 The death of Daniel Fuchs on July 26, 1993, received little attention in the 
press. Fuchs himself was partially responsible for maintaining his position on 
the periphery of literary reputation. Approached by a young admirer, he 
remained shy about providing information about himself, suggesting that his 
life and work did not merit the fuss and attention. When, belatedly, his work 
began to receive some notice from the scholarly community, he was privately 
pleased, but he still tried to keep his distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuchs was a writer's writer. John Updike recommended him for the National 
Academy of Arts and Letters and wrote an afterword to the paperback edition of 
his 1971 novel, "West of the Rockies." Mordecai Richler wrote in the New York 
Times Book Review: "Whenever Jewish writers of my generation come together to 
celebrate those books that really mattered to us when we were young, the novels 
that shaped us . . . somebody will unfailingly ask, 'Do you remember the 
Williamsburg Trilogy?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The three novels on which Fuchs' reputation primarily rests, "Summer in 
Williamsburg" (1934), "Homage to Blenholt" (1936), and "Low Company" (1937), 
were initially received with a lethal combination of fine reviews and poor 
sales. The experience soured him, and he left for Hollywood in 1937. RKO had 
bought his short story, "Crazy Over Pigeons," which was eventually made into 
"The Day the Bookies Wept," starring Joe Penner. Fuchs stayed on in Hollywood 
to become a successful screenwriter, writing the cult classic "Criss Cross," 
"Panic in the Streets," and "Hollow Triumph" and winning an Academy Award for 
the original story of "Love Me or Leave Me" in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Fuchs published numerous short stories, many in The New Yorker and 
The Saturday Evening Post, as well as essays and reminiscences. The best of 
these were collected in "The Apathetic Bookie Joint" (1979), which also 
includes a masterful novella, "Triplicate," Fuchs' most openly autobiographical 
work and one of the most evocative stories ever written about Hollywood. He 
also wrote a Hollywood novel, "West of the Rockies" (1971). 
</P>
<P>
 The forsaking of art for commerce was in part responsible for the poverty of 
Fuchs' reputation. Ironically, Henry Roth, who also came of age in the 1930s 
and who published only one novel, "Call It Sleep" (his second is just being 
released; see Page 1 review), has fared better among critics and intellectuals. 
Fuchs was often amused at being confused with Roth by letter writers who wanted 
to know about his chicken farm. Roth was romanticized by critics as a genius 
suffering from writer's block, an eccentric who exiled himself rather than 
compromise his art. Fuchs, in contrast, opted to make a living rather than 
struggle on as a permanent substitute in the New York City public school system 
while writing at night and during summer breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, he made his choice during a decade when commitment was all, and 
Hollywood was a dirty word. His contemporary, Clifford Odets, might agonize 
over the decision to sell out (and later write "The Big Knife" as an act of 
contrition), but Fuchs admitted no such qualms. In his autobiography, "A Margin 
of Hope," Irving Howe recalls being shamed by a letter from Fuchs, received 
after he had criticized in Commentary Fuchs' move to Hollywood. Fuchs explained 
that he had simply wanted to make his living as a writer, but his fiction had 
not paid the bills. Should he have starved his young family for the sake of 
art? 
</P>
<P>
 Fuchs was bothered by the "Whatever happened to you?" queries. At times he 
protested too much, claiming that he had, after all, kept on writing. But in 
spite of the stories and essays he managed to produce, his film work clearly 
did keep him from the sustained artistry he might have achieved -- that 
potential realized in "Triplicate," which appeared after he had stopped writing 
for the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other Easterners who went West, Fuchs considered writing for film 
difficult, and said so. He never condescended to the movies as others did, but 
respected its craft. Fuchs often wrote of the hard work and the grief that went 
into writing for the movies, the despair at not getting it right, "the 
mountains of failed screenplays on the shelf." He felt that it was the same 
with fiction writing: "You have the same record of misses, the bouts of 
wretchedness, the typed sheets of paper going flat in your hands." The central 
difference was that the studios paid you for unaccepted work, while publishers 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The despair is an attitude bred in the tenements, like the isolation and the 
claustrophobia. In all of Fuchs' novels one feels the oppression, the 
perception of imprisonment in an airless cell. This sense is both physical, 
enforced by the atmosphere, and psychic. Escaping it made the spaciousness of 
California seem positively magical to a young man who longed to breathe freely: 
</P>
<P>
 "The area is still undeveloped, so I am granted the boon of being in a new 
place, fresh and brimming and unawakened, at the beginning. There are masses of 
bougainvillea, Joshua trees and yucca on the hills, a light shining at the 
door, the scent of orange blossoms in the evening air, honeysuckle and jasmine. 
. . . Everything in this new land wonderfully solitary, burning and kind." 
</P>
<P>
 The final irony, as Fuchs himself appreciated, was a merging of the past's 
broken dreams with those of the future. The move from coast to coast finally 
would yield little, and even his capacity for wonder was to dissolve. His story 
"The Golden West" chronicles, in metaphoric terms, the disintegration of the 
studios and the end of dreams of the future. Fuchs' wealthy Californians still 
dream, but they now long only for eternal youth and beauty. Like characters in 
a Chekhov play, they play out the string, talking, hoping, and failing. Yet 
they remain sympathetic: Even the gangsters touch us, for their humanity 
outstrips their deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuchs' three 1930s novels intersect the modernist and social realist schools. 
Unlike the critically esteemed writers of that decade -- John Steinbeck, James 
T. Farrell and John Dos Passos, for example -- he offered no call for revolt, 
nor did he articulate any political or social theories. Not only did he seem 
uncommitted to encouraging the rise of the working class, Fuchs, in fact, 
offered mankind no advice at all; perhaps it is not surprising that his novels 
never really caught on. Rejecting the esprit de corps of the decade, his work 
was marginalized in an era with little patience for individualistic writers of 
somber vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The faint acknowledgment of his Jewishness has also troubled Fuchs' critics 
despite his mastery of the rhythms of the Jewish idiom. Surely his 
characteristic mix of humor and irony, as well the emphasis on his characters' 
conviction of exile and anguish, mark him as Jewish to the core. What has 
puzzled some, however, is the unusual absence of reference to the Jewish faith 
in the work of this child of immigrants. Not only is no interest in religion 
expressed by the sons in these novels (a commonplace in immigrant literature 
where first generation children try to rid themselves of all traces of the Old 
World), but the fathers and mothers likewise make no mention of the old 
rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Fuchs' novels depict a profound and unrelieved spiritual vacuum at 
the heart of existence. Directly reflecting the moral bankruptcy of the modern 
age, his plots are full of gang wars waged by adults and children, murder, 
prostitution, and suicide. Fuchs' fictional universe, like that of many modern 
writers, operates without benefit of God or inherent spiritual value. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving Howe once remarked that writing for Fuchs was as natural as catching a 
fly ball was for Willie Mays. (Fuchs claimed that the compliment made him 
nervous.) In another context Howe termed him a "true writer." Daniel Fuchs was 
indeed a natural; his work reflects experience more "truly" than many writers 
whose reputations eclipse his own. Of all the writers who came of age before 
the 1950s renaissance in Jewish letters, none rendered immigrant life more 
honestly. No other novels of the Depression evoke that decade more forcefully 
and more compassionately, and few novels of any age more vividly evoke the 
hollowness of modern-day America than his masterpiece "Low Company": 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything in Neptune Beach was sand. It was misery. No matter how hard the 
street cleaners worked, shoveling the sand in mounds along the gutters, more 
blew in from the beach. On a rainy day you walked in black gritty mud. Nothing 
was solid, neither the pavements nor the foundations of the buildings. As the 
sands gave, the sidewalks broke and the houses on their pole foundations never 
stopped settling . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Also, few American novelists can look so clinically at their characters to see 
them for what they are and yet have the largeness of spirit to embrace and 
celebrate their humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time that even those who praise the Williamsburg novels stop referring 
to them as "minor classics." And it is about time that Daniel Fuchs received 
the homage he has always deserved.

MERCY OF A RUDE STREAM: A STAR SHINES OVER MT. MORRIS PARK, BY HENRY ROTH (ST.

 'Literary history and the present are dark with silences," Tillie Olsen wrote 
in her remarkable book on writers who ceased to write. "These are not natural 
silences, that necessary time for renewal, lying fallow, gestation, in the 
natural cycle of creation. The silences I speak of here are unnatural; the 
unnatural thwarting of what struggles to come into being, but cannot." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is mentioned only once in Olsen's "Silences," and in a footnote at 
that, Henry Roth's literary muteness has been formidable, as monumental in its 
own way as the reputation of his first novel, the legendary "Call It Sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally published in 1934, that autobiographical look at a painful coming 
of age among the tenements of New York's Lower East Side did not come into its 
own until 1964. In an often-recounted bit of publishing lore, its mass-market 
edition became the first paperback to be reviewed on the front page of the New 
York Times Book Review, and it went on to sell 1.2 million copies in 33 
printings. 
</P>
<P>
 Extraordinary in its treatment of childhood and the family, the immigrant 
experience in general and the Jewish-American situation in particular, the 
intensity of "Call It Sleep's" emotional impact, how close it gets to the 
rawness of truth, outwits all superlatives. To read Roth's densely written, 
poetic account of the childhood of David Schearl is to wonder how he dredged 
this kind of intimate material out of himself -- and to hunger for more. 
</P>
<P>
 For 60 years, however, there was no more. For though Roth was well-reviewed by 
the mainstream press, he was disheartened by attacks on his book by doctrinaire 
publications allied with the Communist Party he passionately believed in. 
</P>
<P>
 When left-wing voices like the Daily Worker and the New Masses complained that 
he had betrayed his proletarian experience by using it "as material for 
introspective and febrile novels" instead of a clarion call for mass action, 
Roth tried to atone with a book about a Midwestern union man. He was unable to 
finish it, and gradually retreated from writing. He moved to New England and 
took a series of impermanent jobs, including serving as an orderly in a mental 
institution and working as a waterfowl farmer, and entered into a literary 
silence so nearly complete many readers thought him dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 60 years after "Call It Sleep's" publication, comes "Mercy of a Rude 
Stream," subtitled "A Star Shines Over Mt. Morris Park," the first of a 
projected six-volume series of novels that Roth, age 87 and now living in New 
Mexico, has been working on since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Though one inevitably approaches this kind of literary second childhood with a 
certain amount of trepidation, the news is remarkably good. For what Roth has 
produced here is not only an evocative continuation of his autobiographical 
story but also a meditation on that enormous and profoundly troubling "literary 
desolation" (his own phrase) that turns out to have been as great a trauma to 
Roth as his agonizing childhood years. 
</P>
<P>
 A continuation of "Call It Sleep," yes, but a carbon copy, no. More has been 
changed here than just the name of the novel's protagonist, now called Ira 
Stigman. The pace and tone are more leisurely and episodic, as much memoir as 
novel, befitting the author's venerable age. And, most radical of all, a second 
voice has been added, nominally the aged Ira's but sounding very much like 
Roth, the voice of an old writer sharing thoughts with a word processor he 
calls Ecclesias. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrative line picks up in 1914 almost exactly where the first novel left 
off, with a pair of momentous events in 8-year-old Ira's life. First, his 
maternal grandparents and four of his mother's brothers and sisters arrive in 
New York from the old country. And more importantly, changing his world as 
completely as only a child's world can change, the Stigman family moves way 
uptown from the familiar, largely Jewish Lower East Side to the more 
affordable, more Gentile precincts of Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mercy" follows Ira and his family for six tumultuous years. Once again we 
meet the boy's mismatched parents, the sad, uncertain, oversized mother who 
above all else "craved a window to lean out of and contemplate the changing 
scene below," and his bitter, rail-thin father, a doomed entrepreneur, 
"unstable and violent," who ferociously blamed everyone but himself for "his 
malign fate." 
</P>
<P>
 There are new characters as well, like the charismatic Uncle Moe, a head 
waiter whose service overseas in World War I causes all manner of family 
crises, as well as childhood friends (invariably non-Jewish), a job in the 
elegant gourmet precincts of Park and Tilford that opens up a side of New York 
Ira has never seen, and the boy's continuing struggle with his hostile 
environment as well as his own uncertain sexuality. But the pull of this book 
is not so much any specific events or a straight narrative line but the way 
Roth tells the tale, his ability to pull us back emotionally into a world that 
is no more. 
</P>
<P>
 The last voice still active of that great New York first generation that 
included Anzia Yezierska, Abraham Cahan, Sholem Asch and non-immigrants like 
"Jews Without Money's" Michael Gold and the Williamsburg trilogy's Daniel 
Fuchs, Roth's specificity of memory about a city and a culture that have 
disappeared is remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 Though contemporary novelists such as Oscar Hijuelos ("Our House in the Last 
World," "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"), Cristina Garcia ("Dreaming In 
Cuban") and Amy Tan ("The Joy Luck Club") have continued and expanded what has 
become a tradition of immigrant literature, the particular culture Roth 
celebrates ended abruptly with World War II. Yet whether describing what his 
mother saw out of that front window or the commotion the family made when Uncle 
Moe finally came home from the war, Roth's powers of observation and recall 
make it all come completely alive. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just the understandably indelible scenes of sexual embarrassment and 
difficulty that Roth remembers so well, but smaller, less consequential 
moments, like his mother's furious reaction to a bruised knee or the acid 
grudges he still bears ("to this very day") against some of his early teachers. 
To understand Henry Roth is to understand that to him no moment, no matter how 
brief, can ever safely be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time memory for this writer is, in several senses, a burden as 
much as a gift, for Roth is troubled by a great deal of what he remembers. His 
family's move to Gentile Harlem, he announces almost at once, "altered his 
entire life for the worse." It precipitated a defensive alienation from the 
Judaism that had been so prominent in his life, a removal from tradition and 
roots he in part blames for those years of creative bleakness. And Roth, 
feeling responsible for the stories he never told, is guilty about that silence 
as well, considering it a squandering of life experience now so distant that he 
can't help bemoaning the fact that "every precious memory now is tarnished." 
</P>
<P>
 That heartfelt rumination on what might have been is one of several from the 
dialogues with Ecclesias sections of "Mercy of a Rude Stream." Roth seems to 
have needed these quasi-journal sections as a way to ease himself back into the 
novel form; they have the characteristic feel of a testing of the waters, the 
safest way to reconnect the urge to write with the primary source material that 
has always been his life. 
</P>
<P>
 When he allows himself to be more personal, talking for instance about M (for 
Muriel), his beloved wife of many years, his thoughts can't help but be 
touching. And when he is disturbed about the difficulty of going back over 
material that once was fresher, when he tells himself to "salvage whatever you 
can, threadbare mementos glimmering in recollection" or refers sadly to "the 
lost richness . . . the Joycean, sordid richness," Roth's frisson of regret 
provides a poignant gloss on one of the most moving and unusual of American 
fiction careers, a career that this book shows is thankfully far from over.

 I am a five-years-sober member of Alcoholics Anonymous who applauds Colman 
Andrews' "Getting Drunk" (Jan. 2). How typically American it is to go overboard 
with the drinking-is-bad-for-everyone mentality.I don't drink because I have a 
problem with alcohol. But why lay a guilt trip on those without such an 
affliction?

 Thanks for that excellent essay defending our God-given right to drink

 That was the most well-written piece of denial, resistance, excuse-making and 
absurdity that I have ever read. By Andrews' own account, he drinks 
alcoholically but defines it as social drinking -- the everybody-does-it 
rationale. 
</P>
<P>
 As a therapist specializing in substance abuse and recovery, I'm sad that 
alcoholics in denial will show this article to their friends and families as 
"proof" that they are only social drinkers. But I also know that alcoholics in 
recovery will look past Andrews' rationalizations to the truth -- a truth I 
hope Andrews faces before it costs him his work, his health and his family.

 I tried to cut down. I periodically went on the wagon, once for two years. 
When I resumed, having proven to myself that I couldn't possibly be an

 Publishing Andrews' article is indefensible. He should be sentenced to working 
400 hours of community services at a rehabilitation hospital with people whose 
bodies and/or minds have been maimed by drunk drivers. Better yet, he should 
work in a hospital, handling the job of telling people that their loved ones 
didn't survive alcohol-related accidents.

 Drunkenness is associated with more criminal activity than any other type of 
drug abuse. I know, because I'm a police officer and have to deal with drunks 
daily. Most wife-beaters are drunk. Most drivers who cause fatal traffic 
collisions are drunk. Most fights are perpetrated by drunks. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day Andrews' story appeared, I had to search for a missing 13-year-old 
girl who'd bailed out of a car being driven by a drunk adult friend. She 
preferred seeking a ride in a neighborhood infested by a large dangerous gang 
to risking her life in an automobile operated by a woman who could hardly walk.

 Presenting a 360-degree view of society is admirable, even necessary. But 
there must be an admittedly ill-defined point at which a sober decision must be 
made. Will you next run an article by Mario Andretti extolling the virtues of a 
daily 120-m.p.h. drive? Cleanses the soul, he might say.

another couple, Tom and Gerri, for a garden cookout. They eat perfect steaks, 
drink Daiquiris and engage in a little cross-marital flirtation and a good deal 
of cross-marital fantasizing. At some point Wylie goes back into the house and 
out the front door, hot-wires a neighbor's beat-up Ford Galaxie, drives across 
America and never comes back. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been an Updike setting, with its sexy suburban folkways and its 
intermittent creaks of metaphysical Angst and insight. Wylie's fugue, we may 
think, will be another Rabbit's. But Stephen Wright, the author of "Going 
Native," is at least one generation this side of Updike. His literary-moral 
compass points are not Tillich, Camus and Melville but Thomas Pynchon, the Fox 
Network and the increasingly surreal quality of the day's headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 This month's billy-club assault on figure-skater Nancy Kerrigan could almost 
have been one of the book's episodes. Like any seriously gifted writing, "Going 
Native" is partly prophecy. When Wylie reports seeing a dead stick-up man at 
the store where he'd gone to get charcoal, Gerri exclaims that she's sick and 
tired of hearing and reading about dead people: "They're on television every 
hour, in the papers every morning, and bleeding all over me in every magazine. 
Today you'd think that was all life was about, dead people." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's novel is, in a way, a book of the dead or, more nearly, a book of 
characters who seem to be all life and flesh and turn out to be ghosts. We 
assume at the start, for example, that we will hear more about Rho, who is no 
mere suburban wife cliche, but a spiky, fierce figure with touching passions 
and confusions. Yet once Wylie is out the door, we never do. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the following six episodes, taking place successively at the house of 
the Galaxie-owning neighbor, on a highway in the Midwest and in various 
settings stretching across the country to Los Angeles, musters its own cast of 
characters, some vivid and others more shadowy. There is no connection among 
them, which would not be remarkable if we had a protagonist in flight to do the 
connecting; a rabbit, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Wylie is no rabbit; he is the Road Runner, with the fugitive, polymorphous, 
infinitely bendable form of the cartoon. His initial name -- he keeps changing 
it -- dangles a clue and sometimes he picks up its allusion to the Road 
Runner's antagonist by calling himself Lee Coyote. The Tom and Gerri of the 
cookout are of course another cartoon reference. One mark of Wright's adeptness 
is that we are not immediately conscious of this; his American gardens are so 
real that only very gradually is it evident that they have turned their tigers 
into line drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 Two things give "Going Native" remarkable distinction in the crowded fictional 
field of post-modern American nightmare. One is the caliber of the writing. 
Several of the episodes are so well-told that we would happily settle for them 
as short stories, quite apart from the design that links them. As for the 
design, it becomes evident in the fact that each episode is written as a 
different genre. If the first is neo-Updike, another is noir suspense; still 
another is a surreal dream depiction of a pornography session in the style of 
Robert Coover; a fourth is a richly detailed account of a Hollywood couple 
starting out as tourists in the Borneo jungles and ending up in a savagely 
ironic heart of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 This disconnection of styles as well as stories points, once more, to the 
nature of the figure who moves through them all. We notice immediately how 
peripherally he usually appears. The second episode tells of a two-day crack 
binge at the house of Wylie's neighbor, owner of a CD store. He had bought the 
store with the proceeds of an insurance settlement after his baby son was 
killed by another neighbor's dog. ("Every customer who left the store with a CD 
in his or her hand was carrying a little piece of Benny.") Wylie is present 
only as the empty space in the driveway where the Galaxie is usually parked. 
</P>
<P>
 In an episode about a murderous hitchhiker with a knife and a knapsack full of 
college texts, Wylie turns up in his Galaxie as one of the hitchhiker's rides. 
He is trying on roles. He announces that he is a professional criminal who has 
been released early from prison despite a murder conviction, but he doesn't 
have the lingo right. "I was renowned for my good behavior," he tells his 
dumbfounded companion who, out-weirded, gets out as soon as he can. 
</P>
<P>
 Humor is one of Wright's many gifts. His darkness has its lights, even if they 
mostly serve to make sure we see how dark it is. There is a wonderfully woeful 
episode about a Colorado motel-keeper who hopes to make his fortune with a 
screen-play about a space-invader. He is continually distracted -- by peculiar 
guests, a wife who conducts her infidelities in one of the motel rooms, and 
several kooky daughters -- and struggles to wrestle "fragments of screenplay 
from the coils of motel management." Again, Wylie appears at the end; this time 
as adeparting guest who gives an eloping daughter a ride with her punk lover. 
He has become more forceful; he manages to steal the girl from the punk. 
</P>
<P>
 Later he will turn up as the murderer he had earlier pretended to be. But it 
is always at the end, as a kind of freak accident, with no apparent relation to 
the stories themselves. The most lavishly developed of these is a pastiche on 
Americans abroad. Amanda and Drake, a partway successful Hollywood actress and 
producer, respectively, go on a guided trek to a remote Borneo village 
inhabited by a tribe that once hunted heads. For them -- unlike Hollywood -- 
head-hunting was a matter of spiritual not commercial enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, there is no abroad anymore. The headman ceremoniously offers a gourd 
with a dark liquid in it. What is it? Drake asks. "Coca-Cola," the headman 
replies. He asks if they know Jack Nicholson, who had visited several years 
earlier and delighted the villagers by dancing for them. "We share the same 
makeup person," Amanda volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not all satire. Wright splendidly evokes the dark oppressiveness of 
the jungle as the visitors are poled along a stream under a dense overhang of 
trees "sealing the world into one long wound tunnel through which drifted this 
odd little boat, its odder passengers, like a dead stick dropped by accident 
and flowing the wrong way up an undulating carpet of pollen and leaves and 
broken twigs where dragonflies cavorted in metals of acid green and blue." 
There is a well-managed sense of nemesis; we are not sure what will happen. The 
nemesis arrives back in Santa Monica when Wylie, now a Charles Manson-like 
figure, breaks in as Amanda and Drake are regaling friends with an account of 
their trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Wylie, as polymorphous and impalpable as the eponymous cartoon, is Wright's 
picaresque protagonist for our near-21st Century. His adventures are no more 
than channel-surfing. The episodes in "Going Native" -- nicely turned out in a 
Brillo Box cover -- have no more linkage than the buttons on a TV remote 
control. Wylie lives modern life as spectator; he switches channels by running 
off, at first, and later by pulling a trigger. Although he sometimes postures 
and over-writes, Wright has produced a witty, prodigal and desolate novel of 
virtual reality.

THREE ON THE TOWN: DECIBEL DIPLOMACY; APARTMENT DWELLERS MUST STRIKE A BALANCE 
BETWEEN THE NEIGHBORS' NOISE AND THEIR OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Gold 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My next-door neighbors have extremely good taste in music: lots of Nat King 
Cole, old soul guys like Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye, cocktail jazz, Capitol-era 
Frank Sinatra, the Traveling Wilburys. It's not my sort of stuff, particularly 
-- though I like it when they play their Milt Jackson vibraphone records -- but 
it's kind of user-friendly, fairly boomer-cool. 
</P>
<P>
 When you live in an apartment building, you pretty much have to adapt yourself 
to your neighbors' idea of righteous tunage. Sometimes it's even nicer to 
listen to the bits of Metropolitan Opera broadcasts that filter down from an 
upstairs apartment on Saturday mornings than it is to tune in "Turandot" 
yourself -- less responsibility that way, also some vague idea about community. 
In some buildings in Los Angeles, where few neighbors share a language, thin 
walls and overheard Cypress Hill records are all that any two tenants share in 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes in the morning, when the guy next door, probably on the outside 
of a good cup of joe, flips on a CD and "My Way" or something whines through 
the walls . . . bam . . . I grumble out of bed into a chair in the next room, 
where I sulk for hours. A person's right to blast the Gipsy Kings ends where my 
ears begin. There is music, and there is space, and there are times one wants 
to be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 My own record collection includes shelf after shelf of gangsta rap, death 
metal, Japanese noise music, techno, Italian opera and every record Bikini Kill 
ever made. My stereo speakers are heavy enough -- and bad enough -- to have 
survived two burglary attempts. I try to keep the music down, but I am, no 
doubt, an annoying guy to live next to. I have deep-house compilations that 
dentists could use to anesthetize their patients. I have at least half-a-dozen 
records by Don Ho. I have seen the pained look on the faces of the people who 
live in another apartment adjoining mine when they halfheartedly assure me that 
I haven't been playing my stereo too loud. I know how they feel. In the last 
place I lived, my downstairs neighbors' 4-year-old had only one record of her 
own -- " Vamos a la Playa ," I think it was -- and she played it several times 
a day. I have heard stories about clogs on hardwood floors, and late-night 
moans, and nightmarish hacking coughs. I have been the sullen teen-ager in the 
rock band that practices right down the street from where you live. 
</P>
<P>
 This is as close to a universal formula for big-city tolerance as exists: I 
can hear them, but I believe that there's a magical barrier where they can't 
hear me. Thank goodness it's only music that makes it through the walls here. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, my dad used to lug his speakers toward his bedroom window 
and blast Mahler across the driveway when the music from next door got to be 
too much. I'm sure Mahler seemed like a good idea at the time -- it was more or 
less the noisiest music he could stand to listen to himself -- but in 
retrospect, I doubt that our neighbors could even hear the "Resurrection 
Symphony" over the Skynrd and Marshall Tucker Band records they always seemed 
to have cranked. And I'm sure my father never realized the effect that my 
French-horn practicing must have had on the neighbors, because it was bad 
enough and loud enough to make even Southern boogie rock sound refreshing in 
comparison. He would have been pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 But I know now that if I were to huff a speaker over to the wall that 
separates me and the guys who blast the dread Gipsy Kings, then lean 200 watts 
into the latest grand opus of Pestilence or Napalm Death, I would be nothing 
but a giant bully, and they would be the ones with a valid grievance. The 
situation can be compared to the U.S. military presence in Somalia: There is an 
enormous arsenal on reserve but really no reasonable way to project it without 
being perceived as the biggest jerk in the world. When it comes to pushing a 
volume knob, we can all get along.

COVER STORY: CBS SPIES A REUNION; CULP AND COSBY PAIR UP AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Culp may grimace at the mention of "Sammy, the Way Out Seal," but a 
smile comes to his face when he talks about "I Spy." 
</P>
<P>
 Culp, along with a very young Billy Mumy and a slippery seal, was a star of 
the Walt Disney-produced comedy "Sammy," which aired more than 30 years ago on 
Uncle Walt's NBC series "The Wonderful World of Color." A lot of baby boomers 
probably got their first glimpse of the actor in "Sammy." But Culp, now 63, 
doesn't see it as his finest hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting in 1958, I had a growing family," the actor explains, relaxing in 
the living room of his agent's spacious Beverly Hills home. "That family was 
four children in 10 years. When you have a growing family ... you don't really 
argue a whole lot. You take what (jobs) you get." 
</P>
<P>
 Culp's best known for his role as secret agent Kelly Robinson on "I Spy." The 
Emmy Award-winning series, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1968, was the first 
regular dramatic show on American TV to feature a black (Bill Cosby) in a 
starring role. "Everybody's forgotten that," Culp says. "It was a long time 
ago. After all, it was 29 years ago that we started the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Culp and Cosby, who won three Emmys for his work on the original lighthearted 
action-espionage series, have reunited for "I Spy Returns," which was shot last 
summer in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '60s series, Robinson was a former Princeton law student who played 
tennis on two Davis Cup teams. Working for the government, his guise was that 
of a top-seeded tennis player traveling the world to play tournaments. Cosby's 
spy Alexander Scott masqueraded as his trainer and traveling companion. He also 
was a graduate of Temple University and a Rhodes scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 In the reunion movie, Scott has long retired from the spy business, but his 
daughter (Salli Richardson) is following in her father's footsteps. She's been 
recruited for intelligence work by Robinson. Scott follows his daughter to 
Vienna after he learns Robinson has teamed her with his son (George Newbern), 
also a novice in the spy business. 
</P>
<P>
 Culp and Cosby have been wanting to do to an "I Spy" movie for years. They 
tried to get one made as a feature film and, when that deal fell apart, as a 
syndicated TV movie. "While it was sitting in limbo," Culp says, "(CBS 
President) Jeff Sagansky heard about it. He latched onto this like a bulldog. 
He said, 'I want to do it. We will have it at CBS.' It's been a long, tortuous 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Before filming began, Culp and Cosby reminisced about old times over dinner in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk all the time on the phone, but I hadn't seen him in a couple of 
years. We dined in this restaurant where all the really rich people in New York 
go to have din-din. I was watching them and I realized they were watching us. 
We caused quite a stir. We cause quite a stir wherever we go now. People who 
remember -- or they think they remember what something was -- have a very 
strong response to 'I Spy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, Culp recalls, he heard that some NBC affiliates refused to 
air "I Spy" because of Cosby. "Bill and I lived a very strange, insular life," 
Culp says. "We worked 'above it all.' If there was hate mail, we never saw it. 
It was filtered out before it got to us. If there were problems with the 
network, they were filtered out. If there were problems with regard to any part 
of the production, most of it, except the really personal stuff, was kept away 
from us. We just skated along doing one-third of all the shows overseas, which 
no one had ever tried to do before and has never been done since." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he says, no other actors could have played Robinson and Scott. "No other 
black man and no other white man would have made it work," Culp says. "We just 
got lucky. We met and decided that we liked each other at first sight. 
Everything else for me and Bill took second position to that. Both of us had 
total trust in each other. It was like Burns and Allen." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides directing several episodes of the series, Culp also wrote seven, 
including the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been a serious, dedicated writer since I was 17," says Culp, who 
directed the 1972 feature "Hickey & Boggs." 
</P>
<P>
 "The writing has sustained me, changed my life, changed my career, all the way 
through the years. By the time I got to New York, I had this sudden spate of 
luck (as an actor) and then nothing. The writing sustained me. I became a 
successful actor almost by mistake. It was something I shouldn't have done. I 
am a much better writer than I am an actor. And I am a better director than a 
writer." 
</P>
<P>
 "I Spy Returns" airs Thursday at 8 p.m. on CBS; repeats of "I Spy" air 
weekdays at 10 on KDOC.

ONE FOURTH-GRADER'S RECOMMENDED READING; TRUE STORIES, AND EARTHQUAKES TOO; I 
AM LAVINA CUMMING, BY SUSAN LOWELL (MILKWEED EDITIONS: $14.95 CLOTH, $6.95 
PAPER; 198 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Anna Kaufman, Anna Kaufman is a fourth-grader in Middleburg, Vt. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When writer Susan Lowell was a child, her grandmother, Lavina Cumming, used to 
tell her stories about her own childhood. Lowell's book, "I Am Lavina Cumming," 
is based on those stories. 
</P>
<P>
 It tells the tale of a young girl who goes from a house full of men to a house 
full of women. After her mother dies, Lavina is sent from the family ranch in 
Arizona Territory to her aunt's house in Santa Cruz, Calif., because her father 
thinks she can't become a young lady without a woman around. The book follows 
Lavina's adventures and the tough decisions she has to make as she gets ready 
to ride the long road to womanhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Lavina's most exciting adventures are also extra fun to read or listen 
to because we know they really happened. One of my favorites concerns the great 
San Francisco earthquake. Lavina is shaken from a sound sleep when a huge stone 
crashes through her window and the big red brick chimney collapses onto the 
roof of her small attic room. Pieces of plaster and bits of brick begin raining 
down on her! 
</P>
<P>
 This is all very excitingly and poetically described. So are the more personal 
parts of the story, one of which changes Lavina's life forever. It's the end of 
the school year, which means composition time. Lavina decides to write about 
the Cumming family motto, "Courage." After school that day, Lavina's teacher 
tells her that she is an exceptionally talented writer, and that she might 
consider skipping a grade. This helps Lavina make one of the most important 
choices a person has to make in a lifetime: She decides that she wants to 
become a school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that it's fun when you can learn history and read a good story at the 
same time. That's why I especially like this book. If you like history and 
reading, I'm sure you'll like "I Am Lavina Cumming," by Susan Lowell.

THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN SPY RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EPSTEIN, Robert Epstein is former executive arts editor of Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's OK if Sheldon Leonard digresses. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 86 the television actor-writer-director-producer is allowed a few 
digressions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I digress like crazy," he says, the trademark Runyonesque intonations booming 
in his voice. "Give me a feed line and I'll give you 30 minutes of extraneous 
material." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard's digressions are an oral history of television, a fast-forward trip 
from the "golden age" to the tarnished '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time Leonard had four prime-time shows in the Top 10. He has won five 
Emmys and 18 Emmy nominations. All of the 17 sitcom pilots he directed made it 
to the little screen. Among the long-running series he directed or 
executive-produced were "The Danny Thomas Show," "Lassie," "The Dick Van Dyke 
Show, "Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C." and "The Andy Griffith Show." He's back Thursday 
as executive producer of the CBS movie "I Spy Returns." 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the '60s I had several successful television shows on CBS, so NBC 
wanted me with them, so they came to me with, in effect, a blank check," the 
former actor with a trademark bad-guy look recalls. "They said, 'What do you 
want to do? We'll let you do it and then we'll put it on the air. No pilot. 
Just do it.' What I wanted to do was to escape the restrictions of television 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was influenced by Jack Webb. Close-up, close-up, close-up. Small 
sets, small pictures. I wanted to put air in my pictures, shoot for television 
the way movies were made and on real locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we went to Hong Kong, and the equipment there was so bad it almost 
bankrupted me. A young USC film school graduate, Fouad Said, told me he could 
help me out. He did a sales job on me that was without parallel. I said OK and 
he then designed and modified a Ford Econoline panel truck that was small 
enough to be loaded on a Flying Tigers cargo airplane and be deposited anywhere 
in the world carrying all the latest American equipment we needed, including 
cameras and generators. It freed us to move wherever we wanted, and Said went 
on to form his own company, Cinemobile." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls how the network supported the then-controversial hiring of Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted an attractive, athletic man with a sense of humor, and here I saw 
this guy on a Jack Paar special. I was just looking for someone with a sense of 
humor and a certain personality, somewhat charismatic too, if I was lucky. And 
there he was, Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only condition NBC gave me with that blank check was that Bob Kintner, 
then head of the network, had to approve our stars. Most of the network's 
affiliated stations considered a black lead very risky, saying anyone south of 
Baltimore was going to turn us off because we had a black man and a white man 
traveling together, rooming together, eating together. 
</P>
<P>
 "My talk with Kintner went something like this: He said, 'How you doing with 
the casting, Sheldon?' 'Well,' I said, 'I hear you like Bob Culp.' He said, 
'Culp's fine.' 'Well,' I said, 'I saw the other guy I want.' He said, 'What do 
you mean you want?' I said, 'He's black,' and Kintner said, 'What difference 
does that make?' I said, 'Kintner, it makes no difference whatsoever.' 
</P>
<P>
 Since "I Spy," Leonard and Cosby have remained close. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Cosby is family. He practically considers my wife and me his mother and 
father. Recently, I berated him for making crap like the movie features 
"Leonard Six" and "Ghost Father." I told him with the exception of his own 'The 
Bill Cosby Show,' the best acting he ever did was in 'I Spy.' Then out of the 
blue his manager, Norm Brokaw, called and asked me if I had said that to Bill. 
I said, 'Yes,' and he said, 'Well, he wants to do it again -- make "I Spy".' So 
Brokaw made an appointment with CBS for me to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Would he make another? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at this time being badgered and bombarded with suggestions that we do a 
sequel, if not a theatrical feature, with the two men. Or a series, spinning 
off the younger actors," Leonard says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to take on projects like this with a carefree attitude. I'm getting 
pretty old and creepy for all this. But if I do it again there will be one 
non-negotiable consideration. I will pick the cast, writers, director, not any 
network. Today, networks dictate. I don't want anybody denying me my freedom of 
choice; for example, telling me someone is too old to work.

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; TAKING IT TO THE SUITES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few years ago, Dr. Michael Oppenheim got a frantic 2 a.m. call from a 
beachside hotel. Food poisoning? High fever? No, a tipsy woman had asked a 
waiter to light her cigarette -- and her acrylic nails had burst into flame. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a typical incident in the casebook of a traveling hotel doc. One of the 
few in town, Oppenheim gets referrals from about 100 L.A.-area inns -- among 
them the Century Plaza and the Beverly Hilton. He's on 24-hour alert, making 
about 1,000 suite-calls a year and giving free phone advice to another 
thousand. He charges a flat $100 for patients within eight miles of his West 
L.A. home (more if they're farther afield).

 In his 10 years as a roving physician, he's seen some heart attacks and lots 
of flu, earaches and upset stomachs. "I like vomiting," he admits, "because I 
can help. It doesn't last long anyway, and they always give me credit for 
stopping it."

 Oppenheim's part-time practice leaves him plenty of time for his other 
occupation -- medical writer. He regularly contributes to Cosmopolitan, Redbook 
and Reader's Digest. He's also written five books, including "The Male Medical 
Guide" and the upcoming "100 Drugs That Work."

<P>
 He won't reveal their complaints, but Oppenheim has treated such patients as 
Leonard Bernstein, Rod Stewart and the King of Tonga. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his clients are visiting L.A. from other countries, with a common 
diagnosis of their own. "They always think the air conditioner has made them 
sick," he says. "So it's always 100 degrees in their rooms." Michele Kort

 STEVE JOBS AND THE NEXT BIG THING by Randall E. Stross (Atheneum: $24; 374 
pp.). The mission statement of NeXT Inc. -- formulated, tellingly, years after 
its founding in 1985 -- commenced with the goal of building "computers that 
change the world and that our friends can afford to buy."Mission 
unaccomplished, for now -- and indeed forever, as early last year NeXT founder 
Steve Jobs decided to axe the company's manufacturing business in order to 
concentrate on software. Jobs, half of Apple Computer's famed 
two-geeks-in-a-garage, said at the time that NeXT was simply positioning itself 
to join the first-tier software companies like Microsoft, and readers who 
encounter this assertion in the introduction to "Steve Jobs and the NeXT Big 
Thing" might well believe it. They won't, however, by the time they finish the 
book, for Randall Stross' detailed portrait of Jobs and NeXT is unrelievedly 
negative. Stross, a historian by training, is a meticulous reporter and 
researcher, and there's no denying his depiction of Jobs as an arrogant, 
seductive, bullying, perfectionistic and single-minded salesman who seems 
almost incapable of learning from his mistakes. Stross makes his points well, 
but this book has one major drawback -- the author's inability to give Jobs 
credit for anything. There's no question that the NeXT computer was a flop, yet 
Jobs was probably right to call the machine ahead of its time -- in its 
magneto-optical drive, emphasis on audio, reliance on object-oriented 
programming -- and for such vision he deserves at least some praise.

 POSITIVE LIVES: RESPONSES TO HIV: A Photodocumentary edited by Stephen Mayes 
and Lyundall Stein, forward by Edmund White. (Cassell AIDS Awareness Series: 
$29.95, 144 pp.) Pictures may not be "worth" words, but they can certainly 
augment and enrich a text. In this gripping and unflinching book, sponsored by 
the Terrence Higgins Trust, 13 chapters by as many authors provide a broad 
glimpse into the varied worlds of people with AIDS. Invited by vivid 
black-and-white and color photographs, we gain access to the perspectives and 
contexts of parents, lovers, health care providers, friends -- all defiantly, 
vibrantly alive, even in the face of fear and suffering. The images are 
memorable both in their beauty and in their underpinnings of sadness, but 
nothing in "Positive Lives" cracks a reader's heart more deeply than Edmund 
White's wise and elegant introduction. In a gentle, elegiac tribute to his 
lover, Hubert Sorin, White tells of a gifted young architect who, in response 
to illness, became a cartoonist and created, through inspiring the laughter of 
others, a profoundly healing balm. Michael Dorris

 BEFORE NIGHT FALLS: A Memoir by Reinaldo Arenas, translated by Dolores M. Koch 
(Viking: $23; 316 pp.). Reinaldo Arenas is probably less well-known these days 
for his fiction than his death -- by suicide, in New York City in 1990, before 
complete debilitation by AIDS.The disease is almost totally absent from this 
book, however, for Arenas was too full of life to dwell on such things: "Before 
Night Falls" is a celebration of the author's personal freedom, even during the 
decades he spent in his native Cuba under the Castro regime. Arenas was a 
Castro supporter as a youth, having been given a scholarship, a Marxist 
education and a job by the soon-to-be Maximum Leader, but his homosexuality and 
desire to write soon made him persona non grata. "The Ill-Fated Peregrinations 
of Fray Servando" won a major Cuban cultural award, but was soon banned there, 
and after the novel was published abroad Castro's security agency began keeping 
tabs on Arenas, trying to determine how he smuggled his manuscripts out of the 
country. Eventually Arenas was branded a homosexual counterrevolutionary and 
arrested, spending years in prison before being allowed -- apparently by 
accident -- to emigrate to the United States during the Mariel exodus of 1980. 
"Before Night Falls" is casually graphic about sex -- he describes a number of 
youthful encounters with barnyard animals and many of his estimated 5,000 
homosexual couplings by the age of 25 -- yet rarely prurient, perhaps because 
Arenas' promiscuity was fueled by what he calls "a kind of erotic rage." What's 
most memorable in this memoir, though, is the sense of Arenas writing away -- 
often rewriting away, as many of his manuscripts were confiscated and had to be 
re-created from scratch, sometimes more than once -- in an ultimately 
successful attempt to make himself free.

 WHO STOLE THE NEWS? Why We Can't Keep Up with What Happens in the World and 
What We Can Do About It by Mort Rosenblum (John Wiley: $24.95; 298 pp.). 
There's a good reason that editors, rather than reporters, are responsible for 
thinking up newspaper headlines -- because reporters aren't very good, by and 
large, at summing up their own work. Case in point: this book, the title of 
which is so inappropriate it could have come only from the author's typewriter. 
Mort Rosenblum, a special correspondent for the Associated Press and former 
editor of the International Herald Tribune, is intent on showing that 
international affairs are under-covered, and mis-covered, by the U.S. media, 
but "Who Stole the News?" is more a grab-bag than an argument -- and certainly 
doesn't live up to its conspiracy-implying title. Rosenblum is right to point 
out that newspaper executives in this country underestimate the value and 
importance of foreign affairs coverage -- it's revealing that two Tokyo 
newspapers have twice as many foreign correspondents as the New York Times, 
that the Gannett chain has no overseas bureaus -- and to note that the U.S. 
government and modern network television, between them, have turned U.S. action 
abroad into controlled photo ops. At the same time, however, good foreign 
coverage is available to those who actively seek it out, and numerous 
enterprising journalists do manage to sidestep bureaucratic spin-control. 
Rosenblum undercuts his thesis by citing many instances of the latter -- in 
Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia and elsewhere -- and those sections of the book prove its 
most effective.Rosenblum is particularly troubled by the civil war in the 
former Yugoslavia, which he believes might have been moderated, and possibly 
averted altogether, had the press covered the brewing mess in its formative 
stages, yet in many ways his analysis seems a product of 20/20 hindsight. Sure, 
the press was wrong to take an artificially "balanced" view of the 
Serb-Croat-Muslim war once it was clear the Serbs were the aggressors, bent on 
genocide . . . but on the other hand, if Vietnam taught us anything, it is that 
the U.S. should decline all invitations to become the world's policeman.

 THE BOOK OF SODOM by Paul Hallam (Verso: $24.95; 290 pp.). It's poignant in 
this age of AIDS to come across a character who muses, with modern "Sodomites" 
in mind, "this race must be indestructible, if God himself was unable to 
destroy them."The passage -- drawn from Michel Tournier's novel "The Four Wise 
Men" -- is one of 40-odd works cited in "A Sodom Anthology," the 
book-within-a-book that British screenwriter Paul Hallam has compiled in what 
might be called an idiosyncratic gay scrapbook. Hallam, who admits to being 
obsessive, has a burning desire to understand the responses to, if not the 
origins of, his own homosexuality: why, for example, Sodom has for millennia 
been thought of as homosexuality's capital city, when both the Bible and the 
Talmud seem much more concerned with the Sodomites' avarice than their bed 
partners. Hallam has turned up many references to Sodom in literature, in every 
combination of low and high, famous and obscure: Hallam includes excerpts from 
Proust, Milton, Dante and Sade, as well as relevant portions of gay-bashing 
sermons, gay-satirizing plays, gay-baiting criminal trials and the like. 
Hallam's autobiographical essay on his search for Sodom, ironically, is often 
more interesting than the anthology itself, perhaps because the anti-Sodom 
screeds are so thoughtless, composed of little but frothing, bug-eyed fear.

 THE COMMON BUT LESS FREQUENT LOON AND OTHER ESSAYS by Keith Stewart Thomson 
(Yale University Press: $22.50; 192 pp.). Many of the essays in this volume 
first appeared in the journal American Scientist, meaning they are directed 
toward the professional rather than the lay reader.Others, though, are readily 
accessible even to the non-specialist -- especially if you like fish, for Keith 
Thomson, president of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia and the 
former arts and sciences dean at Yale, is a paleoichthyologist (no doubt he 
hates the term). In "The Shape of a Shark's Tail," Thomson shows how 
preconceptions can lead researchers astray, to the point that they forget to 
drop their models and observe nature directly; in "The Puzzle of 
Palaeospondylus ," he describes a youthful trip to northern Scotland to collect 
fossil fish, and how the unresolved scientific battle over the identification 
of one particular species has haunted him to this day. The best essay here, 
though, is the autobiographical "Becoming a Scientist" -- probably because it 
shows how an academic ne'er-do-well, given inspiration and direction, can 
succeed beyond his wildest imaginings.

 Whatever happened to the old-fashioned genteel heel? Dirty Rotten Scoundrels 
(ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) has two of them in Michael Caine and Steve Martin, 
playing competing double-cross artists who respectively represent the debonair 
and the crass at their heights. What they're competing for is heiress Glenne 
Headly's fortune. The 1988 comedy represents an honorable attempt at finding 
farcical fun in the dishonorable, with locations along the French Riviera 
providing diversion enough for anyone unwilling to succumb to the movie's 
amusing enough cons. 
</P>
<P>
 Also released that same year, Working Girl (KTTV Monday at 7:30 p.m.) provided 
Melanie Griffith her stardom and audiences plenty of wish-fulfillment. Griffith 
graduates from overly accented secretary to a genius of an ersatz executive 
while the boss is away. Honesty isn't the movie's strong suit, any more than 
it's hers. But with Griffith in her defining role, and Harrison Ford and 
Sigourney Weaver not afraid to stoop to support parts to shine, you'd almost 
have to be an avowed enemy of the proletariat not to give in. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening up to The Doors (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.), meanwhile, is almost 
unimaginable, even if -- or maybe especially if -- you're a fan of the title 
band. This pretentious rock biopic is full of inadvertent comedy, from the 
scenes where we watch the band magically creating "Light My Fire" to the 
recurring visions where Jim Morrison is forewarned of his doom by the infamous 
naked Indian. Val Kilmer does his best as the usually blitzed, perpetually smug 
singer, but can't save Oliver Stone from making his worst mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Midnight Run (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.) has nothing on its mind other than being 
a wry, cat-and-mouse road movie. Robert De Niro makes an unlikely good guy as 
the slovenly bail-bondsman protagonist, but his weird chemistry with his 
elusive, handcuffed charge, Charles Grodin, adds up to good fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise of The Tender Trap (KTLA Wednesday at 8 p.m.) couldn't be more 
dated: Frank Sinatra is a swingin' single who finds himself "trapped" into 
being tied down to one gal, Debbie Reynolds. Within that hoary and sexist 
context, though, the writing is urbane and snappy, and the performances 
spirited -- so just keep repeating, It's only a period piece . (Get the 
letterboxed laser disc if you can, though. The cropping of the wide-screen 
image for TV cheats you out of a lot of Sinatra's incredibly spacious Manhattan 
bachelor pad.) 
</P>
<P>
 The week winds up with a Dan Aykroyd film festival that probably even Aykroyd 
himself would just as soon miss. The Great Outdoors (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.) 
pairs him with John Candy in one of John Hughes' least-greatest scripts. The 
Blues Brothers (KTLA Saturday at 6 p.m.), with John Belushi, isn't quite as bad 
as its rep, but even director John Landis admits its miscalculation. And the 
charms of the movie parody version of Dragnet (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.), with 
Tom Hanks, pretty much begin and end with the casting; the second half gets 
really torturous.

 THE INTELLECTUALS AND THE MASSES: Pride and Prejudice Among the Literary 
Intelligentsia, 1880-1939 by John Carey (St. Martin's Press: $19.95; 246 pp.). 
In 1905, British poet T.W.H. Crosland published "The Suburbans," a book in 
which he attacked suburban dwellers for being "a low, inferior species," having 
the gall to frequent "idiotic free libraries" and show a "mean, discreditable 
suburban rush" for low-priced classics. Crosland is largely forgotten today, of 
course, but as Oxford professor John Carey points out, his views were not 
unique: they were shared, to one degree or another, by many of his more 
distinguished contemporaries, from D. H. Lawrence to Virginia Woolf, Wyndham 
Lewis to T. S. Eliot, H. G. Wells to W. B. Yeats. Carey isn't exactly fair to 
some of these writers -- he's too hard on E. M. Forster and Aldous Huxley, for 
example -- but he does demonstrate how broadly the intellectual class's fear of 
"the masses" ran. T. S. Eliot suggested that the number of students receiving 
higher education in the U.S. and England be cut by two-thirds; J. B. Priestley 
commented that the crowds gathered for the coronation of George VI in 1937 most 
probably "did not know how to make love or even to eat and drink properly"; 
Lawrence, in 1908, even imagined collecting "the sick, the halt, the maimed" in 
order to gas them in "a lethal chamber as big as the Crystal Palace." Carey 
attributes such anger toward the masses primarily to the intellectuals' fear of 
losing "their" civilization, and viewed from the modern era it's quite amazing 
-- even considering the rigidity of the British class system -- to see the 
depth of their animosity. "The Intellectuals and the Masses" is an engaging 
book, and one finishes it hoping for a volume in which Carey expands his 
analysis, for better or worse, to American literature.

'DAY ONE'S' BATTLE

 In the TV Times' listings for Jan. 21, the movie "Scared to Death" on Channel

 I watched "Birdland" (ABC), a new series that premiered on Jan. 5, on the 
basis of Howard Rosenberg's favorable review of the show (Calendar, Jan. 5). 
Once again, an older actor (Brian Dennehy) is cast with a much younger actress 
to play his girlfriend, who also plays a doctor, so she cannot be in the 
relationship for financial reward. I'm thoroughly disgusted by this ongoing 
discrimination against mature women.

 Singing, dancing, crying, pouting and matchmaking. The moppet of all moppets 
did 'em all. And you can catch a good bit of it on a Family Channel Shirley 
Temple movie marathon as an alternative to Super Bowl Sunday football. 
</P>
<P>
 First up is the 1936 drama Captain January (noon-1:30 p.m. Family Channel), in 
which Shirley plays an orphan being raised by a kind lighthouse keeper (Guy 
Kibbee). A young Buddy Ebsen also stars. A highlight is Shirley and Ebsen 
dancing to the delightful "The Codfish Ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley introduces the classic ditty "Animal Crackers in My Soup" in the 1935 
musical Curly Top (1:30-3 p.m.). She plays -- what else? -- an adorable orphan 
who becomes a matchmaker for her older sister (Rochelle Hudson). John Boles 
also stars. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she plays another parentless-tyke involved in a child-custody battle in 
one of her most popular movies, Bright Eyes (3-5 p.m.). Temple introduced the 
tune "On the Good Ship Lollipop" in the 1934 tear-jerker, which also stars 
James Dunn and Jane Withers. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ford directed her rousing 1937 vehicle Wee Willie Winkie (5-7 p.m.). 
Inspired by a Rudyard Kipling story, the action-adventure finds Shirley and her 
widowed mother coming to live at a British army outpost in India. Victor 
McLaglen and Cesar Romero also star. 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon concludes with Shirley in the lead role of the classic kid's 
story, Heidi (7-9 p.m.). The 1937 film, which also stars Arthur Treacher and 
Jean Hersholt, is one of at least six versions made about the Swiss orphan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Shirley Temple Marathon" begins at noon and runs through 9 p.m. Sunday on 
The Family Channel. For ages 2 and up. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Kaye stars as the vagabond Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen 
(Sunday 10 a.m.-noon) in this 1952 musical biography, which also stars Farley 
Granger and ballet dancer Jeanmaire. The Frank Loesser score includes the 
classics "Inchworm," "Ugly Duckling" and "Thumbelina." For ages 4 and up.  
</P>
<P>
 Film versions of three Shakespearean tragedies airing this week offer quite an 
introduction to the Bard. Laurence Olivier (who also directs) stars as the 
moody Prince of Denmark in the 1948 Hamlet (Sunday 1-3:30 p.m. KCET), which won 
an Academy Award for best picture. Jean Simmons and Peter Cushing co-star. 
Following "Hamlet" is Richard III (3:30-6 p.m. KCET), also directed by and 
starring Olivier. The 1955 film, featuring one of the greatest villains of all 
time, also stars Claire Bloom, Cedric Harwicke and John Gielgud. Following in 
Olivier's footsteps is English actor Kenneth Branagh, who directed and stars in 
1989's Henry V (Saturday 9-11:20 p.m. Disney). Branagh, who plays the ambitious 
28-year-old English king who challenged the might of France at the battle of 
Agincourt in 1415, was nominated for Oscars in directing and acting. Mrs. 
Branagh, aka Emma Thompson, also stars. For ages 11 and up.  
</P>
<P>
 Apollo Mission film footage taken by astronauts highlights For All Mankind 
(Sunday 9-10:20 p.m. Disney), 1989-Oscar winner for best feature documentary. 
Included are the astronauts' comments during their mission to the moon. For 
ages 10 and up.  
</P>
<P>
 The Home Matters (Monday 1:30-2 p.m. Discovery) segment "Doctor's Home 
Remedies" features Sid Kerchheimer, author of "Doctor's Book of Home Remedies I 
and II," who'll talk about doctor-tested (and recommended) home remedies for 
children's ailments, for everything from diarrhea to hiccups. For parents.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven-year-old Nicole (Raven-Symone) is teased by Mark (Mark Curry) and Tyler 
(Marquise Wilson) that she'll never get a response to a fan letter she sent her 
idol. Nicole anxiously awaits an answer. When she doesn't get a reply, she 
becomes disappointed until a surprise guest pays a visit. Queen Latifah plays 
herself on Hangin' With Mr. Cooper (Friday 9:30-10 p.m. ABC). For ages 7 and 
up.

PALM LATITUDES: SCHOOL DAYS; TRICKS FOR THE TRADES

<TEXT>
<P>
 In these troubled economic times, people will do just about anything to 
improve their marketability and job security, even if it means pulling a rabbit 
out of a hat. University extension programs from Fullerton to San Diego are 
jampacked with folks hoping to add a little magic to their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a schoolteacher, a lawyer, a Ph.D physicist, an engineer, 
salespeople, a doctor," says Brad Burt, a professional magician who teaches an 
extension class at San Diego State. "It's an amazing range of people all 
wanting to learn magic for different reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 A few students have had a lifelong fascination with sleight of hand and want 
little more from the class than the ability to amaze and amuse. But a 
surprising number of hocus-pocus hopefuls are dedicating one night a week and 
spending $155 for each of the program's three separate courses because they 
believe they might gain a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of salespeople use magic because it's a nice opener for a sales 
presentation," Burt explains. "And the effect of an awful lot of tricks can 
also become a metaphor for some point the salesman wants to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Deanna Clark, a San Diego special education teacher, plans to take the tricks 
and techniques right into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times you need quick attention-getters and some of the card tricks 
would be good lesson starters," Clark says. "It's not as boring as just saying, 
'OK everybody, let's open up your books to page 43.' " Alan Rider

PALM LATITUDES: THE WORD; A NOVEL LOOK AT SOUTH-CENTRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carol Tice 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Dorsey High School graduate Jervey Tervalon enrolled in the acclaimed UC 
Irvine Program in Writing, his advisers told him that his first novel, an opus 
about his birthplace, New Orleans, just wasn't working. They thought his 
characters just didn't sound right, not ethnic enough."So I decided to write 
something so deeply in the vernacular that readers not familiar with that 
world" -- South-Central this time -- "would really have to think about it," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was "Understand This," which was just published by William Morrow & 
Co. Told from eight points of view, the novel tracks a pair of high school 
sweethearts as they struggle to avoid the gangs-and-drugs lifestyle. "There's a 
lot of life in South L.A. that has nothing to do with gangs," he says. 
"Personally, I've never even been in the back of a police car." 
</P>
<P>
 Tervalon, 35, now lives in Pasadena with his wife, Gina, a personnel analyst 
for the city of L.A. His second novel, a history of black Los Angeles told 
through his own family, is already on his agent's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Of South-Central, Tervalon says: "In some neighborhoods, it's really very 
quiet -- you only hear the gunfire in the distance." Carol Tice

BABY BACKLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sonja Bolle 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It all started with Barney. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March Ann Hulbert wrote scathingly in the New Republic about the vile 
purple dinosaur and his icky-sticky songs about love and creativity: "Barney 
makes Mickey Mouse look . . . like a master of irony." Once it was open season 
on this television atrocity, we've been free -- finally -- to express our true 
feelings about the tide of sappy sentiment that has risen threateningly since 
the first Baby Boomer gave birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Baby Backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 Many icons of yuppie baby worship, of course, are ripe for parody. But when a 
publisher feels free to poke fun at Margaret Wise Brown's classic lullaby story 
"Goodnight Moon," you have to ask: Is nothing sacred? 
</P>
<P>
 "Boom Baby Moon" by Sean Kelly with illustrations by Ron Hauge (Dell Trade 
Paperback: $7.99) looks so much like the original it might be mistaken for it. 
The room is set up just the same in the pictures, but where we should see the 
familiar nursery items, this good-night inventory instead begins: 
</P>
<P>
 In the night-lit room  
</P>
<P>
 There was a Kermit-phone  
</P>
<P>
 And a Steiff raccoon  
</P>
<P>
 And a hardcover copy of  
</P>
<P>
 "Goodnight Moon"  
</P>
<P>
 And a silent dehumidifier  
</P>
<P>
 And a space-age  
</P>
<P>
 plastic pacifier. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In short, a clutter of high-tech, overachieving debris and a "Swiss au pair" 
for the kid who's got to be protected at all costs from bodily harm ("Goodnight 
intercom in my crib/ Goodnight fireproof feeding bib"), not to mention accepted 
to Harvard Medical School in 19.5 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Boom Baby Moon" is no coarse joke. As the lines above demonstrate, Kelly 
also wonderfully duplicates the subtle, invasive rhythms of Margaret Wise 
Brown's verse. By the 783rd time you read "Goodnight Moon" (and what parent has 
not?) you find yourself, in regular adult conversation, using shorter phrases, 
hearing odd internal rhymes, drawing out your last syllable and -- suddenly! -- 
you are speaking perfect "Goodnight Moon"-ese . . . and you can't stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Also using "Goodnight Moon" as a jumping-off point is "Goodnight Opus" by 
Berkeley Breathed of Bloom County comic-strip fame (Little, Brown: $15.95) : 
</P>
<P>
 "Which book, dear Opus, may I read you tonight?" asked Grandma with love at 
the start of that night.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why, my favorite," I said, "the one with the rhymes, the same one you've read 
me two hundred nine times."  
</P>
<P>
 On this 210th reading, little Opus is suddenly swept away in an adventure; he 
"departs from the text." This isn't a parody that follows the original book; 
and Opus ends up subversively hoping that stodgy old Grandma will also one day 
depart from the text. Kiddie PoMo! 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat the Bunny," another constant on baby bookshelves, has spawned two 
parodies of its own. It's hard to tell if "Pat the Beastie: A Pull-and-Poke 
Book" by Henrik Drescher (Hyperion: $9.95) is meant to appeal to parents, or to 
a whole world that is -- let's face it -- no longer so gentle. The touchable 
page-inserts have more bite that the original did; in place of soft 
bunny-fluff, for example, you've got fluorescent green fur, with the 
invitation: "Judy pulls Beastie's fur. Will you pull Beastie's fur?" 
(Underneath, additional captions retort): "Ow! That's not fun! Now let's pull 
your hair!" 
</P>
<P>
 There's a scratch-and-sniff for Beastie's feet that we would leave 
unmentioned, except that it's the best segue to the next book: "Pat the Stimpy" 
by Ren Hoek (Grosset & Dunlap: $9.95). Here the frenetic TV team of "The Ren & 
Stimpy Show" raise scratch-and-sniff to new heights: "These socks stink! I 
think I'm going to retch! Now you can smell them and retch, too!" On the last 
page, after the History-Erasing Button has been activated by small hands, comes 
the cheerful announcement: "It's the end of civilization as we know it!" 
</P>
<P>
 So is this the end of civilization as we know it? Are we trying to raise a 
generation of smart-alecks? Or is this just appropriate fin-de-siecle culture 
for kids? Sonja Bolle

STYLE; FASHION; VINTAGE POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Demi Moore appeared at the 1992 Academy Awards ceremony in a breathtaking 
lavender-gray silk georgette gown, speculation about the gown's designer 
included Calvin Klein and Giorgio Armani. But Moore, a devoted collector of 
vintage clothes, was wearing a crystal-pleated dress made in the late '40s and 
purchased at Lily et Cie, a fine vintage clothing rental and resale shop on 
West 3rd Street.Shopping the same store for last year's Oscar gala, Whoopi 
Goldberg chose a Juel Park hostess jumpsuit from the '50s, adding an overskirt 
and bolero to personalize the look. 
</P>
<P>
 Like cars and furniture, fine clothes from earlier times are fast becoming 
collectibles. Rita Watnick, co-owner of Lily et Cie, links the trend to today's 
designers (Karl Lagerfeld shops her store), who often borrow styles from the 
past. "We see vintage styles in contemporary clothing," Watnick says, "so when 
someone buys an original, what they're really doing is going to the source. And 
wearing a vintage gown assures that no one else has the identical outfit -- or 
knows what it cost." 
</P>
<P>
 At antique auctions, clothing by the likes of Galanos, Poiret, Dior, 
Balenciaga and Chanel has begun showing up amid the credenzas and diamonds. But 
prices are far higher than what the clothes originally cost -- dealers predict 
a '30s Chanel evening gown will bring $70,000 in London this year. So a splurge 
on today's designer fashions could actually pay off big in a few decades. Call 
it fashion appreciation.

RESTAURANTS; RAW MATERIALS; WHILE MANY PATRONS CRAVE THE HYBRID FARE, IT'S THE 
SUSHI THAT'S WORTH THE WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Matsuhisa, the Beverly Hills spot where chef-owner Nobu Matsuhisa puts an 
original spin on "gourmet Japanese seafood and sushi" (so reads the sign), we 
are crammed into a makeshift hallway as tightly packed as a Tokyo subway car at 
rush hour. The door opens, and six more people try to make their way to the 
tiny reservation desk just as another group exits the dining room. Gridlock. We 
surge back, jamming into the corners of the framed reviews of the restaurant. 
"Want to buy our spot?" jokes a couple at the head of the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the food worth the wait?" I can't help asking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable," the woman answers ruefully. "Of course, one reason it 
tastes so good is all that butter." Butter?  
</P>
<P>
 It's clearly the food that draws the crowd. The storefront's hardly glamorous 
makeshift decor consists of straw-wrapped sake casks, photos of the house 
specialties and painted silhouettes of Nobu Matsuhisa and company. Considering 
that a bill here can come in at $100 a person and up, we're talking reverse 
chic. 
</P>
<P>
 Once we have achieved an actual table, we confront the menu. There are two: 
the basic version and a separate, 25-page compendium of specialties, with 
index. But by this point, we're too hungry to read. So when the waiter appears 
with a portable board listing the day's specials, we put ourselves in his 
hands.  
</P>
<P>
 A plate of exquisitely fresh sliced fish is doused with hot virgin olive oil 
and sesame oil and a splash of yuzu (a Japanese citron). The strongly flavored 
oils and a dab of fresh garlic overwhelm the seafood's delicate flavor. This 
"new style" sashimi seems to be designed for those who don't like the taste of 
raw fish. A fleshy shiitake mushroom cap piled high with ocher sea-urchin roe, 
wrapped in spinach leaves and set in a pool of hollandaise scattered with beads 
of salmon roe, is lovely to behold -- but uni and hollandaise make an awkward 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiter insists we try something in "creamy spicy sauce," essentially 
mayonnaise spiked with Chinese red chile paste and garlic. We go for the 
gratineed crab. Whether the idea is innovative or peculiar is moot. The 
subtleties of Dungeness crab are lost beneath the slippery, hot mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the baby squid in special pepper sauce arrives several courses 
later, we are into serious protein overload. The plate of tenderest baby squid 
sauced with soy, sake and quantities of black pepper, garlic and wasabi is in 
dire need of some rice to play off its aggressive and strangely appealing bite. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuhisa has clearly observed how Californians like to eat, noting our 
penchant for strong flavors, the way we like both sweet and fiery hot notes. So 
he uses plenty of shoyu soy sauce, deglazes with sake and packs a wallop with 
wasabi and black pepper. When in doubt, it's grated garlic or the ever-reliable 
butter to the rescue. And I suspect that status ingredients such as truffles 
and caviar are there more for show than for any real culinary reason.  
</P>
<P>
 The chef, who worked in Peru, brings eclectic ingredients and techniques into 
the austere Japanese tradition. A great idea, if you can pull it off. In this 
case, his East-West juggling act too often results in muddled flavors.  
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant has a self-contained, by-reservation-only tempura bar right in 
the middle, but you don't necessarily eat tempura there. "It's kaiseki -style," 
the waiter informs me. In Japan, kaiseki means an elaborate meal that proceeds 
in a fixed order, each course featuring a different cooking technique. Here, it 
costs $80 minimum to eat in what looks like a food stall in Tsukiji, Tokyo's 
fish market. What you pay for is exclusivity (there are just eight seats) and a 
custom-tailored menu of intricately orchestrated courses. Jellyfish in crab 
miso, a braised daikon dish, and grilled sea bass marinated in sake lees are 
all delicious, but a seafood-stuffed spring roll is greasy and the steamed eel 
tired and thin in taste. At this price, I expect more. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first-come, first-serve sushi bar, the sound level is deafening. As we 
slip onto our stools one evening, a chef snaps three sushi  
</P>
<P>
 fans grinning into the camera behind a wedge of green tea cheesecake stuck 
with a fizzling birthday candle.  
</P>
<P>
 Each round of sushi -- hamachi , toro , uni , smelt egg with quail egg -- is 
better than the last, especially the flavorful mackerel. Ruddy bonito is 
garnished with rings of dark jalapeno and a squeeze of yuzu . In concept, the 
searing chile replaces the wasabi ; in reality, it blasts away the subtle 
flavor of the fish. Toro tartare arrives with a dab of caviar on top, but it's 
hard to taste the tuna or the caviar through the pugnacious pepper sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 Squid "pasta," pieces of tender, milky squid that do look a little like penne, 
are drowned in melted butter with a touch of garlic, sake and soy. I wanted to 
wipe off the butter in order to taste the squid. The grilled toro steak, 
though, is a gorgeous hunk of tuna rubbed with garlic and shoyu .  
</P>
<P>
 Another dish? We're full. Yet, as I turn my spot at the bar over to the next 
in line, I look longingly at the platter of sushi the chef is preparing for a 
table at the back. Because after all the multicultural magic tricks, it is the 
sushi that's worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>

THE WINE LIST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tradition says Asian food needs sake or beer, but with Matsuhisa's 
eclecticism, fine wine also works well, especially if carefully chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, alas, are out of range: 1971 Dom Perignon Rose might be perfect, but at 
$550, uh, well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Most parties have a wide range of foods, spicy and not, so a fine wine to 
marry flavors is 1991 Sancerre "Le Chene," from Lucien Crochet, $32.More 
complex are the superb 1991 Gewurztraminer from Charles Schleret, $32; 1991 dry 
Riesling from August Eser, $33, and 1992 Ferrari-Carano Fume Blanc, $18. 
</P>
<P>
 White works better than red here, leaving out most of the fine Bordeaux (just 
as well, since the cheapest is $100). For those who must have red, try 1989 
Havens Merlot Reserve, $33; 1991 Domaine Drouhin (Oregon) Pinot Noir, $50, or 
1992 Au Bon Climat Pinot Noir, $26.Dan Berger

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; MICHAEL DUDIKOFF RIDES THE FAST LANE WITH 'COBRA' SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The stoic Scandal Jackson of "Cobra," artfully disarms bad guys by bringing 
them to the ground. At first glance, the role of Scandal seems to fit Michael 
Dudikoff, the high-profile, action star of the "American Ninja" movies. His 
most familiar role as the strong, quiet, and fight-ready loner -- recently 
displayed in the movie "Rescue Me" -- couldn't be further from his real-life 
persona. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of "Cobra" calls for a combination of martial arts and standard street 
fighting, something that Dudikoff, believe it or not, really doesn't know much 
about. The 38-year-old actor learns what he needs to know when he gets to the 
set, courtesy of a choreographer or martial arts expert. 
</P>
<P>
 The aw-shucks Redondo Beach native's favorite role so far? Playing Huck Finn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just more like me," Dudikoff says of Tom Sawyer's best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Scandal is enigmatic and cool. This week, he strong-arms former teen idol Rex 
Smith.Dudikoff, on the other hand, is straightforward and not self-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 In talking about "Cobra's" busy schedule, he says: "I'm dyslexic and sometimes 
when we are doing two shows at once and a line is similar, I'll say the same 
line from the other show. I'm just getting used to the fast pace (compared to 
films). You really have to know your stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Dudikoff hasn't had a problem knowing or learning his "stuff." In the feature 
"Radioactive Dreams," he does some musical comedy and tap dancing -- all of 
which he learned on the set. 
</P>
<P>
 In what could be a scenario for a bad TV movie, Dudikoff was discovered at a 
restaurant -- waiting tables at Beachbum Burts in Redondo Beach -- and given 
the chance to be a model. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in college and wanted to be a child psychologist, but I said, 'What the 
heck, it seemed easy, I get to wear a lot of nice clothes and it would be fun 
to meet new people.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He went from being a print model to television commercials, but didn't find it 
substantial enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't using my brain," he reflects. "I became a poseur. Then I got into 
acting and it totally challenged me. It was very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 His first acting job was as Joanie's (Erin Moran) boyfriend on ABC's "Happy 
Days." Other guest-star roles followed. He continued acting and modeling for 
three years, then gave up modeling to focus on his acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudikoff, who appears to have found his niche in "Cobra" and action-adventure 
films ("The Annihilation," "Avenging Force," "Platoon Leader," "River of Death" 
and "Human Shield"), is determined to prove he can do other types of roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can do 'Tootsie,' I can play 'The Shining,' I can do all that," he says 
emphatically. "That's what acting is all about. If they can give me something 
different, I could do it. I just have to be patient for that opportunity. I 
want to play something where I can make the audience cry and make them say, 
'Wow'." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cobra" airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on KCOP.

PROFILE; LORD OF THE MANNERS; IAN RICHARDSON REVIVES HIS FORMIDABLE PRIME 
MINISTER IN 'MASTERPIECE' SEQUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT WOLF, Matt Wolf is an arts writer based in London. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Actors don't get much more silken than "To Play the King" star Ian Richardson, 
who on a recent morning is indeed the very model of that vanishing breed -- a 
modern British gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be a great deal more good-mannered behavior around," 
Richardson, 59, is saying over morning coffee at Brown's Hotel, exactly the 
kind of discreet, wood-paneled hotel his TV character Francis Urquhart might 
repair to for a confidence-filled chat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," the actor continues, "good manners and politeness are regarded by young 
people as a sign of weakness, and that I find abhorrent. I was brought up to be 
extremely good-mannered in all my dealings with my fellow men. I find it quite 
extraordinary that the very training I had should be regarded as weak when it's 
a sign of strength to know how to behave." 
</P>
<P>
 Try telling that to his chillingly magnetic creation, Urquhart, who, when last 
encountered in "House of Cards" (1991), was leaving a well-mannered trail of 
havoc and death in his wake. In Andrew Davies' sequel based on the Michael 
Dobbs novel, Richardson's devious prime minister locks horns with a newly 
crowned and -- gasp! -- compassionate king (Michael Kitchen of "Out of 
Africa"), whose resemblance to a certain current monarch-to-be is there for the 
making. 
</P>
<P>
 Were the parallels acknowledged during filming, one wonders, especially with 
the issue of Prince Charles' accession to the throne a constant topic of 
British tabloid fodder? "They were never disregarded," Richardson says under 
his breath. "I was quite surprised when I first did a scene with Michael 
Kitchen that he was actually attempting a Windsor voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might have thought myself that Michael might shy away from it because of 
the obvious controversy that would inevitably follow. But then I thought, 'No, 
this is very brave, because even if he played it with a Liverpool accent, 
people would make the connection anyway.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson says talk of a sequel never arose during the filming of "House of 
Cards" and he was at first "of two minds" about reprising the role. " 'House of 
Cards,' if you like, was like the first half of 'Richard III,' which is the 
most enjoyable half to play because he's saying to the audience, 'I'm going to 
do this, and you're going to watch me do it, and it's all jolly amusing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Now comes the second half, and it's not funny anymore because Richard is in 
power and he has got to stay there. He starts suspecting everyone, even 
Buckingham his old chum, and it's all downhill after that," the actor explains. 
"I thought it was very likely 'To Play the King' would be like the second half, 
and having played 'Richard III' at Stratford, I can tell you, I was 
apprehensive." 
</P>
<P>
 The finished product, though, offered its own validation: "I think probably as 
a melodramatic thriller, 'To Play the King' has the edge on 'House of Cards,' 
which I never thought it would. The way Andrew has written it I win in the end 
through the usual Urquhart means." The actor smiles: "It's way over the top, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also made the actor a TV star after a distinguished lifetime in the 
classic theater, playing most of the Bard's great male roles with the Royal 
Shakespeare Company and appearing from time to time on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, Richardson had a taste of musical stardom on the Great White Way as 
Higgins in "My Fair Lady." But despite winning a Tony nomination, he speaks 
sourly about the experience. "I had never worked with microphones on stage; my 
voice had been trained to fill large theaters without electronic assistance and 
nobody thought to warn me, with the result that Christine Andreas as Eliza was 
being heftily miked by the controller at the back of the auditorium and 
whenever I opened my mouth, he was turning the mikes off, which gave a curious 
imbalance to the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 He played the role for a year, "and that was quite long enough. I reached the 
stage where I would gladly have handed my quite generous salary back to the 
producers if only they would let me go home." (Mere mention of a later Broadway 
role, in 1981 for Edward Albee's ill-fated stage version of "Lolita" and 
playing opposite Donald Sutherland, makes Richardson wince.) 
</P>
<P>
 Back in England with his wife, Marousia Frank, Richardson has forsaken the 
stage in recent years for character parts on TV and the big screen (alongside 
Jeremy Irons in "M. Butterfly," among others). He speaks balefully about losing 
the role of Lord Darlington in "The Remains of the Day" to James Fox: "The 
producers looked at my tapes again, and the consensus of opinion was that, 
although I'm not an intellectual person in reality, what comes across on screen 
is a man who's really rather bright, which was completely wrong. Lord 
Darlington should be aristocratic but rather stupid, so they went with James 
Fox, which is not very complimentary, but at least he was better for it." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which may be why, after doubts about a follow-up to "House of Cards," 
Richardson readily embraces a rumored third go-round as Urquhart. "As far as 
the camera's concerned, it's wonderful for someone of my age who had settled 
into a routine of turning up and playing a featured role to somebody else's 
leading role suddenly finding I carry the thing; it's terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 But the actor did make one proviso clear to the producers. "I have said I will 
do it provided in the final reel Urquhart is blown to bits. They have agreed 
that he must meet his demise." 
</P>
<P>
 Part 3 of "To Play the King" on "Masterpiece Theatre" airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on 
KVCR, 9 p.m. on KCET and KPBS and Tuesday at 8 p.m. on KOCE. The fourth and 
final part airs at the same times next week.

RETRO; BACK ON THE 'WAGON TRAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in 1950, John Ford directed the Western drama "Wagon Master" about two 
young cowhands (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.) who join a Mormon wagon train 
traveling to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 That classic, which was filmed in Monument Valley, became the basis of the 
long-running TV Western "Wagon Train." Repeats of the series currently air 
Saturdays on the Family Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wagon Train" premiered Sept. 18, 1957, on NBC. The one-hour weekly series was 
handsomely produced, with exciting stories and attractive guest stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The series was set in the post-Civil War West. Each year, the show began in 
St. Joseph, Mo., and followed a wagon train as it headed west to California. 
During the course of the season, the travelers would encounter Native 
Americans, the elements, the Rocky Mountains, the prairies and the deserts. 
Each week the show would concentrate on a different member of the wagon train. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran character actor Ward Bond, who also had a supporting role in "Wagon 
Master," played the dependable, paternal trail boss Seth Adams. Robert Horton 
was the dashing frontier scout Flint McCullough. Terry Wilson played the 
assistant wagon master Bill Hawks, and Frank McGrath was the old, feisty cook 
Charlie Wooster. 
</P>
<P>
 The series started out rather slowly in the ratings, placing No. 23 during its 
premiere season, which was surprising considering the late '50s were the golden 
age of Westerns on TV. That year alone, five Westerns ranked among the Top 10 
shows: "Gunsmoke," "Tales of Wells Fargo," "Have Gun Will Travel," "The Life 
and Legend of Wyatt Earp" and "The Restless Gun." By the second season, though, 
"Wagon Train" began to roll and streaked to the No. 2 position. It became the 
No. 1 show during the 1961-62 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, the ratings began to drop. Ward Bond died during 
production of the 1960-61 season and John McIntire was brought in as the new 
wagon master, Christopher Hale. Horton left the series in 1962. Scott Miller 
joined the cast as scout Duke Shannon in 1961 and Robert Fuller came on board 
in 1963 as young scout Cooper Smith. Michael Burns was added in 1963 as Barnaby 
West, a 13-year-old traveling the trail by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The series moved from NBC to ABC in September 1962. In the fall of 1963, ABC 
expanded the show to 90 minutes. The change didn't bring any new viewers and 
the series reverted to back to an hour for its last season in 1964. "Wagon 
Train" came to the end of the trail on Sept. 5, 1965. Reruns of the Ward Bond 
episodes were retitled "Major Adams -- Trailmaster" and aired during the day on 
ABC from 1963 to 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wagon Train" airs Saturdays at 1 p.m. on the Family Channel.

$65-MILLION 'THEME PARK' PROPOSED ON RESERVATION BY CUSTER BATTLEFIELD; 
HISTORY: DEVELOPER IS CLOSE TO AGREEMENT WITH U.S., CROW TRIBE. 
PRESERVATIONISTS ARE AGHAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Call it Custerland. 
</P>
<P>
 On 24,000 acres adjacent to the spot where Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer 
met his Maker, a private developer intends to build a tourist park of the 
American West, complete with buffalo and Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The same plan would give the company exclusive rights to conduct tours of the 
battlefield -- a national monument -- and to sell merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has been receptive to the proposal; the Crow tribe supports it 
strongly. But for some preservationists, the plan is a gaudy sacrilege, thrust 
on the public through a veil of secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's "a tacky theme park," said Robert Utley, retired chief historian of the 
National Park Service. "They're trading away the national heritage for the 
somewhat dubious prospect of lots of money coming from the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
 It was at the Little Big Horn that Custer and the men of the 7th U.S. Cavalry 
made their "last stand" in 1876, obliterated by Sioux and Cheyenne warriors in 
what may be the most famous battle of the American Indian wars. 
</P>
<P>
 The park itself is just 700 acres in size; it is surrounded by the Crow 
reservation, on which the tourist park would be built. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for North Shield Ventures Inc., led by Nashville radio-TV 
producer Lawson Stowe Warren, to pay royalties over a 30-year period to the 
Park Service and the Crow Tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, 39, declines to say where the money is coming from for the park, which 
he says will cost $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, called The Road to the Little Big Horn, would consist of 14 exhibits 
that would "weave a continually evolving story into a sensual tapestry of 
images and impressions of the American West," Warren says. 
</P>
<P>
 They would include a herd of 100 buffalo, with Indian hunting parties stalking 
them; Crow, Northern Cheyenne and Sioux villages; a portrayal of "Thomas 
Jefferson's world" of 1803; the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore the West; 
daily life around Ft. Laramie; and the signing of treaties between the United 
States and Native American tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour would culminate in "a 360-degree, three-minute, terrifying film 
presentation of what the Battle at the Little Big Horn would have looked like 
and sounded like," Warren says. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Stovall, a former Crow tribal administrator who helped negotiate the 
agreement, says criticisms are largely unfounded fears of "the Custer buffs." 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is going to be done very tastefully," Stovall says. "It's 
not going to be a Knotts Berry Farm or Disneyland-type operation whatsoever. 
It's going to be a total living experience." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he says, it's going to produce a river of tourists for the gambling 
casino, restaurant, hotel and truck stop the tribe is building a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren says the park would provide 600 summer jobs for Native Americans -- 400 
Crows, 100 each from the Northern Cheyenne and Lakota Sioux -- and a smaller 
operation the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren also offers big money to the Crows. In return, the tribe would agree to 
prohibit development around the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction for the Park Service is the promise of millions of dollars from 
the tourist park, plus additional land for the battlefield and relief from some 
administrative duties. 
</P>
<P>
 North Shield would build and maintain a new visitor center at the battlefield 
for the Park Service, plus new housing for Park Service personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents decry both the proposal and what they say is the secrecy that 
surrounds it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing has been conducted from the beginning in such secrecy and 
among such confusion on the part of the National Park Service that, for a 
private citizen, it's very difficult to sort out where it came from and where 
it's going," said Utley, the retired Park Service historian. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge dismays the Park Service, which held 15 public hearings on the 
proposal in Montana, Colorado and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents point out the Park Service signed a "memorandum of 
understanding" -- setting out the procedure for consideration of the proposal 
-- in September, 1992, before the public knew negotiations were under way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service didn't reveal the agreement until forced to do so by a formal 
request under the federal open records law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we had to resort to the Freedom of Information Act to obtain a 
copy of the (memorandum) makes us all very suspect of any proposals," James V. 
Court, a former superintendent of the battlefield, complained in a letter to 
regional director Robert M. Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service fed opponents' suspicions by abruptly ousting two longtime 
support groups, the Custer Battlefield Historical and Museum Assn. and the 
Custer Battlefield Preservation Assn., about the time the proposal surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The first group was no longer merely supportive and had become an adversary on 
this and other matters, the Park Service said; it said the other group, which 
aimed to buy more land for the park, would be unnecessary if the project went 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Utley and other opponents say the numbers just don't add up: The battlefield's 
350,000 visitors a year can't generate enough money to pay the cost of the 
tourist park. But even if true, he says, the numbers spell trouble for the 
battlefield monument. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Park Service just doesn't have a record of being able to stand up to 
moneyed interests . . . ," Utley says. "The whole thing just stinks to high 
heaven."

GRAND CANYON CONSIDERS BANNING CARS, USING TRAMS TO EASE PARKING NIGHTMARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The principle is simple: A family vacation should not degenerate into an 
exhaust-shrouded battle to park at the edge of one of the world's greatest 
natural wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is precisely what is happening at the Grand Canyon, and officials are 
looking for solutions -- even a ban on cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Grand Canyon experience is rapidly approaching that of a bad day at a 
shoddy shopping mall," said Roger Clark, a spokesman for the Grand Canyon 
Trust, an advocacy group. "You can easily spend an hour and a half of a 
two-hour visit just looking for a place to park." 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical summer day, about 20,000 visitors pass through the gates of Grand 
Canyon National Park, most of them in the more than 6,000 cars that jam the 
roads and compete for fewer than 2,000 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 West Rim Drive, which hugs the lip of the mile-deep canyon and gives access to 
numerous overlooks and trail heads, already is closed to cars in the summer. 
Visitors instead ride a free tram. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no limits on cars elsewhere in the park -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipate the day when . . . there won't be any automobiles inside the 
Grand Canyon National Park," Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt told a gathering 
sponsored by the Grand Canyon Trust in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Traver, the Grand Canyon's chief of professional services, said replacing 
cars with mass transit is but one of a number of options being studied as part 
of a $1.5-million planning process begun in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other possibilities: closing some of the lodging in the park, or 
requiring future construction -- including housing for park employees and 
visitor services -- to be in communities outside the park boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 Another proposal would require visitors to get permits, much like the system 
already uses for backcountry hiking. Traver said this would help spread 
visitors over a broader area and control crowding during peak periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't necessarily mean people would be turned away," Traver said. 
"They might be asked to return later in the day or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 As it is now, almost all visitors to the 227-mile-long park funnel onto about 
30 miles of scenic roads along the canyon's south rim. The main visitor center, 
Grand Canyon Village, is a maze of narrow roads serving the headquarters, 
hotels, restaurants, shops and campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt, a former Arizona governor who has hiked extensively in the park, 
favors building "gateway villages" outside its boundaries where people would 
leave their cars, continuing by foot, horseback or mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 In his private law practice, Babbitt had represented a developer who plans to 
build just such a village outside the park gates in Tusayan. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Department spokesman Kevin Sweeney said Babbitt won't take part in 
any decisions involving the developer, Canyon Forest Village Corp. And he said 
Babbitt supported gateway villages long before he worked for Canyon Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Tusayan -- including motels, an airport, restaurants and a big-screen theater 
that perpetually plays a canyon travelogue -- is about seven miles south of the 
main park entrance. Otherwise, the closest sizable cities are Williams and 
Flagstaff, 50 and 80 miles away, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Traver said there was broad support during a series of public hearings in 
October and November for eliminating cars from Grand Canyon Village. But he 
said there was no consensus for a complete ban on vehicles in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Czeslaw Schmidt, an Arizona retiree, went to the park on his honeymoon 45 
years ago and visits regularly -- most recently last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic, he said, has become a headache. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's lines to get into the park that went about 10 minutes," Schmidt said. 
"At the visitor center there was no place to park. Wh had to park maybe half a 
mile away in a campground and walk." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, he used the West Rim Drive tram and liked it, except for the 
half-hour wait to board the bus. But he isn't sure others are so agreeable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Europeans would probably prefer the bus, the Japanese probably too," Schmidt 
said. "Americans would probably rather use their car."

ARIZONA'S FEDERAL WATER PROJECT A BITTER, COSTLY DISAPPOINTMENT; THE WEST: 
CHEAP, PLENTIFUL SUPPLIES WERE SUPPOSED TO WEAN FARMERS OFF UNDERGROUND WATER, 
BUT WITH A HIGH PRICE TAG, IT ISN'T WORKING AS PLANNED. CALIFORNIA COULD 
BENEFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM KENWORTHY, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was shortly after World War II when Arizona's farming, industrial and 
municipal interests first went to Washington to ask for help with their 
grandiose dream of transporting Colorado River water hundreds of miles to make 
the desert bloom around Phoenix and Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 50 years later, the massive, federally built engineering project they 
envisioned is nearing completion as construction crews put the finishing 
touches on the far-flung plumbing of the Central Arizona Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The multibillion-dollar project's centerpiece, a 336-mile-long concrete 
aqueduct, pierces the desert from Lake Havasu on the California border to just 
beyond Tucson -- a thin, blue artery carrying billions of gallons of water over 
mountainous terrain and dry river washes, sped by gargantuan pumps and then 
stored behind towering dams. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially funded primarily by the federal government and built by the 
Department of Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, the project is being turned 
over in stages to the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, a 
state-created entity responsible for paying back the state's share of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The completion of the CAP ought to be good news for C.L. (Bill) Scott and 
other Arizona farmers who were supposed to use a big chunk of the 1.5 million 
acre-feet of water the system can deliver each year, enough to satisfy the 
eventual household demands of about 7 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheap, plentiful CAP water was supposed to wean farmers like Scott off 
dwindling underground water supplies. Arizona agriculture, which uses 80% of 
the state's water, was supposed to provide a reliable market for CAP supplies 
until they were needed by residential and industrial users in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scott, who raises 1,000 acres of cotton and seed grains on his farm 45 
miles south of Phoenix, says he cannot afford to take any CAP water in 1994 
unless prices are slashed. Nor, he says, can most of his neighbors in the 
Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation District, all of whom are struggling with low 
prices for cotton -- the major crop in the area -- as well as repayments on 
bonds and loans used to finance irrigation networks for CAP water. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current pricing, Scott and others would pay about $61 an acre-foot 
(about 326,000 gallons), but the district wants to cut that to as low as $17 
for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 With cotton revenue down and expected CAP prices high, many growers are 
reverting to their former practice of pumping water from cheaper underground 
sources, a practice the CAP was specifically intended to reduce. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies a fundamental problem for the Central Arizona Project. It has 
just about everything its early proponents foresaw, except enough customers and 
enough income to reimburse the federal government roughly $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Once seen as a testament to man's ingenuity and skill at tinkering with 
nature, the CAP now threatens to become a monument to outdated federal water 
policies and flawed assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The state is scrambling to find a way to make the project work, as the first 
bill in a 50-year repayment schedule comes due this month. And once again, 
Arizona is asking for help from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's proposal for financially restructuring the CAP poses a key test 
for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and other officials who have pledged to 
overhaul federal water policy by reducing subsidies to agriculture, encouraging 
conservation and dedicating more of the resource to fish and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The state solution, however, would dramatically increase subsidies to farmers 
of water-intensive crops such as cotton; shift costs to residential and 
industrial users; and ultimately increase the cost borne by U.S. taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to be this way. But then, few of the assumptions behind the 
CAP have held up over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorized by Congress in 1968, it was projected to cost less than $1 billion 
and to be built in seven years. Now, the total cost is expected to be $4.7 
billion when the last yard of concrete cures in 1999, almost three decades 
after construction began. 
</P>
<P>
 Often propelled by fears of water scarcity, the CAP's major problem is 
"underutilization." With farmers declining to buy the water and whole 
irrigation districts defaulting on their repayment obligations, the CAP has 
never delivered even half of its planned capacity, and deliveries have been 
steadily declining for the last four years. Municipal demand for all of the 
water is decades away. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheap water envisioned by CAP advocates several decades ago is growing 
increasingly expensive, and residential and industrial customers may face 
continued tax increases to pay for the project in the face of declining 
agricultural demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the federal share of the project may be $1 billion greater than 
anticipated, according to a recent report by the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although mop-up construction work will continue for several years, the 
Interior Department last fall declared the major phase of the CAP construction 
project substantially complete. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that this month the Central Arizona Water Conservation District 
must begin repaying the federal government for its share of the cost. Even if 
the state wins an argument with Washington over how much that repayment will 
be, federal auditors say the state may not be able to pay off its long-term 
debt under the current financing structure. 
</P>
<P>
 So Arizona and Interior Department officials are poised early this year to 
begin some delicate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the key players at the department, including Babbitt and his assistant 
secretary for water and science, Elizabeth A. Rieke, have a long history of 
involvement with the CAP, he as Arizona governor and she as director of 
Arizona's department of water resources. 
</P>
<P>
 So too does the new commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, Dan Beard, who 
is taking the lead in dealing with Arizona officials. More than a decade ago, 
as a young assistant to then-Interior Secretary Cecil D. Andrus, Beard clashed 
with Babbitt over CAP allocations to Arizona Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking over their shoulders is Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of 
the Natural Resources Committee and a key player in any debate to help Arizona 
out of its mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is a longtime critic of massive federal reclamation projects that 
heavily subsidize big agriculture. And he is from California, historically 
Arizona's biggest rival for Colorado River water and a potential beneficiary if 
a solution to the CAP's woes includes short-term water marketing to other 
states.

PHONE MAY CUT RISK OF PREMATURE BIRTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Women at high risk of giving birth prematurely may be more likely to carry 
their babies to term if they are in frequent phone contact with a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 High-risk women who received two to four phone calls a week from a nurse 
during later pregnancy had a 9.5% rate of low-birthweight babies, compared with 
a 15% rate for other women, a preliminary study found. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone calls probably helped by providing education and social support, 
said study principal investigator Mary Lou Moore, a research assistant 
professor in obstetrics and gynecology at Wake Forest University's Bowman Gray 
School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some of these women, this may be the most supportive relationship they've 
ever had," Moore said. That could make a difference because women under intense 
stress who have nobody to talk to can be at greater risk for premature birth, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers used low birthweight as an indicator of prematurity, Moore said. 
About 70% of low-birthweight babies are premature, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-birthweight premature babies -- born before 37 weeks of pregnancy and 
weighing less than 5.5 pounds -- run a heightened risk of such problems as 
cerebral palsy, chronic lung conditions, blindness, deafness and mental 
retardation. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore spoke in a telephone interview before presenting the federally funded 
work Friday in Las Vegas at the annual meeting of the Society of Perinatal 
Obstetricians. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a promising study" that follows similar indications from other 
research, said Dr. Robert Goldenberg of the University of Alabama at 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the study has not shown a significant reduction in babies of 
very low birthweight, who run the highest risk of death and serious medical 
problems. Reducing those two outcomes is the ultimate test of such a program, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said too few births with very low weight have occurred to assess the 
program's effect on them, and the study is continuing with additional women to 
overcome that problem. The planned total is 1,500 women, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary results focus on 634 women considered most at risk, such as 
blacks and teen-agers. The women received public assistance and got prenatal 
care from a medical school clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 They were randomly assigned to get either an instructional booklet about 
premature labor or the booklet plus phone calls from a nurse between the 24th 
and 37th weeks of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the phone calls, nurses asked a standard list of questions about whether 
the women were experiencing warning signals of premature labor. Moore said that 
probably helped the women learn about signals that they should get to a 
hospital to prevent premature birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses also encouraged the women to decrease smoking and use of alcohol and 
illicit drugs. They assessed the women's nutrition, advised them on eating 
properly and monitored their use of medications. Women reporting premature 
contractions were advised about steps to take at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Each woman was encouraged to call her nurse any time. Some calls by the women 
dealt with things like breaking up with a boyfriend or a need for drug 
treatment.

LEGISLATOR TAKES AIM AT POST-QUAKE PIRATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kudos to the Dallas-based Southland Corp. for terminating franchise agreements 
with eight 7-Eleven stores charged with price-gouging in the wake of the 
Northridge earthquake ("7-Eleven Cutting Franchises Over Price Gouging," Jan. 
22). 
</P>
<P>
 I'm delighted that Southland has demonstrated that corporate responsibility 
and integrity are as important as corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, those contractors, plumbers, electricians and other business 
people who came through in the clutch -- and charged their regular prices -- 
also deserve our applause. 
</P>
<P>
 As for those price-gouging contractors who are seeing dollar signs, not 
devastation, in the wake of the tragic earthquake, they're another matter 
entirely. I hope the state Legislature will follow the example set by Southland 
Corp. and take swift action to ban price gouging throughout California whenever 
a state of emergency is declared. In addition, I plan to introduce legislation 
to require the state Contractors' Licensing Board to immediately revoke the 
license of any opportunistic contractor convicted of violating any state or 
local price-gouging law.

PACKARD BELL CHANGES WERE IN THE WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jan. 22 story on Packard Bell's layoff of workers omits several critical 
facts ("Packard Bell Plans to Lay Off Some Workers at Chatsworth Center"). 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell had notified all of our service and support employees last 
October that we were seeking a new site for the department.On Jan. 10, we 
informed them of the company's decision to move service and support to Utah and 
asked them to accept or decline an invitation to relocate. Only 30 to 35 
workers, or 7% of our technical support employees, were not offered a chance to 
relocate, based on unsatisfactory performance reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 We were all impacted by the Los Angeles earthquake Jan. 17. Packard Bell's 
technical support building was destroyed along with our corporate headquarters. 
We were forced to move to a new site and accelerate the opening of our Utah 
technical support facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell is very concerned about all of our employees. We are offering 
psychological counseling to any employee who suffered in the quake. We are also 
offering assistance to anyone who sustained personal losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, the earthquake brought personal devastation for thousands of people. 
Businesses were affected also. Packard Bell is doing its best to restore 
normalcy to our employees and the community as quickly as possible.

MILITARY SATELLITE SUPPORTER, CRITIC DRAW LINE IN SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth gets its boots on." This 
old proverb is especially true in today's era of instantaneous mass 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
 It is with great frustration, then, that I find myself lacing up my boots to 
challenge a number of wildly inaccurate assertions published by the Los Angeles 
Times on Dec. 22 ("U.S. to Send Ton of Sand Into Space") and sent around the 
world on the L.A. Times-Washington Post News Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The story in question quoted a number of unnamed sources professing that the 
Air Force is planning to launch "2,000 pounds of sand" into orbit on a Milstar 
communications satellite at a cost to the taxpayers of "$70 million." 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Air Force has no plans to launch 2,000 pounds of sand into space as 
ballast on a Milstar satellite. The ballast is entirely aluminum, consisting of 
model replacements for an electronics payload that is no longer needed. 
Furthermore, the aluminum is necessary to ensure balance for the satellite to 
work properly on orbit, and it weighs only 878 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the addition of the ballast adds nothing to the cost of the launch. 
The article wrongly takes the cost of the rocket and its fuel, divides by the 
weight of the satellite and multiplies by the weight of the ballast to conclude 
that it will cost an additional $70 million to send the ballast into space. 
</P>
<P>
 The logic here is seriously flawed. It is comparable to saying: "My car weighs 
2,000 pounds; it cost $20,000. That equates to $10 per pound. Therefore, if I 
weighed 200 pounds, it would cost me an additional $2,000 every time I drove to 
the grocery store." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact of the matter is that the launch of the satellite will cost exactly 
the same amount with or without the ballast. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the uninstalled payload that necessitated the ballast was built, fully 
tested and successfully installed on our first satellite. It was left off the 
second satellite because it was no longer needed in the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 This saves taxpayers money. But instead of highlighting -- or even mentioning 
-- the cost savings, the article characterizes it as a failure, stating that it 
"was never completed," it was removed because of "undisclosed problems" and 
that "it remains unclear what problems caused it to be removed." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the article holds up the entire Milstar satellite system like a 
punching bag and allows it to be assailed, unchallenged, by Mr. John Pike, a 
longtime Milstar critic. Pike expresses his opinion that the system is 
"virtually useless" with "limited communications capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 We could have explained Milstar's criticality to providing secure, mobile, 
jam-proof, detection-proof communications to tomorrow's battlefield soldiers, 
sailors, airmen and Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Milstar a "$70-million sandbox" and saying that voices using the 
system sound "like Donald Duck" are amusing and entertaining in peacetime, and 
they make for fun reading and catchy headlines. But I guarantee you there is 
nothing amusing or entertaining about our sons and daughters being placed in 
the line of fire without secure communications next time they're sent into 
harm's way.

<P>
 As a former Defense Department official involved in military space systems, I 
was surprised and disturbed to read your Dec. 22 article about the U.S. sending 
a ton of sand into space aboard a Milstar communications satellite. While our 
Air Force space champions in El Segundo have crafted some inventive solutions 
to problems posed in nearly three decades of operating military satellites, 
this idea defies all logic and raises serious questions about the management of 
the program, its operational utility and future. 
</P>
<P>
 On its own merit, Milstar is an ingenious system fashioned to provide 
fail-safe communications between our nuclear-capable forces and the President 
and other decision-makers in Washington during a crisis or nuclear exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea held merit in the late '70s when Milstar was born of necessity. Our 
war-fighting communications satellites were then and still are vulnerable to a 
host of threats, ranging from jamming to eavesdropping to all-out failure by a 
determined Russian attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Milstar made sense during the Reagan Administration given these threats, and 
the Pentagon wisely pushed for its development knowing it would pose a major 
engineering challenge and cost billions of dollars to complete and field. 
</P>
<P>
 However, over the last 10 years, Milstar has been plagued by huge cost 
overruns, technical setbacks and myriad engineering changes to include a design 
shift when it was decided to remove Milstar from the shuttle launch lineup to 
the more reliable Titan launch vehicle. The first satellite was to have been 
launched several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally designed to provide multiple capabilities to include relay of 
high-classified intelligence data between reconnaissance satellites and ground 
stations, it now seems that electronic kit may have been removed from the 
satellite, which has a total weight of 5,000 pounds. A one-ton loss can only be 
categorized as major. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it takes years to fit a replacement system on a satellite so complex 
as Milstar, it seems the only reasonable solution was to add sand as ballast 
and pray that no one, including the general public, would be the wiser. 
</P>
<P>
 The race by program officials to get the first Milstar system in operation and 
to prove its value is no excuse from saving an engineering and financial 
disaster from the budget-cutting knife. The Air Force's proposal gives new 
meaning to the word sandbagging . 
</P>
<P>
 While I have long been an advocate of military space systems, it makes no 
sense in this post-Cold War era to spend billions of dollars on a space system 
that is so problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is our national policy to solely preserve jobs and the defense 
industrial base, then perhaps creation of systems such as Milstar, the B-2 
bomber and similar strategic programs should be preserved. Providing for the 
nation's security is Job One for the federal government, but subsidizing secret 
projects for the sake of saving face is shameful.

<TEXT>
<P>
 What kind of film attracts an audience, frequently the same crowd over and 
over, that seeks refuge in a movie theater in the middle of the night? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rocky Horror Show" has had cult status for years. "Eraserhead" has a 
loyal following. And for the past six months, "Reservoir Dogs," Quentin 
Tarantino's first directing effort, has been playing midnight Saturdays at the 
New Beverly Cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing we've had recently that's done better," theater owner Sherman 
Torgan says, "is the Three Stooges." 
</P>
<P>
 The 40 customers who come out on a recent night when aftershocks are still 
making the city nervous are predominantly men in their 20s. Most say they've 
seen the violent heist film on video. One explains it "deserves the respect" of 
being watched on a big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of four friends say they've come because they got tired of driving 
around looking for something to do. Another customer says "Dogs" has been "one 
of those films that's been nagging at me." Now he has to see it in a theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a cultist," says Michael Aushemker, 24. "I don't dress up. I don't 
throw rice at the screen. But once in a while, if a movie hits me, midnight is 
a nice time to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The theater they've come to is pretty much L.A.'s last revival house. Or 
"continuous repertory programming," as the management calls the schedule of 
old, classic and cult films. A decade ago, there were eight full-time theaters 
showing a similar film mix. "I lived in those theaters," film critic Andy Klein 
says. "Video and cable killed them all off." 
</P>
<P>
 The New Beverly was a porn theater before Torgan took it over in the late 
'70s. Although it's seen better days, it's still clean and functional. A local 
critic once wrote that the New Beverly "revels in its own funk." As Torgan 
describes it, his place is "a little rough around the edges, but we don't have 
any Milk Duds stuck to the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, the theater's well-worn feeling goes over well at midnight. It gives 
the experience a warmth that a mall multiplex screening room could never 
impart. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino says he had always hoped to make a film that would play at midnight. 
Now that "Dogs" is doing just that, he occasionally drives out of his way 
simply to revel in seeing the title up on the marquee. "The fact that people 
have responded that way to 'Dogs' is the greatest compliment of all," he says. 
"This is better than getting an Oscar." 
</P>
<P>
 But even though the New Beverly might be a great place for a midnight show and 
"Reservoir Dogs" is going strong, there's always the chance that as a midnight 
show it could be topped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear there's a midnight 'Saturday Night Fever' somewhere in town," says 
Peter Underwood, 24, a student at Long Beach City College, "and the doorman 
actually owns the suit John Travolta wears." 
</P>

 It was after last week's industry screening of "I'll Do Anything," the one 
that got jogged by a 4.4 aftershock, that we spoke to a screenwriter who said 
he felt he'd "finally had the ultimate L.A. experience."  
</P>
<P>
 "I watched a movie about the film business with a Hollywood crowd while 
getting hit by an earthquake," he said."I feel like now I can move back to New 
Jersey."

 The Skinny on Tattoos: We do not have a tattoo, but if we were thinking of 
going for it, we'd start our research at Melrose News, where the sheer variety 
of tattoo magazines caught our eye. 
</P>
<P>
 On display were Skin Art, Tattoo, International Tattoo Art, Tattoo World, 
Tattoos for Women, Tattoos for Men, Tattoo Ink, Tattoo Flash, Savage, Tattoo 
Expo, Outlaw Biker Tattoo, Skin & Ink, and Sex, Tattoos & Rock 'n' Roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the variety, the stand's owner, Ralph Davila, who prides himself on 
carrying every possible tattoo-related title, thinks the body art phenomena has 
peaked and "the magazines are just catching up." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone already has a tattoo now," he said. "This summer will tell the tale. 
What's better than going back to school with a tattoo? It's the equivalent of 
new clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Truth in Advertising?: Perhaps it's because we've never heard a menu item 
explained so succinctly that the comment by the waiter at Delmonico's stands 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 He was describing to a customer worried about cholesterol what goes into 
risotto. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiter started by saying the Italian dish contained cream and Parmesan 
cheese, then finished by saying, "Listen, it's basically a heart attack wrapped 
around rice."

 I'm writing in regard to the article "It's Hotter Than Ever . . . Hell" (Jan.

 I believe in an absolute right and an absolute wrong, along with punishment 
that is also absolute. Hell doesn't go away when people stop believing in it.

 It is a reality. A reality that should change the way people live, every day, 
not just when it's popular.

A LITTLE SOUP TO CALM THE NERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robin Abcarian's piece about her visit to her grandmother in the Armenian 
Ararat Home in Mission Hills reminds me of my own grandmother in Erzerum, 
Armenia.("Taking Disaster Down to Basics: Helping Grandma," Jan. 19).  
</P>
<P>
 Abcarian says: "They are, after all, Armenians. Armenians are used to 
hardship. An earthquake was not going to devastate this group."  
</P>
<P>
 In my grandmother's case, when there were earthquakes, she would round up her 
kin, lead them outdoors, counsel them and then tread back to her own home, 
where she would prepare vosp abour, a hearty lentil soup, for the group 
scattered outside. Her talents in leadership and cooking did wonders for their 
morale.

CLASSICAL INSTRUCTION FOR GUITAR LOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was interesting reading your recent article "Creating the Sound of Music" 
(Jan. 13).I hope that many parents will be guided in the right direction toward 
quality music lessons for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was a bit disappointed that you failed to mention that it is possible 
for a child to study music with classical guitar instruction.  
</P>
<P>
 Lots of children relate to the guitar. Very few parents realize that serious 
music instruction is possible on the guitar. As a classical guitar teacher of 
many years experience, I know that success on the classical guitar is most 
enjoyable, from the ages of 4 to adults.

BASE CIRCUMCISION DECISION ON WHAT'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her article "Second -- Even Third -- Thoughts on Circumcision," (Jan. 16), 
Robin Abcarian describes how R. Wayne Griffiths, founder of RECAP -- one of a 
network of anti-circumcision groups -- claims his sex life greatly improved 
after stretching his foreskin. 
</P>
<P>
 As a urologist, it's easy to argue, not with Griffiths' personal feelings, but 
with the implication that circumcision affects sexual performance.During the 
past 25 years, neither I nor my associates have ever seen one person complain 
of diminished sexual capacity as a result of being circumcised. 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, many uncircumcised men presented themselves with sexual 
problems due to acute and chronic recurring infections, scarring of the tip of 
the foreskin, and adhesions between the foreskin and the head of the penis that 
tore with intercourse. Many required surgical repair, with excellent results if 
the scarring was not too far advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no serious medical data that proves circumcision causes sexual 
dysfunction. Do you really think that 70% of American males are walking around 
chafed, uncomfortable and sexually diminished? If this were true, there would 
be no need for anti-circumcision groups. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not advocate that every male must be circumcised. Parents have a right to 
do what they think is best for their children based on valid information. 
</P>
<P>
 False threats of sexual dysfunction and emotionally charged arguments hardly 
qualify as valid reasons to deter you from doing what is best for your son or 
giving up your beliefs.

WESTSIDE WATCH: BEVERLY HILLS' THIRST FOR AUTONOMY SAVES THE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike many of their Los Angeles neighbors, Beverly Hills residents didn't 
have to boil water after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 They ought to raise a glass of the stuff to Douglas Fairbanks and Mary 
Pickford. In the spring of 1923, Fairbanks and Pickford were among a small 
group of movie luminaries who fought the proposed annexation of Beverly Hills 
by Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was water. 
</P>
<P>
 As many top stars moved to Beverly Hills in the early 1920s, the city 
experienced a growth spurt -- and private water wells then serving the city 
could not keep up with demand. The owner of the wells was anxious to turn the 
problem over to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the city's real estate agents supported annexation, fearing the area 
might otherwise stagnate. A petition drive put the matter up for a public vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-annexation campaign used a precursor of today's direct mail attacks by 
leaving milk bottles filled with foul-smelling sulfur-laden water at every 
doorstep, labeled: "This is a sample of the water which the Trustees of the 
City of Beverly Hills propose for our city. Drink sparingly, as it has laxative 
qualities." 
</P>
<P>
 But the anti-annexation campaign responded with celebrity power. Douglas 
Fairbanks, Harold Lloyd, Tom Mix, Conrad Nagle, Mary Pickford, Will Rogers and 
Rudolph Valentino -- all Beverly Hills residents -- made their way through city 
streets exchanging autographed glossy photos for pledges of "no" votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The annexation proposal lost by a vote of 507-337, and Beverly Hills set up 
its own water system. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash-forward 70 years: Beverly Hills, though now a customer of the 
Metropolitan Water District, remains free of Los Angeles' water system. That's 
the one that failed in the quake -- and made water-boiling a must for many 
Westsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HELL FREEZES OVER: Even Santa Monica's come-hell-or-high-water parking ticket 
operation collapsed in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Because some private and commercial parking garages have been closed off 
because of safety concerns, the city that loves to catch you with the red flag 
flying did not issue parking tickets all week. 
</P>
<P>
 The reprieve could continue for a day or a month, but Santa Monica Police Sgt. 
Gary Gallinot promised to let the public know when the Parking Monster returns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HOMELESS HOMELESS SHELTER: The plight of the homeless is bad enough. Now, an 
entire homeless housing complex is homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, small surprise, was the earthquake. The temblor cracked a Santa 
Monica church that housed the Turning Point transitional shelter, operated by 
the Ocean Park Community Center. Residents of the shelter have been staying 
temporarily at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. But checkout time was 
scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian Rothstein, Ocean Park's director, is frantically looking for new 
temporary quarters for the shelter, which is slated to get a new building 
within the next eight to 12 months. If you have any ideas, call the Ocean Park 
Community Center at (310) 399-9232 or (310) 453-6739. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 COMMUTER MARKET: With the Santa Monica Freeway severed, Beverly Hills City 
Manager Mark Scott promised Tuesday that the city would help ease traffic 
snarls for commuters using local thoroughfares on their way to and from 
Downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Scott's local business (and tax revenue?) instincts got the better of 
him. He couldn't help adding: "And we hope they'll stop and shop."

TERM LIMITS LEAVE FIELD WIDE OPEN 
</P>

<P>
 It's open political season on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's surprise decision by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) 
not to seek reelection ensures there will be three wide-open Westside state 
legislative races this year. Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), a 
political buddy of Friedman's, is also stepping down. And so, too, is 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), who has decided to run for secretary 
of state. 
</P>
<P>
 The explanation for this unusual exodus: term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It changed the face of California politics," said political consultant Parke 
Skelton, who has been hired by Abbe Land, a West Hollywood councilwoman 
interested in running for Margolin's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin, like Moore, is expected to run for statewide office, in his case 
insurance commissioner. Friedman is hanging up the political gloves to run for 
election to the Los Angeles Superior Court bench. Because of term limits, all 
three legislators faced retirement in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The other thing the trio of state legislators share is their allegiance to the 
powerful Democratic Westside political organization headed by Reps. Henry 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and Howard Berman (D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
 Skelton said this year's elections will demonstrate whether the Berman-Waxman 
machine still packs a wallop.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the heart of what's left of the Berman-Waxman operation," Skelton said. 
"It's really a battle to determine whether the operation is still a force on 
the Westside. The days when they could handpick a successor are, I think, 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 All three districts favor Democrats, so the action will be in the June 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friedman's 41st Assembly District, which stretches from Santa Monica to 
Agoura Hills, Democrats have a 49% to 36.6% registration edge over Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin's 42nd Assembly District to the east of Santa Monica is even better 
for Democrats, with a 59% to 29% spread between the two major parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's 47th Assembly District, south of Margolin's, has, because of 
court-ordered reapportionment, an even wider margin of 75% of registered voters 
in the Democratic column versus 14% for Republicans. Though it's early in the 
season, hopefuls are lining up for all three seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Friedman's announcement, attorney William Rothbard, a friend who 
is a member of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy board, was calling around 
seeking endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said to be eyeing the seat are attorney Sheila Kuehl and former Santa 
Monica mayors Dennis Zane and Christine Reed. Reed is a moderate Republican who 
lost to Friedman in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The word on Margolin's retirement has been out for some time, and there are a 
slew of contenders lining up to replace him. Land is one of several West 
Hollywood politicos who are interested. Her fellow council member Paul Koretz, 
attorney John Duran and Los Angeles Community College board member Wally Knox 
are among them. Another well-known contender is Los Angeles school board member 
Mark Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's departure has also brought out a long list of would-be legislators, 
her sister-in-law Dorothy Jackson among them. Others include attorney Jeffrey 
Gibbs, Valerie Shaw, who used to work for Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth 
Galanter, and Ed Johnson, who used to work for Rep. Julian Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 These are by no means complete lists. The political season has just begun.

BRIEFLY: EDUCATION: UCLA NAMES DEAN OF SCIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roberto Peccei, an internationally known theoretical particle physicist, has 
been appointed dean of physical sciences at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Peccei, who had been chair of UCLA's physics department since 1989, said this 
week that his goal is to gain first-tier status for UCLA's physical sciences 
departments -- astronomy, atmospheric sciences, chemistry, earth and space 
sciences, mathematics and physics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can achieve this goal by hiring the best young faculty," Peccei said. 
"Even in these difficult times, the university must continue to renew itself. 
This will not occur at the same rate as in the 1980s, but it must remain our 
goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Peccei's contributions to physics is the Peccei-Quinn Symmetry, which he 
developed with Stanford University colleague Helen Quinn. The theory, according 
to a UCLA statement on Peccei's appointment, "predicts the existence of very 
light particles called axions, which may be the mysterious 'dark matter' that 
makes up 90% of the universe."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; THEY WEREN'T HURT, BUT QUAKE PUT FAMILY IN 
HOSPITAL ANYWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The Northridge earthquake put Poury Grace and her family in the hospital -- 
even though none of them were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grace, along with her two children, ages 13 and 7, and her 65-year-old mother, 
fled their second-floor Santa Monica apartment after the Jan. 17 quake and 
huddled in the cold on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where a fellow nurse at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital found them 
after Grace did not show up for work in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the cracks in the apartment ceiling and other damage, the hospital 
invited Grace, an administrative nurse there since 1987, and her family to stay 
in one of its rooms for as long as they need. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment building was not condemned, meaning Grace, 46, and her family 
may return to their unit. But as of late last week, they remained too unnerved 
to do so and were seeking another home. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Grace said, work is the best therapy. In the week after the quake, 
she admitted 13 victims suffering from heart and respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Anna Mary, director of pastoral care at the nonprofit hospital run by 
Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, said the invitation accorded Grace would 
be offered any of its 700 employees displaced by the quake. A room comparable 
to Grace's would cost $850 a day, Sister Anna Mary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her colleagues' generosity, Grace said she does not want to wear out 
her welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really want to get . . . on with my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Iran who came to Los Angeles in 1976, Grace is looking for another 
apartment in the Santa Monica area so that her daughter, Salomeh, and son, 
Sina, won't have to change schools. Only as a last resort would she move back 
into the apartment building.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; REVIEW REVEALS CRACKS IN QUAKE RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a public veneer of mastery, all was not well in the early stages of 
Santa Monica's response to the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, officials said the city's 911 system crashed for about three 
hours after the quake. Jory Wolf, city information systems' manager, said the 
last 911 call was logged 20 minutes after the 4:31 a.m. quake. The next one 
came in at 7:41 a.m. Wolf said he is still analyzing what went wrong, although 
it appears to be a combination of lost power and mismatched auxiliary 
generators. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning of the quake, the city's command post moved about as often as the 
ground. It was at a specially equipped trailer, a fire station and, finally, at 
its home in the basement of the old police building, after it was deemed safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the glitches, "The staff sprang into action and acted heroically," 
Councilman Paul Rosenstein said.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Acting City Atty. Joseph Lawrence rushed to City Hall at 5:15 a.m. A 
handwritten declaration of emergency was signed by one official at 6:20 a.m. 
and amended by City Manager John Jalili when he arrived an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a quick response, officials concede it took a while to recognize the 
scope of the disaster. As the week progressed, anxiety built up when a local 
paper printed a list of unsafe buildings. Police called it "a looting map." 
Edgy politicians demanded National Guard troops. When Los Angeles County 
Sheriff Sherman Block, who is regional disaster czar, did not respond fast 
enough, Mayor Judy Abdo tried an end run by calling a county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Though that backfired, Block did dispatch some deputies to town. That did not 
mollify Councilman Kelly Olsen, who complained he had seen quake-emptied 
apartment buildings with no security on his middle-of-the-night rounds. And he 
said he had the videotape to prove it.

EXPERTS BELIEVE THE GEOLOGICAL DECK MAY HAVE BEEN STACKED AGAINST THE WESTSIDE 
DURING THE QUAKE. COUPLED WITH OUTDATED ARCHITECTURE, SOME BUILDINGS DIDN'T 
STAND A CHANCE.; UNDERLYING CAUSES 
</P>

<P>
 Two weeks after the Northridge earthquake, nobody knows for sure why 
structural damage was highly concentrated in parts of Santa Monica, Hollywood 
and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists, engineers and city officials cite a list of possible causes 
that can be summed up by a variation on the old real estate mantra: location, 
location, location. And, construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * Located 12 to 15 miles south of Northridge, the Westside areas are as close 
as anywhere in the Los Angeles Basin to the epicenter of the quake, which 
whipped through the ground in a north-south direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Westside communities are perched atop relatively thin, weakly compacted 
layers of sand and gravel at the junction of flatlands and the hills above 
Santa Monica and Hollywood, a zone more susceptible than most to geological 
trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 * They are crossed by the Santa Monica and Hollywood faults, linked to a 
system that stretches west to Malibu. These faults did not move during the 
recent quake, but they may have focused some of the energy from the Northridge 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many of the area's 30- to 40-year-old apartment buildings sit atop posts 
that rise from wide-open, ground-floor garages that offer little earthquake 
resistance. And a number of buildings dating from the early years of the 
century are made of unreinforced brick. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspect in the jolting -- the Santa Monica Fault -- was recently remapped 
by Caltech scientists, who traced its tracks from the green swards of the Los 
Angeles Country Club to the beach at Potrero Canyon. One dramatic clue is the 
steep slope topped by the Los Angeles Mormon Temple in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 With traces no more than 100 feet wide at its eastern end, the fault generally 
follows Santa Monica Boulevard until the city boundary, then widens to 900 feet 
across as it angles northwest, according to a study by James F. Dolan and K.E. 
Sieh. 
</P>
<P>
 They classified it as an active fault, based on signs of movement within the 
last 11,000 years. Earlier studies, which described a set of parallel north and 
south branches bracketing the path suggested by the Caltech geologists, said 
the fault was no more than potentially active. 
</P>
<P>
 One of three underground formations that could threaten Santa Monica and 
surrounding areas, it is the only one that actually lies within city limits, 
underlying commercial streets and residential neighborhoods alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the city was built by the time they knew they had a fault," said 
Eldon M. Gath, a geologist who prepared a seismic safety update for the city in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fault does move, it could wreak havoc with emergency evacuation routes, 
sever gas and water mains and threaten police, fire and medical care 
facilities, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing we stressed big-time (in the seismic update) was public education," 
Gath said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that official adoption of a fault hazard zone could pose economic 
problems for property owners when they seek to sell or refinance their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, "Let's get people aware that they're living in a hazardous 
zone, and let them be attuned to reinforcing older houses and apartment 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the seismic report's conclusions were included in a master 
environmental assessment released by the city in September, the call for a 
public information campaign was not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still under review," said Kate Vernez, a spokeswoman for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Fault might have played a similar role in focusing the 
earthquake's energy toward the surface in Hollywood, geologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Thomas L. Henyey, executive director of the Southern California 
Earthquake Center, the geology between the earthquake's epicenter and the 
damaged areas of Santa Monica and Hollywood was another likely factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're on the edge of a basin . . . a lot of damage is often on the 
periphery," he said. "Transitional zones between basins and mountains are often 
areas where (seismic) waves are amplified." 
</P>
<P>
 Liquefaction -- a phenomenon in which seismic forces mix soil and water into 
an unstable soup -- was probably not to blame for the damage in Santa Monica or 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 But the phenomenon was almost certainly to blame for the collapse of the 
freeway bridge across La Cienega Boulevard, Henyey said, noting that the 
street's very name means " the swam " in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground under the damage zones is largely made up of sand and gravel 
deposited by ancient rivers, according to Caltech's Dolan, whose findings on 
the Santa Monica Fault were published in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar deposits underlie the area where a medical building crumpled at 
Olympic Boulevard and Barrington Avenue, and parts of Hollywood, where the 
earthquake left 6,000 homeless and 257 buildings severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Washed down from the Santa Monica Mountains and the Hollywood Hills, these 
so-called alluvial deposits form fan shapes that are thinner at the base of the 
hills. Given a good dose of seismic energy, they can transmit earthquake waves 
to the surface with disquieting speed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to readings from a sensor at Santa Monica City Hall, the Jan. 17 
earthquake peaked with a horizontal jolt that amounted to 93% of the force of 
gravity. Hollywood reported 41%, while nearby Century City registered no more 
than 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as good as rock but not as bad as swamp," Dolan said of the lightly 
compacted alluvial deposits that are common to the Hollywood and Santa Monica 
quake-damage zones. "We don't know a lot about why damage is localized. This is 
going to be a very, very educational earthquake for us in those terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Also cited as a likely cause of damage in northwest Santa Monica, experts say, 
was the type of construction used in buildings, in many cases post-supported 
apartment houses dating from the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that those buildings -- we refer to them as dingbats -- took 
the vertical load very well, but they were not necessarily braced for the 
horizontal load," said Joseph V. Pica, a Fairfax district architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Such buildings fell out of favor after the 1971 Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't get regulated out of existence, but they became economically 
unfeasible as a result of earthquakes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-hit portion of Santa Monica also has a significant number of masonry 
buildings, held together by deteriorating sand-and-lime mortar and weakened by 
earlier quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten thousand years of experience with brick buildings shows they don't do 
well in earthquakes," said Dolan, the Caltech geologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Santa Monica once counted 224 potentially dangerous masonry 
buildings, only 94 remain to be retrofitted for earthquake safety, said William 
D. Rome, building officer for the city of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one was hurt by falling bricks, that was only because of the quake's 
early morning hour, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reinforcing doesn't stop buildings from being damaged, that's a false image 
most of the public has," said Russell Barnard, a Main Street property owner and 
Building and Safety Commission member who was active in the 12-year debate over 
seismic fixing. "The difference is, the pieces that fall off are not such huge 
chunks." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most heavily damaged brick structures was an old hotel, now used 
for retail space and offices, at 1337 3rd St. Splits run up the front and huge 
holes let sunshine pour through the crooked side and back walls of the 
building, whose owners did not get around to retrofitting before Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Leasing agent Arist P. Niciforos, a member of the family that has owned the 
building since 1985, said it was due for retrofitting by October of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Located as it is in a prime location on the 3rd Street Promenade, the only 
alternative is to tear it down, Niciforos said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pamela O'Connor, a historic-preservation professional who serves on the 
Planning Commission, said the city should not rush to replace quake-damaged old 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she is especially concerned about the fate of damaged 1920s-era 
apartment buildings north of Wilshire Boulevard, older buildings along the 
Promenade also have historic value, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our immediate concern is that buildings get demolished and people view them 
as an imminent threat to public health and safety," she said. "If these are 
important buildings to Santa Monica, you need to have a second look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 With city officials overwhelmed by the immediate task of post-quake recovery, 
the temblor's consequences for future construction remain unclear. But it is 
likely that anyone looking for real estate these days will have earthquakes in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, every space we look at, we're asking, 'How's that going to support us in 
case of an earthquake?' " said Darren Chuckry, a tenant in Niciforos' building. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A summary of selected Los Angeles City Hall decisions in the past week 
affecting the Westside. CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * BIKE LANES -- Approved the use of $1.28 million in funding from the Los 
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority for several new bike 
lanes.New lanes include the following: Venice Boulevard from Penmar Avenue to 
Naples Avenue; Pershing Drive from Imperial Highway to Manchester Avenue; 
Sepulveda Boulevard from 74th Street to Manchester Avenue. The funds also will 
be used for maintenance of existing bikes paths, such as those at Ballona 
Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 * NEW SIGNAL -- Galanter proposed that a traffic study be conducted to 
determine if a signal light should be installed near the Westchester site of a 
new Los Angeles Police Department academy. The city is in the process of buying 
property at 5651 W. Manchester Blvd. for the new recruit training center, and 
Galanter said a study would help in deciding whether a signal should be 
installed at Manchester and Osage Avenue. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * NARROW STREETS -- Passed an ordinance to exempt the $6-a-month trash 
collection fee for single-family dwellings located on streets too narrow for a 
garbage truck. These homes were being billed even though their trash was not 
being picked up. Passed 14-0. Voting yes: John Ferraro, Marvin Braude, Ruth 
Galanter, Jackie Goldberg, Nate Holden, Mark Ridley-Thomas and Zev Yaroslavsky.

FOR SENIORS; FLYING IS NO. 1 FOR THESE NINETY-NINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The year was 1929. The stock market crashed and women's aviation reached new 
heights. Amelia Earhart called for a meeting of women pilots, and the story 
goes that when she looked around at the 99 aviators who gathered on that second 
day in November she named the group the Ninety-Nines. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, they still call themselves by the same name, even though they have 
6,500 members worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ninety-Nines meet in Santa Monica and Van Nuys, close to the airports that 
house their Cessnas, Beechcraft Bonanzas and Piper Malibus. Officially, they 
still follow the same mission Earhart and her colleagues set out -- to advance 
aviation and support aerospace education. 
</P>
<P>
 Members are a diverse group: housewives, lawyers, teachers. They're retired, 
own businesses, work for others. Some become pilots because of the men in their 
lives. One woman asked for a plane as part of her divorce settlement. But the 
majority just love the adventure that comes with flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Although regular scheduled air carrier pilots must retire at 60, private 
pilots, if they can pass the medical requirements, have no age limit.  
</P>
<P>
 Amy Conner, 76 and is the newest member of the Ninety-Nines' Van Nuys chapter. 
She drives from her mountaintop house in Topanga on the first Monday of every 
month to meet with the other Ninety-Niners for airplane talk and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Conner doesn't scare easily. She was the daughter of an Army cavalry officer 
and was already riding the year before Earhart formed the Ninety-Nines. When 
Conner looked up and saw her first biplane, she thought it would make a 
wonderful way to transport horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in third grade and we were stationed in Arizona and there was some sort 
of revolution going on in Mexico, so the army flew some biplanes to the border. 
One of the planes couldn't take off, so they let us kids sit in it." she said. 
It would be close to 50 years before she became a pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 She married Jack, a military pilot in World War II, the day he got his wings. 
"He took me up flying and showed me all of the bad things like peeling off, 
which made me feel as if I was going through the floor," she said. "My cheeks 
actually moved down to my chin. He deliberately did it to scare me. Well, I was 
perfectly willing to land at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Being on the ground with Jack wasn't uneventful either. "I was married to a 
man who didn't want a dumb-broad wife. We were a team. We worked hard together. 
We built our home with our own hands. So when we bought a plane I figured I 
better take it seriously and learn how to fly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two thousand hours of flying time later, Conner decided after Jack died last 
year to buy her own plane. Her sons think she's too old, but Conner and 
government regulators don't think so. She passed the medical requirements for a 
Class-3 private pilot certification. And then she joined the Ninety-Nines to be 
near people who have lots of energy and love to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent meeting, the Ninety-Nines gave Conner her membership pin and 
awarded 70-seventy-year old Cecelia Heppes a scholarship to further her 
aviation education. Heppes, a Burbank resident, is learning to fly for the 
second time. She's also a member of the Civil Air Patrol, where she serves as a 
scanner and observer for search- and-rescue missions. Next year Heppes, Conner 
and other club members look forward to participating in more Ninety-Nines 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ninety-Nines member Bunny Newman: "The camaraderie of women pilots is 
like nothing else. It's the sheer joy of staying in contact with so many 
different women all sharing the same type of escape -- the sheer joy and 
pleasure of being above it all."

GAS VALVE MAY LESSEN FIRE RISK AFTER QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Once again, Southern Californians are reminded of the seismic threat we live 
with each day, as the region staggers to recover from the blows of the 
strongest earthquake in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest dangers in a quake is fire from ruptured gas lines. 
Appliance feed lines may break in a temblor, and the gas spewing into an 
enclosed space can quickly accumulate to a sufficient concentration to catch 
fire if it reaches an ignition source such as a still-burning pilot light. 
</P>
<P>
 For these reasons, seismic or "quake-activated," gas shut-off valves were 
developed. These devices are mounted into the main gas supply line for a house 
or building and automatically stop the flow of gas before it enters the house 
when substantial earth movement is sensed. 
</P>
<P>
 The valves are in wide use in homes, hospitals, schools, factories and even in 
firehouses. In Japan, another quake-prone part of the world, the valves are 
required by law in all buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than a dozen manufacturers producing valves that have been 
tested and approved by the Office of the State Architect of California. Each 
approved valve must be carefully calibrated to shut off only during a quake 
strong enough to cause pipe damage. (Average 5.5 on the Richter scale.) 
</P>
<P>
 I have installed hundreds of the valves since the 1987 Whittier quake and, in 
spot-checking with some customers, found that the valves apparently functioned 
properly in the Northridge quake, triggering in the 6.6 temblor. Some valves 
had been reset after the first quake and did not trip in the lesser 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuisance tripping is one of the most common concerns about the valves. But 
when the valves are properly installed, that should not be a problem. My valve 
is placed in a location subject to vibration from passing vehicles and has 
never caused a nuisance trip. 
</P>
<P>
 A few questions are commonly asked about the valves, such as, "How long will 
it take to get the gas back on if the valve trips?" "Is the valve easy to 
reset?" and "Why have one if my neighbors do not; won't my house burn anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
 If the valve trips due to an earthquake, your house must be inspected by a gas 
company representative or a licensed plumber to assure that there is no pipe 
damage before the valve is reset. 
</P>
<P>
 True, it could take days or weeks after a large quake to get help, but most 
homeowners who have them agree that the large reduction in the risk of fire the 
valves afford makes the inconvenience after a quake inconsequential. 
</P>
<P>
 All the valves on the market can be easily reset by the homeowner should they 
trigger accidentally (which is a highly unlikely event when properly 
installed). Some designs require only a screwdriver for resetting and some need 
a special tool that comes with the new valve.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the question of "Why have one if neighbors do not," representatives 
of several valve manufacturers respond: "While it may be true that you could 
still lose your house to fire after a large earthquake, at least you have 
dramatically increased the odds of getting yourself and your family out of the 
house safely, as the gas explosion will not occur in your home." 
</P>
<P>
 The typical cost of a quake valve, with installation, is $350 to $600, 
depending on the size of the gas pipe on which it is installed. However, it is 
a one-time investment that requires no maintenance and is designed to last 25 
to 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake gas valves are normally installed by licensed plumbing contractors, 
not the gas company. Check with your plumber about experience and 
recommendations regarding the make of valve he or she prefers. Make sure that 
the valve selected is one of the more popular makes and carries State Architect 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Some communities require building permits before the valve can be installed, 
so check with your local building and safety department before proceeding.

APARTMENT LIFE: CAN LEASE BE BROKEN FOR QUAKE DAMAGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA), 
an apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: The apartment building I own in Northridge was only slightly damaged 
by the earthquake. The damage appears to merely be cracked and fallen plaster 
and the like. Of course, I'll have the damage repaired, but I have a more 
serious problem than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of my renters are saying that they believe the building is uninhabitable 
because of the quake. They want to break their leases. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I think the building is fine, but how do I prove that to the tenants, 
or can they break their leases? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: You are not obliged to prove to the tenants that the building is 
habitable, and they cannot break their leases because of problems like those 
you describe. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the building, or a particular unit, has been condemned by the Los 
Angeles Department of Building and Safety, Los Angeles County Health Department 
or Fire Department or similar agency, it is likely habitable and the leases 
remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 You should attempt to repair the damaged plaster as soon as possible and 
certainly within 30 days. Guide for Refunding Rents and Deposits 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My Reseda apartment building was virtually demolished by the earthquake. My 
renters want their security deposits and rents refunded immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand that I must refund their security deposits within three weeks 
under state law. Does this disaster change that time frame? Also, must I refund 
the balance of January rents or may I keep them? 
</P>
<P>
 A: While the disaster doesn't change the maximum time frame for refunding 
rents and deposits, the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA) 
recommends that all owners in your situation refund whatever money their 
renters are owed as soon as they can to facilitate the tenants rehousing. 
</P>
<P>
 While state law does not require it, AAGLA recommends that any owners who can 
do so refund prorated rents, those beyond the time the property became 
uninhabitable. Any deposit money left after legitimate deductions from them 
must be refunded under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, if your historical records indicate that a tenant's rent was 
late three times, and you charge deposits a $20 late fee per incidence, you 
could logically deduct $60 from the deposit before refunding it. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, let's say a renter admitted he broke a window two months ago and 
you had it fixed at a cost of $70, which the renter never reimbursed you. That 
$70 would also be a legitimate deduction from the deposit. How Quake Victims 
Can Find Apartments 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My West Los Angeles apartment has been condemned because of the recent 
earthquake. Now, obviously, I need an apartment. Is there a list anywhere of 
available housing for those displaced by this disaster? 
</P>
<P>
 A: AAGLA is helping find new housing for renters displaced by the quake. AAGLA 
has available to the public a list of property management companies across Los 
Angeles County with available apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Those needing assistance may call AAGLA's main office for information at (213) 
384-4131, or they may visit any of AAGLA's three regional offices located at: 
Main Office, 621 S. Westmoreland Ave., Los Angeles; 12012 Wilshire Blvd., West 
Los Angeles, or 17707 Crenshaw Blvd, No. 210, Torrance. Must Landlord Pay 
Interim Expenses? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The Chatsworth apartment in which I lived has been condemned by the city 
because of the quake. It cannot be fixed so I'm looking for another apartment. 
In the meantime, I have been staying at a hotel and, of course, have been 
eating all my meals at restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Is my former landlord responsible to pay for my interim housing and meals? 
Does he have any responsibility to relocate me? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because the quake is legally considered "an act of God" (like a flood, 
tornado or hurricane), the landlord is probably not liable to your for food, 
housing or relocation expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, a landlord was in some way negligent in the wake of the 
quake, he may be liable. If, for instance, a landlord was required by the city 
to make a building seismically safe, and he didn't do so, he may be liable for 
some or all of those expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the case, and your damages don't exceed $5,000, you may sue the 
former landlord in Small Claims Court for damages, but you'll need evidence of 
the landlord's transgression from the city for the court. Should Landlord Close 
Up Broken Windows? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My North Hollywood apartment building was destroyed by the quake. The 
tenants are moving their belongings out of the property, but I'm wondering 
about all of the broken windows. Should I board them up? The building will be 
demolished anyway. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that an ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure. Beside the 
security of your renters' possessions, there is their safety to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 If one of them is injured by falling glass while moving his belongings, you 
may very well be liable for his injuries because you had knowledge of a 
dangerous condition at your property and did nothing to correct it. For both of 
the above reasons, security and safety, if I were you, I would board it up as 
soon as possible.

CONDO Q&A: WHAT DOES EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE COVER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Hickenbottom is a past president of 
the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), 
a national nonprofit research and educational organization. She welcomes 
readers' questions, but cannot answer them individually. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: Our condominium association does not have earthquake insurance. 
Since the Northridge quake, the board of directors has received many calls from 
our unit owners asking why we don't have coverage. Some people are demanding 
that the association obtain coverage. We need answers to several questions. 
What does an earthquake insurance policy cover? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The earthquake insurance policy covers the structure of the building 
or buildings, common areas including equipment and contents owned by the 
association. The association's policy would not cover the interior portion of 
the individual units or the furniture and personal belongings inside the units. 
Is Board Liable When Units Aren't Insured? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some owners feel that the board members have an obligation to obtain 
earthquake insurance for the association. Must the board do so? Is the board 
liable if they don't vote to obtain the coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some associations have wording in their legal documents that requires that 
the association have earthquake insurance. However, most declarations of 
covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs) leave this decision to the 
association's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The board members should consider their personal liability for this important 
decision. I know of many associations that have had major controversies about 
whether or not earthquake insurance was advisable. Some boards of directors 
feel that the responsibility for this decision should be shared by all of the 
owners, so they survey all of the owners or call a special meeting to let every 
owner vote on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance broker Bob Little of Robert W. Little Agency Inc., offers the 
following advice: 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Directors and Officers 'errors and omissions' policies contain an 
exclusion for any 'act, error or omission' that a board member might make in 
procuring the right forms and kinds of insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if the board is sued for negligence because they didn't obtain 
the insurance, the directors and officers liability policy might not have to 
defend the suit or pay any court costs. The board might be personally liable. 
</P>
<P>
 Little advises the board of directors to limit their liability by conducting a 
vote of all of the owners. He states, "We encourage the board to prepare a 
mailing for each unit owner explaining the insurance coverage and the effect, 
if any, the addition of the earthquake coverage will have on the monthly 
assessment that each owner pays. The mailing should include a written ballot. 
If the majority of the owners do not want the coverage, place the written 
ballots in a safe place so that the board will have evidence to support their 
decision." Can Individuals Buy Insurance Coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If the association does not obtain earthquake coverage, can an individual 
owner purchase an earthquake insurance policy that would cover structural 
damage? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't believe that you can purchase coverage for something that you do 
not own. Since the structure of the building is owned by the association, each 
individual owns just a percentage of the structure, and an individual would 
probably not be able to purchase a policy. Is Deductible on Loss or Replacement 
Cost? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The association received bids from various insurance companies and they all 
had deductibles of 10%. Does that mean that the association would have to pay 
$5,000 of a $50,000 loss? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, the deductible does not apply to the amount of the loss. The deductible 
would be 10% of the total replacement cost of the structure or the total policy 
limits. If the building is a $10,000,000 structure, the loss would have to be 
greater than $1,000,000 in order to file a claim. For example, if the 
association filed a claim for $1,200,000 worth of damages, the association 
would have to pay $1,000,000 and the insurance company would pay $200,000. How 
Does Association Pay for Deductible? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would the association be able to pay the deductible? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The association would have to use reserve funds or, if reserve funds were 
inadequate, the owners would have to pay a special assessment. Let's say the 
condominium association has 100 units. Each owner would have to pay a special 
assessment of $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 There is protection that an individual owner can obtain that will help to pay 
a special assessment in these circumstances. The individual owner can obtain 
earthquake coverage for their personal property and the unit's contents. In 
addition, some insurance carriers offer "earthquake loss assessment coverage," 
which will protect the unit owner when the association must levy a special 
assessment to cover the cost of the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual owner may be able to obtain "earthquake loss of use coverage" 
to cover the cost of temporary relocation if the unit is uninhabitable. Some 
policies will cover hotel costs and other expenses if the owner has to leave 
the unit until repairs can be completed. Does Owner With No Damage Have to Pay? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will I have to help pay for repairs even if my unit is not damaged in the 
earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, you own a share or a percentage of the entire property and you must 
share in the cost of the repairs so that everyone's investment is protected. 
What If Owner Can't Afford Assessment? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What if an owner is unable to pay a large special assessment? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If an owner is delinquent in paying a regular monthly assessment, a special 
assessement or an emergency assessment, the association can file a lien and 
take the property through foreclosure. Can Insurance Firms Cover All the 
Claims? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the insurance companies be able to pay all of the claims that will 
result from another disaster? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Each disaster that occurred recently, such as Hurricanes Iniki in Hawaii 
and Andrew in Florida and the fires in California, has had a devastating affect 
on the insurance industry. Several companies have gone out of business. Be sure 
to check the A.M. Best Key Rating Guide to Property-Casualty Carriers to find 
the bidding companies' ratings and their financial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 You can call the California Department of Insurance at (800) 927-4357 to see 
if the companies have a good record for claims processing. I have heard 
complaints from some people who had losses during the Whittier quake. They were 
very disappointed that claims took several months to be processed. What to Ask 
When Obtaining Insurance? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some of the questions we should ask when obtaining earthquake 
insurance bids? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I urge board members and owners to contact several insurance experts when 
considering insurance matters. Ask about the cost of the clean up and disposal 
of debris and other related expenses. Be sure to fully disclose any information 
that you have about the property. For example, if you know that asbestos is 
present, that will cause additional expenses. Find out if coverage includes 
asbestos cleaning and disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, coverage for full replacement cost is preferable because you will 
not have a deduction for depreciation at the time of the loss. Ask about 
co-insurance and get a full explanation of any co-insurance clauses in the 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure that the association obtains an accurate appraisal for the full 
replacement value of the property, not including the land. A market value 
appraisal is not appropriate for insurance purposes. An excellent way to 
minimize the board's liability is to rely on the advice of professionals who 
specialize in community association insurance. In addition to your insurance 
agent, you may want to obtain the services of an independent insurance 
consultant and appraiser.

TRAVEL INSIDER: FREQUENT FLIERS MAY FIND LESS TURBULENCE OVERSEAS; TRENDS: IT'S 
GETTING HARDER TO QUALIFY FOR FREE DOMESTIC FLIGHTS, EASIER TO EARN FOREIGN 
FREEBIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These are trying times for those who live to fly free. 
</P>
<P>
 As airlines around the world create and reshape frequent-flier programs to 
compete on a worldwide level, the frequent-flying life is getting ever more 
complicated for American domestic travelers. But in some respects, it's also 
getting more attractive for those looking to Europe and other overseas 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the best of these developments, says Randy Petersen, Colorado-based 
publisher of Inside Flyer magazine, "You don't have to fly more. What you have 
to do is become a more educated consumer," taking advantage of the mileage 
tie-ins increasingly available through telephone companies, credit cards, 
rental-car companies, hotels and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Dale, Arizona-based publisher of the newsletter Mileage & Points, adds 
this: "For anybody who travels internationally over the next couple of years, 
(these changes) could be a real plus." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few key pieces of the puzzle: 
</P>
<P>
 * Increased mileage requirements for free U.S. flights. Having painted 
themselves into a corner with fare cuts, major carriers are compensating in 
part by raising the number of frequent-flier miles needed to qualify for a free 
flight. Beginning Feb. 1, 1995, United Mileage Plus and American AAdvantage 
program members will need 25,000 miles to get a free domestic coach flight, up 
from 20,000. USAir's threshold, too, rises from 20,000 to 25,000 on Jan. 1 next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these changes, however, concentrate on the bottom end of benefits, for 
the moment leaving requirements for international flights unchanged. (Earlier 
this month, United did announce a mixture of increases and decreases in 
qualifying mileage levels for international travel.)  
</P>
<P>
 Petersen forecasts that the 25,000 figure will become an industry standard. He 
predicts that Northwest will raise its threshhold from 20,000 to 25,000, too -- 
and that Delta will come down to 25,000 from its current 30,000 level. 
(Northwest will say only that it is considering "significant changes" in its 
program in response to "economic realities.") 
</P>
<P>
 As Petersen suggests, alert travelers can neutralize the hike by more 
efficiently gathering miles from various sources. But some sources could dry 
up. Many hotel chains have updated programs so that travelers must choose 
either frequent-flier mileage or frequent-guest points for each stay -- but not 
both. (The prominent exception is Hilton's HHonors program, which still allows 
"double-dipping.") 
</P>
<P>
 * Less credit for short trips. On April 1, Northwest's WorldPerks program will 
reduce the minimum mileage credit it offers per flight from 750 miles to 500. 
Thus, a traveler on the 431-mile Northwest route from Dallas to Memphis, will 
get credit for 500 miles, instead of the current 750. American, United and 
Continental Airlines made the same move about five years ago. (Throughout 1994, 
however, Northwest will add 500 bonus miles to the account of anyone connecting 
through Minneapolis, Detroit or Memphis.) Delta continues to award a minimum of 
1,000 miles for each flight, but Petersen and others suggest that will not 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alliances between U.S.-based and foreign-based carriers. "The real growth 
(of frequent-flier programs) is going to be in the international markets," says 
Dale. Throughout Europe, Dale points out, carriers are "starting to come into 
things. . . . At least in the short term, that's going to benefit U.S. frequent 
fliers because of the competition that's going to surface." 
</P>
<P>
 International cooperative pacts between airlines -- agreements that generally 
allow mileage earned on one airline to be applied toward a flight on another -- 
have been multiplying. American Airlines' AAdvantage program now includes 
alliances with Canadian Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Qantas, Singapore and TWA. 
Northwest's WorldPerks program includes a partnership with KLM. USAir and 
British Airways, which have had limited reciprocal arrangements for passengers 
to "earn and burn" mileage points for several years, took a further step by 
lifting many restrictions last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, United Airlines, which has played an elaborate game of musical 
partners in recent years (now affiliated with Air Canada, Alitalia, Ansett 
Australia and Sabena, but disconnected from KLM and Swissair as of December), 
last month announced an imminent alliance with Lufthansa, bringing together two 
giants and a massive route system. Under the reciprocal plans, there will be 
some differences between mileage accrual and redemption possibilities between 
the airlines.

POOLSIDE IN PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I hear America sloshing. 
</P>
<P>
 I smell chlorine and Coppertone. I see two-pieces, one-pieces, water wings, 
Ray Bans, loungers, lapsters, tanners, towel monitors, drinkers, smokers, 
fitness fiends, New Yorkers, Midwesterners and Nebraskans. I feel slick tile 
underfoot, ultraviolet rays on the brow, a stiff dry breeze raking across the 
date palms and luxury hotels of the Coachella Valley. Above rise the jagged San 
Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains, their ridges so sharply defined that they 
look like a cardboard-cutout facsimile of a skyline. Now a murderous woman's 
voice wafts across the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get out of my sun," demands the voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 It is peak season in America's swimming pool capital, where the winter sky 
hangs cloudless and spa water bubbles naturally from the earth. I am here, 
poolside, to see exactly what we've come to, poolwise, since that fateful day 
when the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians put up the first commercial 
bathhouse at a natural spring here 123 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In one very narrow sense, nothing has changed: At essentially the same site 
chosen by the Agua Caliente entrepreneurs in 1871, where Indian Canyon Drive 
and Tahquitz Canyon Way now meet in downtown Palm Springs, the pink bulk of the 
Spa Hotel Resort & Mineral Springs looms five stories high against the sky. The 
owners of the Spa Hotel? The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, who bought 
the 30-year-old lodging and spa in 1992, hired a management company and, since 
reopening on Dec. 15, have once again been touting the restorative powers of a 
dip in mineral springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, more or less everything has changed. Just in the municipality of 
Palm Springs, city planners this month counted 8,427 swimming pools, scores of 
them attached to hotels. That's roughly one pool for every five city residents, 
which the local movers and shakers assert is the highest pool-per-capita ratio 
in the country. The numbers are no doubt comparable, however, in the 
neighboring resort cities of Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, Indian Wells, La 
Quinta, Desert Hot Springs and Cathedral City. 
</P>
<P>
 And the pools are clearly getting used. When the Palm Springs convention 
bureau commissioned a study in 1989 to find out exactly what people do on their 
vacations in the area, only 21% of those surveyed named golf and just 10% named 
tennis. About 66% named swimming and tanning a figure surpassed only by the 75% 
who went shopping. Probably they were buying swimwear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, the quality of the pools here is as good or better than 
anywhere in the country," says Dick Leimkuhler, co-owner of Mirage 
WaterFeatures in Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get outside of this area, they're still using some antiquated 
techniques." 
</P>
<P>
 They don't hold with antiquated techniques here. Most of the major resorts, 
for instance, have in recent years added misting systems, which lower 
summertime poolside temperatures by as much as 10 degrees by forcing water from 
special pipes at pressures of 800-1,000 pounds per square inch. The 21-acre 
Oasis Water Resort in Palm Springs closes for the winter, but from March 
through fall can boast of nine water slides, a 600-foot-long river inner-tube 
ride, and a beach lashed by artificial waves. Over at La Mancha Private Villas 
in Palm Springs, owner Ken Irwin is killing germs in his main pool with a fancy 
new electronic ionization system, which he says was devised under the auspices 
of NASA and may render chlorine obsolete. In another development that may have 
more to do with torts than technology, one may find water slides or steel 
sculptures or shorelines of imported Hawaiian sand at the hotel pools of 
greater Palm Springs, but one finds neither diving boards nor lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 One further result of all this hydro-sophistication is that no shrewdly 
positioned resort can be satisfied merely to possess a pool; it must have a 
pool with a personality that will beckon to some segment of the market: pools 
for grown-ups, pools for kids, epic pools, intimate pools -- or pools with 
historic precedent, such as those of the Spa Hotel, in whose 104-degree bubbles 
my odyssey began. 
</P>
<P>
 In its early days, the first bathhouse in Palm Springs charged 25 cents a dip. 
Sally McManus, director-curator of the Palm Springs Historical Society, reports 
that management then maintained a pair of silty pools -- one for men, one for 
women -- sheltered by unpainted pine boards. 
</P>
<P>
 In its new incarnation, the Spa Hotel boasts of its just-completed $9-million 
renovation, rents out 230 rooms at peak-season "off-the-rack" rates of $125 and 
up, (though introductory discount rates of $94 nightly were available in 
January) and offers spa services to non-guests for $20 and up. I didn't stay 
there; for all its recent improvements, the place still has that built-in-1963 
look to it, and fits awkwardly into a middle category, less luxurious than the 
desert's newer resort hotels, more impersonal and expensive than the many 
inviting small hotels nearby. (I stayed happily at one of those smaller hotels, 
the Casa Cody Country Inn, which in proper Palm Springs style had not one but 
two residential-size pools serving its 17 units.) 
</P>
<P>
 But I did sign up for the Spa Hotel spa, which was busier than the hotel and 
entirely silt-free. The best deal seemed to be the $30 back massage: half an 
hour of pummeling, along with daylong access to the big hotel pool, two outdoor 
spring water pools, and most elements of the inside "spa experience." 
</P>
<P>
 First stop, to clear the sinuses and open the pores, was seven minutes in the 
100-degree Eucalyptus Inhalation room, which was not unlike being trapped in a 
burning Sucrets factory. Then a spell in the 150-degree sauna, and another 
spell in a tub for one, being scalded in an agreeable way by a jet stream of 
the hot water that gave this city its name. (Bowing to state law and the limits 
of human endurance, the hotel uses cold water to bring the 106-degree spring 
water down to 104 degrees.) Finally, a top-notch massage. A good deal all the 
way around. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spa Hotel has tenure, but no reasonable discussion of the Coachella 
Valley, swimming pools and history could get far before arriving at the 
entrance to La Quinta Hotel Golf & Tennis Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 It stands in the shadow of the Santa Rosa Mountains, a few miles off 
California 111 and about 20 miles southeast of Palm Springs proper, with the 
rows of cypress trees carefully tied into uniformity along the entrance drive, 
the colorful flower beds, the well-appointed acre after acre of one- and 
two-story tile-roofed casitas. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta opened in 1926, and from the beginning served as a desert hideaway 
for various movie stars and prominent persons. The place feels like a very rich 
village, one with golf and tennis facilities on all sides. There is lots of 
room, and not much in the way of bells and whistles. No one could afford to 
build a new hotel this way, and evidently, it's been problematic sustaining an 
old one. Last July, the resort and its three 18-hole golf courses were sold at 
an auction held by the Resolution Trust Corp., fetching $136.4 million from the 
KSL Recreation Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its 640 guest rooms, La Quinta's proprietors have spread 25 swimming 
pools and 38 spas, several of which are now named for former hotel familiars -- 
Gable, Garbo, Lombard, Dietrich, Renker (that's Fred Renker, La Quinta's first 
tennis pro) -- and the whole place seems to radiate venerability and 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, every guest has his own agenda. As I looked over the 60-year-old 
Renker Pool one dusk, a lone bather slipped in the gate, stepped into the hot 
bubbles of the poolside spa, and leaned back his head beneath the sky full of 
stars, the jagged mountain silhouettes, the still water of the pool. It was 
dead quiet. An ideal scene, by my standards. The bather, 22-year-old Mark 
Henny, a resident of Whidbey Island, Washington, and guitarist for the aspiring 
heavy metal band Grumble Thorp, seemed to think so, too, then raised his 
eyelids to half-staff, surveyed this world and found one element missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," he asked, "anybody know where a person can get a can of beer around 
here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But a bather in greater Palm Springs can't wallow in history, or deal in 
modest proportions, for long. Quickly, you're on to the epic waterscapes, the 
panoramic views, the sand from Hawaii, the water slides and private water 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Vant to be alone? The 18-year-old La Mancha Private Villas and Court Club, in 
Palm Springs, discretely offers 32 pools and 41 spas in all, most of them 
privately attached to one of the hotel's 54 units. "The locals in Palm Springs 
live by their pools," says owner Ken Irwin. "They eat by their pools, they 
drink by their pools -- quite a lot, in fact -- and they do some other things 
by their pools. When we opened, we said, 'Why don't we give the consumer a 
taste of what the locals have?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for child-friendliness? At the 4-year-old Stouffer Esmeralda Resort in 
Indian Wells, 560 pricey rooms are stacked and several dozen palm trees are 
arrayed around a big squarish pool with a bar in its middle and, yes, sand at 
one end. The sand is imported from Hawaii, concierge Nancy Jeskey reports, 
because "the sand here is too yellow." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Westin Mission Hills Resort in Rancho Mirage, too, occupying children 
is a priority. When the desert dust cleared after the resort's renovation and 
reopening by Westin in August, 1991, the 512-unit Moroccan-style property's 
main pool (there are three) included a 60-foot-long curving water slide. Up the 
hill nearby, the 5-year-old Ritz-Carlton Rancho Mirage holds court near the top 
of Frank Sinatra Drive and ushers guests through a formal interior of dark wood 
and low lights to a large and languorous pool area. There were a few kids on 
hand during the afternoon of my visit, but the place clearly isn't in business 
for their sake. The featured attractions are the view -- about 180 degrees of 
desert -- and pampering for grown-ups. Towel monitors and waiters scurry. Glass 
of fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice? $3.77. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyatt Grand Champions Resort in Indian Wells seems mostly a place for the 
well-fixed and grown-up, too, but in a less men's-clubby fashion. While I was 
sitting by its two curvilinear principal pools , the water seemed to serve as a 
sort of immense coffee table, standing in aid of a humming cocktail party. As 
at the most interesting cocktail parties, all sorts of people were there , 
including a mane in a yellow T-shirt with bright red letters: HELL'S KITCHEN, 
NEW YORK. At the same poolside, I met Richard Dreizen and Helen Makohon, two 
more New Yorkers, reclining on the last day of their vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping our flight will be canceled. No luck so far," said Dreizen, 
behind shades. About 36 hours later, the Northridge earthquake struck, briefly 
closing down Los Angeles International Airport. Careful what you wish for, 
Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles northwest of Indian Wells, the loudest bells and whistles in the 
valley clang. An indoor-outdoor lake. Electric boats. A receiving line of 
flamingos by the pond out front. An eight-story atrium. The 895 rooms. The pair 
of golf courses. The gleaming, verdant, sprawling, 1987 excess of Marriott's 
Desert Springs Resort & Spa. 
</P>
<P>
 The main pool lies close by the lake, and basks in Hawaiian monster-resort 
glory, stretching about 35 meters long, about 25 meters wide. On a Sunday 
afternoon, I found a pianist and percussionist pounding out live music for the 
masses, drink servers circulating. When the weather is warmer -- the highs were 
in the 70seach day I was there -- the scene is completed by a bevy of fit young 
men and women who bound about moistening guests with spritzer bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marriott pool certainly looked to be among the largest in the valley (the 
Shadow Mountain Resort & Racquet Club's 160-foot-long, 48-year-old model in 
Palm Desert is another contender), but the Marriott people, who have their 
flamingos to feed and electric boats to recharge, don't bother to brag much 
about that. In fact, sifting through the pitches of local lodgings, one finds 
that the boasts of "Palm Springs' largest pool" instead come from the Wyndham 
Palm Springs Hotel and the Palm Springs Riviera Resort & Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Each hotel is evidently thinking of the City of Palm Springs -- thereby 
excluding the outlying big resorts -- but even so, someone was stretching, and 
nothing makes a reporter happier than throwing a spotlight on someone 
stretching. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wyndham, a 410-unit hotel attached to the Palm Springs Convention Center, 
was a pleasant place that did have a large and popular pool, along with 
refreshment service and a sunbather who noted that by comparison, "the beach 
sucks in January." The Wyndham management estimates the pool is 5,000 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop: the nearby Riviera, with 480 rooms, a celebrity impersonator show 
in its lounge and Bono restaurant, owned by that guy who used to sing with 
Cher, next door. Eric, the 16-year-old son of a convening General Motors 
executive, lay near the pool, savoring his last few hours before the return to 
Michigan and zero degrees. "Gotta get as much as I can," said Eric, sounding a 
common local sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 So how big is the Riviera pool? The Riviera engineering department estimates . 
. . 280,000 gallons. And no, they say, they've never measured square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing makes a reporter unhappier than mathematics problems involving 
multiple variables. And even if you're in the swimming pool capital of 
civilization, enough is enough. I came home the next morning. But when I need 
another desert dip, I know my options.

AFTERSHOCKS - PHYCHIC AND OTHERWISE; THE NEXT TERROR: CHALLENGE OF REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Starr, Kevin Starr, professor of planning and development at USC and 
faculty member of the USC Embassy Residential College, is writing his next 
volume of the history of California, The Dream Endures: California Through the 
Great Depression, to be published by Oxford University Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First came the terror of the earthquake. Now come questions that hold a terror 
of their own. How will Los Angeles and its surrounding communities survive the 
disruption to its one abiding necessity -- mobility? Can strategies to 
supplement the broken lifelines be devised? More subtly, but of equal 
importance, can the civility and good behavior of the immediate post-quake days 
be prolonged? 
</P>
<P>
 Irony of ironies, the Northridge earthquake temporarily restored to the 
region, the city of Los Angeles especially, its lost reputation. For nearly two 
years, the outside world has been judging Los Angeles by the riots. Here, 
critics contended, was proof positive of the pervasive social instability of 
the city, and much of the county, of Los Angeles. Yet, in the wake of the 
earthquake, there were no riots; looting was negligible. The citizens of the 
region -- of necessity! -- repossessed the public places they had long since 
abandoned to the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, news reports of possible widespread fraud in the emergency food-stamp 
program take some of the bloom off the rose of social cooperation and good 
behavior in the post-earthquake era. Dangerously, the food-stamp fraud offers 
an opportunity for immigrant-bashers who might want to suggest that all 
immigrants, even the undocumented, come from the criminal underclass, which is 
not the case. In the matter of showcasing social behavior, the earthquake 
giveth; the earthquake taketh away. In this instance, the earthquake has 
brought further to light the persistent presence of a growing underclass in the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is not boosterism to note -- hence to praise -- the performance of 
front-line public servants, the rank and file of city and county government, in 
the aftermath of the disaster. Nor is it naive to note that District Seven of 
Caltrans, the most challenged of all governmental agencies, revealed (perhaps 
for the first and last time) its humanity, as well as its bureaucratic clout, 
when a succession of its engineers jerry-rigged a transportation IV to the 
traumatized body of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 But now comes the hard part. Now comes the long-range, and perhaps most real, 
challenge. Now comes the slow recovery, with all its demands on personal and 
communal patience. Now comes the effort to maintain the high ground, the 
momentarily achieved sense of common identity and purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 The responses to some quake-created challenges, while expensive, are 
self-evident. The partial collapse and subsequent demolition of the Barrington 
Building on Olympic Boulevard, with the loss of countless, sensitive medical 
records, and damage to the Hall of Justice, which rendered its data system, 
from fingerprinting to criminal histories, temporarily useless, underscore the 
fact that the region can no longer afford to maintain its databases in one 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 And how do we face up to the limits of our highway engineering technology? 
Should we, for the third time, spend tens of millions of dollars on overpasses 
that must inevitably collapse? The region now has a window of opportunity to 
diversify its transportation options. But will government have the good sense 
to ease restrictions on shuttle vans, allowing them to function as para-transit 
jitneys on declared routes? Or will it continue to protect the public-transit 
monopoly? 
</P>
<P>
 How can we replace some 20,000-plus units of housing stock? How can banks be 
expected to refinance multiunit apartment complexes that, under current 
construction codes and costs, can never be made affordable to the population 
that was displaced by the quake? Will some public-private mode of refinance be 
achieved, thus putting Southern California on the cutting edge of housing 
economics? Or will only the affluent be able to regain lost housing, with the 
rest lingering on in tents or drifting into Third World-style shanty towns in 
exurban arroyos and culverts? 
</P>
<P>
 Comparisons have been made to the rebuilding and improvement of Athens 
following the Persian invasion of 479-480 BC, or the rebuilding of London after 
the Great Fire of 1666, or the recovery of Atlanta after Sherman's march to the 
sea, or the reconstruction of Chicago after the great fire of 1871, or to the 
rebuilding of San Francisco following the earthquake and fire of April, 1906. 
In one sense, such comparisons are perhaps too grand. Metropolitan Los Angeles 
was not brought to the ground as were these other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in another sense, such comparisons are warranted, at least in American 
terms. The Northridge earthquake, at an estimated $30 billion in damages, 
represents the single most costly catastrophe in U.S. history. Athens, London, 
Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco had years to rebuild, although San Francisco 
did it in slightly more than three. Metropolitan Los Angeles, by contrast, 
feels the necessity of recovering immediately, lest it lose its economic 
momentum, lest it gain a negative reputation in investment circles. 
</P>
<P>
 The $6.6 billion federal-aid package will cover a mere 20% of the estimated 
quake-related damage. Intraregional and interagency competition for scarce 
funds can be expected to be fierce. In this spatially and sociologically 
segregated region, scarcity of funds is too often automatically translated into 
interethnic competition, which directly wars against that momentary sense of 
unity (already threatening to reveal itself as an illusion) the Northridge 
quake ushered in. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuilding task is enormous, perhaps impossible of realization. It may be 
a year or two or even more before things get back to normal, before 
metropolitan Los Angeles can be truly said to have regained the social and 
economic momentum it was showing before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But, then again, the British historian Arnold Toynbee has argued that 
near-impossible challenges put cultures and societies in connection with their 
best possibilities. In crisis, notes Toynbee, comes the challenge, and from the 
challenge comes the response. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, as Toynbee tells us, it is those very values momentarily 
recovered by metropolitan Los Angeles in the earthquake -- shared identity, 
moral community, a sense of hope and the common good, the distinctive renewal 
that comes from struggling against adverse fate -- that are most relevant to 
the recovery or collapse of past societies. 
</P>
<P>
 Will historians of a future era see in the behavior of metropolitan Los 
Angeles after the Northridge earthquake -- see in the social programs, economic 
and entrepreneurial strategies, traffic and engineering solutions -- a creative 
response to the challenge of the quake and the social problems it underscored? 
Or will something less than this be achieved: not enough to eliminate the 
region entirely (that is impossible) but certainly enough to have it lose its 
luster, to fall short of that dream of a better life that has filled Southern 
California with hard-working, aspiring people from every corner of the globe?

'CRISIS? WHAT CRISIS?' -- THE GOP RESPONDS TO THE HEALTH-CARE ISSUE; POLITICS: 
REPUBLICANS WILL ADMIT THERE ARE SOME 'PROBLEMS' BUT INSIST THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
OVERSTATING THE CASE. THE POLLS SHOW SOMETHING ELSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Harrington.

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, President Bill Clinton renewed his effort to redeem the most 
important promise he made to the people who elected him: to reform the 
country's health- care system so it provides universal and affordable coverage. 
Back on Election Day, 1992, Clinton voters named health care their top priority 
after fixing the economy. A year later, polls show health-care reform is the 
Clinton campaign promise that has most stayed in the minds of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the past year, Republicans have regularly voiced anger at Clinton's 
failing to make good on one 1992 promise or another. Now we know how they feel 
when he tries to make good on a key pledge: They really get upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care has put Republicans on the defensive, because they have no track 
record -- and thus little credibility with the voters -- on the issue. Their 
struggle for a response has led to some bruising intrafamily fights. But now 
they have forged a rough consensus -- made up of one part narrow partisanship 
and two parts ideological rigidity, with a generous dusting of cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican rejoinder -- you may wonder why this took so long -- is: 
"Crisis? What crisis?" America has health-care "serious problems," says Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, not a health-care "crisis." As its first 
line of defense, then, the party has revived its Vietnam strategy: Declare 
victory and go home. 
</P>
<P>
 They usually base the no-crisis claim on poll results that show a large 
majority of Americans satisfied with their own health care. These figures are 
accurate -- and beside the point. No one has suggested that the crisis is one 
of quality. It is a crisis of two other serious and interrelated factors: cost 
and coverage. Every poll on the issue shows the public somewhere between 
disgruntled and angry about the former, and somewhere between nervous and 
frightened regarding the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts bear out both anxieties. Americans today pay half again as much for 
health care, measured as a percentage of their family income, compared with 
1980. By the end of the decade, they will pay twice as much. People are being 
hit harder at every stage -- the cost of services, the share of premiums 
employers require them to pay and deductibles.  
</P>
<P>
 Health-care inflation, while easing this year, also remains a tremendously 
serious problem for the larger economy. Businesses have been hit hard, seeing 
their health-care tab triple since 1980. Small businesses -- those that take 
the responsible course and insure their employees -- have it toughest of all. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle over who will pay the costs frequently poisons labor-management 
relations, provoking many of the most significant strikes in recent years. 
Rising health-care costs have been a crushing burden on local, state and 
federal government -- accounting for virtually all the increase in government 
spending since 1980. If the United States had a normal level of health-care 
expenditures, we would literally not have a deficit problem! 
</P>
<P>
 On the insurance-coverage issue, Republicans argue that the much-cited 37 
million uninsured figure is a snapshot at any one time, and that most of them 
are not permanently uninsured. That's right, which is why 37 million 
understates the extent of coverage insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Census figures show that nearly twice as many Americans -- about one-quarter 
of the population -- can expect to lose coverage in a two-year period. And the 
vast majority of them will remain uninsured for four months or longer -- hardly 
a trivial duration. In addition, millions more families face the reality or 
real possibility of losing insurance because they become injured or seriously 
ill, thanks to the notorious "pre-existing condition" policies of most 
insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Republicans point out that most people who experience periods of 
non-coverage don't have the misfortune to get seriously ill in that time. And 
most will not develop a chronic condition bad enough to deny them coverage. 
Well, yes, but millions do -- and that's a disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 One could use the same logic, more plausibly in fact, to argue there is no 
crime crisis: Well over 90% will not be a victim of crime this year, and most 
are not even at any real risk. You can imagine the indignant GOP response to 
such a notion. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, this whole line of reasoning ignores the essential nature of 
insurance. We pay a lot for insurance, but hope never to use it -- it's not a 
normal economic good. Its value is to be there when we need it, and relieve 
insecurity the rest of the time. America's bizarre patchwork private insurance 
system -- using system loosely here -- doesn't meet this basic standard. Maybe 
if private insurers started issuing home-owner policies that covered expensive 
artwork and jewelry -- except in cases where someone broke into your home and 
stole it -- the GOP would take decisive leadership in the fight for insurance 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The public understands social insurance, but Republican leaders never seem to 
have quite grasped the concept -- from the introduction of Social Security, to 
Medicare, to today. Once it happens and is politically popular, they sign on, 
but each time is met at the time with the cry of "socialism." 
Academic-turned-Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas carries this old and tattered flag 
into battle even now with no apparent sense of irony -- perhaps because he was 
trained as an economist, not an historian.  
</P>
<P>
 The problems of cost and coverage leave the public with no real doubt about 
whether their health-care system is in crisis. In recent polling by NBC and the 
Wall Street Journal, 78% say the system does not meet the needs of most 
Americans; as a concern and priority, it ranks with crime at the top of the 
list, far ahead of welfare reform. And people are prepared for -- in fact, 
demand -- fairly radical surgery: Seven in 10 say more government involvement 
is acceptable, and a "complete overhaul" is required. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans assert that the public is mistaken about all this, taken in, 
perhaps, by Hillary Rodham Clinton. Besides being wrong on the substance, this 
rejoinder has the additional shortcoming -- as Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga) warns 
his brethren -- of political foolishness. It signals to the public that the 
complacent Republican Party of George Bush lives on, and won't step up to the 
big issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small solutions for small problems" is today's Republican watchword, and 
Democrats could hardly wish for a better opposition. If the GOP keeps getting 
it wrong on health care -- the way they consistently said the economy was not a 
problem in 1992 -- it could soon be a party in crisis.

AFTERSHOCKS - PHYCHIC AND OTHERWISE; THE POWER OF RUMORS: MIDDLE AGES REVISITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steven D. Stark, Steven D. Stark, who has written for the Atlantic Monthly 
and the Washington Post, is a commentator for National Public Radio. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In medieval times, there was the Roman Catholic Church. But otherwise, there 
was no center to hold, so virtually every idea possessed some currency. As 
Lewis Lapham wrote recently, storytellers blurred the distinctions between 
truth and fiction with their allegorical tales of animals and saints. Belief 
was more important than knowledge and few people could read. Natural disasters 
and plagues mesmerized the public, and chaos was frequently the normal state of 
things. When something went bad, the response was often to start a witch hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, our culture seems to become more like the Dark Ages. So it seemed 
fitting that strange apocalyptic rumors swept Southern California in the wake 
of the Northridge earthquake. First, there was a widely circulated and accepted 
rumor that a secret fax was sent from the California Institute of Technology to 
the governor's office four days after the disaster, warning of an 8.5 quake 
within 72 hours. (Never mind that Caltech never predicts quakes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it was widely repeated that the actual magnitude of the quake was 7.8, 
not 6.6 as reported, and "the powers-that-be" were keeping this a secret for 
fear it would be bad for business and would psychologically scar the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the details have obviously been modernized, there is something medieval 
about all this. We live in yet another era of atomization, which celebrates the 
baby-boom version of the Middle Ages' mysticism, love of spectacle and 
promotion of feeling over thought. In a boomer world where "the personal is 
political," everything, by definition, is in play. In such an atmosphere, what 
would really be surprising is if there were no wild, conspiratorial rumors 
sweeping the region after an earthquake. If we can no longer blame Satan for 
our troubles as we did a millennium ago, there's always Caltech or Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors, of course, are nothing new in American life: Thousands tried to close 
their accounts during the Great Depression as rumors of bank failures spread, 
and the baby boomers spent much of their formative years comparing notes on the 
apparent but unreported death of Paul McCartney. ("Turn me on dead man.") 
Widely accepted rumors tend to follow the panic that ensues in mass disasters 
-- particularly when official organs of communication are impaired. In the 
minutes after John F. Kennedy's assassination, for example, there were wild 
stories exchanged in workplaces and schools about who else had been in the car, 
or where else the assassin might strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists tell us that rumors get started for a lot of reasons -- attempts 
to explain troubling news, misunderstandings, a desire for communion and 
sometimes just plain mischief. But a culture that continues to spot Elvis, 
still scandal-mongers about Kennedy's death, obsessively speculates about what 
Michael Jackson and Tonya Harding really did and gobbles down vitamins based on 
"hearsay" medical evidence is obviously fertile ground for rumors of any sort 
-- medievalism notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is that public cynicism about authority figures is so 
great. Rumors tend to arise when we don't believe what "officials" tell us. One 
can point to a variety of factors that have contributed to the current cynicism 
-- from Watergate, to the baby boomers' distrust of authority, to the media's 
pervasive compulsion to tear down public figures. Americans -- 
anti-Establishmentarians at heart -- have never had much use for officialdom, 
anyway. But the bottom line is that everyone from the press, to priests, to 
Presidents now has a gaping credibility gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that the media hierarchy has collapsed. In the old era 
of three networks and only a few other quasi-official information sources, 
people tended to get their news from the same places, which then functioned as 
gatekeepers. When Walter Cronkite said, "That's the way it is," it was, in 
part, because there weren't a lot of other sources of information that could 
compete with him. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the news bombards the public from thousands of equally credible, or 
better yet, incredible sources -- not the least of which are public computer 
networks that operate faster than television and have no restrictions on the 
flow of information. Welcome to the misinformation highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstream press no longer does a thorough job of distinguishing fact from 
rumor or fiction. In the not so recent past, there was a need for news only 
several times a day -- to fill a newscast or an edition. Now, with 24-hour 
cable news services and far more news shows on the networks, there is a greatly 
increased demand for "news." One result has been a broadening of what is 
considered reportable -- with the result that everything from speculation about 
Bill Clinton's alleged sexual escapades to Tonya Harding's motives is presented 
on an equal footing with what really happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to these developments the propensity of reality-based television to blur 
the lines between documentary and drama on shows such as "Rescue 911" and 
scores of docudrama mini-series, and it's no wonder that the public doesn't 
know anymore what and whom to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no coincidence, of course, that all these forces have converged in 
recent days in Los Angeles. It is, after all, the entertainment capital -- our 
source of myths and legends, which psychologists tell us are themselves close 
cousins of rumor. Unlike other nations, America has always been a country built 
around an idea -- a series of myths or rumors, some might say -- and nowhere 
have those myths become a more formative force than in Southern California: 
Hollywood, Disneyland, the West, Garden of Eden, the apocalyptic End of the 
Road and Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 As the center of the entertainment culture, it's not just that Southern 
California has always had a propensity to believe -- falling head over heels 
for the hype that is America. It's that more than other places, Los Angeles 
originated and thrived on artifice -- whether the artifice concerned how the 
water actually got there, or how the stars really lived. In a culture of 
illusion, cinematographers and skillful rumor-mongers flourished: Where else 
would Oliver Stone, peddling conspiracy rumors, be considered a prophet, or 
Orson Welles -- who created perhaps the greatest rumor scare in American 
history (the Martians are coming!) -- have found his true vocation? Even 
Welles' great unfinished documentary, "It's All True," was a staged docudrama 
with a fabricated subplot. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no coincidence that the region's most notable political export, Ronald 
Reagan, was notorious for the way he sunnily presented the local affliction -- 
unable, at times, to discern rumor from fact, entertainment from news, fiction 
from truth. Does Reagan really believe he liberated concentration camps, or 
better yet, was in the dark about Iran-Contra? Live in that world of illusion 
and rumors long enough, and you begin to believe in what you believe. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes in Los Angeles, with its earthquake rumors. "Everybody says it, 
and what everybody says must be true," wrote James Fenimore Cooper, who 
understood the American myth-making culture of rumor even before there was one. 
The need to pass along a conspiratorial, apocalyptic explanation of an event 
like an earthquake is partly human nature, partly our anti-Establishment 
heritage, partly a throwback to medieval times and partly a reflection of the 
media world. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also shows the irresistible temptation, particularly in the mythic 
capital of entertainment, to take an event and immediately begin reprocessing 
and hyping it in bigger and bolder ways -- for film at 11, a mini-series or 
just to tell a friend. The rumor gives magic, order, grace and grandeur to an 
event, just as the Hollywood version is always better than the original. As 
they said in the movie, "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance": "This is the West, 
sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."

AFTERSHOCKS - PHYCHIC AND OTHERWISE; THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT THAT BUILT AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Felix G. Rohatyn, Felix G. Rohatyn, senior partner at Lazard Freres & Co., 
is the former chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corp. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The disaster created by the Northridge earthquake, together with continuing 
pressures to curb domestic federal spending, have forged a political 
opportunity to deal with both problems. 
</P>
<P>
 California, already financially strained be cause of its weak economy, must 
now spend billions of dollars to rebuild roads, bridges and other 
infrastructure damaged by the quake. There will be a sterile argument in 
Congress about whether disaster relief should be offset by spending cuts or 
treated as an "off-budget" item. What California, along with every other state 
in the Union, needs is federal assistance in the form of public investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Such public investment, if properly financed, should never be part of the 
federal budget. The fact that investment in a school building or a bridge is 
treated as if it were next week's welfare payment is economic nonsense. But 
like so much economic nonsense, it has strong political support. An attempt 
should now be made to step away from this trap by creating a free-standing, 
independently financed public corporation to assist state and local governments 
with their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 An aggressive, long-term federally assisted public-works construction program 
is an economic and social necessity. Investing $25 billion to $35 billion 
annually could generate from 800,000 to 1,000,000 jobs each year; could be part 
of a targeted defense-conversion plan and, if combined with Civilian 
Conservation Corps-type training camps, could provide training and employment 
for inner-city youth. It would also be psychologically uplifting at a time when 
fear of new layoffs in the private sector, as well as of cutbacks in state and 
local governments, is pervasive. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge is to create a structure that could serve as the centerpiece for 
such a program. New York's Municipal Assistance Corp. could be a useful model. 
</P>
<P>
 MAC was created, in 1975, by the state of New York to provide financing for 
New York City, then in serious financial difficulties. Between 1975 and 1984, 
it raised nearly $10 billion. Through the sale of MAC bonds, backed by a 
portion of the city sales tax, New York City was able to significantly increase 
its investment in its physical facilities. Since 1985, MAC has been paying down 
its debt and will retire its bonds by 2008. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar approach, using a longer time frame, should be adopted at the 
federal level. We need not start with the largest possible program. Rather, the 
initial goal should be limited, though capable of expansion if the program 
works. To illustrate, let's consider a $200-billion, 10-year effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government would create the "Public Investment Assistance Corp." 
with authorized capital of $20 billion and $200 billion of borrowing authority. 
The PIAC would provide incremental financing to state and local governments 
over a 10-year period on a matching-fund basis. Washington would contribute 80% 
of the funds, which would be generated by sales of PIAC bonds, guaranteed by 
the U.S. government. The remaining 20% would be provided by participating 
states on an equity basis reflecting their distribution share -- for example, a 
state eligible for 4% of the funds would be responsible for 4% of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenues could perhaps be generated by raising the federal gasoline tax by 2 
cents a year for five years -- equaling about $2 billion annually. The revenue 
stream, which would build to $10 billion to $12 billion a year after five 
years, would support a 10-year, $200-billion borrowing and investment program 
and fully service and retire the outstanding bonds after 40 years. The federal 
guarantee would only come into play if Congress interrupted the revenue stream. 
The debt-service coverage should result in an investment-grade rating for the 
bonds -- which would make them eligible for pension-fund investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the total amount of private and public pension funds is about $3 
trillion. This is expected to double over the next 10 years. A $200-billion, 
10-year, public-investment program could be entirely funded by the commitment 
of less than 10% of the increase in pension funds becoming available over the 
same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the bonds would have to meet the most stringent fiduciary 
standards; they could also be sold to the general investing public. The only 
federal budgetary cost would be the value of the guarantee (no more than 1% to 
2% of principal) and the PIAC cash flow and borrowing should be totally 
off-budget. A strong control mechanism, such as MAC's board of directors -- 
consisting entirely of independent, private-sector directors -- would insure 
funds were used prudently. 
</P>
<P>
 The political problem is obviously the imposition of additional energy taxes. 
But an annual increase of 2 cents a gallon for five years, earmarked for new 
construction and job creation, seems a small price to pay. Oil prices are now 
at their lowest level, in real terms, in the past 30 years. In addition, there 
was no public outcry over the 4-cent gas tax included in the deficit-reduction 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The requirement of a 20% local share may be a problem for some states -- but 
cost sharing is probably a necessity. The subscription, however, would take 
place over time in proportion to the overall borrowing program. The program 
should also provide that some investments would generate their own revenues -- 
toll roads, bridges, etc. -- that could be used for further expansion or 
accelerated debt repayment. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's economic well-being has historically been dependent on public 
investment -- under both Democratic and Republican presidents. Franklin D. 
Roosevelt helped steer America through the Depression, in part, through the 
activities of the Reconstruction Finance Corp. and other significant public 
projects. These dealt with urban and rural problems, with electrification and 
water, with roads and bridges. In the 1950s, Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the 
interstate highway program, which helped sustain an economic boom well into the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when we are looking for ways to fight crime, offset job losses in 
the private sector and improve the quality of urban life, a significant 
public-investment program is long overdue. It should appeal to Republicans and 
Democrats alike. It would be a fitting part of President Bill Clinton's call 
for change and for investment in America.

CLINTON GRABS GOP AGENDA FOR HIS OWN

 Body language can tell you pages about a politician. As he stood in the well 
of the House of Representatives giving his first State of the Union Address on 
Tuesday, President Bill Clinton was high octane -- hands punching the air, 
shoulders back, head high, eyes on the prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Look now at the Republican members of the House and Senate, clustered together 
to Clinton's left, looking for all the world as if they had just heard their 
favorite dog had been hit by a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, in a way, that was true. The dog, in this case, was the GOP hammerlock 
on such red-hot issues as crime and welfare reform, and the truck was Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of Clinton's long -- probably too long -- speech, the Republicans 
limped from the House floor to the waiting press hordes to report the crime. 
"He stole our agenda," they insisted, or "We were there two years ago" or, my 
favorite, from House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, "I said that last 
year." How are all these poor Republican souls ever going to pick up the broken 
pieces of their lives and carry on? 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't just welfare reform that brought gas to the heart of the 
downtrodden GOP. Herewith, a trip through the Clinton State of the Union and 
his words -- with the appropriate response from the injured party. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, many people urged me to cut defense spending further . . . I said 
no."  
</P>
<P>
 "What," say the Republicans, "that's our line. We already lost our best 
defense card when all the commies went away. It's the GOP that holds the line 
on defense cuts." Not any more, boys; meet the commander-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us resolve . . . to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and 
gangs." And, said Clinton, let's put 100,000 more cops on the streets and put 
three-time felony offenders away for good. 
</P>
<P>
 This one really hurts. Poor old Phil Gramm, the right-wing senator from Texas 
and presidential wannabe, was left to mumble, "Words are one thing, actions 
another." Get a life, Phil -- the President was holding the bill passed by the 
Senate. He told the House to pass it, and he'd sign it. The toughest crime bill 
ever. The Clinton crime bill. Don't you love it, Phil? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunters must always be free to hunt; law-abiding adults should always be free 
to own guns."  
</P>
<P>
 Yep, that's a Democrat talking. This is not to suggest that Clinton will win 
the gun-nut vote. But it sends a message to gun owners that, although Clinton 
will seek tougher gun control, your guns will be protected. No Republican 
response here, save for some guttural sounds from the stalls in the Capitol 
men's room. 
</P>
<P>
 "To all those who depend on welfare, we should offer, ultimately, a simple 
compact. We will provide the support, the job training, the child care you need 
for up to two years, but after that anyone who can work, must."  
</P>
<P>
 You boys better get used to the fact that you've been trumped by a better 
poker player who has a far better feeling for America than you suits ever will. 
The public wants welfare reform. But they don't buy the GOP position of 
mean-spirited retribution toward "lazy welfare queens." Rather, they take 
Clinton's view that welfare as currently structured does not work -- but the 
need to help these folks is important and we better figure out a way to do it 
so these people (read, our fellow citizens) have a decent shot at the American 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problems go way beyond the reach of government. They are rooted in the 
loss of values and the disappearance of work and the breakdown of our families 
. . . . We can't renew our country till we realize that governments don't raise 
children, parents do."  
</P>
<P>
 The most unkind cut of all. From the Republican general in charge of values, 
Dan Quayle, to the cultural-war minister, Patrick J. Buchanan, Republicans have 
claimed cultural values as their own. And now this Democratic President, with 
his own moral problems, lays claim to the mother lode. No way. Way boys. 
</P>
<P>
 You could have had the values message but you blew it. You assumed the public 
could never believe that Democrats had any values. After all, Democrats were 
the party of gays and feminists. But more important, you saw values as a 
negative attack agenda against the party and their leader. You saw a value 
agenda as a way to divide not unite. You let the Christian right lead your 
fight -- not as forgiving Christians but as moral interventionists. 
</P>
<P>
 The American people are suspicious of messengers carrying moral agendas to 
their living rooms. Clinton understands this. He sees what the majority of the 
country sees -- we better regain our values as a people together if we're to 
find our way home, using values as a guide, not as whips. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton used his bully pulpit Tuesday night to rally the country to the great 
challenges that all Americans face. He did it with words they understand, with 
an agenda for change and a road map to get there together. Do you get it, Bob 
and Newt? Nah!

BEHIND THE CHIAPAS REVOLT: AN ARMY ALLOWED TO OPERATE OUTSIDE THE LAW; MEXICO: 
EXECUTIONS AND TORTURE ARE THE SOLDIERS' TOOLS TO RESTORE ORDER. THE U.S. CAN'T 
JUST SIT TIGHT AND COMPLAIN ABOUT RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

World Policy Institute at the New School for Social Research.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reports of executions and torture of captives in Chiapas are but the latest 
examples of abuses carried out by the Mexican armed forces. Compounding the 
problem is the imprisonment of a brigadier general who dared suggest the 
military should respect human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The army's abuses highlight the danger of allowing any institution to operate 
outside the law. The continuation of these abuses in Mexico, and elsewhere in 
Latin America, requires the United States to reappraise its hemispheric 
human-rights policy as it prepares for economic integration with the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Armies are supposed to protect the peace -- not the Mexican army. It has 
instigated rebellion through two decades of repression in Chiapas. 
Significantly, one of the first acts of the Zapatista rebels was to kidnap 
Absalon Castellanos, a retired general. As commander of the 31st military zone 
in Chiapas in the early 1980s, Castellanos was notorious for repressing the 
Mayan population. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their memories is the Golonchan massacre of June, 1980. Tiring of 
interminable delays, Tzeltal Mayans, who had already been granted titles, took 
possession of their lands. The state's powerful land barons called on the 
government to dislodge them. Through the mediation of a priest, the governor of 
Chiapas agreed to expedite the land transfers and meet with the Tzeltals. But 
it was not the governor who showed up on June 15; it was Castellanos' troops, 
who slaughtered the Tzeltals, including women and children. Two years later, 
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) rewarded Castellanos 
with the governorship of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellanos was succeeded, in 1988, by Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, who 
continued the repressive policies of his predecessor. Last January, President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari named Gonzalez secretary of government, the second 
most powerful post in the Mexican hierarchy. The appointment was widely 
interpreted as heralding a harder line toward discontent in rural Mexico. As it 
turns out, there has been a disturbing increase in the deployment of troops in 
the Mayan Highlands of Chiapas during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report published last August, a team of investigators from Minnesota 
Advocates for Human Rights described a pattern of abuses by the military in 
precisely the area that has become the focal point of today's insurrection. 
Following the disappearance of two army officers last spring, troops occupied 
several villages, detaining, beating and torturing civilians. The report also 
documented similar abuses against the populations of villages in the state of 
Chihuahua, on the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite national and international exposure, none of the officers responsible 
have been disciplined. Instead, the army's high command has imprisoned Brig. 
Gen. Francisco Gallardo for his human-rights advocacy. Citing mistreatment of 
civilians in rural Mexico, among other offenses, Gallardo proposed creation of 
a human-rights ombudsman for the armed forces. The proposal has gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of reform, the Mexican army is responding to the uprising in 
Chiapas in the exact manner that helped provoke the insurrection there. 
Villages are being bombed, rebels executed after capture and suspected 
sympathizers tortured to extract confessions. What happened after the army 
seized the village of Oxchuc, in the Mayan Highlands, epitomizes the dangers of 
military involvement in civilian affairs. Accompanied by officers, the mayor 
toured the town, fingering supporters of opposition parties. The soldiers took 
the civilians away, accusing them of subversion. Such collusion between the 
army and the ruling party leaves dissidents few options but insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for a re-evaluation of the role of the armed forces in Mexico, and, 
by extension, in other Latin American societies, is clear. With the demise of 
the Soviet Union, the United States no longer faces any credible military 
threat in the Americas. Nor does Mexico. That reduces the Mexican army to the 
role of a police force engaged in combatting drug smuggling and maintaining 
domestic order. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies a problem. Armies are trained to fight invading enemies. When 
used as domestic police forces, they have an unfortunate tendency to treat 
their fellow citizens as "the enemy." In 1968, the Mexican army turned tanks 
and automatic weapons on a peaceful gathering of student protesters in Mexico 
City, killing hundreds. During the following years, hundreds of suspected 
dissidents were kidnaped by the army's white brigades and executed at a 
military base on the outskirts of the capital. In rural Guerrero, the army made 
little distinction between civilians and combatants in suppressing a small 
insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
 Such brutalization has political consequences. The urban repression has 
created an underground intelligentsia; the repression in the countryside, 
widespread discontent. These two forces have come together to form a guerrilla 
movement that is attracting support from Indians and peasants across southern 
Mexico. If reports of recent guerrilla mobilizations in Guerrero prove 
accurate, the challenge to the Mexican government could be far more serious 
than first suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic integration cannot succeed in an atmosphere of corruption, repression 
and conflict. If the nations of the hemisphere are to inaugurate a successful 
economic partnership, it will have to be on the basis of a common foundation of 
democracy, public accountability and respect for human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration thus needs to follow through on its pledge to make 
democracy and human rights the "cornerstone" of its foreign policy. It can 
begin by asking the U.S. Senate to ratify the American Convention on Human 
Rights, which has already been ratified by every Latin American country, except 
Cuba. Ratification would enable Washington to insist on enforcement of the 
convention's provisions as a condition for aid and for access to the regime 
created by the North American Free Trade Agreement. For its part, the Mexican 
government should signal its seriousness in pursuing reform and reconciliation 
by withdrawing its troops from Chiapas and by disciplining its officers who 
violate human rights.

GOODBY TO A PRINCIPLED POLITICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All Californians have benefited from the distinguished congressional service 
of Rep. Don Edwards -- a hard-working, principled Democrat from San Jose. His 
decision to retire at the end of his current term, after 32 years on Capitol 
Hill, is to be noted with regret. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of the House judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional 
rights, Edwards has been one of the most ardent civil libertarians in 
Washington. He got to that point from what would seem an unlikely background: 
The former Young Republican and FBI agent first ran for Congress in 1962 after 
a successful business career. 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of the first in Congress to push for abolition of McCarthy-era 
committees on so-called un-American activities. He later sponsored the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 and fought for the Equal Rights Amendment in Washington as 
far back as 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 His most noteworthy recent contribution was helping found the California 
Institute, a privately funded research center designed to inspire California's 
congressional delegation, which now numbers 54, to work in a unified manner on 
issues important to the state. This is a noble goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his liberalism, Edwards reached out to the state's many conservatives 
and asked them to work with him for the sake of California. And, as the dean of 
Congress' biggest -- although not always its most effective -- delegation, 
Edwards provided valuable leadership in bringing at least a semblance of unity 
to an often unruly group. That may yet prove his greatest legacy to California.

GETTING ALONG

<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Honolulu Sets Pattern as Capital of Diversity" (Jan. 10) suggests that all 
of us can do better to erase racial and ethnic hatred, particularly if we 
maintain our sense of humor. I would like to add five excellent reasons why we 
should fervently reject all hatred of our fellow humans. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Most of us will agree that there is no "superior race." There are, however, 
superior people who achieve and excel. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Most of us will agree that achievement is possible only if freedom to think 
and act independently is available to every individual.  
</P>
<P>
 3. Most of us will agree that we are what we are and have what we have because 
of people's efforts in past generations. We stupidly deny their magnificent 
contributions if we don't take advantage of our freedom in the U.S. to progress 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Most of us will agree that politicians who promise to make everything 
"right" frequently make things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Most of us will agree that the world is becoming smaller and smaller and 
that the element of race is becoming increasingly diffused. We will probably 
blend into one in the distant future.

INFORMATIVE AS POSSIBLE -- WITHOUT GETTING RECKLESS; HOW TO COPE WITH THE 
TRICKY, SENSITIVE ISSUE OF AIDS NOTIFICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the years of the AIDS epidemic, the disease has been diagnosed in nearly 
340,000 Americans. Of that number, according to the federal Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 205,000 have died. The World Health Organization 
reports that 8 million to 10 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, 
the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. Acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome is a fatal and horrific disease for which there now is no cure. Its 
tragedy features a pronounced irony: One of the ways in which its seemingly 
inexorable advance can be checked is by ensuring the confidentiality of the 
tests that detect it. 
</P>
<P>
 A LONG-SILENT KILLER: Simply put, it is vitally important for individuals to 
be tested for the AIDS virus if they suspect they have been exposed. Part of 
the reason is that the disease can incubate within the body for a decade or 
more without causing symptoms. Such asymptomatic carriers unwittingly can 
spread the disease to many others. It has been demonstrated that only if there 
is confidentiality will large numbers of people come forward to be tested. 
Without such assurances of secrecy, many of those who might be infected decline 
to be tested, hastening the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 It is precisely that area of confidentiality that is now under attack in the 
case of a serial-rapist suspect being tried in a Van Nuys courtroom. He is 
suspected of having raped as many as 15 women in the east San Fernando Valley 
between August of 1991 and his arrest in January, 1992. He has been formally 
charged with six of these attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The same confidentiality laws -- part of the state health and safety code -- 
that encourage people to seek HIV tests, and that make it illegal to disclose 
the results of such tests without authorization, also protect the suspect in 
this case. Because of another statute, Section 1524.1 of the state penal code, 
only the women who figure in the formal rape charges can petition the court to 
have him tested for HIV infection. And only those women are allowed to know the 
results of that test. Four of the women involved in the charges against the 
accused took those steps two years ago and were able to learn whether their 
alleged attacker tested positive for the AIDS virus. But in instances where 
formal rape charges are not brought -- usually because the prosecution fears 
its case is weak -- the victims cannot learn whether their supposed attacker 
was infected. Obviously, this profoundly disturbs some victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those victims have a right to know. They are going to spend the rest of their 
lives wondering if and when they are going to come down with it," a police 
detective said. This is far from the fact. Actually, although AIDS can have a 
long incubation, HIV infection is detectable within three to six months of 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged rapist in the Van Nuys case was arrested two years ago. None of 
the women involved have reported testing positive for the virus. According to 
medical experts, if they have not tested positive for the virus after more than 
two years, they will never develop AIDS from that contact. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not as though the confidentiality laws expressly forbid the notifying of 
alleged rape victims, even in situations where a formal charge of rape has not 
been filed. Section 199.25 of the state health and safety code states that 
medical professionals will not be held criminally liable for telling alleged 
rape victims that they have had sexual contact with an infected person. The 
only stipulation is that the alleged victim cannot be told that it might have 
been the alleged rapist. In this case, county health officials have sent 
letters to some or all of the nine women who reported being raped and who are 
not involved in the six charges against the defendant; the letter tells them 
that they may have been infected with the AIDS virus but not by whom. 
</P>
<P>
 THE TORTURE OF NOT KNOWING: "You can imagine a rape victim who gets a letter 
like this and doesn't know. 'Was it the suspect? My husband? My boyfriend?' " a 
prosecutor asked rhetorically. One option for authorities in multiple-rape 
cases is to bring formal charges related to all the attacks, thus allowing all 
the alleged victims to petition the court for an AIDS test for the suspect and 
to learn the results. But there is no reason to wait that long to find out 
whether one has been infected. If one has been sexually assaulted, one should 
be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 The state penal code requires local governments to counsel rape victims to 
help them determine whether they should seek to have the accused tested for 
AIDS. It is at that time that the victims ought to be urged to take the test as 
well, at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The confidentiality laws on AIDS and health status might serve as a barrier to 
knowing whether an alleged rapist has the HIV virus. They are no barrier at all 
to self-knowledge, and that is of preeminent importance here.

ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER . . .; TIMES POLL ON NORTHRIDGE QUAKE CONTAINS SILVER 
LININGS, DISTURBING FINDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a two weeks it has been. 
</P>
<P>
 And what an extraordinary next few months it no doubt will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Spare us the excitement, right? For -- once again -- the millions who live 
here are being severely tested, this time by the biggest earthquake in our 
modern history. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, we'll pass the test. We're resilient, determined, committed, all of 
that. Look at the amazing results of the Los Angeles Times Poll taken last 
weekend. It revealed that only 3% of poll respondents -- and only 4% in the 
most heavily damaged areas -- say they will pick up and get out. 
</P>
<P>
 So we're staying, we're digging in, we're fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 That we know. 
</P>
<P>
 What we don't know is whether we'll be better or worse for all the trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 No less than 54% of respondents said they were suffering psychologically as a 
result of the 6.6-point quake that occurred early Jan. 17. Indeed, one in four 
said the Northridge earthquake was one of the worst experiences of their lives. 
Sounds reasonable to us. 
</P>
<P>
 What did seem a lot less sensible was that 83% of those commuting alone said 
they would continue to do so. It takes some kind of zany optimist to find a 
silver lining in an earthquake, but our hope has been that the commuting 
nightmare that we have all awakened to would force many of us into doing what 
we should have been doing all along: Start a car pool, take a bus, ride a 
train. 
</P>
<P>
 Our guess is that a few more weeks of the post-quake commuting ordeal will 
chip away at that 83% figure. We'll see. 
</P>
<P>
 And no one really knows how much children will be affected by the trauma. 
Endless psychologists -- pop and otherwise -- will no doubt speculate. But only 
the attentive parent will be able to tell. It did seem to us that local school 
officials moved as quickly as humanely possible to get the schools up to speed. 
That was a relief to the kids, not to mention their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Another silver lining -- can you can hear us whistling? -- is that the 
experience of this powerful quake will motivate us all to take the whole 
business of earthquake preparedness a lot more seriously. Disturbingly, 53% of 
poll respondents did not consider themselves well-prepared for a quake. We've 
got to change. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as you go to bed tonight, ask yourself this question: Do you know where 
your flashlights are?

DWP CHIEF'S PENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Dan Waters will retire at the end of the month (Jan. 12). He worked for the 
DWP for 32 years, the last three as general manager. His final annual salary is 
$165,000 and he will receive a pension of $110,000 per year. That equates to 
66% of his final salary. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a 31-year airline pilot, ending with 19 years as captain. I selected the 
highest pension I was entitled to and it amounts to 41% of my highest salary.  
</P>
<P>
 I hope Waters' pension does not include a COLA (annual cost of living 
adjustment). Mine does not, nor does any private sector pension I know of. This 
seems to be civil service/public service perk. 
</P>
<P>
 Could sweetheart pension setups like that paid to Waters, multiplied by many 
DWP retirees, be a contributing factor to our high water and electric bills? I 
think so. If we don't express our views to those responsible, we can count on 
continuously increasing DWP charges.

<P>
 * As I read the quoted remarks of the "statespeople" who currently serve us in 
Los Angeles, in Sacramento and in Washington, as well as those who would like 
to replace them, certain themes emerge in sharp relief: 
</P>
<P>
 Most local "leaders" want everything fixed but paid for by the state or the 
federal government. Most state "leaders" want everything fixed but paid for by 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The esteemed senator from Kansas believes that the federal government should 
cut other items from the budget if it does pay for our earthquake relief but I 
didn't hear him offering any of his constituency's pieces of pork to the 
butcher's knife. 
</P>

 Taxpayers, most of whom have been hollering that we are overtaxed, expect some 
government to make good their losses, presumably without anyone paying taxes to 
provide the money. But the governments all get their money from taxpayers; 
where else does anyone think it comes from? 
</P>
<P>
 We claim to be exponents of free enterprise but I guess that means we want 
governments to carry out a lot of enterprises for free.

REFORMING LAWYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Why Lawyer-Hating Is an American Pastime," Opinion, Jan 16: 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln Caplan's column on lawyer-hating/bashing suggests the solution to the 
abuses by "win-at-all-costs" attorneys should start at the law firm. He 
identifies or defines the law firm as the legal equivalent of the family. 
Unfortunately, as in some families we grow up in, law firm families can be just 
as dysfunctional and produce menaces to the public good. 
</P>
<P>
 After working in the Los Angeles legal community for 11 years as a law 
librarian, I have experienced firsthand "the good, the bad and the ugly" at 
major firms which included Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, the subject 
of Caplan's recent book. To expect a firm such as Skadden to take on the 
responsibility of improving the performance of the Bar is about as realistic as 
hoping all Los Angeles gang members will trade their guns for tickets to a 
Lakers game because the media ask them to. Both parties need outside reform and 
strong incentives to force abandonment of their respective weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a more realistic solution, which also includes lawyers, could be to 
ask corporate counsel, as clients, to take a close look at firms and the 
partners that manage and dictate the firm's culture before selecting outside 
counsel. Abandon the win-at-all-costs (even the corporation's and shareholder's 
costs) law firms and do your next deal and litigation with a firm that will put 
the spirit of the law back into the outcome of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The process (any process) will be excruciatingly slow, but perhaps with one 
step, one deal, one settlement at a time the message will become clear to the 
legal world that private greed is not for the public good.

 * As a legal-aid volunteer, I can attest that in this litigious society 
justice is available most often to those who can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, the ever typical eviction case where a residence has 
uninhabitable conditions (e.g., mice, roaches, etc.). In most cases, a 
landlord's attorney will urge his/her client to settle the case out of court by 
providing the renter with relocation assistance once it is known that the 
renter has legal representation. Cost-benefit analysis concludes that this 
course of action is the least expensive, and risk-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Indigent renters, however, end up being railroaded by the legal system because 
they cannot afford today's exorbitant legal fees. Typically, these renters find 
out too late that simply bringing a picture of uninhabitable conditions to 
court may allow a judge to significantly reduce rent monies owed, and can even 
extend the payment due date. Money, therefore, is often the determining factor 
for accessing one's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Aversion for lawyers, and the feeling that the legal system has failed, should 
surprise no one.

<P>
 * Caplan's generally astute assessment of lawyers' misbehavior fails to note 
its causes. Lawyers are rational. If they act in overreaching ways, it is not 
because they were corrupted in legal ethics courses but because such behavior 
pays off in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers are supposed to be their clients' paladins, doing what they can to 
win, but only within the rules. Those rules can only curb overreaching behavior 
if enforced by judges. But the cold fact is that many judges have grown 
insensitive to lawyers' excesses. These days, case dispositions and litigation 
outcomes all too often seem to be of greater interest than adherence to rules 
of law -- and that includes rules that govern proper norms of professional 
behavior.

FEDERAL AID FOR EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It incenses me to read that certain congressional leaders are calling for 
budget cuts to offset funds to assist those of us in the earthquake zone (Jan. 
24). While I am in agreement that we need to balance our federal budget and 
need to have some fiscal responsibility, I do ask that our leaders extend us 
the same financial assistance they would another country had this disaster 
happened elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 If this earthquake occurred in any other country, especially a Third World 
nation, Congress would immediately pass an assistance bill, sending billion of 
dollars as gifts from the Americans. When it is our own, we try to get out of 
this responsibility, or try to find ways to delay the process and charge for 
the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 I have suffered extensive damage from this earthquake, both externally and 
internally. All I want from my government is a loan to repair the physical 
damages, and some understanding and compassion to repair my emotional damage. 
If members of Congress, like the outspoken Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), choose to 
stand in the way, I suggest they spend a few days in my home, and share the 
experience. Perhaps their ivory towers are impervious, but my home and my 
nerves are not.

PERSPECTIVE ON VIETNAM; THE WAR CAN FINALLY END NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLEN E. GOODMAN, Allen E. Goodman is associate dean of the Georgetown 
School of Foreign Service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Clinton ends the U.S. embargo begun in 1964 against North 
Vietnam, he will have ended the war. The lifting of trade sanctions and 
eventual diplomatic recognition will allow the United States to deal with 
Vietnam as a government rather than an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's political advisers, however, are telling him that there are 
still considerable risks involved in normalizing relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 A prime concern is the powerful interest group representing the families of 
American soldiers listed as officially missing in action. This group does not 
believe that the Vietnamese government can be trusted to work toward the 
fullest possible accounting of the MIA cases. The search for definitive facts 
about the 193 "discrepancy cases" -- the airmen who were last seen alive when 
they were captured in North Vietnam but who were neither among the POWs 
returned at the end of the war nor among those whose remains have been 
repatriated -- has so far determined the fate of all but 73. But MIA groups are 
convinced that the Vietnamese withheld information and should, by now, have 
cleared up the remaining cases. Lifting the embargo, the MIA lobby argues, 
would deprive the families of all leverage over the Vietnamese government. 
</P>
<P>
 The riposte is that such leverage no longer exists. Moreover, a permanent and 
ambassadorial presence in Vietnam will allow for much more substantial 
progress. With a U.S. Embassy in Hanoi and consulates throughout the country, 
personnel can be assigned to collect and solicit information about MIAs. Having 
a long-term presence will enhance the ability to distinguish fact from fiction 
and disinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 As Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said earlier this month in Bangkok, "A 
strategy of engagement with Vietnam may be the best way to promote our goal of 
accounting for POWs and MIAs from the war." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever President Clinton does is not likely to produce immediate answers on 
the fates of the MIAs. But if he does nothing else toward improving relations 
with Vietnam, he also risks losing an opening for a genuine breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 The President is likely to resolve this dilemma by applying the lessons of 
U.S. diplomatic history. The United States has consistently tended to seek 
reconciliation with its enemies. The surprise attacks and genocide carried out 
by Germany and Japan during World War II were of a far greater scale than 
anything that the Vietnamese carried out. Eighty thousand U.S. soldiers are 
still officially listed as missing from that war. Yet we have enjoyed the 
closest of relationships with both former adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, some will argue that World War II is different because the United 
States won. But reconciliation with Vietnam gives us the opportunity to win the 
peace, which even the Vietnamese recognize they have so far lost. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much in normalization with Vietnam that will serve American interests 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. goals of creating an Asian-run collective security system and 
eliminating the threat of conflict within the region will only be enhanced by 
the integration of Vietnam into the emerging Pacific community. American 
businesses will also benefit greatly from entering the Vietnamese market now. 
If they are prevented from doing so by a policy adopted in a different 
atmosphere and set of circumstances, our companies will lose the ability to 
compete with Japanese, British, French, Korean, Taiwanese and Australian firms. 
Moreover, much of what Vietnam needs for its future development could be made 
in the United States, creating as many as 50,000 new jobs here. By being able 
to set up manufacturing operations in Vietnam, U.S. firms could also take 
advantage of a highly skilled work force at wages below what they are paying in 
other Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestically, an increasing number of veterans seek ways to visit Vietnam to 
make their own peace; diplomatic relations can facilitate this process. Many 
surveys reveal that the majority of those who fought in the war favor 
normalization of relations and an end to the embargo. Further, by the end of 
the this decade, 2 million Americans will have Vietnamese ancestry; nearly a 
quarter of a million are planning to return to Vietnam for the lunar new year. 
They need the protection and help in restoring family ties that only a 
full-scale embassy can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifting the embargo now will accelerate the integration of Vietnam into the 
post-Cold War international system based on the principles of free and open 
markets, human rights and the peaceful settlement of disputes. As a student, 
Bill Clinton opposed the Vietnam War because he believed such values could not 
be implanted by force. As President, ironically, he could accomplish the very 
purposes for which so many fought and which none of his predecessors achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifting the embargo will help integrate the nation into the world system and 
achieve what we fought for 30 years ago.

COLUMN LEFT/ JONATHAN FREEDMAN: WILSON'S NEW WITCH HUNT: PRENATAL ALIENS; 
DENYING HEALTH CARE TO PREGNANT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IS BARBARIC AND FISCALLY 
FOOLISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN FREEDMAN, Jonathan Freedman is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist 
in San Diego and the author of From Cradle to Grave: the Human Face of Poverty 
in America (Atheneum, 1993). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson wants to halt state-funded prenatal care for undocumented 
immigrants. The rationale is that California can no longer afford to provide 
Medi-Cal to all low-income citizens, let alone illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 The unstated argument runs something like this: California is overwhelmed by 
immigrants who cross the border illegally, take low-paying jobs from Americans 
and have too many babies at taxpayers' expense. The governor can't change 
federal immigration law, although Wilson advocates that undocumented 
immigrants' American-born babies no longer be granted automatic citizenship. 
But, he reasons, California can make itself inhospitable by refusing medical 
care to undocumented mothers-to-be. (Scapegoating illegals also feeds a 
nativist backlash and enables an unpopular governor to distract voters from 
California's real problems.) 
</P>
<P>
 Denying prenatal care to illegal immigrants will only add to the state's 
financial woes. Wilson hopes to save $92 million from the 1994 budget by this 
cut. Yet it eventually will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in 
hospital bills, long-term care, remedial education and lifetime support to 
raise impaired children.  
</P>
<P>
 It's disturbing that Wilson, who came into office committed to a healthy start 
for all children, has abandoned this goal just as progress was being made in 
reducing infant mortality in Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 There are very few things a governor can do that uphold the ultimate value of 
each individual human life and also save tax money. Prenatal care costs about 
$10 a day, compared with $2,000 a day to hospitalize a sick, premature baby. 
Prenatal care sharply reduces the chances of babies being born too small to 
survive on their own. Low-birth-weight babies are 40 times more likely than 
normal-weight babies to die before their first birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The objection to Wilson's proposal is not only economic; it is moral. How a 
society treats babies is a reflection of a civilization's deepest values. 
Preventive checkups and nutrition are the best ways to offer a new generation a 
healthy start in life. Prenatal care is an absolute good. 
</P>
<P>
 Withholding checkups, vaccinations and nutrition from undocumented mothers is 
bad health policy. Once a pregnancy has begun, in the normal course of things a 
baby will be born. The question is whether the mother and child will receive 
low-cost prenatal care or come into the delivery room without ever having seen 
a doctor or nurse practitioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with poor immigrants is not that they overuse prenatal care, but 
that so many never go to a doctor until it's an emergency. Instead of barring 
the undocumented from health care, we should be reaching out to persuade them 
to utilize preventive health services for their benefit -- and for the 
taxpayers' protection.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's proposal undercuts the principle of equality that underlies a 
pluralistic democracy. To deny prenatal care to individuals based on their 
parents' immigration status is to expose an entire class of children, prenatal 
aliens, to a high risk of physical and mental disability. In a society that 
equates healthy bodies and minds with high status, it adds to the stigma of 
illegality a life-long curse of perceived inferiority. 
</P>
<P>
 As immigration policy, withholding prenatal care to undocumented mothers is 
perverse. It threatens to punish the American-born child for the acts of the 
immigrant parent. Low-birth-weight babies start life in torture -- limbs 
stabbed with needles, throats cut to insert breathing tubes, eyes blindfolded 
to protect from bright lights, bodies confined in Isolettes, deprived of human 
touch. And this torture goes on in silence: Low-birth-weight babies can't 
scream because they're hooked up to breathing tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 If we're going to use brain-damaged, blind, deaf and crippled babies to deter 
illegal immigration, let's stick their tiny bodies on posts at the border as a 
warning to expectant mothers. Deploy the Border Patrol at Medi-Cal clinics. 
Arrest doctors who give checkups that prevent birth defects. Hunt down pregnant 
women in the barrios and ship them to Tijuana. Then, at least, Gov. Wilson 
would be honest about what Californians are willing to do to the most 
vulnerable strangers in our midst. 
</P>
<P>
 Human sacrifice will neither balance the budget nor seal the border; Wilson's 
proposal is a barbaric reflection of what we have become.

A MAYOR IN SNEAKERS: RIGHT LEADER FOR A CITY REELING FROM DISASTER; QUAKE: 
RIORDAN HAS BEEN TOUCHING, HOLDING AND REASSURING THE PEOPLE. WILL HIS ABILITY 
TO GET THINGS DONE BECOME THE BASIS FOR A VISION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Xandra Kayden and Xandra Kayden, a visiting scholar at the Center for 
Politics and Economics at the Claremont Colleges, is the author of "Surviving 
Power" (Free Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Great tragedy frequently spawns great leadership. But though Los Angeles is 
recovering from the Northridge earthquake, it is not because the mayor has 
burst forth as a knight in shining armor to lead us through the dust of the 
trembling Earth. Rather, we have had a mayor in sneakers, turning up at one 
disaster site after another, day after day, to touch, hold and reassure shaken 
children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 For Richard Riordan, the quake and its aftermath have provided an 
extraordinary opportunity to learn what works and what doesn't work in city 
government. They may even help him craft a vision for the city, something he 
has, so far, not been able to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, it is difficult to assess Riordan's leadership by more 
conventional standards. The mayor is not entirely responsible for the 
functioning of the Fire Department or the Department of Water and Power, or all 
the city agencies that have risen to this extraordinary occasion. Still, 
Riordan has been quite effective in getting to work on the tasks at hand -- 
tasks that are clear and whose goals are shared by all. His political power is 
growing by leaps and bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But is he evolving into a more effective leader in a city whose preference for 
a weak mayor is written into law? 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, CORO, the national leadership training program, asked two groups of 
people living in Southern California to define leadership. One group was 
composed of neighborhood residents, the other of leaders. Each drew up a list 
of 10 qualities associated with leadership that they valued most. 
</P>
<P>
 On six qualities -- good listener, vision, respect for others, risk-taker, 
integrity and the ability to delegate -- the two groups concurred. The 
neighborhood groups also valued leaders who are open-minded, compassionate, 
self-confident and good communicators, all facets of character, except for the 
last quality. The leaders valued the ability to motivate, to get things done, 
charisma and the ability to inspire -- qualities that emphasize links with 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more interesting findings was that the farther leaders get from 
their communities -- the more successful they are in climbing the ladder of 
power -- the weaker their relationships to their constituents are perceived to 
become. Doubts about them creep in -- partly because of the perceived increase 
in political distance, partly because the higher the office, the more 
vulnerable the officeholder is to media scrutiny. Television strips away that 
quality of charisma that enables us to believe that someone else is better, 
smarter, more blessed than the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in the aftermath of the worst quake in modern L.A. history, television 
seems to have brought Riordan closer to us, closing the distance -- and thus 
the trust gap -- between him and us. In terms of the CORO study, Riordan has 
been seen in the neighborhood, listening, then calling on his car phone to give 
orders. This, more than anything else, may account for his high approval 
ratings in the weeks since the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 A modern, urbane society, we may come to recognize, is not run by one knight 
but thousands of knights, some on horseback, some on mules, some just walking 
their blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a vision of a Los Angeles that works: traffic moving on the freeways, 
homes rebuilt, safety and security from the elements and each other, a 
recovered economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan is doing an extraordinary job in helping make those things happen, and 
while words and sentences are not his strong suit, he does convey a sense of 
purpose and ability. When he stumbles over the words, well, maybe his lack of 
slickness makes him more like us, closer to home, someone to be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 People want leaders to be close to them -- to listen to them, to be connected 
to them, to assure them. It's hard to do that in an urban setting, which may be 
why leaders place more stress on communication. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake brought the mayor out into his city, back to the people. We 
have watched him assume responsibility, take risks and try to get things done. 
That is leadership by any measure, and those traits are among Riordan's 
greatest strengths.  
</P>
<P>
 Learning what works and what doesn't may enable Riordan to see a better 
vision, and that will be the measure of greatness -- if he can bring us along 
with him.

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: WATER, CHOCOLATE: THE 
AFTERTASTE IS SWEET INDEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE GALBRAITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What Hollywood movie project will tantalize the taste buds of "Like Water for 
Chocolate" director Alfonso Arau?  
</P>
<P>
 The picture would have to have some of the same ingredients that made 
"Chocolate" so irresistible, the Mexico native said, like family, romance and 
that oh-so-hard-to-define quality, magical realism. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will always be love and food, those are the two elements of life," he 
said last year, to explain how "Chocolate," and the book written by his 
novelist-screenwriter wife Laura Esquivel, crossed into the record books as the 
highest-grossing Latin American release ever. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a romantic tale set in the vineyards of Napa Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 The story is "A Walk in the Clouds" for MGM, a remake of Alessandro Blasetti's 
1942 Italian movie "Four Steps in the Clouds," the rights to which were 
acquired five years ago by producer Jerry Zucker. 
</P>
<P>
 Zucker, part of the team that made "Airplane!," has more recently moved out on 
his own and into themes about death and afterlife with "Ghost" and "My Life." 
He believed that Arau was a perfect match to direct his remake, and forwarded 
screenwriter Robert Kamen's adaptation to the director at CAA, which signed 
Arau following "Chocolate's" impressive box-office grosses. 
</P>
<P>
 At first Arau, besieged with offers, was reticent. This was a story about an 
Italian-American vintner family forced to cope with their daughter's unexpected 
pregnancy and a suitor who is not the father.  
</P>
<P>
 Arau said he told Zucker that he was only interested if it was a 
Mexican-American-owned winery with the girl in peril dealing with Mexican 
religious and cultural values he could relate to. Also, Arau said he argued, 
"the totality of the workers in Napa and Sonoma are Mexicans," though nearly 
all the wineries were founded and continue to be owned by descendants of 
Italians and Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The themes are larger than life . . . everything I want to film," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, Victoria Aragon, an English literature student at the University 
of San Francisco, is abandoned by the professor who is the father of her unborn 
child. She meets WASP-y chocolate salesman Paul Sutton on the train and he, 
smitten by her, offers to pose as her husband when she returns to face her 
father at the Aragon winery. The two try out the charade over a three-day stay 
-- with unexpected results. 
</P>
<P>
 No casting has been set, although Arau intends to try and find Latino actors 
and actresses for the key roles (except Paul) and currently is conducting a 
search on three continents (including Europe) for the woman who will play 
Victoria. Lumi Cavazos, who played Tita, the cook and passed-over bride in 
"Chocolate," is among those auditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Production is expected to begin in May on location.

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: AD'S LINEAGE; A TRIBUTE 
FROM 'HEIDI' IS NO JOKING MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ad appearing in the Jan. 18 issue of the Hollywood Reporter was enough to 
grab the entertainment world's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressed to veteran Emmy-winning television producer Robert Halmi Sr. 
("Lonesome Dove," "The Josephine Baker Story") as part of a 56-page supplement 
saluting him on his 70th birthday, the ad read: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Bob, You've Always Been My Favorite Client . . . Next One's on Me." 
</P>
<P>
 It was signed: "Heidi." 
</P>
<P>
 The mere mention of the name "Heidi" in Hollywood, of course, conjures up the 
alleged Hollywood madam, Heidi Fleiss, whose arrest last year on pandering and 
drug charges ignited a major scandal at Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The seismic shock waves continued after Vanity Fair recently published an 
article on Fleiss in which she purportedly identified some famous clients of 
her high-priced call-girl ring. The story prompted Fleiss' lawyers to issue a 
statement that she had been grossly misquoted, but the magazine stood by its 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was all the more mystifying to believe that Robert Halmi Sr., a former 
Life magazine photographer who over the past two decades has assembled nearly 
200 productions (including the upcoming $40-million miniseries "Scarlett," 
based on Alexandra Ripley's sequel to "Gone With the Wind") could be getting a 
congratulatory message from that Heidi. 
</P>
<P>
 Or did he?  
</P>
<P>
 No way! came the response from Halmi's New York-based production company, RHI 
Entertainment Inc., when asked if the ad had been placed by Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was done as an inside joke by a person who knows him and thought it would 
be funny to do it this way," said K.C. Schulberg, vice president of marketing 
at RHI Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulberg declined to identify that person, except to say: "The ad was placed 
by a good friend of his who lives in Switzerland and used to share a sheep farm 
with him. It has nothing to do with Heidi or Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Halmi, in fact, didn't even know of the birthday salute until arriving in the 
U.S. late last week for a party. His staff had intended it as a surprise and 
planned to show it to him when he flew in from Africa, where he is shooting 
"The Ascent." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Hollywood Reporter, meanwhile, said they did not think the ad 
was in poor taste, even though the intent of such special sections is to 
celebrate the life and career achievements of the person in question. It has 
published tributes to many entertainment figures, such as Johnny Carson, George 
Lucas and Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate publisher Lynne Segall said that before any tribute is published, 
the person being honored is asked to submit a list of friends or companies that 
would likely take out ads ($1,500 for a talent ad; $2,500 for a company ad) 
honoring that person. "I don't know who placed it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, through a spokesman, had no comment except to say she had nothing to 
do with the ad.

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: STERN'S NEW YEAR'S PARTY 
FALLOUT; 'THE MISS HOWARD STERN PAGEANT' WAS A PAY-TV BONANZA BUT MAY HAVE COST 
HIM A MOVIE CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It looks like Hollywood took one look at Howard Stern's New Year's Eve 
pay-per-view special and decided against making him a movie star. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio executives who once considered courting the titan of trash backpedaled 
furiously after seeing "The Miss Howard Stern New Year's Eve Pageant," in which 
one bare-chested woman ate maggots, another smeared ice cream over her body and 
a third passed out after singing opera with a plastic bag over her head. 
</P>
<P>
 What brought on Hollywood's change of heart over the radio personality, who 
draws 16 million fans for his nationally syndicated show? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because he goes too far, even for Hollywood standards," said one executive at 
Universal, which reportedly thought about making an offer to Stern. (He asked 
to remain anonymous, fearing he would incur Stern's wrath.) 
</P>
<P>
 The special -- which looks to be the top-grossing pay-per-view broadcast ever 
-- certainly went too far for 20th Century Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch, whose TV 
group was seriously considering Stern to replace the short-lived late-night 
Chevy Chase show. Also dropped was Paramount Pictures' offer for a screen 
adaptation of his best-selling autobiography "Private Parts." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the special, New Line Cinema had dropped a deal to produce the film 
"The Adventures of Fartman" -- a fictional avenging angel familiar to Stern's 
radio fans. That deal blew out over disputes regarding content and 
merchandising rights. New Line wanted a PG-rated film, Stern wanted an 
R-rating. New Line wanted to be sole seller of the movie T-shirts, Stern wanted 
his radio stations to hawk them as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Those close to Stern say he has taken the rejections a bit hard. Repeated 
attempts to reach Stern, his producer Gary Dell'abate and manager Don Baldwin 
for comment were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a Howard Stern fan since his WNBC (a New York radio station) days 
and I was one of the ones at New Line who sought him out," says Mike DeLuca, 
president of New Line Cinema production. At one point, DeLuca said, the 
independent production company toyed with a Howard-Stern-Meets-"The Player" 
idea, but squelched the notion as too pretentious. Then New Line decided to 
latch onto a project with the Fartman character Stern played at the 1992 MTV 
Video Music Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a goofy character that has great appeal to the mass public. It's too 
bad this didn't work out," says DeLuca. "It was kind of a mutual understanding 
when we parted ways. We realized we weren't the studio that could make this 
movie." Translation: It takes a major studio's big bucks to give Stern what he 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
 And the studio that could have made a Stern movie wouldn't. Paramount and 
producer David Picker ("Lenny," among other films) backed off from their offer 
after the New Year's Eve special aired. While parties involved say that the 
special had nothing to do with it, the timing was curious. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio set a $9-million budget cap on the movie, but offered no up-front 
book option money. Instead, Stern, who would be the star, would share in the 
film's profits from the first dollar earned. But Paramount sources say that he 
wanted the up-front money and thought he could get a better offer after the 
special. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they say Stern hoped that Paramount's offer would spark a feeding 
frenzy from other studios. "When we didn't hear back from him, we knew he was 
shopping around trying to get another movie deal," said one Paramount 
executive. "But it blew up in his face." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount probably won't be courting Stern again. Ditto for other studios -- 
or so they say. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stern previously has said he has received other movie offers -- another 
for "Private Parts" and one for an undisclosed story. But their identity is 
something Stern, for once, is keeping private.

STAGE WATCH: 'THE JEFFERSONS' ARE MOVIN' ON UPSTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Jeffersons" are back, but this time they're on Marla Gibbs' own stage, 
not CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening Thursday at Gibbs' 1,050-seat Vision Theatre in Leimert Park is "The 
Jeffersons -- Movin' on Up Tour," a staging of three of the 22-minute scripts 
from the long-running sitcom that made Gibbs a star. The cast includes most of 
the stars of the TV series: Gibbs as Florence the maid, Isabel Sanford and 
Sherman Hemsley as George and Louise (Weezie) Jefferson, Franklin Cover and 
Berlinda Tolbert as Tom Willis and his daughter Jenny, and Ned Wertimer as 
Ralph the doorman. 
</P>
<P>
 It'll be Gibbs' first professional production in the theater she bought in 
1990, and the first time an Actors' Equity production contract has been used at 
the venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs, who is not an Equity member herself, hopes the theater will be used by 
other Equity productions. But its first priority will be for community 
productions that help develop local talent, she added. It already has been used 
by the L.A. Festival and for a variety of concerts, student productions and 
special events. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs' Crossroads National Education and Arts Center is planning to produce a 
season at the theater beginning next month. Expected on the schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Meeting," the Jeff Stetson drama about a fictitious meeting between 
Martin Luther King and Malcolm X (Feb. 24-March 13). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Before It Hits Home," the controversial first major play by the rising 
young writer Cheryl West, two of whose plays will be produced at the Old Globe 
in San Diego this year. "Before It Hits Home" examines the impact of AIDS on a 
black family; Gibbs hopes to play the mother (March 31-April 16). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hell's a Poppin'," a musical by Mickey Stevenson (May) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Look at Me," a new piece by Barbara Montgomery and Hattie Winston. (June) 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Vision Complex's smaller theater, Crossroads plans to present "The 
Other Weapon," "Frederick Douglass" with William Marshall and "Mitote." 
</P>
<P>
 A subscription package will be offered, said Avril Harris, Crossroads 
executive director. She estimated the budget for the theater season at $1.3 
million. Professional actors will be used in most of the productions, though 
they will be working under individual Actors' Equity Guest Artist contracts 
rather than using an overall contract for the entire season. Students at the 
Crossroads Arts Academy also will participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Information about the season will be available at performances of "The 
Jeffersons." But will people really pay to see "The Jeffersons," when they can 
see reruns on TV for free? "They have to stay up until 2 a.m." to do so, 
replied Gibbs. "And they really want to see us live." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 N.O.T.E. NOTES: You know you're in trouble when you see ABC's Peter Jennings 
reporting on earthquake damage from in front of your building. That happened to 
the New One-act Theatre Ensemble, whose Theatre of N.O.T.E., just north of 
Hollywood Blvd. and Kenmore, is in a building that has been condemned. The 
company is "searching frantically" for new quarters, said house manager Margo 
Rose-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 A fund-raiser to assist that effort has been scheduled for Feb. 26, location 
to be announced. Information: (213) 666-5550. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre of N.O.T.E. appears to be the only professional theater group that was 
made homeless by the quake, though American Renegade Theatre and Actors Alley 
-- both in North Hollywood -- suffered major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, more than 1,500 people turned out to see "Les Miserables" at the 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium on Jan. 17, the same day as the quake. There was no 
curfew in Pasadena. During its two-week run, "Les Miz" took in house-record 
grosses for one night ($130,323), one week ($845,973) and two weeks 
($1,601,452).*

ON THE RECORD: HITTING A BULL'S-EYE WITH PEAK-PERIOD MOZART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When conductor Roger Norrington knocked us for a variety of loops six years 
ago with his "historically informed" EMI set of the nine Beethoven symphonies, 
on period instruments, with its radically rethought tempos and balances, the 
feeling was that a massive revolt against anachronistic Romantic tradition had 
taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 That stunned first reaction was soon replaced by the humbler notion that a 
promising start toward a permanent change in interpretive attitude had been 
made, that others would come along to refine Norrington's cheekily intelligent 
notions. And that has come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 No comparable sensation was created by Norrington's subsequent recorded foray 
into period opera with Mozart's "Die Zauberflote." Not because his ideas were 
alien, but because there seemed to be so few of them, along with a certain lack 
of energy, to say nothing of a paucity of first-rate vocalism. 
</P>
<P>
 With his recently released "Don Giovanni" (EMI 54859, 3 CDs), however, 
Norrington comes as close to a bull's-eye as we've yet had with period Mozart 
opera. This is a powerful, convincing performance, both as scholarship and as 
communicative drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Norrington and EMI score major points for giving us both versions of the 
opera: the original, first heard in Prague in October, 1787, the second being 
the Vienna revision of some months later, to which were added, most 
significantly, Elvira's "Mi tradi " and Ottavio's "Dalla sua pace." 
</P>
<P>
 You can program your CD player for either version, or listen to both, with 
material common to Prague and Vienna coming first, followed by Prague and 
Vienna on separate tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed is, of course, one of the obvious differences between this "Don 
Giovanni" and the others. Here, as we assume was the custom in Mozart's time, 
tempos are not only fast, but there are far fewer tempo fluctuations within a 
number, whether aria or recitative, than we are accustomed to hearing. Yet, 
where it makes sense to be slower than is customary, such as in the Don's 
"Champagne" aria, whose text and music can become gabble at the usual hectic 
speed, the comfort of the singer and the sense of the text are paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 The title role is handled with thrilling panache by Andreas Schmidt, his Don 
aristocratically charming, seductive, threatening by turns. He is perfectly 
complemented by the darker-voiced, peasant Leporello of Gregory Yurisich. 
</P>
<P>
 The women comprise a strong trio, with Lynne Dawson a touching Elvira, Amanda 
Halgrimson an appropriately fiery Donna Anna, her characterization refreshingly 
free of harridan histrionics, while Nancy Argenta is a strong-willed Zerlina, 
immune to soubrette cutesiness. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mark Ainsley's tenorino is more pallid than necessary for Ottavio's 
dramatic platitudes and a shade underpowered for his musical marvels. But he 
has the breath for the longest-spun phrases of both his arias. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra, the London Classical Players, creates a splendidly pungent, 
penetrating sound in the tuttis, while the instrumental solos are exceptionally 
sweet and clear. And, not least important, the singers' execution of 
appoggiaturas is strictly enforced by the conductor, who clearly views them not 
as historical curiosities, but as vital expressive enhancements. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among the recent releases is a live-performance recording (Budapest, 
1992) of Mozart's "Cosi fan Tutte." Sigiswald Kuijken directs his snazzy period 
ensemble, La Petite Bande, and a group of talented, enthusiastic young singers, 
not one of whose names I had previously encountered and for whom no biographies 
are provided (Accent 9296/98, 3 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 Kuijken, too, leads his opera at a bracing clip, never with speed for its own 
sake or contrary to the capabilities of his singers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mozart-Da Ponte wit comes through, and there's some distinguished singing 
and characterization, above all from the Fiordiligi, soprano Soile Isokoski. 
Appoggiaturas are in plentiful supply here, too, but, being a live performance, 
a singer occasionally forgets. 
</P>
<P>
 As a whole, this is a far from contemptible "Cosi," but hardly an improvement 
on the competing period production on the Oiseau-Lyre label conducted by Arnold 
Ostman: a stronger overall showing than the "Don Giovanni" from the same 
source.

"all-star" label is a legitimate one.Despite generally excellent soloing and

there is a complete lack of ensemble personality.

<P>
 "Tiananmen!" 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Note  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Jang's first Soul Note album was disjointed but there's no trace of that 
problem on "Tiananmen!" The Bay Area pianist's ensemble -- augmented by guest 
James Newton (flute) -- evokes a myriad of moods by deftly blending jazz and 
Asian music elements and instrumentation, fiery improvisation, and provocative 
ensemble packages and arrangements.One brief portion halfway through "Fifth 
Modernization" tells the story of this constantly inventive, changing music -- 
an ensemble melody played by Asian instruments suddenly shifts gears to four 
hard-swinging, horn-dominated bars a la Mingus and then seamlessly slips back 
to the melody again.

 * * * Muhal Richard Abrams, "FamilyTalk," Black Saint. After two superb 
big-band outings that masterfully blended abstract tone colors with the verve 
of the African American music tradition, this sextet session is a relaxed 
stroll in the woods.Four of the six pieces run between 14 and 17 minutes, so 
there's plenty of open space in the arrangements for soloing mixed with Abrams' 
trademark flair for unusual instrumental colors. "FamilyTalk" may lack the 
gripping density of Abrams' big-band albums, but the leader's on a big-time 
creative roll right now -- the people who hand out those genius grants wouldn't 
go wrong throwing one his way.

 Blue Note  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 This four-CD box (4 1/2 hours of music) includes 36 cuts, all but the final 25 
minutes being classics from the 1960s. Though Henderson is the leader on only 
10 tracks, his tenor is prominent throughout on selections led by Bobby 
Hutcherson, Duke Pearson, Andrew Hill et al. 
</P>
<P>
 The set could as well have been issued as "Best of Blue Note." Sad to say, 
many giants of that era heard here have left us: trumpeters Kenny Dorham, Lee 
Morgan, Woody Shaw and the memorable Blue Mitchell, whose solo on "Sweet and 
Lovely" is a gem. Most of the pianists, though, are still among us: Horace 
Silver, McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock, Tommy Flanagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson's sound and maturity differed little 30 years ago from his 
much-lauded work today. For proof, compare the first cut, "Sao Paolo" in 1963, 
with the final item, from a 1990 date with Renee Rosnes. Why it took so long 
for fame to overtake him is anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). LEONARD FEATHER

EMERGENCY AID FOR SCOREBOARD RAISES HACKLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * One has to wonder about the priorities of our governor and local leaders 
when they declare a state of emergency in Orange County because of $3 million 
to $4 million of quake damage at Anaheim Stadium. Let Anaheim impose a 
short-term quake repair surcharge on parking at the stadium, and declare 
instead a state of emergency for California's markedly decaying schools, 
universities, and libraries.

<P>
 * Why am I not surprised by the greedy action the Anaheim City Council took 
over the loss of the Jumbotron scoreboard during the Northridge earthquake? By 
trying to get state and federal disaster relief funds to repair a professional 
sports scoreboard, the City Council, Supervisor (Thomas F.) Riley, Governor 
(Pete) Wilson, and ultimately, the President, have demeaned the suffering of 
the real earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much "priority" they claim they want to be given the real 
earthquake victims, it is just wrong to use state and federal disaster relief 
money to replace an elaborate sports scoreboard. Any money that would be spent 
on scoreboard replacement should go instead to such necessities as school and 
hospital repair. I wonder what the taxpayers in Northern California, San Diego, 
or the Midwest think about us using their disaster relief money to replace a 
scoreboard. As a resident of Anaheim, I am ashamed of this "theft" by my City 
Council, Board of Supervisors chairman and governor.

</P>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim is no more a quake victim than I am. Applying for relief 
to restore Anaheim Stadium's round-heeled scoreboard is an irresponsible, 
opportunistic grab for a free lunch that cheapens the suffering of the real 
victims of this disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 When a close friend's car was burglarized years ago, he dabbled in insurance 
fraud, explaining it was his "right," somehow, to lay a false claim against his 
years of premium payments. The incident changed the way I felt about him 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim's grab for state disaster relief smells of the same species of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The swooning scoreboard was the only significant damage in the county. Could 
it be that it was defective as built? If so, the appropriate action is against 
the builders, not the states' overtaxed relief fund. Accountability demands 
that the buck stops here, not in Sacramento. The relief is not infinite in 
nature and there are more than enough genuine victims of the quake. 
</P>

 * Here is a good way to solve the problem of the collapsed scoreboard of the 
big A. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the athletes -- who use the stadium to earn megabucks -- chip in to pay 
for the repairs. After all it is for their benefit -- and since they all earn 
more than common sense would dictate, they could pay for it easily and monies 
that should go to those in real need could be allocated properly.

 * I am disgusted and embarrassed that the Orange County Board of Supervisors 
has declared Orange County a "disaster area" for the sole purpose of siphoning 
off precious federal money to repair a high-tech scoreboard at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 They have made the people of Orange County look like greedy, self-serving 
opportunists. If Orange County is a disaster area, it is not due to earthquake 
damage, but to their misguided action. They should do the right thing, and 
withdraw their declaration at once.

TIME FOR OPENNESS ON EL TORO'S REUSE; * PANEL'S SEATING WAS MILESTONE; CANDOR 
NEXT ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of controversy, representatives of the county and the cities 
closest to the base finally sat down last week to start discussing what to do 
with the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station after the Marines leave. If the past 
is prologue, the talks will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the planning sessions should be marked by refreshing openness, unlike 
the recently acknowledged suppression last year of part of a regional report 
that surely will be of use to the participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, relations between proponents and opponents of converting El Toro into 
a commercial airport have become increasingly strained and largely have pitted 
North County against South County. Cities in the north, the main backers of the 
airport proposal, complained they were being left out of the planning process. 
The divisiveness spilled over to the Board of Supervisors.  
</P>
<P>
 After a number of false starts, a welcome agreement was finally reached that 
the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority would consist of the five county 
supervisors, three Irvine City Council members and one Lake Forest council 
member. Representatives from other cities will be on subcommittees. However, 
the formation of the reuse authority did not stop the bickering over issues 
like Irvine's wish to annex El Toro. But actually sitting at the table did 
allow the planning to begin.  
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department has always said it wants to deal with one entity 
representing Orange County, and local officials must heed that warning. In the 
difficult process of planning for El Toro's future, give thanks for even small 
milestones. 
</P>
<P>
 The process was not helped by the Southern California Assn. of Governments' 
suppression last April of the part of a report on aviation showing that the 
base had a good chance of being a successful civilian airport. The suppression 
would seem to be illegal, given a California Supreme Court ruling that 
"selective disclosure" of information by a public agency is unlawful. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Assn. of Governments' Executive Director Mark Pisano said 
it was not illegal because the report was not officially transmitted. But even 
if he's technically correct, the full report should have been released in the 
spirit of giving the current base planners the best and most complete available 
thinking. The study was funded by the Federal Aviation Administration, meaning 
taxpayers paid for it and had a right to know its contents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Assn. of Governments is a regional planning group 
whose members include numerous cities and counties, including Orange County. It 
should draw up plans, not calculate the political effect of its information and 
conclusions, and use the anticipated fallout as justification for suppressing 
its reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The part of the study that was made public examined the impact on existing 
regional airports such as Orange County's John Wayne Airport if Norton Air 
Force Base in San Bernardino County and March Air Force Base in Riverside 
County were downsized or closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The portion that was not made public, but was provided to John Wayne Airport 
officials, also addressed the possible consequences of closing El Toro. The 
Times was able to obtain the full report only by filing a request under the 
California Public Records Act. But information needed for a fully informed 
public debate must be made public when it becomes available, not months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the entire report has now become available outside the 
association of governments and John Wayne Airport. That's good for the 
important planning now under way, but the report should not have been so 
difficult to obtain.

VISION OF AGRAN'S FOES IS A BAD SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I had to respond to John Jaeger's grossly misleading letter ("Budget 
Shortfall and Continuing Fiscal Problems Plaguing Irvine," Jan. 23), which 
attempts to pin all of Irvine's fiscal woes on former Mayor Larry Agran.  
</P>
<P>
 I was a budget analyst and a City Council aide for Irvine from 1985 through 
1990.If one were to total the cost of programs proposed by Mayor Agran, I 
suspect it would be far less than 1% of Irvine's operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Mr. Jaeger's assertions, Agran and his colleagues proposed 
programs that demanded fiscal responsibility and accountability from city 
staff. City Council member Cameron Cosgrove, an Agran ally, proposed an 
economic uncertainty reserve fund that set aside money for the more difficult 
times ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this fund that allowed Irvine to keep afloat during the early recession 
years, which by the way began after Agran and Cosgrove were defeated for 
reelection in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Agran's opponents have had 3 1/2 years to implement their vision of paradise. 
Their track record so far seems to have been one of fiscal irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't see Mr. Jaeger offering any constructive solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to stop painting Larry Agran as Evil Incarnate and start admitting 
that he was right.

SUPPORT, CRITICISM REGARDING QUAKE AID TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In regard to the latest anti-immigrant proposal voiced by Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), "Rohrabacher Proposes Legislation to Deny 
Federal Quake Relief to Illegal Immigrants" (Jan. 23), he once again has joined 
in the ever-increasing wave of immigrant bashing by further fueling the issue 
with insensitivity, ignorance and racist overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, immigrants, especially those of Latin American countries, have 
had the tendency to not demand or even request any type of social service from 
the county, state or federal level. This will be confirmed after results of 
quake relief are available. 
</P>
<P>
 CESAR MADRID 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 * Well, once again Rep. Dana Rohrabacher has stepped forward to voice what 
many feel and do not have the guts to say, let alone put in print: California's 
taxpaying, legal residents are being raped and plundered once again to pay 
hundred of millions of dollars to help illegal immigrants who have no legal 
right to be in this country in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Rohrabacher is "cruel" because he believes American quake-relief dollars 
should only go to American citizens. The only problem that Rohrabacher has is 
that he is the only man with enough guts to speak the truth while the silent 
majority hides and mutters under their breath what the congressman says! 
</P>
<P>
 BRUCE PARDUE 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Shame, shame on Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. It is sad that any American, let 
alone a representative of the people, would even think to not provide help to 
another human being in a time of disaster.  
</P>
<P>
 PAMELA CROMER 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Of all the mean-spirited proposals to come out of the immigration debate, 
the most recent one from Rep. Rohrabacher on denying federal quake relief to 
illegal immigrants deserves special recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 How can "hundreds of millions of dollars" go to illegal immigrants when (the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency) will not approve a loan unless it can be 
repaid, and grants up to $12,000 to replace essential possessions and housing 
will end up back in the economy, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher should listen to the thousands of Americans who are giving their 
time, money and donations to help those devastated by the quake -- whether they 
are here legally or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts better represent the true spirit of America than our elected 
officials do with their inflamed rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 SUSAN PERLSON 
</P>
<P>
 Brea 
</P>
<P>
 * I was appalled and saddened, but not surprised, by Rep. Rohrabacher's latest 
proposal to deny federal aid to illegal immigrants who suffered loss due to the 
recent earthquake. It really serves to further prove what a bigot he really is. 
Rohrabacher said in regard to this issue that "we have to use our hearts, but 
we have to use our heads." Rohrabacher is incapable of doing either, since he 
is both heartless and ignorant. 
</P>
<P>
 Any illegal immigrants affected by the earthquake who had managed to create 
some semblance of an existence are just as entitled to federal aid as citizens 
are.  
</P>
<P>
 It is time that the thin veil that weakly covers Mr. Rohrabacher's hatred and 
prejudice be lifted once and for all. I do not believe that intelligent and 
compassionate individuals can be fooled by Mr. Rohrabacher's divisive and 
racist attempts to lead Californians into the black hole of cruelty and 
bigotry, particularly in such a time of need as this. 
</P>
<P>
 TANYA MCGUIRE-GUZMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 * While viewing nonstop TV coverage of the earthquake news and subsequent 
lines of people applying for aid, I couldn't help thinking: "How many of these 
people can our government support?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Arturo Montes of the League of United Latin American Citizens states that 
Dana Rohrabacher's comments are "racist." Anytime anyone questions handouts 
given to illegal immigrants, whether it includes free health care or free 
education, that person is labeled a "racist." 
</P>
<P>
 I hope this earthquake has "shaken up" more people into realizing that the 
disaster relief pit is not bottomless and, unless we monitor who gets the 
money, we who live here legally will have to do with less so those who live 
here illegally can have more. 
</P>
<P>
 The American pie is only so big.

GREED FUELS POLICE, FIREFIGHTER UNIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It may seem highly inappropriate to criticize our public-servant 
firefighters and police in light of the many heroic acts some of these 
personnel performed during the earthquake and recent fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the recent actions of police and firefighters in regard to 
blue-flu sickouts (Anaheim) and overtime requests (Westminster) to achieve 
labor-union goals are outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 These public servants in Orange County do not work in cities with high-rises 
and crime problems as would occur outside Orange County. When I last checked 
average police and firefighter salaries, they seemed quite liberal in view of 
the economic troubles affecting our municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe money, and money only, is at the root of the disputes and work 
stoppages, and "raiding the till" does not serve anyone's interests -- the 
public's or the public servants'. It takes a brave city administrator to face 
these unions these days to bring economic reality into focus. Constant floods 
of self-aggrandizing PR make the job of a city/county administrator too 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't these public-service personnel take a close look at what's happening 
in the real world -- the private sector. I hope their next siren is a wake-up 
call. Too much greed -- even for good guys and gals. 
</P>
<P>
 DOUGLAS BENNETT 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point 
</P>
<P>
 * I want to congratulate the cops of Anaheim for their sickout during the 
height of the earthquake crisis in Southern California. Their compassion, 
commitment and concern for our public safety is deeply appreciated, and the 
people of Anaheim will never forget it, I can assure you. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim cops complain that they haven't had a raise in 18 months. Big deal! I 
haven't had a raise in over 36 months. So what does that prove? Absolutely 
nothing, that's what. I know a lot of good people who don't even have a job, 
let alone a raise. What about them? 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim cops are simply angry because they now make less than cops in Santa 
Ana, Huntington Beach and a few other highly overtaxed cities. But a more 
rational case can be made that cops in those cities are overpaid, not that 
Anaheim cops are underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The real problem is that over the years there has been a needless and costly 
competitiveness in police pay. In a way, it has become a high-stakes poker game 
between police unions, with the taxpayers picking up the tab. Anaheim cops now 
think it's their turn for a raise. Next time it will be another city. So goes 
the cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it is obvious Anaheim cops have lost touch with the reality of the 
labor market in the private sector. The fact is that police pay, pensions and 
benefits are already far superior to most other professions or occupations. 
Furthermore, there is no real shortage of well-qualified applicants who are 
ready, willing and able to do the job.

A LAWYER JUST ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE LAW; * JAMES GUNDERSON ESCAPES DISBARMENT 
BY QUITTING PRACTICE; MAY HIS LEGACY BE A LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorney James D. Gunderson, target of a State Bar investigation for allegedly 
plundering the estates of elderly Leisure World clients, has resigned from his 
practice, even as prosecutors prepared to file conflict-of-interest charges 
that could have led to his disbarment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson's attorney said recently that the resignation had been planned for a 
long time and that his client had never been disciplined. Well, maybe so. But 
here is one lawyer who will not be forgotten readily, and that is not because 
he never was disciplined, nor because he got out before his peers routed him 
from their ranks. The publicity he received at the end of his career will stand 
primarily as a catalyst for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In this manner, the Gunderson case likely will take a place of prominence in 
the annals of Orange County scandals. He resigned 14 months after The Times 
detailed how he inherited millions of dollars in cash, stock and real estate 
from clients whose wills and trusts were prepared by him and other members of 
his law firm. The inheritances remain under investigation by the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But already the attorney has inspired change. The Bar is obviously concerned 
about potential damage to the image of the profession. It is working toward 
adoption of a new rule making lawyers subject to disbarment for preparing wills 
or trusts that bequeath them gifts. And the Gunderson case already has led to 
the enactment of a bill sponsored by Assemblymen Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) 
and Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) restricting attorneys from making themselves 
beneficiaries of estates. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson of the Gunderson case was put well by the Orange County Trial 
Lawyers Assn.: "This should be a message to all professionals that they 
absolutely will be held accountable for their conduct and they are not above 
the law."

WETLANDS PLANS SHOULD BE AIRED PUBLICLY; * COUNTY'S REFUSAL TO HOLD HEARINGS IN 
HUNTINGTON ON BOLSA CHICA REPORT ERODES TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bolsa Chica wetlands are a heavily tarnished jewel, awaiting restoration. 
Though surrounded by Huntington Beach, they are part of unincorporated Orange 
County, and a magnet for visitors eager to view migratory waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The state uses a tiny part of the wetlands off Pacific Coast Highway to 
maintain the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. The largest part of the property 
is owned by the Koll Real Estate Group, which wants to build more than 4,000 
homes on 400 acres. In return it promises to restore 1,100 acres that are now 
mostly mud and old oil wells. 
</P>
<P>
 The development plans have sparked heated debate, and city residents deserve 
to have their opinions aired. Yet the Orange County Environmental Management 
Agency, which is involved in the planning because Bolsa Chica is in 
unincorporated territory, has refused to hold a public hearing in Huntington 
Beach on the county's report. It was released last month and concerns the 
environmental impact on the wetlands of proposed development plans. Instead, 
the county said it will take only written comments at this time. That's a 
shortsighted attitude. Many in the city became suspicious when Koll last year 
exercised its right to switch review of its plans from Huntington Beach to the 
county, despite an earlier agreement to let the city be the lead reviewer. The 
switch came after City Council members considered more pro-environment attained 
a majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Refusing to hold public hearings in Huntington Beach erodes trust in 
government. It also discourages participation in the affairs of the community, 
when government should encourage such activity. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be public hearings later on the plan, but they will be in Santa Ana 
before the County Planning Commission. The county should hold at least one of 
them in Huntington Beach. This project is too important for business as usual.

CORRIDOR ALIGNMENT IS BEST SOLUTION

 * As a managing principal at UMA Engineering, I felt it important to set the 
record straight regarding an article ("Group Fails to Win Change in Toll Road," 
Jan. 15) with respect to the development of alignment alternatives for the 
connection of the future San Joaquin Hills Corridor to I-5. In this article, 
UMA Engineering is described as "tainted" by Bob King, spokesman for the SOS 
group, due to the fact that UMA had previously worked for the Transportation 
Corridor Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 I can assure Mr. King that the engineers at UMA do not and will not sell their 
integrity for any client. We, as engineers, have a great respect for our 
profession and I find it personally offensive to be accused of selling out. 
Furthermore, in my many years of professional experience, I have never seen a 
city bend over backward more for their citizenry than (San Juan Capistrano 
director of engineering and building) Bill Huber and his staff have in 
searching, in complete good faith, for a more viable alignment alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 We at UMA worked diligently, along with city staff, to evaluate any and all 
possible alternatives to the current alignment with the final result being that 
the alignment, as proposed, is simply the best solution considering all of the 
constraints in the area.

BOLSA CHICA DEVELOPMENT PLANS SPARK SOME STRONG OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am an ecologist, so I suppose that that makes me immediately suspect. I am 
also a geologist and a marine biologist. I have been in and around the Bolsa 
Chica wetlands since the 1930s. If we ignore all of the ecological reasons not 
to build on the Bolsa Chica property there are still better reasons to restore 
the whole property to wetlands.  
</P>
<P>
 I lived in Compton in 1933, the last time there was a major quake on the 
Newport-Inglewood fault. When you decide to build 4,000 homes on the Bolsa 
Chica property, you would do well to look at the trace of the Newport-Inglewood 
Fault. When the 1933 quake hit and demolished Long Beach and Compton, including 
the rotary converter at Los Patos, (now Warner), and PCH, everything else just 
inland from Seal Beach to Huntington Beach was what it should be still, a 
tidewater wetlands. Liquefaction was not a problem, it was all mud anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground conditions have not changed. It is still mud, Huntington Harbour 
not withstanding, and it should occur to almost anyone that that whole region 
is a prime area for ground collapse when the next quake hits on that fault. It 
is not a question of "if," only "when." Ask the folks at Koll if they would 
like to place their home office at Warner and Los Patos!

 * Regarding the article "Muddying the Waters Further," (Jan. 22) on the Bolsa 
Chica wetlands: The only vision (Lucy) Dunn (from the Koll Real Estate Group) 
has is dollar signs. When are people going to understand that without an 
environment and the preservation of our natural resources, there won't be a 
future! 
</P>
<P>
 Have a good look at San Juan Capistrano, where's the swallows? Or the toll 
roads that are taking our natural resources, or Unocal's vision of building a 
golf course in the Fullerton hills. Of course they're going to leave an area 
for the birds. Just what we need is a another golf course. That's what I call 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Haven't we destroyed enough of our future? Koll may have the money, but they 
have no vision.

 * Do the people of Huntington Beach know how cavalierly the county is treating 
them? 
</P>
<P>
 The county came to town for what was to have been a dialogue with the 
community about the environmental report. Instead, the county, after agreeing 
to the dialogue, changed the rules and said the only input the community could 
have with the county would be in writing . I urge all citizens of Huntington 
Beach to write to Paul Lanning-EMA/environmental planning division, County of 
Orange, PO Box 4048, Santa Ana, Calif. 92702-4048. Ask him why no one is 
allowed to talk about the EIR to the county?

</P>
<P>
 * The majority of the people I speak to in our city do not want 5,000 or even 
4,000 homes built on the Bolsa Chica ecosystem. That's why a new City Council 
was elected last year. Still, an active minority seems to get a lot of 
publicity by saying those who don't want any more congestion in our city are 
"NIMBYs." In other words "Not in my back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us moved here because we liked the way the town was. We'd like to keep 
it that way as much as we can. What's wrong with that? Less than 5% of the city 
of Huntington Beach hasn't been paved over. Can't we say enough is enough? Is 
Southern California a better place because it now has 24 million instead of 2 
million? 
</P>
<P>
 Koll is the fourth group that has tried to speculate on the Bolsa Chica real 
estate. The county may override our City Council and approve the project, but 
after it's built they'll turn it over to Huntington Beach to administer and 
we'll be forced to accept it within our city borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow that doesn't seem to be democracy in action.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON HEALTH CARE; COUNTY IN GOOD SHAPE, WILL 
FEEL EVEN BETTER AFTER REFORMS; THE GROWTH OF HMOS AND BUSINESS COMMUNITY 
INVOLVEMENT THAT CLINTON HAS CALLED FOR IS ALREADY WORKING HERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BISHOP, Greg Bishop is the director of Business Health Solutions, a 
collaborative project supported by the Orange County business community and 
health care providers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's State of the Union address firmly establishes health care 
reform at the top of America's agenda in 1994, and due to our excessive health 
insurance costs and numbers of uninsured residents, this is great news for 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 More good news is that Orange County is well positioned to progress with 
reform due to the ongoing evolution of our health care market and collaborative 
efforts occurring over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 An underlying principle of both Clinton's plan and the main Republican 
alternative is that "regions" will become responsible for the costs and output 
of their own health care systems. Both plans call for the coalescing of 
employers into regional purchasing cooperatives, which means that health care 
will be priced and delivered on a regional basis. 
</P>
<P>
 We will all benefit to the extent that we lower costs, improve quality, 
decrease our numbers of uninsured and reduce the wasteful use of our health 
care resources. Our success will depend upon our ability to bring together our 
employers, hospitals, physicians, health providers, insurers and consumer 
groups to create the best overall system possible. 
</P>
<P>
 We have already made a good start through Business Health Solutions, a project 
which has brought these constituencies together to work collaboratively toward 
reform of Orange County's $10-billion health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed systems of "managed competition" call for managed care delivered 
through accountable health plans. We are fortunate in that, compared to the 
rest of the nation, most of us already participate in some form of managed care 
and a variety of strong health plans (FHP, Cigna, Kaiser, etc.) are well 
established in our Orange County market. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Industrial League of Orange County is working to coalesce 
employer purchasing power, which will further stimulate our market forces 
toward creating the most cost-effective health plans possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Another initiative by our largest employers to measure the quality and 
performance of health care providers is also in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is particularly burdened by a very high level of excess capacity 
in our regional health care system (over half of our hospital beds are not 
used), which translates into waste and reduced quality. Last year, Hoag 
Hospital closed its heart transplant center to improve the efficiency of its 
cardiac services. We all benefit from such an enlightened step because the 
cost-effectiveness of our remaining heart transplant center will likely improve 
due to a higher volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Our 10 hospitals in the county offering heart surgery is another problem that 
needs to be addressed; consolidation will improve the cost-effectiveness of 
heart surgery here. 
</P>
<P>
 The same applies to many other services as well, and we need to encourage 
consolidation of services by focusing our purchasing on those programs 
delivering the best combination of quality and cost. Important developments in 
this regard are the impending consolidation of Mission Hospital into the St. 
Joseph Health System, and the expansion of physician networks such as Bristol 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major challenge is to reduce our high levels of cost-shifting (i.e., 
those who pay for health care also pay for those who do not) by improving 
access for the poor and the cost-effectiveness of programs that serve them. 
Orange County's OPTIMA project, a new health authority set up with these 
objectives, will begin by reorganizing the $500 million in care delivered 
annually to county Medi-Cal recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Another development is the Industrial League's effort to secure equitable 
treatment for Orange County by the state in the distribution of public funds. 
We need our fair share of resources to address the basic health needs of our 
indigent population, and our growing social problems (teen-age pregnancy, gang 
violence, child abuse, etc.) which translate into higher health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The acceptance of personal responsibility regarding health care is perhaps the 
preeminent challenge we will face. Orange County residents enthusiastically 
consume $10 billion of health care annually, and we are hungry for more. 
</P>
<P>
 To constrain expenditures, we first need to take better care of ourselves. The 
Orange County Wellness Coalition is working to develop a communitywide effort 
to reduce smoking, prevent injuries, improve nutrition and exercise, and 
encourage a wide range of other prevention activities. The Orange County 
Employer Health Coalition has also developed guidelines which call for 
workplace-based wellness programs and incentives for healthy lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 We also need to encourage the rational use of our limited health care 
resources, and reduce our demand for expensive health care services that have 
little or no value. 
</P>
<P>
 We have gotten used to asking for such services because they have been offered 
and someone else was paying. We now need to understand that we all pay, and 
that wasted resources cannot be applied to real needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several important efforts to address this issue are developing in Orange 
County, and they will need our personal commitment to succeed. An example is 
the development of a program being designed to assist those facing terminal 
illness with objective, expert advice on alternatives to futile, expensive and 
often painful, debilitating treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Our progress will continue to depend upon our ability to work together. We are 
fortunate that our leading health providers are more than receptive -- 
insistent is a better term -- to reorganized incentives that reward 
cost-effectiveness, including the shedding of excess capacity. They are eager 
for members of the business community to act in their capacity as purchasers to 
drive reform of the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 We are also fortunate that our business community is stepping up to this 
challenge and taking actions that will benefit us all.

GOP 'FRIENDS': SHOW COMPASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Fair weather friends could precisely characterize the local Orange County 
legislators who "heartily object" to tax increases to help our neighbors in the 
north in repairing our freeways. ("State Lawmakers Warn They Won't Stand Still 
for Earthquake Tax Hike," Jan. 23). 
</P>
<P>
 The earth hadn't stopped shaking before the Republican legislators used the 
opportunity to use the "No Tax" increase phrase as a catalyst into the primary 
election in June. 
</P>
<P>
 As representatives of the people in the state, these legislators ought to be 
proposing ways to assist and help the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was only a few months ago that south Orange County was seeking fire 
relief funding from state and national agencies. How quickly our 
representatives forget. After reading their responses, one could surmise that 
if it comes to a tax increase, there would be absolutely no help for those in 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fair weather friends, where is the compassion for the individuals who 
suffered and are still suffering from the earthquake? The most unkind and least 
compassionate statement, and most politically convenient remark, was from Rep. 
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), who said that he plans to introduce 
legislation that will require disaster victims to show proof of legal residency 
before receiving funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "Once 
people realize that there is free money available, the line will be 
never-ending and will reach all the way to the border," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What if the earthquake had struck Orange County and rattled the windows in 
Oceanside, where one of the legislators resides? How about in Huntington Beach? 
What would our fair weather friends say then about taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that we all visualize the creative ways we can build a greater 
society together and use the earthquake experience to better the lives of 
everyone.

BIRTHDAY SUITE; THE HOTEL DEL CORONADO: A LITTLE BIT GINGERBREAD, A LITTLE 
GRANDE DAME, AND RIGHT FOR AN IMPORTANT DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, Times Staff Writer; Dean writes for The Times' View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Birthdays that end with a zero, those serious fetes when mortality moves one 
closer to his Maker's place of business, seem to bring out the ageistic worst 
in friends. 
</P>
<P>
 There's that old thigh slapper of presenting a proxy enrollment in the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons. Reeeally hilarious gag gifts are birthday 
cards that force humor about dinosaurs, George Burns, proctologists, prunes, 
Medicare, headstones, descending body parts, Polygrip and, ha ha, Fabio at 80. 
</P>
<P>
 "So a surprise birthday party at Andy Rooney's Twilight Home for Doddering 
Journalists is out of the question?" asked my lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely. Her looks, of course, haven't budged since 1968. She admits to no 
life before Meat Loaf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I will kidnap you for a Dorian Gray weekend of champagne, salt and 
cholesterol-rich dining, tennis, the beach . . . in a place that has survived 
many more decades than you," she promised. 
</P>
<P>
 And so we drove two hours and change from Los Angeles to a package weekend at 
the Hotel del Coronado, that white-and-maroon wooden wedding cake on a Pacific 
peninsula just one bay and a bridge west of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been coming here for 20 years and never met a room I didn't like. Being a 
sentimental traveler with a preference for inns before motels, and bed and 
breakfast weekends to four-star American plans, I have never stayed at the 
Del's modern but architecturally coordinated annex, raised in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 But its history is as tangible as beaches and breezeways recognizable from the 
movie "Some Like It Hot," which I've seen nine times. The past is as touchable 
as the handshake of 50-year tennis director Ben Press, an early tournament 
partner of the late Maureen (Little Mo) Connolly. Press still teaches. 
</P>
<P>
 I love the warm, musty smell of 106-year-old sugar pine paneling on the Del's 
walls, dark halls and ceilings. How many layers of paint on those balustrades? 
Probably one a year since 1888. The hotel should charge for riding and swaying 
in the bronze bird cages that pass for elevators, which are better in their way 
than the lifts in L.A.'s Bradbury Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 400 original rooms have been restored, renovated and reproduced 
by the great chunk, their floors still groan and slope. Striped wallpaper, 
wainscoting and sconces are the antique way they were. Spectravision and 
mini-bars are there in deference to today, but don't really fit the aura. C'est 
la guerre.  
</P>
<P>
 My lady has her memories of the Del. She came here for Sunday burgers and 
Cokes on the ocean terrace when dad still held her hand crossing the street. 
Now I buy the burgers and hold her hand. C'est la vie.  
</P>
<P>
 I chose the hotel's Gourmet Delight package for my birthday kidnaping because 
of a price you feel tempted to call back and confirm in a disguised voice. It's 
that good. 
</P>
<P>
 The stay was two nights and three days, allowing a Friday afternoon arrival 
and a 2 p.m. checkout on Sunday. Dinners and extravagant brunches were 
included. So were spa privileges to work off any excess. The cost, for two, was 
a near-piddling $514. Including fresh flowers in a king-size room with a 
partial view of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Our room was 3325 and typical Del, which is huge and high-ceilinged Victorian. 
The wallpaper was a striped print and the chandelier grew out of a plaster 
sculpture in the center of the ceiling. With lights low, with windows staring 
into a Pacific sunset, with champagne hissing in flutes bought in the gift 
shop, a man forgets birthdays and considers staying young forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first-night dinner for two was at the clubby, pubby, very paneled Prince 
of Wales restaurant, with everything included in the package price except for 
lobster, caviar, liquor and the tip. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Veal Oscar -- supposedly first prepared at the Del -- has passed away 
with Chef Oscar, Steak Diane is the replacement specialty. Ours was performed 
tableside, of course, didn't spare the truffles but was easy on the pepper and 
quite exquisite. We gave an honorable mention to a superb starter, wild 
mushrooms en crou te . 
</P>
<P>
 With that lineup came a bottle of Silver Oak, a mellow red and the gift of a 
surprise dinner guest -- my son PJ, a soon-to-be firefighter who had flown in 
from Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "Silver Oak costs many pieces of silver and my guess would be $70," I 
protested. "You have five more months in college, an apartment lease to feed, 
Brigid to court, and a truck to pay for. Restraint is indicated." 
</P>
<P>
 PJ pulled out his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also have a brand-new Visa card to break in," he said. "Celebration is 
indicated. Hey, this is a serious birthday ending in a zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, how quickly they grow up. Only yesterday we were eating fried fish 
sticks in a restaurant shaped like a stern wheeler and PJ blew his nose into 
his napkin. 
</P>
<P>
 But back to the Del. The only drawback to this evening was a maitre d' who 
wouldn't have lasted a wet weekend at Denny's. Our 8 p.m. reservation turned 
into an 8:45 p.m. seating with explanations making absolutely no sense. His 
only apology was a freebie after-dinner drink that mixed Frangelico with 
Baileys Irish Cream and caressed the tonsils like Nyquil. 
</P>
<P>
 Our second-night appetites were taken to the hotel's historic Crown Room -- 
Charles Lindbergh was feted here in the '20s, and the Prince of Wales in the 
'30s -- where liquor and tip are the only extras because lobster and caviar 
aren't on the menu. Although the food was not quite to Prince of Wales' levels, 
the rack of lamb Wellington for me, and the seafood linguine for her, were 
several levels better than adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was a Crown Room brunch for two at a buffet that is a one-story 
embarrassment -- certainly enough to feed Bosnia for a week -- of eggs 
Benedict, pasta, smoked salmon, omelets, sea food, fruits and berries, turkeys 
and standing rib roasts. 
</P>
<P>
 This being my birthday, on Saturday morning I chose to hit with assistant head 
pro Scooter Henson on one of the hotel's six oceanside tennis courts. He's a 
27-year-old former professional hockey player wrapping up a BA in American 
literature to give himself enough career flexibility to teach tennis until his 
knees give out. Where did the rest of us go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 It was a superb morning with Scooter never the patronizing pro, always the 
hard-hitting, cross-courting opponent elevating your game and your hoping it 
will make him sweat. Which it does. Hah! 
</P>
<P>
 My lady, meanwhile, was exercising our complimentary spa admission and 
exercising; life cycling and tread milling before broiling and poaching in 
sauna and steam rooms. At night we wandered the Del's gardens and grounds that 
are tidy enough to have been trimmed by nail clippers, and inhaled the musk of 
palms and plants in sea air. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day there's a village nearby, the adjacent and tiny Navy town of 
Coronado, where the average house costs $450,000 and every other homeowner is a 
retired admiral. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you do nothing else at Coronado, get up early enough to be considered town 
folk, and walk half a mile along Orange Avenue, past small and neat stores, to 
the Night and Day Cafe. It has been open, of course, day and night and around 
13 overflowing stools for about 60 years. OK, so Bev behind the counter slops 
melted butter on the griddle with a paintbrush and lets a yellow river run 
through a small mountain of hash browns. The sausage is thicker than flapjacks, 
there isn't a kiwi fruit in sight and this is Cholesterol Central. 
</P>
<P>
 But you want Coronado lore for the folks back home? Management of the Day and 
Night has changed several times and none more dramatically or romantically than 
1944. That's when the deed switched owners in a crap game. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Del, anytime is the perfect time to walk a beach of mushroom-tan sand 
that's bigger than Dodger Stadium with all its parking lots.  
</P>
<P>
 My lady used to comb these beaches and find maybe a dozen sand dollars in an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend we found only five. 
</P>
<P>
 It must be the economy. Budget for Two

<P>
 Gourmet Delight package, Hotel del Coronado: $514 
</P>

HIKING: SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS; A PEAK VIEW ABOVE ANGELES CREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A splendid view of high mountain summits and the wide Los Angeles basin is a 
hiker's reward for climbing to the top of the San Gabriel Mountains' namesake 
peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyramid-shaped San Gabriel Peak, at the crest of the front range high above 
Altadena, offers a 360-degree view of basin and range. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of earthquake damage to Interstate 5 and California 14, many commuters 
are now using Angeles Crest Highway (California 2), which passes near the 
peaks. San Gabriel Peak Trail was not damaged by the 6.6-magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Take two maps to the top of San Gabriel Peak -- one of the city, one of the 
Angeles National Forest -- to help you identify metropolitan and mountain 
landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountain views are particularly good. From atop 6,161-foot San Gabriel 
Peak, you can look down upon two of the Southland's most famous peaks: Mt. Lowe 
(5,603 feet) and Mt. Wilson (5,710 feet). 
</P>
<P>
 Well-engineered San Gabriel Peak Trail, built by the JPL Hiking Club in 1988, 
takes you to the top. The hand-built footpath switchbacks through the forest 
and offers a delightful alternative to the boring paved service road (once the 
only way to the top) trudged by earlier generations of hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From the Foothill Freeway in La Canada, exit on 
Angeles Crest Highway and drive 14 miles into the mountains to Red Box Station. 
Turn right on Mt. Wilson Road and proceed a short half-mile to a turnout, where 
you'll see the gated Mt. Disappointment service road and the signed trail head 
for San Gabriel Peak. The trail begins 50 feet to the left of the service road. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: The path switchbacks southeast up the pine- and oak-forested slopes. 
Occasionally paralleling the Mt. Disappointment service road, the trail offers 
eastward views of Mt. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 About a mile and a half from the trail head, the trail joins the paved service 
road. You'll climb a short quarter-mile with the road to a junction. The 
service road turns sharply right (almost a U-turn) and continues another 
quarter-mile to the summit of Mt. Disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 From this junction, bear left and soon join the unsigned footpath leading to 
San Gabriel Peak. The trail dips and quickly comes to an unsigned junction. The 
right fork descends to Markham Saddle and eventually links up with the Mt. Lowe 
trail system. Continue on the left fork, climbing southeast -- first along the 
saddle between Mt. Disappointment and San Gabriel Peak, then up San Gabriel 
Peak itself. A stiff half-mile climb brings you to the summit. San Gabriel Peak

POP FACES: DRS; INJECTING A GANGSTA MINDSET INTO THE R&B WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I can't stand that 'Baby, I love you' crap they're always singing about." 
DRS' Chris (Pic) Jackson isn't a big fan of the R&B genre, which he dismisses 
as staid and wholesome. "I wanted to do something different," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His solution? Introduce gangsta rap themes to R&B music. 
</P>
<P>
 So on DRS' first album, "Gangsta Lean," featuring the long-running Top 10 
title ballad, the Sacramento-based vocal quintet sings about what gangsta 
rappers rap about. Using hard-core lingo and lovely harmonies, they croon about 
the horrors of life in the 'hood -- a style they've dubbed gangsta swing. (See 
review, Page 56). 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to rap, R&B is so tame and needed to branch out," explains Jackson, 
a 26-year-old Compton native who co-founded the group in 1988. The members of 
DRS, who prefer to be known by their street nicknames (Blunt, Deuce Deuce, Jail 
Bait and Endo), got a deal with Ruthless Records in 1990 but never recorded 
anything until signing with Capitol last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, the group's main writer, got the inspiration for gangsta swing 
several years ago from Dr. Dre. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said don't do what everybody else is doing, try to take gangsta rap 
somewhere else," Jackson recalls. "I'm glad this record didn't come out a few 
years ago. People wouldn't have been ready for it. Dre and the others had to 
lay the foundation first." 
</P>
<P>
 Though DRS (it stands for dirty rotten scoundrels) may get pats on the back 
for broadening R&B's turf, many would like to give them smacks in the face for 
some of their seemingly misogynistic views. Jackson says that's a bum rap, 
though his nickname, Bitch Killer, doesn't help his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times we may sound like we condone rape, but we don't," he insists. "We're 
just trying to bring attention to a situation." 
</P>
<P>
 He's alluding to the sinister song "Strip," which supports Mike Tyson, the 
boxing champion who's serving a prison sentence for rape. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Jackson is so firmly in Tyson's corner that the name of the woman in 
"Strip" originally had the same first name as Tyson's victim, Desiree 
Washington. But Capitol Records ordered the name changed to Debra Ray. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you hear the song, everybody knows who we're singing about," Jackson 
says. "It's an expression of our opinion. We're entitled to that, aren't we?"

POP FACES: CLAY WALKER; AFTER THE VICTORY AT THAT TALENT SHOW, HE HAD TO KEEP 
GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Country singer Clay Walker still gets shivers of anxiety when he recalls the 
toughest audience he's ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about your no-win situations," says Walker, who's had two hit country 
singles in two tries -- "What's It to You" and "Live Until I Die." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the only white contestant in this talent contest at my high school, a 
predominantly black school in Beaumont, Tex.," he continues. "To make things 
even tougher, I was singing a country song and I knew most of the kids didn't 
like country music, because they'd kid me about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Walker won a victory that had a far-reaching effect on his life. "I can 
still feel the rush I felt when I got a standing ovation from an audience that 
was all set not to like me," he recalls. "It's a feeling of triumph I can't 
really describe. But it was an instant addiction. I wanted to experience it 
again and again. Ever since then a singing career is all I've cared about." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker sings with a soulful, George Jones-like twang that make his tales of 
heartbreak seem even sadder, and there are also echoes of Clint Black and 
George Strait in his style. But he's not defensive about copycat charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people say I sound like certain singers, they're right," explains the 
24-year-old singer, whose debut album, "Clay Walker," is over the 600,000 sales 
mark. "When you're young, you fall in love with the styles of singers and you 
imitate them. That's the way it is. I'd love to be original, but I'm not. I'd 
hardly call myself a great singer either. I've had to make do with the talent I 
have -- and I've done OK." 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster in Beaumont, Walker wasn't that wild about country music. "It 
was too sad for me," he recalls. "My all-time favorite artist isn't even 
country -- Lionel Richie." 
</P>
<P>
 But Walker's father, who taught him to play guitar when he was 9, steered him 
toward country music. Walker started knocking around the Southern club circuit 
when he was 16, but it took seven years for him to get a deal -- Giant Records 
signed him last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating that I wasn't getting a contract, but I never doubted I'd 
eventually get one from somebody, " he says. "That's because my father taught 
me something else too -- to have incredible confidence in myself."

 TORI AMOS 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the Pink" 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic  
</P>
<P>
 * * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Amos' sophomore effort features the spare instrumentation -- piano, 
mostly -- and prominent vocals that distinguished her attention-grabbing solo 
debut, "Little Earthquakes." At times the lyrics' dominance over the music 
could hardly be more complete if it were a spoken-word recording. 
</P>
<P>
 This imbalance worked to great effect on "Earthquakes," when the power of such 
songs as "Me and a Gun" -- the stark story of a rape -- owed much to the 
primacy of the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time around it's hard to believe Amos knows what she's talking about, 
though she clearly wants you to listen to what she has to say. The lyrics are 
so obtuse -- in an overreaching stab at profundity -- that they're almost 
meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the Pink" is not without its charms. Amos is a seductive singer, wooing 
the listener with finely nuanced inflections. Ultimately, though, it's hard to 
be moved by music you don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). JEAN ROSENBLUTH

Gavin Friday co-wrote and duet on two songs, both creepy, cannily crafted, 
percussive delights -- if hardly hits; Sinead O'Connor, in her prettily tense

effort fails to expand on promising aspects of last year's hit debut, "Life's a 
Dance."Outside of the first track -- "Be My Baby Tonight," whose 
tongue-twisting chorus virtually screams hit -- there's nary a memorable lyric. 
When he's not echoing Garth, what little character his voice possesses sounds

 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ramones have always been closer to their roots than Guns N' Roses. So it's 
no surprise that Joey and the boyz's album of favorite old songs sounds better 
(if less ambitious) than GNR's "The Spaghetti Incident?" Let's face it: The 
Ramones may have touched off the '70s punk explosion and have remained 
surprisingly strong into the '90s, but they're really children of the 
psychedelic '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of this collection is the Ramones' refusal to distinguish between 
legitimate '60s icons (Dylan, the Who, the Stones) and the era's pop 
cheese-makers (the Seeds, Ted Nugent's Amboy Dukes, the Troggs). The group has 
walked that same line itself for years. 
</P>
<P>
 To their credit, the Ramones do more than just give the likes of "Out of 
Time," "Substitute" (with Pete Townshend guesting) and "My Back Pages" the 
1-2-3-4 treatment, instead meeting the original versions halfway. They do give 
the speed treatment to Creedence's "Have You Ever Seen the Rain" and the Jan & 
Dean's "Surf City," and it works perfectly.  
</P>
<P>
 And they get major bonus points for the long-overdue unearthing of "The Shape 
of Things to Come," a Mann-Weil number from the 1968 B-movie "Wild in the 
Streets," with a hippie-youth-rebellion message that translates perfectly to 
punk-youth-rebellion.

<P>
 Hard-core rap balladeers should be a contradiction in terms, but 
unfortunately, DRS -- an acronym for dirty rotten scoundrels -- is serious. 
Lyrically and musically, the production of this Sacramento-based group's debut 
album rings false. 
</P>
<P>
 They're attempting to be a hard-core equivalent of Boyz II Men, but they don't 
have any of that Philadelphia quartet's sincerity. And ultimately the likes of 
a promise to tip a 40-ounce malt liquor in tribute to a dead homie ends up 
trivializing such serious issues as gang violence. (See Pop Faces, Page 54.)

 The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences has collected some of the 
top music performances from Grammy Awards telecasts on a new series of CDs and 
videos. The first set of four CDs and two videos, being released by Atlantic on 
Feb. 7, includes music from Michael Jackson, Sting, Barbra Streisand and Neil 
Diamond, Bonnie Raitt, Tina Turner, Eric Clapton and Aretha Franklin. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Looks like it'll be a wait for a full new Whitney Houston album, but a 
greatest-hits package -- probably featuring a new song or two -- is due in 
summer or early fall. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 TLC is finally putting the finishing touches on its second album, which is now 
due in April, but the three female rappers will be heard before then, guest 
starring on Keith Sweat's single "How Do You Like It?" in March. . . . Speaking 
of hot guest stars, rappers-singers Nice N' Smooth scored Bobby Brown for the 
first single, "Return of the Hip-Hop Freaks," from their April album. Also 
guesting: House of Pain's Everlast and Cypress Hill's B-Real. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The rap community is eagerly awaiting the second album by Public Enemy's 
deejay Terminator X -- a collection of songs with him producing, but others 
rapping. The track that's really got everyone excited is "Sticka," featuring 
Chuck D, Ice Cube, Ice-T and MC Lyte. . . . Meanwhile, despite continued rumors 
that Public Enemy has retired, the group, with Chuck D at the helm as usual, is 
in the studio working on an album that's due this summer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 David Lee Roth does country? Not exactly. His upcoming album, "Your Filthy 
Little Mouth," due March 22, features a duet between Roth and Travis Tritt on a 
number titled "Cheatin' Heart Cafe" and Diamond Dave's version of Willie 
Nelson's standard "Night Life." But a spokesman says that the album is all 
rock. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Anton Corbijn is the director of an upcoming video for longtime collaborators 
Depeche Mode. The clip for "In Your Room" will feature several images recycled 
from past Mode clips. The song itself has been remixed by Butch Vig (he 
produced Nirvana's "Nevermind" album) and is vastly different from the album 
version. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 John Cale, fresh from the brief Velvet Underground reunion, is teaming with 
veteran singer-songwriter Bob Neuwirth for "Last Day," a "song-cycle" album of 
related songs.*

POP EYE: HOPEFUL EAGLES PROMOTERS GETTING A PEACEFUL, EASY FEELING

 Can anybody in pop resist $50 million? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the tantalizing question facing the Eagles, who are flying higher than 
ever following the enormous success of the "Common Thread" tribute album. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the success of that album -- which features a dozen country artists 
performing their versions of Eagles hits -- that has concert promoters, radio 
programmers, record sellers and ticket brokers drooling at the prospect of a 
reunion tour and/or recording project. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has the album sold more than 2 million copies in three months, but 
its high profile has also boosted sales of old Eagles albums by more than 20%. 
Two Eagles albums, including the 14 million-selling "Greatest Hits" package, 
were among the nation's top 15 selling catalogue albums last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could play any size venue, anywhere," says Irving Azoff, chairman of 
Giant Records. As Don Henley's primary adviser and former manager of the group, 
Azoff would play a major role in any reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Common Thread' has impressed upon them that they're still a vibrant, 
important force on the marketplace," he says. "Everybody's on speaking terms 
and I do think they're awed and a little bit shocked by this success. But 
there's nothing officially in discussion right now. It wouldn't surprise me if 
they did get back together, and it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if there's no confirmation, the "what if" game is in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be looking at one of the top tours of the year, no question," says 
Susan Rosenbluth, general manager of Nederlander Concerts, which operates the 
Greek Theatre and books music events for the Anaheim Arena. "You're looking at 
multiple nights in arenas at least." 
</P>
<P>
 Radio programmers are equally enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous interest," says Tommy Hadges, president of the Pollack 
Media Group, a consulting firm whose clients include more than 100 stations 
worldwide. "The group's old songs get played steadily on classic rock stations, 
album rock and adult contemporary, and the country stations have certainly been 
giving 'Common Thread' a lot of airplay." 
</P>
<P>
 Most industry observers point to last year's Steely Dan reunion, which grossed 
$8.9 million on a 27-city tour of mostly 6,000-to-15,000-seat amphitheaters, as 
just the tip of the iceberg that an Eagles reunion would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors have circulated for years about a reunion of the Grammy-winning group, 
which called it quits in 1982 because of various personal and professional 
differences after virtually defining the California country-rock sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a couple of years ago, Henley, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. 
Schmit were set to record new songs to be included in a planned box set 
anthology, with a tour possibly to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 But tensions in the always volatile lineup -- especially between Henley and 
Frey, who wrote most of the group's hits together -- put the project on 
permanent hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations, however, were good enough last month for Henley, Frey and the 
others to join in Los Angeles in the video for Travis Tritt's version of "Take 
It Easy," which appears on the "Common Thread" album. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GAME PLAN: So how would the reunion work? 
</P>
<P>
 Under one scenario, the whole thing might start with an acoustic benefit 
concert that could yield an "unplugged" video and album. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the Eagles' strong, melodic songwriting makes the group ideally 
suited for that format. If all goes well on that first step, a summer tour -- 
including stadiums -- could follow. And maybe it's wishful thinking on record 
retailers' and radio programmers' parts, but there's even hope that the group 
would follow that with an album of new Eagles songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Azoff acknowledges that a benefit situation is the most likely way to get them 
back together, given Henley's and Frey's high-profile activism. 
</P>
<P>
 But he doubts the group would do a stadium tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never advise them to go out and do a huge-stadiums 'greed' tour. 
They're not the kind of guys who would do that. It's more likely that a charity 
thing would bring them together than anything else." Steve Hochman

 SYMBOL MAN RETURNS: What was all that again about Prince's retirement? 
</P>
<P>
 You may have heard that the Purple One, who declared last year that he is 
going to stop recording new music, has a new single, "The Most Beautiful Girl 
in the World," coming on Valentine's Day.But now we hear that he's also working 
in a Los Angeles recording studio on an album that could be in the stores by 
summer.  
</P>
<P>
 Karen Lee, vice president of media communications at Prince's Paisley Park 
company, would not confirm plans for an album, but said that a package of 
remixes of the single may be released.  
</P>
<P>
 In a twist, the single will not be distributed by Warner Bros. Records, the 
company that funds Paisley Park. Both Lee and a Warner Bros. spokesman said 
that it was agreed that the single could benefit from independent distribution 
in order to try to reach "new audiences." (The recording will be "previewed" 
during the Miss USA pageant telecast Feb. 11 on CBS.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said that Prince does have several new projects in the works, including 
new dance projects in the wake of the Joffrey Ballet's successful use of his 
music and the planned opening of more Prince clothing and accessories stores 
modeled on one opened last year in Minneapolis.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Prince has been conducting a search for the "most beautiful girl in 
the world" to be his Valentine's Day "date" in a promotion for the song. The 
finalists will be announced soon. 
</P>
<P>
 And the retirement? 
</P>
<P>
 "He retired from recording as Prince," she says of the artist, who has adopted 
that male-female symbol as his moniker. "This single will be released under his 
new name, for which we still don't have a spelling or pronunciation." STEVE

<P>
 AND ONE MORE THING: Pop Eye has no problem with music by contemporary figures 
Bono, Gavin Friday and Sinead O'Connor being in the film "In the Name of the 
Father," which takes place largely in the late '70s. Their music adds to the 
dramatic tension of the story of Gerry Conlon, wrongly convicted as an IRA 
bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prominent use in the film of a contemporary music poster may raise 
eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of the poster, Jimi Hendrix, is fine. Conlon is established early 
in the film as a big Hendrix fan. But the poster on the wall of his prison cell 
promotes "The Jimi Hendrix Collection," a best-of album that was released just 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Says a spokesman for Universal Pictures, which released the film: "Oops!"

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: SAME STREET, SLIMMER MORTON'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a cliche about moving, whether it's just down the hall to the 
apartment with a better view, or to the restaurant across the street with a 
bigger parking lot: Precious possessions become suddenly less treasured when 
you actually have to lift them into a packing box. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Morton's -- that everlasting Monday-night hangout of Hollywood power 
brokers -- has the mark of an owner who has pared his business down to its 
essential elements: big palm trees, big steaks and, we can only assume for now, 
big attitude (on the Wednesday after the earthquake, the greeters at the door 
seemed downright happy that customers had bothered to come out and eat). One 
item that didn't make the move -- Morton's crab cakes, which is just as well, 
because in the final months at the old space, the crab cakes were seeming more 
than a bit tired. 
</P>
<P>
 Big money was obviously spent on the new Morton's minimalist design. Just 
across Robertson Boulevard from its tree-shrouded, stuccoed former home, the 
new place looks like an art gallery designed as much to show off its famous 
customers as well as its huge Ruscha paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu has also been trimmed to the basics. A T-bone steak nicely roasted in 
a wood-burning oven. Grilled veal chops and lamb loins. Grilled swordfish and 
ahi tuna. Pan-seared salmon. And Morton's famous lime-grilled chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these basics could use some fine-tuning. But there is a new chef in 
the kitchen, and some of his appetizers are terrific. Grilled shrimp comes in a 
wonderfully pungent black bean sauce. Grilled lobster sits on top of a sweet 
corn pancake with curried creme fraiche.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, minimalism doesn't come cheap -- the least expensive bottle of wine 
here is $25, and the prices go way up from there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Morton's, 8764 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, (310) 276-5205. Entrees $18-$28.

RESTAURANT NEWS: STILL QUAKING, SURE, BUT BAKING TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Carol Krug worked late two weeks ago, until 2 a.m., cleaning up after a 
Sunday-night staff party at Bob Burns restaurant in Woodland Hills. She needn't 
have bothered. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-and-a-half hours later, toppled restaurant equipment, broken glass and 
shattered china were strewn everywhere, the result of the 6.6-magnitude 
earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big restaurant and we had a big mess," says Krug, who is general 
manager of Bob Burns. "Just about everything broke." 
</P>
<P>
 But a week later, after work crews repaired cracked walls and cleaned carpets, 
after the gas company restored service, the Woodland Hills restaurant opened 
for dinner.  
</P>
<P>
 Hamburger Hamlet in Sherman Oaks wasn't as lucky. "We don't know if there is 
structural damage or not," says CEO Tom McFall. "They may be able to fix the 
building, but I'm not overly optimistic." The Northridge Hamlet fared much 
better and is already open, as are the rest of the popular chain's stores.  
</P>
<P>
 Hamburger hangout Johnny Rockets on Ventura Boulevard in Encino, however, 
probably won't reopen. Structural damage has left the space beyond repair and 
most of the restaurant equipment has already been carted off to the chain's 
Westwood location. "The whole front wall came out," says Jennifer Smith, 
general manager of the Johnny Rockets on Melrose, "and the owner thinks it too 
far gone to rebuild." Still, she doesn't rule out the possibility of the 
company finding another location to open in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 While the earthquake and its aftershocks damaged restaurants all over the 
Southland, surprisingly few restaurateurs plan to close their places 
permanently. Art Ginsburg, for instance, was seen in TV interviews and in 
newspaper articles vowing to reopen his Art's Deli in Studio City. The 
37-year-old hangout was destroyed by a fire that followed the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City's Bistro Garden at Coldwater Canyon is expected to reopen too -- 
in about a month, according to manager Freddy Kernbach. "We lost everything," 
he says, "but we did better than the other tenants. Fortunately, when the 
center was built they knew the space was going to be a restaurant, so 
everything was reinforced."  
</P>
<P>
 Down the street at Laurel Canyon, the Daily Grill is still drying out. Its 
sprinklers were activated by the big jolt and ran for several hours. Owner 
Robert Spivak estimates that the restaurant will remain closed six to eight 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Il Mito in Studio City suffered significant interior breakage and water 
damage, but reopened this past Monday after a quick remodel job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my entire liquor room and we are down to a dozen wineglasses," says 
Orleans owner Mary Atkinson. Still, the West L.A. restaurant was back in 
business, albeit hard-up for stemware. 
</P>
<P>
 At Junior's deli, also in West L.A., the domed glass ceiling in the main 
dining room caved in, refrigerators overturned, and two giant griddles fell on 
the floor. Owner Marvin Saul had just canceled the restaurant's earthquake 
insurance. "I'm back in hock," he says. Fortunately, expectations of reopening 
two-thirds of the deli by the weekend were fulfilled. But the damage seemed 
like nothing, however, when Saul learned that his sister-in-law was crushed to 
death during the collapse of the Northridge Meadows apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go to the coroner's office and then you go to the morgue," says 
Saul, "anything else is secondary." 
</P>

 BERNARD'S LIST: Opening a restaurant just isn't as easy as it used to be, even 
for Bernard Erpicum, who knows practically everyone in town. The former Spago 
maitre d', who has been trying to open a restaurant since he left Spago last 
July, finally snagged his last investor in the limited partnership last week. 
He is now shooting for a March 25 opening date in the original Morton's space 
on Melrose. Eclipse will open only for dinner and offer a seafood- and 
fish-oriented menu. "It's harder to raise a half a million today than $5 
million 10 years ago," moans Erpicum, "but I did it."

GRAZER VS. KRAMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What was the point of Larry Kramer's assault on "Philadelphia" and the 
creative team behind it? ("Why I Hated Philadephia,' " Jan. 9). This bitter 
diatribe supports the time-honored adage: "No good deed goes unpunished." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer's myopic perspective suffers from the worst kind of arrogance born of 
ignorance. As a onetime studio executive, Kramer ought to at least understand 
that Tom Hanks (whose previous two movies each grossed in excess of $100 
million) is not obligated to pick risky acting parts. He chose to do 
"Philadelphia" because he cares about the issue of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 As a top director who walked off with a handful of Oscars for "The Silence of 
the Lambs," Jonathan Demme did not have to spend two years of his life taking 
on a project whose commercial prospects never appeared great on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kramer's attempt was to motivate movie-makers to take on riskier subjects, 
his angry essay only works to sabotage his very agenda. Demme may not have made 
the exact movie Kramer had been waiting for -- whatever that is -- but he did 
tackle a subject the vast majority of our business would never have touched. 
And he made a movie that will help to inform, educate and, yes, even entertain 
millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of verbal assault does not stimulate risk; it stifles the creative 
process and pushes talented filmmakers closer to the much safer middle ground 
of the formula movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of attacking the film, Kramer -- of all people -- ought to applaud the 
spirit and initiative of the movie-makers who were brave enough to use their 
collective creative powers to get this movie made. Unlike Kramer, the 
"Philadelphia" team had their hearts in the right place.

 Regarding "Managing in Turbulent Times," Claudia Eller's profile of 
entertainment manager Sandy Gallin (Jan. 16): 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gallin, we, the society, are suffering from sexual phobias and 
client Michael Jackson's relationship with children is the norm. Thank you, 
Sandy, for clearing up that misconception.This, from the man who brought us 
Milli Vanilli. 
</P>
<P>
 This man doesn't keep a low profile to maintain his dignity -- it's called 
don't bite the gloved hand that feeds! I don't believe him any further than he 
can throw a desk at a secretary. If Gallin thinks this story was supposed to be 
in defense of his client, I think Jackson better go shopping for another 
personal manager. 
</P>
<P>
 This is more than a client-manager relationship -- it is a bizarre bond shared 
by two self-absorbed people (who just want to be loved) with a penchant for 
plastic surgery.

into my window with several hundred million dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 He is already worth $30 million, and his prize possession is a $13-million 
beach house. 
</P>
<P>
 Five paragraphs later he tells us: 
</P>
<P>
 "As I've become more secure in myself, more spiritual (emphasis added), I need 
less of the outside accouterments to make me feel accomplished."

RIGHT -- BUT WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was with anticipation that I had been awaiting the arrival of "Monty," Fox 
Television's new series, starring Henry Winkler ("A Little to the Right This 
Time," by Judith Michaelson, Jan. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 It had been my understanding that during development of the series, a 
recurring gay character appeared and then disappeared, a fact Michaelson 
confirmed. So I was interested to see what the final product would present. 
</P>
<P>
 As the article mentions, the Monty character does use "pejoratives" for gay 
men. As the dictionary defines the word: "having a tendency to make or become 
worse: disparaging ." Why is it that lesbians and gays are now the brunt of our 
humor? 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Lawrence, creator of the series, says that making Monty overtly racist 
would "make me sick to my stomach." If that is the case, why is it still 
appropriate to promote other bigoted attitudes? One's sexual orientation should 
not always be a joke, just as one's ethnic background is not a joke. The 
problem with "gay" jokes is that much of that humor leads to bashings of people 
who are gay or may even just look gay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation is concerned when the media 
continue to allow disparaging descriptives for groups. We will watch "Monty" 
and hope that his character becomes more educated about how to treat fellow 
human beings.

 I watched the first episode of "Monty" with doubled anticipation. First, as a 
longtime fan of the Fonz, the character Winkler created on "Happy Days." 
Second, as a Libertarian, to see if the production could manage to pull off a 
script that is advertised as being about an archconservative talk-show host but 
that co-producer and liberal Democrat Marc Lawrence describes in your article 
as having a "political philosophy (that) is actually libertarian." 
</P>
<P>
 While it remains to be seen whether the Monty character actually begins to 
take some Libertarian positions on future episodes, he has soundly flunked my 
basic Libertarian test on the very first. 
</P>
<P>
 And that test is tolerance . The measure of a true Libertarian is in his or 
her tolerance of the behavior of other humans that does not involve force, 
fraud, invasion of privacy or initiation of an adult contract on a minor. 
Monty's attitude and rude behavior toward his son's new girlfriend indicate a 
total lack of inherent Libertarian manners. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Lawrence could find out what Libertarians are really like in the same 
manner available to others: by calling the Libertarian Party of California's 
toll-free information line. It's in the phone book.

 LimoLib Winkler, who became filthy rich during the Reagan-Bush years, now 
intends to capitalize (get richer) on the huge success of conservative Rush 
Limbaugh, who exposes liberals' hypocrisy and their failed programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Winkler, like so many other liberals, finally realizing that socialism is a 
wasteful blunder that has squandered trillions of our tax dollars? Only a dumb 
Fonz could've voted for Slick Willie. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, will Limbaugh be listed as co-creator and receive compensation? 
Not from so-called liberals. They only spend other people's money.

 When Winkler's co-producer admits that "we're mostly liberals writing this 
show" but believes that they'll "give fair credence to what we perceive 
(conservative) views to be," no wonder I'm leery that "Monty" will just be an 
"Amos 'n' Andy" for conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the ideological equivalent of blackface, and will it work or just 
insult?

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS; DEFICIT-REDUCTION PLANS: A LOT OF PAIN THAT MAY ADD UP 
TO NO GAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROBERT EISNER, ROBERT EISNER is William R. Kenan professor of economics at 
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No gain without pain! That's what we are told by the deficit hawks. Sen. Bob 
Kerrey (D-Neb.) pushes formation of a national commission devoted to curbing 
"entitlements." Warren Rudman, Paul Tsongas and Peter Peterson of the Concord 
Coalition offer a variety of cuts in their "zero deficit" plan. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is presented as responsible sacrifice today in order to live better 
tomorrow. Is it that -- or pointless, harmful sacrifice that will hurt us now 
and in the future? 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing wasteful government expenditures with productive investment would be 
fine. Further deficit reduction in itself, though, is likely to hurt many -- 
the elderly on Social Security, government workers or those on government 
contracts, affected taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit hawks say: Yes, it is bitter medicine, made necessary by years of 
irresponsible behavior. But it will make us well, along with our currently 
debt-laden children. 
</P>
<P>
 One of their arguments is that the debt we incur today will have to be paid 
off by our children. The simple fallacy in this is that if our children pay off 
the debt, they will be paying it off to -- our children. The federal debt "held 
by the public" -- today some $3.3 trillion -- is owned overwhelmingly by 
Americans. It is not a "national debt." It is a debt owed by the federal 
government to the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 An economically more sensible argument on the hawks' part is that private 
saving is being used to finance government deficits, rather than private 
investment. Thus, they say, we are depriving ourselves of the new factories, 
machinery and housing on which our future well-being depends. 
</P>
<P>
 But suppose deficit reduction means holding back on public investment? Suppose 
it means curbing expenditures to improve the education and training of our 
young for productive jobs, to put more police on the beat to prevent crime, to 
repair and build public infrastructure, to finance basic research and new 
technology? Will such deficit reduction leave us better off in the future -- or 
worse? Should we not repair the Los Angeles freeways knocked out in the 
earthquake, as Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole seems to suggest, if that would 
add to the deficit? 
</P>
<P>
 No, the sensible deficit hawks would tell us, we just want to cut government 
payrolls and "entitlements" (read Social Security) and raise taxes. That would 
force those affected to cut their consumption and, thereby, leave more 
resources for private investment. 
</P>
<P>
 But will those resources be so redirected? 
</P>
<P>
 If lower Social Security benefits, higher taxes and the loss of jobs -- either 
in government or in private firms with government contracts -- lead some of us 
to forgo buying new cars, will that lead General Motors to invest more money in 
new facilities? Or isn't GM likely to invest less? 
</P>
<P>
 These are the facts: Budget deficits rise as the economy declines; the 
Treasury collects less in revenues and lays out more for unemployment benefits. 
Suppose we then reduce the deficit by cutting outlays or raising taxes. As the 
reductions curb public investment and force households to reduce consumption -- 
thereby depressing private investment as well -- they will be dealing our 
future and our children's a double whammy! 
</P>
<P>
 What does this say for our current situation? 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 deficit, forecast at $327 billion by the Bush Administration just 
before it left office, actually came in at $255 billion. The shrinkage was due 
largely to an improved economy and lower interest payments by the Treasury. 
Reductions in the underlying, structural deficit -- included in the vast 
Clinton deficit-reduction program of $500 billion over five years -- are yet 
largely in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 There is considerable danger that the burden of these deficit reductions 
gradually will crush the recovery that finally seems to be gathering speed. 
That would deliver a body blow to private investment, a blow that lower 
interest rates could deflect only partially at best. And curbs on government 
spending will mean that public investment is held back as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deficits can be too large, if they induce so much spending that they bring 
inflation -- hardly the situation now. But they can be too small, too, if they 
fail to contribute the purchasing power necessary to keep the economy 
prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a useful rule of thumb for the deficit, not all that different from 
one for private borrowing: Keep your debt from growing faster than your income. 
For the federal government, this would mean a debt growing no faster than the 
usual growth rate of the national income -- about 6%. The current debt of $3.3 
trillion could grow about $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if unemployment falls one more percentage point, the deficit will be just 
that -- without any of the further reductions in the Clinton program. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the deficit hawks insist that we must look for still more deficit 
reduction. We must reduce our deficit, they say, to zero. Adopt a "balanced 
budget amendment," some of them tell us, to enshrine this perverse economics in 
the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 We would suffer as we took this medicine. We would suffer for years into the 
future. For banging our heads against the wall as a sacrifice to old dogmas, we 
would have a headache for a long, long time.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: EARTHQUAKE DEDUCTIONS HAVE LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: My home was severely damaged in the recent earthquake and I do not carry 
earthquake insurance. Friends are talking about something called an 
"involuntary conversion" and say I may be able to claim a tax deduction for my 
losses. Can you explain all this? -- C.C.K.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Casualty losses, even on a personal residence, are tax deductible up to the 
amount of your tax basis in the house minus both $100 and 10% of your adjusted 
gross income. Be very clear about these regulations. Your deductible loss is 
limited to either your adjusted tax basis or your actual loss, whichever is 
lower, not your home's assessed or market value which could be substantially 
higher than your tax basis depending on when you purchased the home and whether 
you rolled over untaxed profits from a previous home. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: Let's say, using very round numbers, that your tax basis 
in your home is $100,000 and your adjusted gross income is $100,000. Under the 
Internal Revenue Service guidelines, you would be limited to a maximum casualty 
tax deduction of $89,900. Here's how you would figure it: $100,000 tax basis, 
minus $100, minus $10,000 (10% of your adjusted gross income). It doesn't 
matter whether your house is worth $250,000 and will need $150,000 worth of 
repairs to be habitable again. Your deductible losses are limited as described 
in the above calcualtion. However, any money you spend beyond the amount of 
your deduction increases your tax basis in the house and will reduce your 
potential taxable gain when you sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, once an area has been officially designated a federal disaster 
area, you have the option of claiming your casualty loss on the current year's 
tax return or the previous year's tax return.  
</P>
<P>
 This choice allows you to get a tax refund from the prior year's tax return 
processed immediately, giving you some much needed cash. It also allows you to 
pick the year in which your income was lower, making you eligible for the 
largest possible casualty loss deduction. For example, if your adjusted gross 
income last year was $80,000, you would reduce your casualty deduction by 
$8,000 plus $100, giving you a potential maximum of $91,900. ($100,000, minus 
$100, minus $8,000.)  
</P>
<P>
 But, be careful, a casualty loss claim can trigger a tax audit. So keep 
receipts, photographs and other appropriate documentation to substantiate your 
claim. When your loss exceeds your income for the year in which you claim it, 
you may carry forward to the next year, or back up to three years, the 
remaining unrecognized loss. But the total of your deductions is still limited 
to the amount of your tax basis in the home.  
</P>
<P>
 An involuntary conversion is an entirely different matter and concerns only 
taxpayers who receive an insurance settlement or some other sort of 
compensation for their property losses. IRS rules governing these procedures 
allow taxpayers up to two years to use the proceeds from their compensation to 
replace their lost property. The clock on the two-year limit begins running 
after the close of the tax year in which the involuntary conversion occurred. 
For taxpayers affected by the earthquake, for example, the replacement clock 
begins ticking Jan. 1, 1995 and expires Dec. 31, 1997. Interest From Family 
Goes on Schedule B 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do I report the interest I receive from a loan I made a family member 
for a down payment on a home? * 
</P>
<P>
 B.S.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You should include it with any other interest income you receive on 
Schedule B, Part 1 on your tax return. Calendar Year Key to IRA Withdrawals 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As of which date do I calculate the value of my individual retirement 
accounts in determining my annual mandatory withdrawal? Also, how do I 
determine what my age is when I make the withdrawal? Do I use my actual age at 
the time of the withdrawal or my age as of the end of the calendar year? -- 
G.J.N.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The amount of your mandatory distribution should be based on the value of 
your IRA accounts as of Jan. 1 of the year in which the withdrawal is to be 
made. You should use your age as of Dec. 31, of the year in which you make the 
withdrawal, not your age on the actual date the money is distributed. Inherited 
Bond Interest Probably Subject to Tax 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When my sister died, I inherited some U.S. Savings Bonds on which interest 
accumulated untaxed. If I cash them in now, what is my tax liability? Is it the 
amount of interest the bonds have generated from the time I inherit them until 
I cash them in, or the interest generated from the date of their purchase? -- 
D.J.M.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: If no taxes have ever been paid on the accumulated interest, then you are 
liable for taxes on all the interest the bonds have generated. Be careful, 
however, to check whether your sister's estate reported that interest on her 
final income tax return. In some cases, it can make sense for an estate to 
report accumulated and unrecognized interest on the decedent's final return. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? When the decedent has little or no income for the year in which he or she 
dies, income -- up to certain limits, of course -- can be reported and still 
not be subject to taxes because it doesn't meet the tax threshold. Perhaps this 
happened in your sister's case; you should at least check. 
</P>
<P>
 If it did, then your would only be liable for taxes on the interest the bonds 
have generated since you have held them. 
</P>
<P>
 If your sister's final tax return did not include the bond interest, you are 
liable for taxes on the whole amount.  
</P>
<P>
 However, for the future you should remember to use a decedent's final tax 
return to its fullest advantage.

HOT PROPERTY: PARIS IS BELLE'S CURRENT LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emmy-winning actress RUE McCLANAHAN -- who played man-crazy Southern belle 
Blanche Devereaux in "The Golden Girls" and "The Golden Palace" sitcoms -- has 
purchased a getaway apartment overlooking the Seine in Paris for slightly more 
than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 McClanahan, who was also a regular for years on the TV series "Mama's Family" 
and "Maud," appeared as the ruler-brandishing Mother Superior in the 
musical-comedy "Nunsense," which premiered Jan. 6 on A&E. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oklahoma-born actress is writing a book, described as an autobiographical 
comedy that will be titled "My First Five Husbands," and she has agreed to star 
in the Harbor Lights Entertainment comedy movie "Lisdoonvarna," which will be 
filmed next summer in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loves France -- Paris is her favorite city," said a spokesman for 
McClanahan. "That's why she bought an apartment there as a place to get away 
from it all." She purchased the 3,000-square-foot unit from a Dutch financier. 
</P>
<P>
 McClanahan also owns a small, three-bedroom Victorian farmhouse at Lake 
Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Her primary residence is in Encino, on three acres she bought in 1988 for $2.5 
million, including a house she then tore down. In its place, she built a 
5,000-square-foot California ranch-style home at an estimated cost of $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if McClanahan's Encino home suffered any damage from the Northridge 
earthquake, her spokesman said, "The house itself is OK. She just had some 
crystal glasses break." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian YAKOV SMIRNOFF has moved from Los Angeles to Branson, Mo., and he has 
put his Pacific Palisades home on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which is on the Riviera Golf Course, is listed at $2,295,000 with 
Joan McGoohan of Jon Douglas Co.'s Pacific Palisades office. Built in 1951, the 
ranch-style house has three bedrooms plus maid's quarters in 3,300 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put in . . . a sandbox that looks like a sand trap in the back, so it 
looks like the yard is part of the golf course," Smirnoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he was relieved to find that the house had sustained no damage from 
the Northridge earthquake. "Because it's on the 18th hole, I was afraid it 
would be in the 18th hole," he said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Linda, bought the house for $2.4 million when the first of 
their two children was born three years ago. They put another $150,000 into it, 
he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could move the house back here," he sighed. Since moving to Missouri 
before Christmas, the Smirnoffs have been leasing out their Pacific Palisades 
house and renting in Branson, where he appears regularly at the Osmond Family 
Theater, which he jokingly calls "The What-a-Country Theater." 
</P>
<P>
 The longtime, Bel-Air home of the Hormel meat-packing family has been sold for 
close to $4 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-acre property had been in the family for 67 years, since family 
patriarch/company founder GEORGE A. HORMEL, called "The King of Spam," bought 
the site. His daughter-in-law, Germaine Hormel, tore down the original home and 
built a contemporary, 9,200-square-foot house, with four bedrooms and an indoor 
pool, in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 The home has wooded pathways, a small rose garden and a 180-degree view, from 
the San Gabriel Mountains to the ocean. "On a clear day, you can see Catalina," 
a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Financier Robert Day and his wife, Kelly, bought the house, and they plan to 
tear it down and build a new residence on the site, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale was precipitated by the death of Germaine Hormel in 1991 at the age 
of 94. The sellers are Hormel family heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Tsu and Parveen Knighton of Fred Sands Estates, Beverly Hills, had the 
listing, most recently at $5.25 million. The home was originally on the market 
in 1991 in the $9-million range, other sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 An oceanfront home built in 1928 by the late DICK LOYNES, a legendary Long 
Beach yachtsman and philanthropist, has come on the market at $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Loynes skippered the 106-foot yacht "Contender" in 1939 from San Francisco to 
Honolulu to win the Golden Gate International Exposition trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a founder and first commodore, in 1929, of the Long Beach Yacht Club. 
He was also an internationally renowned speedboat racer, with 16 world records. 
A Long Beach street and the yacht club's race-committee boat are named for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Loynes built his 3,700-square-foot house in Long Beach with a Baccarat 
chandelier in the living room, inlaid gold trim around much of the interior and 
etched-glass windows, each with a nautical theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which also has portholes on the second floor, was one of five on 
Ocean Boulevard that had a tunnel to the beach. The tunnels were all filled in 
during the 1940s when there was fear of a Japanese invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Alton Hess, owner of a rare-book bookstore, acquired the home from Loynes' 
estate in 1979, when Loynes' widow died. Loynes died on his yacht in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Hess added a guest house, lap pool, spa and fountain to the home, which is 
listed with Adam Feldman of Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 CLARIFICATION: The Beverly Hills home of actress/singer Shirley Jones and 
comedian Marty Ingels is listed with Mike Silverman and Kay Pick of Mike 
Silverman Estates, a Jon Douglas Co. The realtors' names were inadvertently 
omitted in last week's Hot Property column.

IT'S BIGOTRY TO LUMP WHITE STUDENTS TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your story "Plan for Black Students' Conference Draws Fire" (Jan. 13) uses 
the term Anglos in referring to 19% of Reseda High School's students. 
</P>
<P>
 It is bigotry to lump all white students together as Anglos when there are 
many distinctive cultures represented in this group. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school has a Brothers and Sisters United Club and a Latino Club, 
I doubt that it has an Anglo Club. I hope the instructional program of the 
school includes an appreciation of the cultures and concerns of white ethnics 
as well.

DON'T REPEAT SAME BRIDGE MISTAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Some 40 years ago when I was a brand new MIT graduate, I began working at 
Lockheed in the structures division. For beginning engineers there was one rule 
that was strongly impressed on our collective consciousness by the senior 
engineers.This was so-called Rule No. 2, and it said: "Thou shalt not fail 
twice!" 
</P>
<P>
 And yet Caltrans appears to have allowed exactly that situation to occur with 
the recent earthquake failures of the bridges at the Golden State and Antelope 
Valley freeways. These bridges failed the earthquake test in 1971 and now again 
in 1994. What's more, these failures look just like those in the 1989 
earthquake in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take much of an engineer to appreciate that these failures are all 
very similar to what happens when a singer sings the right notes to break 
glasses sitting on a shelf. These bridges all resonate (i.e., bounce up and 
down) at about two cycles per second. And that is about the same frequency of 
the earthquake shocks. The man who witnessed failure of the Santa Monica 
overpass said it bounced up and down. 
</P>
<P>
 What it amounts to is that these high-flying long spans are simply dynamically 
unstable in earthquakes. Put them down low to the ground where you can put in 
more vertical supports.

HALT IMMIGRATION UNTIL SOME DECISIONS ARE MADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to your article "Middle Class Despairs Over Its Paradise Lost" 
(Dec. 19), The Times reports that over the past several years, the San Fernando 
Valley has been splintered apart, with extremes in wealth and poverty. The 
Valley's middle class it seems, is getting the heck out! 
</P>
<P>
 Gang violence is up, violent crime is up, home prices have dropped, graffiti 
is omnipresent, welfare rolls are growing, and does it seem coincidental that 
illegal immigration is out of control? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not immigration but too many illegal immigrants arriving in a 
small window of time. We must get off our hands and impress upon our local 
representatives that California is tired of absorbing the glut of undocumented 
workers. We don't have the social services or the money to handle the multitude 
of newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington must shut the borders and let the people of California as well as 
the rest of the United States catch our breath and decide how to assimilate the 
legal and undocumented foreigners that are now upon our soil. This is not 
immigrant bashing but simple common sense.

AIRPORT'S NOISE IS A NUISANCE FOR THOUSANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In a society where it is considered OK to appropriate someone's house to 
build a freeway through areas where people live, it is no wonder that kids 
understand that you simply do not give a thought for the rights of others, you 
just steamroller them in search of the almighty dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what happened when a Burbank court ignored the law on airport noise 
and granted a variance so that Burbank Airport can continue dumping noise and 
air pollution on thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does Judge Richard J. Lopez live? If the judge were awakened by a 
multi-engine commercial aircraft under take-off power at 7 a.m. on Sunday, I 
wonder whose rights would be more important then. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Richard J. Lopez "rejected an argument" from Los Angeles officials that 
the public nuisance created by the airport outweighs the public good. Tens of 
thousands of people are aggravated and annoyed every day, and thousands are 
aided by flying out of Burbank. Common sense dictates that allowing one element 
of society to dump noise and air pollution on the rest is not healthy for the 
society.

A BALM AMID THE PAIN OF THE QUAKE; PHARMACY SERVED THE RAVAGED COMMUNITY WHEN 
ALMOST ALL DOORS WERE CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much has transpired since the Northridge quake struck at 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 17, 
but there is room to praise at least one more memorable effort associated with 
that day. Perhaps there is a lesson here as well. 
</P>
<P>
 When dawn broke, it would soon become apparent that the Los Angeles medical 
community had taken as large a hit as any. Doctors' offices, hospitals and 
pharmacies were among the many establishments that suffered major damage that 
morning, a fact that only added to the high anxiety and consternation of the 
moment. Many, in fact, are still closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the confusion on the morning of the quake, Valley Drug in 
North Hollywood did something unusual. It not only opened its doors for 
business; it opened them early, and kept them open until nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that the owner, Sidney Simmons, had been forced to relocate to new 
quarters after the pharmacy's host building of 50 years had received -- you 
guessed it -- a condemnation notice. Simmons made the most of a bad situation, 
ensuring that the new site at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Riverside Drive was 
wired to a generator that would handle computers, refrigeration and lighting in 
the event of a major emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The system survived the quake, but that wouldn't have mattered had Simmons, 
his pharmacists, staff and family members decided to just stay home that day.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Simmons decided, "This is a pharmacy and people need it. When I 
got here that morning, at around 6:30 a.m., someone was already waiting here, 
hoping to get some pain medication." 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of that morning, through the afternoon and right up until dark, 
the drugstore stayed open. Service was available for regular customers and many 
new ones who were unable to refill or renew prescriptions that had been lost 
amid the rubble of the quake, and for those who needed over-the-counter 
medications for quake-related injuries. For many, the store's service was the 
day's only respite. For that, Simmons and his staff deserve the community's 
sincere thanks.

VOLUNTEERS HELPING PUT VALLEY HOMES IN ORDER; GROUP DOING BUILDING AND REPAIRS 
COULD USE YOUR HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Habitat for Humanity, the volunteer home-building group that is responsible 
for more than 20,000 homes worldwide since 1976, has earned a reputation for 
solid work. In 1992, for instance, the 27 Miami-area homes Habitat built 
survived the 175-m.p.h. winds of Hurricane Andrew with only minimal damage. And 
now, the eight homes Habitat completed in Pacoima last March -- the group's 
first in the San Fernando Valley project -- have emerged unscathed from the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 That record, and Habitat's pledge to redouble its construction and repair 
efforts in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, comes as welcome news to 
communities hit hard by the quake. Habitat officials say they want to provide 
low-to-moderate income homeowners with three levels of support: 
</P>
<P>
 * Help in repairing relatively minor problems such as broken windows, doors 
and water heaters; 
</P>
<P>
 * Help with major repairs or renovations for homes that sustained partial 
structural damage; and 
</P>
<P>
 * An acceleration of new home starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat's goal is to work on 75 to 100 homes a year. It's the kind of effort 
that could nicely supplement federal, state and local government 
disaster-relief programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat is not a charity. It does not build or repair homes for free. It does, 
however, provide no-interest loans that the current or eventual homeowner must 
repay. Residents also are required to perform so-called "sweat equity." In this 
case, it simply means that Valley homeowners will be required to chip in and 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 For a complete home, Habitat officials say, the sweat equity requirement is 
typically 500 hours. It will be commensurately smaller for lighter repair work. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lamishaw, executive director of the San Fernando and Santa Clarita 
Habitat chapter, says that his office has received calls from across the nation 
from businesses willing to donate construction materials such as lumber, as 
well as window glass and frames, water heaters and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 That points out some of the group's needs in meeting its commitment. The list 
includes volunteers for its North Hollywood office, and many more to work on 
homes as the local construction effort progresses. Habitat needs about 4,000 
square feet of office space, and another 20,000 to 30,000 square feet of 
protected space in which to store those donated materials from around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The group says it could also use donated computers to help coordinate requests 
for repair, and three one-ton pickup trucks to ferry materials to home sites. 
The Habitat office is already taking telephone requests for repair help. Until 
its 800-number is established, those wishing to help out or donate resources 
can call (818) 781-0016. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake damage toll to housing in the Valleys is already staggering, and 
certain to rise. An early Times computer analysis of city inspections of Valley 
dwellings found that about 45% of them were being declared unsafe. In areas 
close to the epicenter of the quake, the percentages were even higher. Many 
other homes have sustained lesser damage. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have been moved by images and accounts of that damage, and want to 
help, a donation of time, equipment or money to Habitat would be an excellent 
way to proceed.

COST AND INCONVENIENCE ARGUE AGAINST MONORAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The voters who favored the monorail system were about 10% of the eligible 
voters. 1990 was one of those years in which fewer than half of those eligible 
actually bothered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason there has never been a fatality on a monorail is because there are 
so few passenger miles per year traveled, and because the average speed is 
about 25 m.p.h. The "existing right of way" Supervisor Mike Antonovich mentions 
in his letter of Jan. 8 has not yet been approved by the agencies of 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two basic problems with a monorail for the Valley corridor. First, 
the cost of facilities, training and operating are higher when a system is not 
standardized. Buying a fleet of vehicles is less expensive than buying smaller 
orders of differing types from varied manufacturers. Second, if a rider on the 
Red Line is forced to exit the train and walk to another platform and wait for 
the next monorail, travel time is adversely affected, the rider is 
inconvenienced and patronage is discouraged.  
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Antonovich has always disliked rapid transit, and any program he promotes 
should be viewed with some skepticism.

YAROSLAVSKY'S FUNDS ARE FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Los Angeles City Council member Zev Yaroslavsky, a career politician, 
decrying the influence of lobbyists on the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority in commentaries like the one that appeared in The Times (Jan. 16) is 
the pot calling the kettle black. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not just the MTA that is floundering due to inaction, poor 
decision-making and questionable ethics. It has largely been while Zev 
Yaroslavsky has been at the helm of one of the City Council's most important 
committees -- the Finance and Revenue Committee -- that Los Angeles has seen 
the decline of its once nationally respected police force, the rapid rise of 
gangs and the overall deterioration of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Yaroslavsky writes, "The board of the MTA is practically paralyzed by 
lobbyists." Interesting stuff coming from one of the leaders in campaign 
donation-gathering on the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mr. Yaroslavsky, who recently announced his intention to seek election 
to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, has been reported to have 
almost $230,000 that he is carrying over from earlier election campaign 
accounts to help fund his latest bid for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
 One look at his previous campaign financial records would clearly show that 
the money comes from special interests, not the general public. Is it any 
wonder, then, that Yaroslavsky's own City Council district is one of the most 
overdeveloped and crime-ridden districts in the city? 
</P>
<P>
 The real problem with government -- be it the MTA, the City Council or the 
county of Los Angeles -- is that career politicians have practically offered 
themselves for sale to the lobbyist with the biggest checkbook. We need elected 
leaders who are not captives of special-interest groups, who will put the needs 
of the public above the needs of their political careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, career politicians like Zev Yaroslavsky will continue to make 
decisions that result in cost overruns, increased crime, sloppy workmanship and 
a pervasive distrust of government.

MOLESTED GIRL DESERVES THANKS FOR HER COURAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your story "Girl Awarded $2 Million in Molestation Lawsuit" (Jan. 8) was 
sensitively written and pointed out some of the problems children have should 
they decide "to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Young Desiray's courage and desire to protect others from possible 
victimization needs to be applauded. Her peers need to reach out with open 
hearts and open hands. They need to stand beside her and say, "Thank you." And 
all children need to learn that any peer victimized sexually at the hands of an 
adult is innocent of any wrongdoing. There are no excuses for any adult who 
perpetrates these crimes on a child.

CHILDREN'S SELF-DEFENSE IS NOT A FAD OR A JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was appalled by your story on the street-fighting self-defense course for 
children taught by Barbara Gallen. Not only was your article snotty and 
condescending, it was inaccurate as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Gallen does not teach the children "a couple of kicks," as your 
reporter would have learned had he stayed for more than a cursory glance. The 
techniques she employs are simple, practical and very effective -- certainly 
much more effective than the personal alarms and pagers also mentioned in the 
article. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Hines' suggestion to "change children's behavior so their safety 
becomes second nature" is only half of the solution. I would like to hear Ms. 
Hines tell the parents of Polly Klaas how altering Polly's behavior might have 
saved her life. I'm sure that Nicole Parker's parents taught her very carefully 
not to go with strangers, but that didn't save her life either. Nor has it 
saved the lives of any of the thousands of children abducted by strangers every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The course given by Barbara Gallen and her people teaches children how to set 
boundaries, how to stand up for themselves, how to avoid becoming victims, and 
when all else fails and they are in the worst possible situation, how to save 
their lives. This kind of serious, practical training is not a yuppie fad. It's 
not an overreaction of panicked parents. And it's not a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 As things stand, those in power do not protect or defend our children. 
Therefore we must teach them to protect and defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ms. Hines and your obviously skeptical reporter were to watch Barbara 
Gallen's entire 10-hour course and then still believed that a small child can't 
defend herself against an adult, then I would invite them to get themselves 
some padding and come on over to my house. I've got a 9-year-old who'd love to 
meet them.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; POST-TRAUMATIC SALES DISORDER; AFTER A SHORT-TERM DIP, SAN 
FERNANDO VALLEY PROPERTY VALUES AND REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS SHOULD REBOUND 
FROM IMPACT OF THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE McCAIN, Alice McCain is president of the San Fernando Valley Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The short-term effect of the Northridge earthquake on resales of homes in the 
San Fernando Valley is likely to be profound. A temporarily stall will later 
give way to a phantom mini-boom as disaster-aid dollars appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, however, the terrible temblor's impact will probably diminish. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices might rise if the quake weeded out excess or antiquated housing 
inventory, thus making room for new, expensive homes, but that's highly 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to diminish the personal tragedy, but the destruction and damaging of an 
estimated 10,000 homes will have a relatively small impact on the county's 
housing stock of 1.7 million residential units or the San Fernando Valley's 
more than 500,000. The damaged properties represent 0.6% countywide and 2% in 
the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 That suggests the earthquake's impact will be greatest in areas most directly 
affected, those nearest the epicenter and in localized zones of devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it occurred just as the region's economy showed signs of 
emerging from its three-year recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales of most of nearly 1,000 homes that were waiting for escrow to close 
were stopped cold. Yet within days of the tragedy the transactions involving 
those 853 single-family homes and 144 condominium sales showed signs of 
continuing their march forward. The same was true for households caught in the 
midst of a refinancing. The process stopped with the earthquake, but one week 
later most refinances were back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake devastated some people and rattled everyone, but it did not demolish 
the economic engine that propels Los Angeles and makes the city the hub of the 
Pacific Rim economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a sale or refinance could proceed, buyers and lenders needed to be 
convinced that the properties had no major structural problems -- such as a 
shift in the foundation, noticeable settlement, broken windows, damage to the 
chimney or roof, or cracks of greater than a quarter-inch in diameter in the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors reported that lenders and 
buyers involved in those pending transactions generally insisted on a 
post-quake inspection. If the property survived intact, the sale or refinance 
was allowed to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people believe that the infusion of hundreds of millions of federal 
disaster-aid dollars will provide a shot in the arm to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be. Yet there also is a school of thought that suggests today's fast 
fixes ultimately translate into higher taxes and diminished public services, 
which, in turn, work against a vibrant local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, disaster dollars don't get us ahead of where we were prior to 
the quake, but merely let us make up for some of what we lost -- which doesn't 
sound like real progress. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's true, no amount of disaster aid can ever make us totally whole, 
although time does heal most wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The destruction from the 1971 Sylmar quake was almost as severe as this 
year's, but real estate values eventually returned to their pre-quake levels. 
Outside Sylmar, where damage was most severe, most of the earthquake's effect 
was relatively short-term. Like this year's quake, the Sylmar quake also came 
during a recession, which was due to defense and aerospace cutbacks caused by 
the end of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Will the 1994 Northridge quake drive people out of the area, thus forcing 
resale values even lower than the already low recessionary levels? 
</P>
<P>
 That seems unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 No significant exodus of population occurred after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake 
in San Francisco, which registered 7.1 on the Richter Scale, killed 67 people 
and ran up a road repair bill alone of more than $1.6 billion. Some areas of 
San Francisco prospered more than others, and businesses reported a mixed bag 
of successes and failures. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt some people will leave. But many will decide to rebuild. Others may 
decide to move into the San Fernando Valley from outlying regions -- Lancaster, 
the Antelope Valley -- to be closer to work and avoid the terrible traffic jams 
caused by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Will a new resident of equal buying power and equal skills replace each 
resident we may lose? 
</P>
<P>
 Only time will tell, but I believe that the residential market will soon 
resume its recovery from recession, that new industry will replace what we have 
lost, and that life will return to normal even before all the visual reminders 
of the quake have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricanes buffet the seaboard states. The East Coast suffers sub-zero 
winters. The Midwest cowers before terrible tornadoes. And California rocks 'n' 
rolls to earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Every place extracts its price. Still the people keep coming, homes are bought 
and sold, and a new generation is born.

AMID TEMBLOR'S HAVOC, A NEIGHBOR BECOMES A LIFESAVER; A QUAKE VICTIM WHO IS 
DISABLED RECOUNTS HOW A WOMAN CAME TO THE RESCUE IN THE DAWN HOURS OF JAN. 17. 
THE HEROINE TOOK ACTION DESPITE BEING TOLD TO 'SAVE YOURSELF.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH JACOVITZ, Judith Jacovitz is a free-lance writer who has contributed 
often to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I had always told my friends that in case of earthquake they shouldn't hang 
around to save me -- just run. I thought I was only being practical. I got 
around in a wheelchair on the third floor of my building. How could I ever get 
down the stairs? 
</P>
<P>
 So while the earth rocked and roared on Jan. 17, I didn't cry for help as 
everything fell around my bed. This was it, the end of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shaking stopped, I made no effort to get up. My apartment was in 
ruins. Where could I go through that battleground? 
</P>
<P>
 It was a while before I heard a voice call, "Judy! Judy!" 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at my door, a flashlight in her hand and a long bathrobe around her, 
was Brenda Blackman, a neighbor whom I'd given a key months ago after my stay 
in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda, who never took out the trash without her makeup on. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda, a former modeling teacher who conducts seminars at junior colleges on 
subjects like "How to Find 100 Lovers," "How to Romance a Woman" and -- the one 
that got her on the Oprah Winfrey show -- "How to Marry Money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She had shrieked in terror when the quake was destroying her apartment, but 
when she saw that the only object left on the wall was my key, she told 
herself, "I have to get Judy and me out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, her hair uncombed, her face pale, the flashlight wavering in her hand, 
she said we were leaving here. 
</P>
<P>
 We? 
</P>
<P>
 "Save yourself," I said. I thought I meant it. I did not want to be the cause 
of someone else's death. At the same time, I found myself getting into my 
wheelchair. Brenda wrapped my blanket around my nightgown. I pulled a coat 
around myself. 
</P>
<P>
 The outside hall was empty. The earth kept groaning. And although I told her 
she should run for it, she shook her head. Water on the floor blackened the hem 
of her robe. We froze for a long moment near the stairs. Then a man came 
hurrying through the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to carry her down the stairs!" Brenda ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 There was doubt in his eyes as he lifted all 102 pounds of me, and he missed a 
step as Brenda guided the wheelchair down the stairs from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the first landing, he'd had enough. "She's too heavy," he told Brenda, 
depositing me in the wheelchair. The ground still shook. Brenda, an expert at 
finding men, found another one -- smaller but fitter. Down we went. 
</P>
<P>
 Would we all make it? I kept my eyes closed and prayed as the ground shook 
again, "Oh, God, don't let these people die because of me." 
</P>
<P>
 And of course they didn't. Outside in the still, dark early morning, a million 
stars shining overhead, we huddled with others, none of whom I knew. But as I 
shivered, one young woman ran for some towels to cover me. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda now started to worry about my need for a restroom for the disabled. She 
conferred with others and decided they'd push me across Burbank Boulevard to 
Tarzana Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait a second," she said, and amazingly ran back into the building to get her 
purse and my medication and change clothes. Earthquake or not, she wasn't about 
to leave the grounds in her bathrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 We were all a sight, but on earthquake morning who cared! Two young women 
stood on either side of the roadway and stopped cars so we could pass. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't hear anything about Tarzana Hospital on television, but despite a 
ceiling ready to fall, water leaks everywhere, regular patients being removed 
to make way for emergencies, they were kind to a refugee like me. They fed me, 
comforted me and said I could stay if I didn't have a place to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda came back to the hospital later and sat with me until my son came to 
take me to his home in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose Brenda Blackman and I may not be neighbors again. We were not close 
friends before the quake, and our building may be pulled down. I have no idea 
where I will be living in three months. 
</P>
<P>
 I shall always remember her as one who reached for the substance within her 
when life was on the line. If she needs another course to teach, she can call 
it "How to Be a Hero."

ON LOCATION; MEET SIX-GUN SHARON STONE; THE ACTRESS DONS HIGH-PLAINS DRIFTER 
GEAR TO DISH OUT HER OWN BRAND OF FRONTIER JUSTICE IN 'THE QUICK AND THE DEAD.' 
AND SHE REALLY LOVES IT.

 "Do we have any blood around?" asks Kevin Conway, looking up from the mud 
puddle in which he has been wallowing for several minutes. The question is 
instantly distilled into a command, and echoed up a line of recent film school 
graduates in headsets.  
</P>
<P>
 "Blood!" A makeup artist bursts through a set of swinging saloon doors and 
scuttles into the street, where the actor lies cowering at the feet of Sharon 
Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway is not the first man in Hollywood who has found himself in this 
position. Or deserved to. Holding a gun to his head, Stone looks down at the 
spot where a red liquid is being applied to what is left of the lap of Eugene 
Dred, brothelmaster of the fictional town of Redemption. "Your penis has been 
shot off!" she observes cheerfully, as the makeup person scurries off again. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone rode into town on horseback in November, a cigarillo dangling from her 
lips, and the bit very much in her teeth as the star of Sam Raimi's "The Quick 
and the Dead," a big-budget twist on the spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone. 
With Stone cast in the Clint Eastwood role of the mysterious outsider, "The 
Quick and the Dead" intends to be something far more '90s than spaghetti. Think 
of it as Hollywood's first fusilli and chevre Western. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway crosses and uncrosses his legs uncomfortably, waiting for the 
apocalyptic rain to begin again, while Stone asks director Raimi if she should 
kick Dred's gun away. "That's the way Angie Dickinson would do it," Conway 
mutters from his mudhole. 
</P>
<P>
 What is surprising about this scene is how easily Stone has transformed 
herself from Catherine Tramell, the ice maiden of "Basic Instinct" (and Sally 
Eastman, the ice matron of the current "Intersection"), into this cayenne Sgt. 
Pepper of the old frontier. She is a cold fish out of water -- Camille Paglia 
in "Annie Get Your Gun" -- whose very presence in a Stetson and spurs invites 
the question Gene Wilder once asked Cleavon Little in "Blazing Saddles": 
"What's a dazzling urbanite like you doing in a rustic setting like this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, for one thing, she is attempting to reinvent the Catherine wheel, to 
move beyond the hothouse flower in the police interrogation room to something 
far more interesting: a leading lady who is actually leading to something other 
than retirement at 40. "I really like that the woman plays what is classically 
the man's role," Stone says. "Because I'm learning that that's what I'm best 
at. Not that I play it like a man. I think it's woman revealed in a new way." 
</P>
<P>
 From the very first showing of dailies, some executives at TriStar expressed a 
preference to see woman revealed in the old way. "Some people, who shall remain 
nameless, wanted me to wear a dress to ride into town," Stone says. "I thought, 
'Oh yeah, the gunslinger's gonna ride into town side saddle.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice becomes a combination of mince and menace. " ' I am just so darn 
mad! You had better watch it now! ' And there were some people, who shall also 
remain nameless, who were concerned that there really weren't a lot of places 
for me to be naked in this movie. But there are a lot of ways to be sexy other 
than flouncing around in your birthday suit. This character's not trying to run 
around in the nude so she can get control over somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say she won't be nude in "The Quick and the Dead," just that 
she doesn't spend the majority of her day that way. " 'Will she be naked when 
you interview her?' Say yes! Say I was!" The image pleases her. "There's a 
stereotype to everything," she goes on. Stone looks into the beady eyes of her 
ink-stained visitor. "You, for instance, get a certain amount of pressure that 
you're a despicable, untrustworthy ferret. And as you can see, I'm nude. So 
there you have it." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Basic Instinct," America proved it would go see Sharon Stone in a man's 
fantasy of what a woman should be. And the surprising success of the much 
reviled "Sliver" demonstrated Stone's power to embody the European voyeur's 
fantasy of what a woman should be. Her four-day war of nerves in "The Quick and 
the Dead" with the allegorically evil Herod -- played by Gene Hackman -- should 
answer two questions: Is the world ready for Sharon Stone's fantasy of what a 
woman should be? And can Stone make frontier feminism fun? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pleasure because every day I get to come to work and experiment with 
what that is," she says, "what would it be like to be trapped in this situation 
in the Old West? And because I don't have to fit into some agreement of 
femaleness, I get to really be female." 
</P>
<P>
 The gentleman's agreement on Hollywood femaleness, as portrayed in the classic 
Westerns of John Ford and Howard Hawks, consisted primarily of dance hall 
girls, prostitutes, and dance hall girls studying to be prostitutes. "They made 
them wear those unbelievably stupid hairdos," Stone says, "like, excuse me but 
where did they get the cream rinse and the curling iron? 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole depiction of women in film has been a joke. It's rarely been a 
picture of a woman as women really are. It's much more a man's perspective, a 
man's fantasy of a woman, than it is of the way women actually do anything. I 
go to the movies with my girlfriends, and we come out of the picture going, 'Do 
you do that? I don't do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For her gunfight with the lamentable Dred, Stone spent the better part of a 
week caked in mud, her hair wet and stringy, wearing a wet suit under her 
clothes and plastic bags on her feet. "She's very unglamorous in this movie, 
and she's the one who wanted that," says costume designer Judianna Makovsky, 
who found many of the original costumes used in the Sergio Leone Westerns in a 
vault in Italy, now authentically aged. "Of course, the studio wanted her to 
look good, and we certainly never wanted to pretend that she wasn't feminine. 
The leather pants will help with that." 
</P>
<P>
 For a 35-year-old sex goddess who had to campaign in the B-movies for more 
than a decade before she achieved stardom, Stone seems particularly unconcerned 
about asserting her femininity in this picture. "Well, you know, I think we've 
pretty permanently established my gender," she says. "I think that's an element 
we don't need to view as a mystery anymore." In this picture, it is Stone's 
gender politics that aren't wearing any clothes -- but the leather pants will 
help with that. 
</P>
<P>
 If Redemption reminds moviegoers of no other Wild-West town they have seen, it 
will be because of the house that is perched, buzzard-like, at the end of the 
main street. The house not only blocks off one end of the street from the high 
desert beyond -- a great rarity in a genre that practically hums the tune "Home 
on the Range" under its breath -- but it has been made to look so completely 
evil that production designer Patrizia Von Brandenstein has actually given it 
razor-sharp teeth just over the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 The house is occupied by Herod, played as a deadly dandy by the 
mutton-chopped, bowler-hatted Hackman. "I thought about predatory birds when I 
designed Herod's house," says Von Brandenstein, "and about Dickens, because 
this is a place where bad is very bad, good is very good, and in the end, 
people get what they deserve. This is a town in which there is no commerce, no 
society, no school, and no sheriff. Children don't thrive here, and babies 
aren't born. But now a cleansing rain has hit Redemption. It's all very 
allegorical, but it's not tongue in cheek." 
</P>
<P>
 Allegorical Westerns have a way of galloping over the top if they aren't 
carefully reined in, which explains Hackman's sure-footed and stabilizing 
presence in "The Quick and the Dead." After making only one Western in his 
career, Hackman is well on his way to becoming the Gabby Hayes of the '90s, 
having reeled off "Unforgiven," "Geronimo" and now "The Quick and the Dead," in 
just three years.  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever else its effect on Hackman's career, this little midlife gambol has 
paid an unexpected return: He is now the fastest draw in the Westwood movie 
district. "Gene has the quickest draw around here, maybe in the business," says 
Thell Reed, the film's gun coach and a former world record holder in the fast 
draw. "He works at it pretty hard." Feared by all the other bankable cowpokes 
from Brentwood to Bel-Air, Hackman was the natural choice to slap leather with 
Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of leather gets slapped during the course of the movie's four days, and 
not all of it is holsters. Russel Crowe, the brooding Australian who played a 
skinhead in "Romper Stomper" last year, and 19-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio, who 
plays the retarded boy in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," are Stone's unlikely 
love interests. In fact, the two young tyros were attracted to the picture by 
the opportunity to watch Hackman work his close-up magic, rather than any 
particular interest in either Stone or the chance to play cowboys. "I never 
really liked Westerns," says DeCaprio. "I thought they were extremely boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this posse of talented actors, the picture belongs to Stone. That she 
will receive top billing is a testament to her international star power, but it 
is also a kind of bullseye for plummeting grosses. "The Quick and the Dead" 
will likely stand or fall based on how willing audiences are to accept Sharon 
Stone as a cranky cowgirl. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sometimes cowgirls get the muse. Between gunfights, Stone sits next to 
an electric space heater in the frigid saloon, steam rising off her as if she 
were about to spontaneously combust. A makeup person has been covering her left 
wrist with liquid skin and blood, and at one point accidentally starts to peel 
back Stone's real skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love the violence," Stone says. "Whenever somebody suggests cutting it 
back, I'm like, no, no, more violent, I want it to be more violent. There's 
something about a period movie, and particularly a movie that's this kind of 
new genre, that takes the reality out of the violence, it doesn't romanticize 
it." Reaching for the Colt Peacemaker on her hip, she adds in a gravelly, tough 
hombrette voice, "Otherwise I'm gonna kill somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure the picture would stand out visually in what has become a 
stampede of Westerns, Stone insisted that the 34-year-old Raimi, whose 
background was in low-budget splatter films like "Army of Darkness" and 
"Darkman," be brought in to direct. Stone says, "He was the only person on my 
list, and if Sam hadn't made this movie, I don't think I would have made it. 
It's the kind of picture I don't think just anyone could have made, even any 
great directors, because of the kind of material it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most deferential human being ever to look through a Panaflex lens, 
Raimi unfailingly refers to everyone on the set as "sir" or "ma'am," and wears 
a tie every day because he had seen old stills of D. W. Griffith wearing a suit 
and tie while directing some ancient desert epic. "I do it as a sign of respect 
for the cast and crew," Raimi says, though he waited until he was in his 
mid-20s. "Young kids," he says, as if recalling some past unpleasantness, "it 
doesn't look good if they wear a tie." 
</P>
<P>
 Raimi had never directed a picture with big stars like Stone and Hackman, but 
the challenge of that quickly paled next to making a Western that is nearly all 
gunfights. "I was a little scared at first," he says. "There's a fine line 
between the cliche of previous Westerns and the classic aspects of previous 
Westerns," Raimi says. "Is the gunfight something that's so cliche the audience 
really doesn't want to see it anymore? Or is it a classic element that has gone 
beyond the cliche and into the myth of the thing? I just keep asking myself 
what new edge are we bringing to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Each gunfight has been choreographed differently so that it is stylistically 
unlike the one before it. The producers also brought along veteran character 
actors like Woody Strode and Pat Hingle to create a visual link with the old 
Westerns. But without a distinctly modern look, the endless exchanges of hot 
lead would fall flat, and Stone -- who is credited as a producer for the first 
time in her career -- wanted Raimi's eye. "When Sharon Stone says, 'I want 
you,' " Raimi says coquettishly, "what man could feel bad?" 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Simon Moore could feel bad, and did. Moore is the Englishman who 
wrote the screenplay for "The Quick and the Dead," despite never having seen 
the American West, and had planned to direct it. "I was told Simon had already 
raised the money in Europe to do it," says producer Josh Donen, "and that I 
should back off." Instead, Donen showed a bit of his own gunslinger side by 
moving Moore aside to get Stone for his leading lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone had just come off what she said was a blissful experience making 
"Intersection," and was determined to use the power conferred on her by the 
unexpected grosses of "Sliver" to make "The Quick and the Dead" her own 
vehicle, if not "Stagecoach." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Sliver' was my big learning experience," she says. "I had the right to say 
no to all kinds of things in my contract that I rolled over in an effort not to 
be difficult, to be a good girl. And everything I rolled over on became the 
enormous errors of that picture. So I got to the point in the production of 
this of fighting for everything. 'I am not rolling over on this. It will not be 
less than this. It will go like this.' I became very adamant that the quality 
of the piece be maintained." 
</P>
<P>
 She was, of course, immeasurably aided in this by her own reputation as a pain 
in the neck. "That's OK," she says, "having a reputation as a bitch makes 
people stay back a little bit, which gives me room to breathe. I don't mind it 
that much. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we were ready to make the movie, I didn't want to make it I was 
so worn out," she adds. "The night before the read-through I was running a 
102-degree fever because I didn't want to face going. But by the time I left 
the rehearsal I was all right. We did all the fighting before we got here." 
Nobody had to tell her to smile when she said that. She already was.

COVER STORY; A FEW GOOD COLORS ARE PLENTY; HAS IT REALLY BEEN 30 YEARS SINCE 
ROY LICHTENSTEIN FIRST BROUGHT US THOSE CARTOON PAINTINGS? WELL, YES. AND NOW 
TAKE A GUIDED TOUR WITH THE ARTIST THROUGH HIS LIFE, TIMES AND ALL THOSE DOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a bright winter morning, before the arctic weather descended upon the city, 
Roy Lichtenstein walks into the Guggenheim Museum. Although it's a Thursday and 
the museum is closed to visitors, the entire building feels animated by a 
spectacular retrospective of Lichtenstein's work. The paintings -- with their 
bold outlines and primary-colored images -- spiral around the Frank Lloyd 
Wright ramp, spilling out like a brilliant reel of film unwinding. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, organized by Diane Waldman, Guggenheim senior curator and deputy 
director, opens at Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art today, featuring 88 
paintings and sculptures spanning the artist's three-decade career. (In 1969, 
Waldman organized the Guggenheim's first Lichtenstein retrospective; 25 years 
later, she returned to his work with unflagging enthusiasm.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lichtenstein's choosing to work within a limited palette might seem harshly 
deliberate (he once told a journalist that "yellow is yellow and red is red. . 
. . To me, skies are the same everywhere: A sky is simply blue dots"), but his 
visual lexicon -- everything for the perfect home found through the Yellow 
Pages, troubled girls lost in romance-comic episodes, brusque men engaged in 
business and war, and the formidable icons of modernist art and architecture -- 
is extraordinarily rich and facile. Lichtenstein knows his material, and he 
riffs on it with a virtuoso's flair. "Like Stravinsky or Thelonious Monk," he 
says, "I like making dissonances in my work." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lichtenstein and I meet on this winter day to view his retrospective 
together, his look is completely unself-conscious, reassuringly casual: 
well-worn canvas deck shoes, a boat-neck sweater, his silver hair tied into a 
ponytail about the size of a small sable watercolor brush. 
</P>
<P>
 He's surprisingly unassuming, considering his fame and influence, and yet he 
is known for that. In the mid-'70s, when Conceptual artist Don Celender 
produced a pack of art-world baseball trading cards for Ivan Karp's O. K. 
Harris Gallery, Lichtenstein's read: "The nicest guy in the art world." In a 
Vanity Fair profile published last summer, the 70-year-old artist was described 
as "preternaturally boyish" and remarkably shy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, Lichtenstein moved to Southampton, on the eastern end of Long Island; 
for 13 years, it was his sole residence and studio. He now divides his time 
between Southampton and Manhattan's West Village. "I do love the light out on 
Long Island," he remarks. "But I always painted the entablatures (architectural 
images) out there and the seascapes in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Before we begin our tour at the Guggenheim, Lichtenstein takes off his jacket 
and casts about the gallery looking for somewhere to leave it. The public 
cloakroom is closed, and the sole guard who has been assigned to us is lurking 
at a respectful distance. Lichtenstein gingerly places his jacket on a ledge at 
the bottom of the museum's ramp. Still hesitant, he looks up: His paintings 
have taken complete command of the space -- he can probably leave his jacket 
anywhere he wants to. 
</P>
<P>
 In the center of the ground-floor gallery stands a painted bronze sculpture 
from 1981 titled "Brushstroke." It's a petrified Expressionist gesture, an 
image of fluidity rendered in the most rigid, solid way possible. Lichtenstein 
delightedly describes the sculpture and its anti-intuitive concept as "absurd." 
As he rolls the word around in his mouth, his enormous blue eyes widen and he 
smiles rather slyly -- absurdity is clearly delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 In his paintings, Lichtenstein has rendered, with dense black outlines, such 
ordinarily ephemeral events as sunsets and explosions. "I think it is absurd," 
says Lichtenstein, "to outline brush strokes and paint drips and to make water 
glasses and light rays more palpable." 
</P>
<P>
 Lichtenstein is a New Yorker, born and bred. He grew up across Central Park 
from the Guggenheim in the West 80s. He attended the Franklin School for Boys, 
graduating in 1940. He spent that summer studying with American Social Realist 
painter Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League. 
</P>

 RL: New York was so different in those days. Obviously there were the same 
streets and many of the same buildings but so many fewer cars. There were no 
traffic jams, and there was always a place to park. The subway only cost a 
nickel, and you could go anywhere. The cars had woven-rush seats, and men would 
stand up to give women their seats. My mother said that in her day, when they 
still had trolley cars, if a woman got on the trolley, all the men would stand 
up and tip their hats. Can you imagine that? They certainly don't do that a lot 
anymore. It's hard to imagine those days when no one would leave the house 
without a hat.  
</P>
<P>
 SM: As a child, did you visit the Metropolitan Museum? 
</P>
<P>
 RL: I went there a lot; it was always empty. All of the museums then were 
relatively empty.  
</P>
<P>
 SM: They didn't have scarves and coffee mugs for sale around every corner. 
</P>
<P>
 RL: That's right. Now when you walk around through the show, you are led 
straight into the shop. Apparently, it's a really successful idea, so the gift 
shops are now included as part of the museum's budget.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Lichtenstein's "Modern Paintings and Sculpture" series from the late '60s, 
he captures another New York era -- Art Deco. In "Modern Sculpture With Velvet 
Rope" -- two highly geometric brass stanchions are strung together with a 
theatrical velvet rope -- he creates a period icon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 RL: Art Deco wasn't actually a part of my life, but it was a style that I saw 
in the movies. I was 11 when Rockefeller Center and Radio City were being 
built. Of course, there was also the Chrysler Building, but it didn't really 
make an impression on me when I was young.  
</P>
<P>
 My grandparents had come from Germany, so my family was still living a German 
Victorian life -- with a lot of big heavy furniture.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lichtenstein left New York in 1940 to study fine arts at Ohio State 
University. In 1943, he was drafted into the Army. Asked how long he served, 
the artist answers: "Long enough. I didn't set the war effort back too much." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1946, he returned to Ohio State and studied with Hoyt Sherman. Sherman, a 
follower of educational reformer John Dewey, was an engineer, artist and the 
author of the renowned "Drawing by Seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 RL: Hoyt Sherman was interested in perception as it pertains to art. For his 
class, he had created a room that was totally dark -- which is actually a very 
difficult thing to do. In this room, he would flash a slide of an image just 
made up of smudges. We would have a pile of newsprint in front of us so we 
could immediately make a drawing of what we had just seen. When you view a 
slide in total darkness, you experience a very strong afterimage. Each slide 
would appear very quickly in a flash of light. You couldn't focus on separate 
parts, so in the darkness you would see an entire afterimage. You would have to 
reach for the paper, make a drawing and use a real visual, kinesthetic sense. 
Taking that information into the real world was very useful. I tried to 
continue with that same strong, visual sense.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lichtenstein received his bachelor of fine arts from Ohio State; he completed 
his masters degree there too, in 1949, and also took part in his first group 
exhibition there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to be in New York," Lichtenstein says, "but I couldn't just 
move to New York -- I had a family, kids, I had to make a living. At that time, 
very well-known artists -- Ad Reinhardt, Robert Motherwell -- were teaching in 
New York. Any artists who hadn't had a million shows couldn't possibly get a 
teaching job in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Lichtenstein taught in Ohio, then at the State University of New York at 
Oswego; in 1960, he was appointed assistant professor at Douglass College, the 
women's division of Rutgers University, in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rutgers, Lichtenstein met artist Allan Kaprow, who, as Lichtenstein 
recalls, "had finished with paintings and was doing Happenings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 RL: Allan Kaprow introduced me to Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, George Segal and 
Bob Whitman. Everyone was doing Happenings. I went to them, but I never did one 
myself. I am probably the only artist in the world who has no idea of what to 
do with a movie or a play. I never had any idea for anything that happens in 
time. Every artist always wants to be a movie director. I guess movies are 
glamorous, and it's more fun than being in the studio alone, painting.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kaprow, who also coined the term Happenings , argued to Lichtenstein that 
paintings didn't have to look like art. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lichtenstein was already working from two-dimensional sources 
(reproductions of history paintings, advertisements, a $10 bill), his paintings 
still greatly resembled the art that he had looked at -- there was the Cubist 
influence of Picasso, the fancifulness of Klee and Miro and the flat Modernist 
style found in the work of Stuart Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1960, Lichtenstein was making paintings of what he saw in the world -- the 
Benday dot screens used in commercial printing, the single-frame dramas of 
bubble-gum comics, the advertisements in the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
 He began to relate painting more directly to printing. "Dots are not an 
elegant European painting texture," he says. "They relate to a vernacular form 
of expression." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, Kaprow suggested that Lichtenstein show his paintings to Ivan Karp, 
who was then working with art dealer Leo Castelli. Lichtenstein tied some 
paintings to the top of his station wagon and drove into the city from his home 
in Highland Park, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 As the artist carried his painting "The Engagement Ring" (one of his blond 
Sunday-funnies heroines, wearing a string of pearls and sporting bright red 
fingernails, asks pensively: "It's . . . it's not an engagement ring, is it?") 
up the gallery stairs, Karp was talking to a group of students. When 
Lichtenstein and his painting reached the group, Karp turned to Lichtenstein 
and his painting and announced: "And this is the art of the '60s!" 
</P>
<P>
 And it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I felt wonderful," Lichtenstein recalls. Castelli, who became the 
seminal champion of Pop art, asked the artist to join the gallery. Lichtenstein 
had his first show there in February, 1962. (Castelli initially turned down the 
work of another artist working with cartoon imagery -- Andy Warhol, who joined 
the gallery in 1964.) 
</P>
<P>
 The current Lichtenstein retrospective begins with his 1961 painting "Look 
Mickey" (another of the paintings strapped to the roof of his car that fateful 
day). In it, Donald Duck, a fishhook caught in his coattails, peers 
ecstatically into the water and exclaims -- "Look Mickey, I've hooked a big 
one!!" Looking on this hapless scene, Mickey Mouse stifles a guffaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look Mickey" was the big one. It remains an astonishingly fresh painting; 
with its purposely flat painting style and a seemingly unpainterly concern for 
shape rather than light, as well as its humorously banal subject matter 
regarded with real seriousness, the work cracked open the ideas and methods 
that would fuel Lichtenstein's work during the next 30 years. It is the work 
that Lichtenstein has referred to as his "first painting with no Expressionism 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Until quite recently, the artist had kept this painting in his personal 
collection; "Look Mickey" is now a promised gift to the National Gallery of Art 
in Washington, in honor of its 50th anniversary last year. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lichtenstein and I walk through his show together, he stops at 
paintings, pauses before speaking, surveys the canvas for changes, considers 
the passage of time and then introduces them as warmly as an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 As we arrive at the 1962 painting "Masterpiece" (a man and a woman look at a 
painting, and the woman exclaims: "Why Brad darling, this painting is a 
masterpiece! My, soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work!") 
Lichtenstein confides, irony tingeing his smile, that "she" -- the sloe-eyed 
blonde oozing with enthusiasm -- "really does know -- she can tell masterpieces 
very easily, this girl." 
</P>
<P>
 And Brad, the hero of this particular series of paintings, has to agree. "I 
always changed their names to Brad," Lichtenstein says of the manly men he 
would borrow from comic books to star in his paintings. "Brad sounded like the 
real masculine name at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Lichtenstein has taken apart images and reassembled them 
according to his own methods. Besides making use of popular images, he has 
quoted liberally from art history as well. Picassos, Mondrians and Monets have 
all been translated into Lichtenstein's unique language. Beginning in the '70s, 
art became more obviously his subject. He works like an editor, selecting 
images with the precise resonance and exact meanings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really analyze the images," he says. Many of the sources for his 
paintings appear as illustrations in the exhibition's catalogue. Over the 
years, he has filled notebooks with found images, potential subject matter for 
his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I will see something interesting, but it will only become usable 
much later," he explains. "I just use what feels right to me." 
</P>
<P>
 He has used banal images borrowed from newspapers -- a woodcut version of 
Gilbert Stuart's famous portrait of George Washington found in a Hungarian 
newspaper, a golf ball advertisement painted in the style of Mondrian and an 
illustration of the before-and-after effects of invisible reweaving -- a truly 
modern miracle -- rendered in Lichtenstein's painting as a stark religious 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really did a good job; you can hardly see it," Lichtenstein says as he 
facetiously examines his own handiwork -- as if his artist's representation of 
this subject were, in fact, the remarkable genuine article. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw what kind of picture this ad could make, I thought that making it 
a diptych would make it even more absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, Lichtenstein was commissioned to paint his first large-scale mural -- 
for the New York State Pavilion, a circular building designed by Philip 
Johnson, at the World's Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were about 10 artists who were commissioned -- Rauschenberg, 
Rosenquist, Warhol all did something," Lichtenstein recalls. "I was still 
living in Highland Park, so I constructed a scaffolding in front of the garage. 
I made a painting of a woman looking out the window. I thought that the 
curtains and the siding, everything that didn't appear on the building but did 
appear in my painting, could ruin the architecture. I thought the painting was 
huge -- it was 24 feet high and 16 feet wide. But when I got it to the fair, it 
looked like nothing. There was a UniRoyal tire that was 80 feet high. It's true 
about sculpture too -- if you place it next to a building that is 50 stories 
high, it disappears. It looks like a brooch on the architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 Lichtenstein has continued to create murals. Beginning in the 1980s he has 
worked on commissioned murals for specific architectural sites. At Castelli's 
Greene Street Gallery, a temporary mural was completed in just eight days, 
after months of planning by the artist and his assistants. Working on such a 
large scale (at its highest point, the mural was 18 feet high and nearly 96 
feet long), Lichtenstein was able to rework his old images (Art Deco motifs, 
Pop images of Swiss cheese and black-and-white composition book covers, the 
petrified brush stroke) mixed in with new and references to other artists' 
paintings. The scale, like that of an epic motion picture, allowed him to cover 
a great deal of territory and time. Although the Greene Street mural was only 
temporary, Lichtenstein told a writer that he had created it "for the pleasure 
of the dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Lichtenstein's large-scale projects -- "Mural With Blue Brushstroke" (1986) at 
New York's Equitable Tower and "Bauhaus Stairway: The Large Version" (1989) at 
the Creative Artists Agency in Beverly Hills -- are history paintings of a new 
and impressive variety. Lichtenstein's murals convey a late-20th-Century 
panoramic view of art history by simultaneously replaying the artist's own 
early work alongside references to the work of other artists. 
</P>
<P>
 For his subject matter, Lichtenstein has always preferred working from the two 
dimensional, the already reproduced image. In the 1970s, he began a series of 
paintings of entablatures, the architectural friezes that run along the facades 
of buildings. Lichtenstein deviated from his usual method of finding images and 
in a rare instance took his own photographs of the classical cornices found on 
various Manhattan buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message found in that type of architectural detail is that 'this is 
substantial,' " he explains. "The entablatures really do represent culture, the 
Establishment." 
</P>
<P>
 As painted by Lichtenstein, the entablatures appear without any context; their 
long, narrow horizontal formats give the impression that the geometric pattern 
runs on endlessly. They are also, despite their architectural reference, 
decidedly formal and abstract. 
</P>
<P>
 During this same period in the early '70s, Lichtenstein also worked on a 
series of "Mirror" paintings. The mirrors too are abstract; the light reflected 
in them is reduced to a series of dots and diagonal lines. For the "Mirror" 
paintings, Lichtenstein also took photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do usually work from two dimensions," he says. "I don't work from real 
things. But I needed an idea of what mirrors really look like; I photographed 
magnifying mirrors because your reflection then appears out of focus and you 
don't get in the subject matter." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, he painted "Self-Portrait," a Magritte-style joke -- the artist is 
represented by the open neckline of a white T-shirt topped by a rectangular 
mirror reflecting rows of dots. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to tell if it's a self-portrait or if it isn't," the artist 
remarks with amusement. "Anyway, I think 'Self Portrait' is always a good title 
for a painting." He looks at his watch and realizes he's about to be late for a 
lunch date. We start to race through the show, no longer lingering, making a 
quick remark here and there. 
</P>
<P>
 Lichtenstein's devotion to the two-dimensional is evident everywhere. In a 
group of ceramic works, tottering stacks of teacups and portrait heads of 
cartoon heroines, shade and contour have been indicated in the most 
two-dimensional way -- patterns of dots and thickened lines -- across the 
three-dimensional surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Reclining Mermaid" (1979), a sculpture commissioned by the Miami Beach 
Theater for the Performing Arts, is a silhouette of enameled steel reclining 
between the cutout sky and sea. "I was thinking of a Henry Moore with a slice 
cut through it," the artist says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last gallery, all the years come together magnificently in 
Lichtenstein's recent paintings, the "Interiors." Furnished with advertisements 
from the Yellow Pages, these interiors are also decorated with art -- old and 
new, invented and borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 In these paintings, the artist juggles his own "Girl With a Tear" with a 
kidney-shaped swimming pool, a comically reconstructed bonsai tree and his own 
living-room suites of the '60s. These interiors are large, invigorating, 
ambitious: The bright rooms are reflected in angled mirrors, the homely images 
culled from the Yellow Pages are romanced in grand style, and the high-art 
references are given a good-humored tweak. The "Interiors" are complex and 
lively, a brilliantly performed riff to make a virtuoso feel proud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of these glorious "Interiors," the artist apologizes for having 
to run off so suddenly. Together, we ride the elevator to the ground floor, 
where his jacket is still lying safely on the ledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back at some of the early paintings, Lichtenstein remarks: "When I did 
those paintings, they were so new, almost vulgar, too fresh. They didn't have 
any museum qualities. Now, they're a little grayer, and they almost look 
precious. Here they are under glass, framed, taken care of, hung up in a 
museum." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's just the passing of time . . . ," I start to suggest. "That 
legitimized the work," he answers, and then he really does have to run. 
</P>
<P>
 On Fifth Avenue, the brisk air throws the city into sharp outline: black, 
leafless trees line the park's edge, and the enormous white, slightly 
off-kilter shape of the Guggenheim looks like a cutout against the bright blue 
sky. A row of taxis and one enormous white limousine are lined up outside the 
museum's entrance. With a bright step, Lichtenstein runs off and hops into a 
waiting cab -- as yellow as yellow in any one of his paintings -- and heads 
downtown.

POP MUSIC; PAN-AMERICAN PUNK; ROCKERS FROM ALL OVER LATIN AMERICA ARE FINDING 
POWER IN THEIR OWN WORDS AND TUNES THESE DAYS -- AND THE WORLD IS LISTENING 
</P>

<P>
 From the uncompromising artistry of Argentina's Divididos to the savage 
intensity of Mexico's Maldita Vecindad, there is a new generation of bands that 
has brought an invigorating spirit and promise to the world of rock en espanol. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the stereotype harbored by most English-speaking rock fans of Latino 
bands as watered-down imitations of British and American groups, the best of 
these espanol groups offer a liberating blend of traditional rock values with 
regional sounds and themes. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bands would welcome attention in the English-speaking markets, their 
music isn't tempered by crossover dreams. The focus of these bands remains the 
hard-core hispano world. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, 1994 is the ripest moment ever for los rockeros -- especially in Los 
Angeles, which, because of its large Latino population, is the unofficial 
capital of rock en espanol in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latin departments of record labels are increasing their number of album 
releases every year, and MTV Latino was launched last October, bringing rock en 
espanol to 14 countries around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 By midyear, MTV Latino will be seen in most U.S. cities with a major Latino 
population, an exposure that could lead Latin radio stations to increase the 
amount of air time devoted to this music.  
</P>
<P>
 Historically, Hispanic radio stations in this country have opted to air 
softer, pop-oriented material without acknowledging the existence of a huge 
number of youngsters who can't stand Luis Miguel or Magneto. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the bands? Who are the main creative forces in the rock en 
espanol movement? 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in order, is my list of the 10 Latin American bands that best reflect 
the new vitality of the movement. Though several bands in Spain -- notably 
Celtas Cortos, El Ultimo de la Fila, Negu Gorriak and Os Resentidos -- are also 
doing important work, the Spanish rock scene has historical and commercial 
characteristics that make its bands stand somewhat apart from the contemporary 
urgency of the Latin American scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1. Divididos (Argentina). Argentina traditionally has produced the most 
influential and exciting Spanish-language rock bands. It's a pattern that began 
in the late '60s when such pioneering groups as Los Gatos and Almendra broke 
from the tradition of simply recording Spanish versions of British and American 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 By writing their own songs, those Argentines brought a revolutionary energy 
and sense of cultural identity to the scene. Crucially, they also sang the 
songs in Spanish and incorporated regional musical strains, including tango, in 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
 During the '70s and early '80s, Charly Garcia headed a long list of talented 
Argentine performers who carried on the legacy of those pioneers and passed it 
on to such '80s groups as Sumo, a cult favorite whose wildly eclectic approach 
-- incorporating everything from reggae to metal -- served as the foundation 
for what's happening now in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 When that group dissolved in 1987 after the drug-related death of its leader, 
Luca Prodan, guitarist-vocalist Ricardo Mollo and bassist Diego Arnedo formed 
Divididos with drummer Gustavo Collado, who was later replaced by Federico Gil 
Sola. 
</P>
<P>
 Better than any of their colleagues who have experimented with rock and 
Argentine folk -- and there have been many talented ones -- Divididos 
effortlessly adapt sambas and chacareras to create a fierce, bluesy, funky 
sound that stresses both power and melody at all times. Their first single, 
"Que Ves?" ("What Do You See?"), for instance, is a catchy but powerful " chaca 
-reggae," representative of Divididos' peculiar fusion style. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnedo is the son of noted Argentine folklorist Santiago Arnedo, and the trio 
has a strong local influence, especially in the way its abstract lyrics and 
emotional vocals update the spirit of the tango. But make no mistake: Divididos 
is a true rock 'n' roll band. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Maldita Vecindad (Mexico). The student massacre at Tlatelolco in 1968, 
where 100 to 400 protesters were slain (depending on whether you accept the 
official or the unofficial version), was a tragic setback for the already 
persecuted Mexican rock en espanol movement, because several of the country's 
most promising rock songwriters were either killed in the government crackdown 
or subsequently left the country. 
</P>
<P>
 There remained such an anti-rock attitude among authorities, especially in 
Mexico City, that the music had little chance for growth in the '70s and early 
'80s. With few exceptions, it was difficult to even be in a band in much of 
Mexico during those years, much less in a band that had a rebellious edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Things started opening up in the '80s, first with the guaca- rock trio 
Botellita de Jerez, led by Sergio Arau (the son of Alfonso Arau, director of 
"Like Water for Chocolate"), and then with Caifanes (see No. 9 on the list), 
whose contemporary version of the popular classic "La Negra Tomasa" was such a 
hit that the media could no longer ignore what was happening in Mexican rock. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maldita Vecindad made an even greater impact on the scene in 1989 by 
becoming the first of the new Mexican rock bands to gain attention in the 
English-language press -- for many the true test of credibility of rock en 
espanol . 
</P>
<P>
 Maldita Vecindad's debut album that year established it as the first band to 
prove that Mexicans could compete with Argentine and Spanish rockers. The 
group's second album, 1991's "El Circo" ("The Circus"), had such a strong 
influence on Mexican hard-core rock that it could be called the "Sgt. Pepper's" 
of Mexican rock. It gained rave reviews and sold an unprecedented 500,000 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldita is the ultimate Mexico City band, giving the listener a sense of the 
frantic pulse of life there -- bombarding you with heartbreaking images of the 
circus-like atmosphere and utter poverty that is found in much of the downtown 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The music itself couldn't be any less brutal. A savagely intense but often 
humorous blend of funk, ska, punk, rap, boleros, rancheras and a delicate touch 
of Caribbean rhythms, all played by Mexican youngsters who grew up loving the 
norteno quintet Los Tigres del Norte and balladeer Juan Gabriel as much as the 
Beatles and the Stones. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Cafe Tacuba (Mexico). No debut album in Mexican rock had the impact of 
1991's "Cafe Tacuba," which featured a frantic mix of nortenas , boleros, pop, 
punk and virtually all the other sounds identified with the musical heritage of 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Ruben Albarran's voice and manner are a strange mix of rural 
sensitivity and middle-class urban youth rage. He's joined in the group by 
Emmanuel del Real on keyboards, Quique Rangel on stand-up bass and Joselo 
Rangel on Spanish guitar. They bring to the stage unmatched freshness and 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's uniqueness has turned off some listeners, who don't consider it a 
rock band. But if rock means freedom, irreverence and unpredictability, Cafe 
Tacuba, which toured as part of the second stage of "Lollapalooza" in 1992, is 
among the greatest Spanish-speaking rock groups ever. 
</P>
<P>
 4. La Lupita (Mexico). The hottest, baddest and most promising band from the 
BMG-distributed Culebra Records, the most important independent label for 
alternative rock bands in Mexico. With its 1992 debut album, "Pa' Servir a 
Usted" ("At Your Service"), the group offered an enjoyable 
grunge-funk-pop-metal- nortena combo, even leaving room for little disco 
flashbacks. But it's La Lupita's soaring live performances that suggest that we 
might be talking about the future of Mexican rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for a second recording with production whiz Gustavo Santaolalla (Cafe 
Tacuba, Maldita Vecindad, Divididos) haven't materialized so far, but La Lupita 
should nevertheless be able to top its previous material. A suggestion to the 
quintet: Give co-singer Rosa Adame a more prominent role. A suggestion to the 
reader: Don't miss the group's next Los Angeles appearance, probably in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Cuca (Mexico). Representative of a traditional leather-clad, straight-ahead 
type of rock 'n' roll, Cuca still manages to do it with an originality and 
humor frequently missing in this area of Latin rock. Cuca (short for cucaracha 
, cockroach) favors a slightly twisted approach, with Cuban-born singer Jose 
Fors -- arguably Mexico's best rock singer -- writing lyrics on female beauty 
("Pizza Face") and life origins ("Son of the Milkman") with a fast-paced edge 
and wit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuca is the other Guadalajara band: If pop-rock megastars Mana are one side of 
the coin, Cuca is definitely the other. Following up its 1992 debut, "La 
Invasion de los Blatidos" ("The Invasion of the Roaches"), the band has just 
released "Tu Cuca Madre Ataca de Nuevo" ("Your Cuca Mother Attacks Again"). If 
Cuca maintains its sales pace, it will soon become Culebra's No. 1 band, 
despite its somewhat anti-success attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Soda Stereo (Argentina). The light-pop trio, led by talented 
guitarist-singer-songwriter Gustavo Cerati, is the smartest pop-rock en espanol 
band and definitely the most important Argentine band of the last nine years 
before Divididos. Soda Stereo is better than it seems, because behind the 
catchy melodies, standard light-pop sound and sensual, romance lyrics, the 
group created a radio-friendly product without crossing the often violated line 
into stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerati, one of Argentine rock's most creative minds, gives the group a 
credibility lacking in most similar mainstream projects. Its six albums, 
despite ups and downs, assure the group a respectable place in rock en espanol' 
s hall of fame. Key albums: 1983's "Soda Stereo" and 1990's "Cancion Animal" 
("Animal Song"), the latter a rare sample of Soda at its rawest. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Los Fabulosos Cadillacs (Argentina). Despite their success, the stubborn 
Fabulosos Cadillacs have been battling detractors from day one. They were 
considered a bunch of jumping gorditos (clowns) when they arrived 12 years ago 
as a nine-man ska group, complete with black suits and sunglasses. After 
silencing their South American competitors with huge sales, they made their Los 
Angeles debut at the 1989 Latin Rock Festival at the Sports Arena, where they 
were greeted by flying beer and nachos thrown by hard-core Mexican fans who 
were there to hear legendary blues band El Tri. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after six albums and an evolution that has resulted in a powerful, 
everything-goes mix of ska, tropical, rock, Tex-Mex, etc., and vastly improved 
musicianship, the Caddies are either loved or despised. "Vasos Vacios" ("Empty 
Glasses"), a compilation featuring two new songs, was released in Argentina in 
December and will come out in the United States next month. Like Cafe Tacuba, 
Los Fabulosos Cadillacs are not for all tastes, but their honesty and hard work 
have kept them on the spot for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Bersuit Vergarabat (Argentina). Give this sextet a good producer and budget 
and it could top its impressive 1991 debut, "Y Punto" ("Period"). Singing in 
the nasal voice typical of Argentine barrios, the group captures the 
frustration of disillusioned Argentine youth who have realized nothing changed 
with the return of democracy in 1983. Bersuit took a step backward with an 
uneven second album, "Asquerosa Alegria" ("Nasty Happiness"). Still, the group 
should bounce back as strong as when it appeared on the scene as one of 
Argentina's most interesting bands. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Caifanes (Mexico). Long gone are the bad old days when they were compared 
with the Cure everywhere they went. Yes, the music is pretty dark, and their 
dense-sounding concerts can either make you fly and identify with leader Saul 
Hernandez's pain or run toward the nearest exit. But Caifanes should not be 
underrated. The group's presence was key for the development of Mexican rock; 
its version of "La Negra Tomasa" taught Mexican youth that inspiration was not 
in London or El Norte but right at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Caifanes' peak came with their third album, 1991's "El Silencio" ("The 
Silence"), produced by former King Crimson member Adrian Belew. After an 
exhausting 1992-93 world tour, bassist Sabo Romo and keyboardist-saxophonist 
Diego Herrera left the group. The main creative team of guitarist Alejandro 
Marcovich, drummer Alfonso Andre and guitarist-singer Hernandez is working on 
new material, which is expected to give Caifanes a rawer, more guitar-based 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Niquel (Uruguay). To name a Uruguayan band among the best in Latin rock 
sounds like scheduling a Moroccan baseball team in the World Series. But 
Uruguay did have its quota of rock, first in the early '70s and then in the 
late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Niquel, the lone survivors of the second coming, made the list thanks to Jorge 
Nasser's songwriting and vocal skills and their intelligent description of life 
in a nation they refer to as a "pseudo country." Moreover, Niquel's other 
contribution is "De Memoria" ("By Heart"), a 1987 collection of versions of 
songs from the "golden years" of Uruguayan rock in the early '70s. Don't look 
for striking originality or ethnicity in Niquel -- just a tight, straight-ahead 
rock band sugar-coated enough to survive commercially in a non-rock country.

MOVIES; THE TRIP TO BANKABLE; AFTER A SERIES OF SUPPORTING ROLES, MADELEINE 
STOWE HAS FINALLY ACHIEVED NAME-ABOVE-THE-TITLE STAR STATUS. AND ALL IT TOOK 
WAS 15 YEARS OF PAYING DUES AND SPEAKING HER MIND -- AND ONE BIG HIT IN 'LAST 
OF THE MOHICANS'

 For somebody who's played a lot of damsels in distress -- remember "Revenge," 
anyone? -- Madeleine Stowe looks pretty well defended. Armored in a bulky gray 
sweater that falls below her knees and her long dark hair swimming about her 
shoulders mermaid-style, the actress seems just the kind of woman who would fly 
in from Texas, where she's buying a new ranch, hurry to a meeting at a swank 
Beverly Hills hotel in her boots, order up a double helping of finger 
sandwiches and turn a discussion about her career -- some rolling of the eyes 
here -- into a polite but pointed dissing of Hollywood and its treatment of 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that demure has ever been Stowe's duende. Anyone who knows the 35-year-old 
actress will tell you she's no diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once Madeleine told me I had to kiss her ass if I wanted her to do something 
on a shoot," recalls Jonathan Kaplan, who directed the actress in the 1992 
thriller "Unlawful Entry" and the upcoming "Bad Girls." "She has no trouble 
speaking her mind no matter what's at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 What's at stake happens to be quite a lot. Ever since Stowe was teamed with 
Daniel Day-Lewis in the 1992 hit "The Last of the Mohicans," her career has 
gone from supporting player to potential star-in-the-making. She was singled 
out by reviewers for her performance as the feisty general's daughter, no easy 
accomplishment given her co-star's high profile. When the film adaptation of 
James Fenimore Cooper's classic grossed more than $75 million at the box 
office, Stowe was suddenly offered bigger, better films. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it was, but that movie changed things," she says with a 
shrug. "Some people even said, 'We'll finance this movie if you say yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Heady stuff for an actress more used to playing the love interest -- brunet 
version -- in such films as "Stakeout" and "The Two Jakes" as well as "Unlawful 
Entry," yet hardly a fluke. This month, Stowe was named best supporting actress 
by the National Film Critics Assn. for her performance as the spunky, cuckolded 
wife in Robert Altman's "Short Cuts." If the award was somewhat unexpected 
given the film's sprawling ensemble nature, it still seems a precursor to a 
possible Oscar nomination next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Stowe will be seen in three new films this spring: "Blink," 
director Michael Apted's thriller, which opened Wednesday; "China Moon," a film 
noir for Orion from Kevin Costner's TIG Productions, shot three years ago and 
finally set for release in March; and "Bad Girls," Kaplan's female-themed 
Western, scheduled for April. 
</P>
<P>
 In two of the films, Stowe gets her first starring roles. In "Blink," she 
plays a partially blind murder witness a la Audrey Hepburn in "Wait Until 
Dark"; in "Bad Girls," she plays the violent, sullen leader of a quartet of 
prostitutes-turned-outlaws, the Clint Eastwood of the demimonde. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a crucial time for Madeleine," Apted observes. "These are the first 
movies she will actually carry, and (if they're successful) she could become a 
major star." 
</P>
<P>
 If Stowe puts any store in this will-she-or-won't-she speculation, she doesn't 
show it. Unlike her fragile screen persona, Stowe in person is armed with a 
fairly robust demeanor, a personality that Altman describes as "not 
push-around-able, a kind of cultural looseness which is either an attitude or 
lack of attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing a good 5-feet-7, she wears little makeup and no jewelry, and her 
square hands with the snub-nosed nails are muscular, capable. She clearly 
relishes her independence and finds acting ideally suited to her real passion 
for her rancher's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the life of an actor," she says, "because you spend brief amounts of 
time with other people and then you just leave. I need to be alone a lot, and I 
need to be outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, she is wary of discussing her career, preferring to talk instead about 
her upcoming move from Los Angeles to Texas -- "I like to be where the light is 
interesting and there is weather" -- her four horses, and her desire to start a 
family (she has been married to actor Brian Benben, the star of HBO's "Dream 
On," for more than eight years). Besides, any talk of Hollywood tends to send 
her into another fit of pique about the industry's more blatantly sexist 
aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always talked about it a lot, so I hesitate now because it's incredibly 
boring," she says, checking herself for a nanosecond before launching into a 
decidedly sardonic take on her upcoming films. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate the title 'Bad Girls,' " she snorts. "It's totally politically 
incorrect, but it's a marketeers dream, don't you think? Can't you see the 
poster: 'Bad Girls' and below that all of us lined up with guns?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her observations of "China Moon" -- something of a "Body Heat" manque , her 
second collaboration with Costner after the disastrously received "Revenge" in 
1990 -- she prefers to keep off the record, "but you'll laugh your ass off," 
she says, sending a few peals of her own around the hotel cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Blink," which despite its small, $11-million budget represents Stowe's 
first real solo starring role, she is already braced for flak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kid you not," she says taking a swig of tea. "A male reporter, younger than 
me, says, 'In this film you play a really abrasive character.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So I say, 'Oh, do you think so?' And he kind of wrinkles his nose and nods. 
'You play a lot of really strong characters, don't you?' he says. 'How do you 
explain that there are so many strong women roles now?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stowe puts her cup down with a clatter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got so angry with him. I said, 'Haven't you been reading all the articles 
on women in Hollywood these days and how there are no decent roles?' But then 
what flashed through my mind is that any (non-traditional) image of women was 
threatening to him and that this was the taste of Middle America, exactly the 
audience the studios are going after." 
</P>
<P>
 What emerges during a nearly two-hour conversation with Stowe is a portrait of 
an actress whose film persona is far removed from her real self, a 
self-possessed woman whose striking, Pre-Raphaelite beauty serves as a 
formidable mask to a decidedly restless soul. Although she insists she's been 
lucky in her career, a self-taught actress who has never taken a day job since 
she was first spotted by an agent as a freshman at USC. But Stowe has clearly 
logged the numerous slights and inequities she's experienced throughout her 
career that began more than 15 years ago with guest appearances on such TV 
shows as "Baretta" and "The Gangster Chronicles." Despite her rising profile, 
she remains someone for whom the glass is still half-empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madeleine is quite unlike most of the characters she has played," Apted says. 
"She projects this fragile beauty, but she is really assertive and sure of 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Kaplan: "Madeleine is so delicate and graceful, but she has a strong, 
iron will. It's unusual to have someone with her kind of fragile body language 
in a woman who is really tough and so utterly fearless when it comes to 
authority." 
</P>
<P>
 As if to bolster Kaplan's assessment, Stowe takes a bite of sandwich, swallows 
hard and rushes on. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm really interested in is erratic behavior," she says, leaning forward 
as if she were passing along an insider-trading tip. "The world is so crazy 
that lately I've been observing the inconsistencies in people. You know, that's 
one of the things that is so lacking in women's roles -- that you're not 
allowed to be inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of the main reasons Stowe chose to do "Blink" as her first major 
role after "The Last of the Mohicans." Although she had doubts about the 
viability of the genre after less-than-happy experiences filming "Unlawful 
Entry" and "China Moon" -- "I don't think thrillers work anymore, because 
they've become too formulaic" -- Stowe recognized in the character of Emma 
Brody not only the engine of the film, but also an unusually well-defined 
female protagonist: a blind fiddler in an Irish band who receives her sight 
after an eye transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I made 'Unlawful Entry' -- which was a very successful film but where 
the woman was a bit of a Barbie doll -- I made a promise to myself that I would 
not allow the same thing to happen again," she says. "But with 'Blink' there 
was this strong female character, someone I had not played before." 
</P>
<P>
 Although ostensibly a typical thriller -- Emma is the only witness to a murder 
-- "Blink" differs from such films as "Wait Until Dark" and 1992's "Jennifer 
Eight" in its focus on the character's medically documented condition, 
retroactive hallucination phenomenon, as well as its non-victimized 
protagonist. Stowe's Brody is an acerbic, demanding woman who hounds the local 
police department while instigating a romance with the chief detective, played 
by Aidan Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the things I appreciated about the film, that Emma got to be 
inconsistent, to the point that some people consider her abrasive," says Stowe, 
who also made alterations to screenwriter Dana Stevens' script, changing her 
character from a poet to a musician -- "It was inherently more cinematic" -- 
and expanding the role of Quinn, with whom Stowe had first worked on 
"Stakeout." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if it's a man or a woman, I don't think it's right to have 
someone just function as the love interest," Stowe says. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us dreaded the idea of the poor girl in peril," says Apted, the 
British documentarian who has also directed such feature films as "Coal Miner's 
Daughter" and "Gorillas in the Mist." "I thought she might embrace the 
character's more fragile aspects. But Madeleine really came at it with strong 
single-mindedness that this woman is not a victim. She's created a woman who is 
much closer to her own personality than anything she's played before." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the contrast between Emma Brody and Stowe's earlier film characters is 
not lost on the actress, who readily concedes that until "Mohicans" and "Short 
Cuts," "I hadn't really liked anything I had done." Although she had attracted 
attention with her first feature film appearance, playing the endangered 
ex-girlfriend in "Stakeout," John Badham's 1987 comic thriller, the actress had 
earned a reputation for turning up on screen partly or fully nude, playing 
exploited women. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a certain amount of sniggering about the amount of nudity she 
engaged in in her films," Apted says, "but Madeleine sees that as part of her 
ammunition. She's like the great actresses in the '30s and '40s, very beautiful 
but with nothing cute about her looks, a woman who is not afraid of her own 
sexuality." 
</P>
<P>
 For an actress so outspoken about the stereotyping of women in Hollywood, 
Stowe has only recently come to a new conclusion about her willingness to shed 
her clothes: "It was never the kind of situation where anybody said, 'You have 
to do this or you won't make this film.' No, I was always a very willing 
participant because it seemed sort of meaningless. But it's become much more 
personal, and it reminds me how dispensable women are." 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude is one reason Stowe is happier with her career since "Mohicans." 
Not only was she playing an independent woman in that film, but the love scenes 
between her character and Day-Lewis' were fully clothed, "about emotion, not 
sex." Her change in attitude also led Stowe to challenge Apted on the love 
scenes in "Blink," as well as to refuse Altman's first offer to work on "Short 
Cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd seen her in a couple of really bad movies where she had been quite good," 
recalls Altman, who had wanted Stowe to play the painter, the controversial 
role ultimately played by Julianne Moore that called for the actress to play a 
scene naked from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Bob had his reasons for it," Stowe says, "but I couldn't find a 
justification for it." Stowe wound up playing the part of Moore's character's 
sister, the wife of Tim Robbins' philandering policeman. Although she had one 
nude scene in which she posed for her sister's painting, "it was essentially a 
comic scene, and I didn't feel exposed in the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 That sense of exposure is crucial not only to Stowe's work but in her personal 
life as well. Stowe -- the oldest of three children born to Robert Stowe, a 
civil engineer from Oregon, and Mireya Mora, the daughter of a prominent Costa 
Rican family -- recalls growing up in Glendale as a painfully shy teen-ager in 
a conservative, troubled home. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, she says, was "a Latin woman with this infinite patience," while 
her father "was largely uncommunicative," a man who battled multiple sclerosis 
for most of Stowe's childhood. (He died in 1983.) 
</P>
<P>
 Her childhood memories run to her father's "huge fits of violence" and awkward 
public scenes of his collapsing in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neighbors would come running, and here we were these three little kids trying 
to pretend that nothing was wrong," Stowe says. "I kept wishing that my mother 
would stand up to him, but she was such a saint. I always felt a little bit 
evil compared to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stowe studied the piano as a child, she never seriously considered a 
career in the arts. She enrolled at USC with the intention of studying 
journalism but wound up cutting classes to volunteer at the Solari Theatre (now 
the Canon) in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up twice to do scenes (at the theater) and I was absolutely terrified," 
she recalls. "I felt the cynicism of the actors: 'This nice little girl, she's 
too inhibited.' And I was." 
</P>
<P>
 It was at the theater that Stowe met her first agent, Meyer Mishkin, who was 
representing Richard Dreyfuss in the theater's production of "The Tenth Man." 
After signing with Mishkin, Stowe dropped out of school and entered acting full 
time. She spent nearly a decade working in television, before a role in the 
miniseries "Blood and Orchids" led to "Stakeout." "I did a lot of terrible work 
for a lot of years," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of her outspokenness, Stowe still seems to be wrestling with the whole 
concept of stardom. When asked about her future, she mentions working with 
director Agnieszka Holland ("Europa Europa") and taking a year off in the same 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very self-indulgent profession," she says, smiling for a moment 
before launching into another self-lacerating analysis of her career. Male 
stars are allowed to "evoke a kind of trust" from audiences, Stowe says, 
"because usually they blast somebody away and we're made to feel good about 
that." Women, on the other hand, "don't evoke that kind of trust." The most 
successful actresses, Stowe believes, manage to combine a sense of "being a 
heroine with a calculated sense of fragility that makes people want to protect 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Stowe pauses, fiddling with her teaspoon. "I think it's a really sad thing. 
Because I have fought that softness in myself. Softness bores the hell out of 
me."

THEATER; THE STORM OVER 'OLEANNA'; WHEN DAVID MAMET AND WILLIAM H. MACY TRIED 
TO TELL THE TAPER HOW TO CAST MAMET'S PLAY ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT, A WHOLE NEW 
CONTROVERSY BROKE

<P>
 The shocked professor pleads for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does this mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 The equally shocked student whispers, "I thought you knew." 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" The professor is almost begging. "What does it mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly the office sways as if anticipating her response. The student 
hesitates, maintaining her balance until the aftershock ends. At last she 
answers her instructor: "You tried to rape me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel Mark Smith steps from behind his desk to confront Kyra Sedgwick, but is 
interrupted again, this time by their director. "Let's drill it one more time," 
William H. Macy commands. "Be right on top of her -- I mean, on top of her 
lines. Be. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Another tremor shakes the office set. The director and his cast pause while 
the stage lights tremble. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake's aftershock ends and for the moment the ground beneath West 
Hollywood's Tiffany Theater is still. But cultural shocks may well resume with 
this Friday's Los Angeles premiere of David Mamet's "Oleanna," the first of two 
productions of the show to hit the Southland this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Mamet's deceptively spare two-character drama about political correctness and 
sexual harassment on a college campus is the most controversial American play 
of the 1990s. Wherever it's been staged -- Boston, New York, London, 
Johannesburg, Stockholm -- "Oleanna" has provoked women's organizations, 
academics, columnists and critics into outraged hyperbole. It's no accident 
that the play's poster is a circular target with a bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Newsday writer Jan Stuart pronounced it "loathsome and riveting." 
Time magazine's William A. Henry III declared it "reason enough to cheer for 
the future of the theater." The Village Voice experienced a radical shift when 
its lead drama critic Michael Feingold judged "Oleanna" to be "cunning . . . a 
tragedy built as a series of audience traps. . . ," while its columnist Alisa 
Solomon condemned the play as "twisted . . . meant to provoke feminists who 
insist on calling (Mamet's) work misogynist." 
</P>
<P>
 But now add the specter of racism to the charges of sexism. In Los Angeles, 
controversy erupted before the play even opened. Members of the "Mamet Mafia" 
-- fiercely loyal actors who have worked with the prolific Mamet for decades -- 
took on the Taper when officials there refused to cast Smith in the role of the 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mark Taper Forum has never staged a Mamet play and isn't likely to anytime 
soon after the backstage battle over "Oleanna." Notorious for being bluntly 
outspoken and uncompromising, Mamet took an interest in this production because 
it is the first to be done in Southern California (San Diego's Old Globe 
Theatre will present a different production May 19-June 26). 
</P>
<P>
 Mamet, who won a Pulitzer in 1984 for "Glengarry Glen Ross," used his muscle 
to insist on Smith, one of his regular team, in part, because Smith lives in 
Los Angeles. The Taper balked, saying they were not comfortable with the 
actor's work. The actor thinks the decision came because he is black, and he 
believes the Taper was uncomfortable casting a black man in a role where he 
would be accused of sexual harassment. The Taper denies race had anything to do 
with their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyalty is the bottom line for Mamet -- he and Macy held firm. Instead of the 
originally scheduled "Oleanna," the Taper's 1994 season opened with Ariel 
Dorfman's "Death and the Maiden." And Macy, instead of guiding his cast in a 
prestigious 750-seat theater, is now standing in the 99-seat Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
 How did this happen? 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Mamet took a strong hand in the creation of the Los Angeles 
premiere production of "Oleanna," and up to a point, the Taper cooperated. Last 
fall, when the Mark Taper Forum selected "Oleanna" as its season debut 
offering, Mamet insisted that his close friend Macy direct. No problem. Taper 
producing director Robert Egan stepped aside. But then the Mamet-Macy team 
decided to cast Smith, a Los Angeles-based actor they had worked with since 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The script's sole character description of the professor, known only as John, 
is "a man in his 40s." But it was Macy -- a 43-year-old white male -- who 
created the role under Mamet's direction for its 1992 world premiere in Boston, 
then took it to New York. In Mamet's text, the professor pontificates about 
"the white man's burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's working relationship with Mamet stretches over 20 years and 
approximately 40 plays and movies, including co-starring with Joe Mantegna in 
Mamet's last feature, "Homicide." Remembering the decision-making process, Macy 
mimicked his conversation with Mamet, their terse, shorthand conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy: "Is it Lonnie (Smith)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mamet: "Yeah. What do you think?" 
</P>
<P>
 Macy: "Yeah. Is it Lonnie or nothing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mamet: "Yeah, why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? Already controversial as written, by casting Smith, Macy recognized 
that he and Mamet had upped the ante, adding racial issues to the polemical 
tale of an educator refuting charges of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy admits he hesitated initially. No rookie director, the longtime Mamet 
protege directed the hit 1988 Lincoln Center premiere of Howard Korder's "Boys' 
Life," as well as numerous Mamet plays. Macy shared his doubts about Smith with 
Mamet. Mamet replied, "It's not going to make any difference, and what 
difference it does make is going to be delicious and wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 In the play, Macy found support. After delivering his "white man's burden" 
lecture, the professor is challenged by his student, an emerging feminist. 
"What has brought you to this place?" asks the young woman. "Not your sex. Not 
your race. Not your class. Your actions!" 
</P>
<P>
 But if a black man and a white woman are alone in a small office, wouldn't the 
subject of race be inevitable? Macy observed himself thinking such thoughts 
while considering Smith for the role. "What incredible racist issues I have, 
unbeknownst to me," he realized. "For instance, I said to myself, 'You get a 
black man and a white girl on stage, can they talk about something besides 
race?' What a ridiculous notion! I also said to myself, 'But their speech 
patterns are so white in the text.' And that's a horribly racist, ridiculous 
thing to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who still believes race kept him from playing the part at the Taper, 
couldn't believe he had been chosen from the first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like everybody else in America," says Smith, who's worked in five Mamet 
stage productions, one television production and in three Mamet movies. "I'm 
conditioned to de facto segregation and racism. I never thought David and Bill 
would cast me as a college teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 And so the task fell to Macy to inform Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson 
and Egan that "it's Lonnie or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did all the talking," Macy recalled. "But Dave was the muscle behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 Egan remembers the negotiation process. "I don't know this actor," Egan said 
of Smith. "I've never even met this actor. There's no way I can commit to an 
actor I have absolutely no knowledge of in a two-character play in a 750-seat 
theater for 64 performances. And the way we agreed for me to become familiar 
with this actor was a reading, where we'd read the play from beginning to end." 
</P>
<P>
 Macy was not happy about the Taper's request for a reading. "This is all over, 
guys," he remembers telling Davidson and Egan. "What you want to do is test 
him. He won't pass the test." 
</P>
<P>
 "They prejudged us," Smith felt. "It was cold in that Taper room, and I knew 
in a moment this was an audition, not a reading. Afterward, Gordon said, 'So, 
you live here now?' I said, yeah, since 1978 -- don't you remember me in your 
workshop?' I decided to use Gordon as part of my character study for the 
professor." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Taper's reading, Egan told Macy, "We can do better." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know you can," Macy responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have done better than Lonnie," Macy explains. "They could have 
gotten a better director, a better actress, a better designer. And when they 
got their best team, I could have done better than that. I could have bested 
them. If you're going to play that game, it never ends. Some directors and 
producers feel that what the process is all about is to keep auditioning until 
that perfect guy or the perfect woman walks in. It ain't gonna happen. They're 
waiting for the character to walk in so they don't have to direct." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith still believes the Taper's decision was racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Egan denies this. "Any actor who hears they're not strong enough to carry a 
stage (like the Taper's)," Egan says, "is going to have some enormous armor 
that goes up in defense of why they were not chosen. In Lonnie's case, he 
brought up the issue of race. That is so ludicrous to accuse Gordon of racist 
tendencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Macy agrees with Egan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think racism is an issue in the play," says Macy. "And I don't think 
it was an issue with the Taper." 
</P>
<P>
 But Egan disagrees with Macy's contention that "Oleanna" is not affected by 
the casting of an African American. "There's no doubt about it," Egan insists, 
"the dynamics of the play are affected when you bring the issue of race into 
it. Race is real. And if you have a young white girl lecturing a black man 
about his privileges, that becomes a real issue." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, my casting bends the play," Smith adds sarcastically. "All casting 
bends a play." 
</P>
<P>
 Macy admits he would "dearly love" to work at the Taper, Southern California's 
most visible theater. And Mamet lost money, too, including box-office royalties 
at the Taper, which will be significantly less at the tiny Tiffany. He also 
returned a $25,000 grant for the production of another play at the Taper, plus 
he sacrificed a much higher theatrical profile in Hollywood's film community. 
This last may be the most crucial since Mamet is shopping an "Oleanna" film 
script that he hopes to direct, and many studio executives use the Taper as 
their sole theater experience in Los Angeles. Macy knows that if Mamet directs 
the film version, he'll likely again portray the professor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Macy also knows Mamet's principles. "David was my first teacher and really 
my only teacher," Macy says of their first meeting in 1971 in a drama class at 
Goddard College in Vermont. "This play's professor talks about education and 
how rotten it is, and I had tons of rotten teachers, with the exception of 
Dave. He was a defining moment in my life. He truly gave me my entire 
aesthetic. I ain't proud. I'll admit it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The day I stopped being Billy's teacher," Mamet says, "it was like we were 
going out to the Klondike together." Along with another Mamet student 
(director-writer Steven Schachter), they formed the St. Nicholas Theater 
Company in 1971. Macy starred in Mamet's first successful plays, "Sexual 
Perversity in Chicago" and "American Buffalo." For more than two decades, Macy 
has remained Mamet's actor and partner in writing, directing, producing, 
teaching, and poker. Although Macy keeps an apartment in Los Angeles to 
maintain his frequent television and movie acting work, his permanent home is 
in rural Vermont, less than a 20-minute drive from Mamet's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Billy can almost read my mind," Mamet says. Mamet dedicated his 1975 play, 
"The Poet and the Rent," to Macy, adding: " . . . In the hopes he and I may 
continue to be aware of what the other is thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, when Macy first received a much longer version of "Oleanna" from 
Mamet, the production has been "pretty much all friends and family." He worked 
opposite Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon, in the world premiere. When cast 
changes had to be made, Mamet chose friends as the replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to stick in the same vein (for the L.A. production)," Macy says. 
"Lonnie's an old and dear friend, and that's why we were just convinced he's 
the guy to do it. . . . I first saw him do this wonderful production of 'Sizwe 
Banzi Is Dead' at the Goodman in Chicago in 1974. It knocked my socks off. So 
we just hung out in bars together and lied about women, and stuff like that. 
And I've known Kyra since she was still in high school, when I did a summer on 
'Another World' while she was a regular. And of course I've known (her husband) 
Kevin Bacon for years and years and years. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it's just nice to be working with folks you know," Macy concludes. "It 
makes all the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 "David's loyalty runs very deep," says Smith, who's also worked with Mamet 
intermittently for 20 years. Onstage, Smith acted in Mamet's adaptations of 
classics and appeared in the Off Broadway production of "Edmond," later 
directing a revival of Mamet's bleak satire at the Powerhouse in Santa Monica 
in 1989. On the screen, Smith acted in Mamet's films "Homicide" and "Things 
Change," and on television he appeared in the recent TNT presentation of 
Mamet's "The Water Engine," in which Macy reprised his starring role from the 
1977 premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 Christened "Mamet's Mafia" by industry insiders, other members of this 
professional clan -- the majority old cronies from the 1970s in Chicago -- 
include Joe Mantegna, J. J. Johnston, Jack Wallace, George Wendt -- all of whom 
will soon crowd the Tiffany's second theater with a production of Mamet's first 
full-length play, "Lakeboat," opening Feb. 24. That show is co-produced by 
Mamet's younger brother, Tony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gonna be like a Mamet festival here," Macy enthuses, "a hoot. It's just 
a gas to hang out with those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in this loyalty," Smith adds. "We love, trust and respect each 
other. My friend David said to Bill, 'Let Lonnie do this role.' I've been an 
actor for 36 years. I've done episodics, from 'St. Elsewhere' to 'L.A. Law'. I 
deserve a shot. My father was a heroin dealer and my mother died of alcoholism. 
I remember the police kicking my door in when I was 4, looking for my father. I 
remember hunting for the man who raped my mother, to kill him, when I was 10 or 
11. I had to think my way out of the ghetto(of the South Side of Chicago). How 
to do this? 'You're an intellectual,' David said. 'Just learn the lines and do 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 According to Macy, Smith's casting illustrates valuable lessons about the 
play's themes of power and control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black men and women in general have more in common when it comes to political 
correctness and power," Macy says, "than women and white men. They're both an 
oppressed minority. It's a white guy's world. That's the way it is. So (Smith 
and Sedgwick) have more in common than I would with Kyra, for instance. Our 
camps are separated by a wider gulf, politically. And so it's interesting that 
these two factions (white woman, black male) with so much in common perform 
this battle to the death. It makes the play maybe even a little more 
heartbreaking." 
</P>
<P>
 After all this, what does Macy expect Mamet to say about his direction of 
"Oleanna?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave will come and say . . ." Macy mimics Mamet: " 'Well, you took a shot.'

THE SHOCK OF THE NEW; ANTI-IMMIGRATION FEVER IS AT A FEVER PITCH, BUT THE REAL 
ISSUE IS THIS: WHEN WILL THE OLD (ANGLO) L.A. JOIN THE NEW (LATINO) L.A., AND

 The boots. Smooth, black brushed-leather boots. Snakeskin boots. Cheap, white 
vinyl boots. Sharp-toed boots. Tasseled boots. Hundreds of boots shuffling, 
kicking, twirling. Kick forward, twirl at the knee, kick back, twirl at the 
knee. . . fast , across the dance floor. Boots belonging to boys and girls. The 
boys in jeans and crisp white shirts, or in T-shirts with the names of their 
dance crews in graffiti-style lettering -- "La Herradura," "Vaqueros Nortenos," 
"Indias Carinosas." The girls in jeans too, or short shorts, silver nylons and 
blouses sequined and sparkling. The boys with their mustaches, lots of 
mustaches. The girls made up, some modestly, others chola -heavy. And then the 
hats, the all-important tejana , the Texas-style Stetson, preferably black, 
tugged down low over the eyes. A sea of hats across the dance floor, bobbing up 
and down, along with the shoulders, the chests, the breasts, the hips, the 
knees and the boots that kick forward, twirl at the knee, kick back, kick fast, 
kick-twirl-kick-shuffle to the beat: um-pa-bum, um-pa-bum, um-pa-bum. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Friday night at Mi Hacienda in La Puente, and I'm witnessing the 
resurgence of the American cowboy and cowgirl: the brown-skinned and black-eyed 
vaqueros y vaqueritas . The new American cowboys and cowgirls are mostly from 
Mexico and have been here only a few years. But there are Salvadoran vaqueros , 
too. And second-generation Chicana vaqueritas . Most are in their late teens 
and early 20s, dancing to the quebradita beat of Banda Toro, a brass-heavy 
Mexican outfit in matching uniforms of embroidered shirts, boots and, of 
course, black tejanas . 
</P>
<P>
 "La noche que Chicago se murio..."  
</P>
<P>
 "The night Chicago died." The melody brings back memories of the '70s: a group 
called Paper Lace hit it big with this song about gangsters in Chicago. And 
here it is in 1994, in Spanish, set to the polka-ish, tinny, fast quebradita 
sound that the vaqueros y vaqueritas live for. 
</P>
<P>
 " Arriba Michoacan! " cries out Toro's lead singer between songs, a salutation 
to the natives of that Mexican state. A cheer sounds, hats are raised. " Arriba 
Jalisco! " More cheers, more hats. " Arriba Zacatecas! " Hey, that's me! Well, 
sort of. My grandmother was born in a small town of that Mexican state. If I 
had a hat, I'd wave it. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that there is Latino pride in La Puente tonight would be an 
understatement. It's more like a cultural revolution. We're Mexican, speak 
Spanish, dance quebradita and are damn proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies the revolution. The quebradita fad began here, though it's 
roots are obviously south of the border. Historians and and ethnomusicologists 
agree this is the first instance in which a Mexican popular music -- in this 
case from 19th Century Sinaloa -- has been revived and commercialized in the 
United States, then shipped back to the Old Country. In Mexico, quebradita is 
just starting to catch on, about two years after the scene took off here. 
</P>
<P>
 To Steven Loza, a professor of ethnomusicology at UCLA, the quebradita scene 
is about establishing a sense of Latino independence -- in the North. "People 
are saying that we don't have to look like Prince or Madonna," he says. "We can 
wear our boots and hats. The vaquero style is important as a symbol. When a 
Mexican puts on that suit, just like when in the old days you put on a zoot 
suit, you can walk into that club and be proud that you're a Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which begs many questions that relate to California's most volatile and 
polarizing political topic: immigration. Why is it that Mexicans both recently 
arrived and American born are proclaiming themselves Mexican on this side of 
the border? Are Mexicans and other Latino immigrants overturning America's 
cherished rites of assimilation, proclaiming themselves an independent cultural 
Other within the United States? And why now? Is it mere coincidence that the 
quebradita craze was born roughly at the same time that politicians began 
staking out positions against the presence of immigrants -- especially the 
illegal immigrants -- in our midst? 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers think that questions of "why so much pride" and "why now" merit 
a simple answer: "It's almost like a response, a backlash, if you want to call 
it, against the anti-immigrant rhetoric," says Loza. The question of the 
creation of a non-assimilated Other is a little more complex.  
</P>
<P>
 Quebradita is but one of many signs that the city of Los Angeles is undergoing 
a radical transformation. Latino Los Angeles hovers at more than 40% of the 
population -- a plurality heading toward a majority. Historians and 
demographers refer to this percentage, which includes newcomers and several 
generations of the American-born, as a "critical mass," an agent of change. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not just a matter of numbers. The fact that Mexico and Central 
America, the immigrants' Old Countries, are just across the border is equally 
important. Latin culture, as well as people, travel across that border daily. 
Unlike other U.S. immigrants, Latinos can touch their roots with ease. And, of 
course, the city itself shares those roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latinos are not like the old European immigrants, nor like a racial minority. 
What we have is something fundamentally different," says David Hayes-Bautista, 
director of the Alta California Policy Research Center, an independent think 
tank studying Latino issues. Latinos in L.A., he adds, are their "own civil 
society, almost equivalent in size to the state of Minnesota." 
</P>
<P>
 Put it this way, then: While Gov. Pete Wilson, Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne 
Feinstein and many other pols in the state rant about the "immigration 
problem," the more pertinent issue might be this: When will they learn to dance 
the quebradita ?  
</P>
<P>
 This transformation has set the city on edge. White suburban dwellers grit 
their teeth at seeing vendors or day laborers on street corners in the San 
Fernando Valley. African Americans in South-Central L.A. watch black 
neighborhoods turn brown, and worry over competition for jobs. The fear, anger 
and frustration among non-immigrant L.A. transcends racial and class lines.  
</P>
<P>
 But transformation and its discontents work both ways. Latino culture, too, is 
being remade. Indeed, some would argue that the quebradita craze is merely a 
nostalgic yearning in a culture that will inescapably be changed now that it 
has crossed the border. Then there's the feeling on the part of most immigrants 
that they are being unfairly blamed for California's economic woes. The "new" 
L.A. -- Mexicans, and Central Americans who've arrived in the past decade, 
Chicanos who've been here for generations, working-class teens and doctoral 
candidates at Caltech, business people and domestic workers, the elite and the 
welfare recipients, legal and illegal -- is as uncertain, and fearful, about 
this transformation as the old L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 But tonight the new L.A. is not fearful or uncertain or contemplating a 
hostile reconquest of the Southwest. Tonight the new L.A. is dancing up a storm 
in La Puente, remember?  
</P>
<P>
 There is Griselda Mariscal, 20, a native of L.A. whose mother was born in 
Guadalajara and whose father hails from Tepic. She is here, with her 
ivory-toned botines (boots); her loose blue jeans held up by a braided piece of 
leather work called a cinto piteado and her panuelo (bandanna) of green, white 
and red, the colors of the Mexican flag, that announces "Nayarit," her father's 
home state. Her date, a shy vaquero , tucks his thumbs into the corners of his 
jeans pockets. His Stetson is pulled down low. Very cool. 
</P>
<P>
 " Quebradita is a way of showing you can be all into your culture," says 
Mariscal, who, when she's not out dancing, crams for midterms and finals at 
Occidental College, where she is a third-year history major. "To me, it's a way 
of holding your head up high. It says that I am in college because of the 
strength of my culture, because of the sacrifice of mis papas, mis abuelitos ." 
Mariscal grew up near Belmont High School, where, she says, "there were no 
white people." The first Anglo institution she encountered was Occidental 
College, with a student population of 1,650, of which 60% are Anglo. "I didn't 
know anything about being a Chicana until then," she says. She joined the 
militant Chicano student organization MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de 
Aztlan), and promptly declared herself Mexicana: "I hated the gringos." A trip 
to Mexico brought her disillusionment, however. "They called me a gu erita " -- 
an American-looking girl. And whenever an English word crept into her otherwise 
flawless Spanish, she'd get more grief: You don't belong here. You're from el 
otro lado , the other side of the border. "It took me a trip to Mexico to 
realize that I had something in common with the gringo." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she heard about quebradita . Now it was her Chicano friends who 
questioned her for being so retrograde: "They'd see me in my botines and ask me 
where my horse was." But she persisted. Gradually, the quebradita fever spread 
to more of her Chicano friends. Today, Mariscal doesn't see herself as a pure 
Mexicana. But she still doesn't see herself completely as an American, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Onstage, Banda Toro is tearing into a popurri of songs: suddenly, the 
um-pah-bum gives way to a rock 'n' roll backbeat and the thousand pairs of 
boots are trying out some version of the twist. We are not in Mexico, nor in 
Aztlan, the mythical Chicano nation separate from white America. But we're not 
quite in the United States, either. We're in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE 1920S, THE MARTINEZ-DEL RIO DUO WAS AMONG THE MUSICAL ACTSthat played 
L.A.'s Mexican theaters. They sang corrido tales from the Revolution and other 
dramas of the day. Juan Martinez and Margarita Del Rio were my grandparents. 
They came north, riding their generation's wave of migration, and stayed, 
settling in the Silver Lake hills along with the Russians, Irish, Asians and 
Italians of the old L.A. They loved America, even when America deported 
hundreds of thousands of their compatriots back to Mexico during the Great 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 They were spared that fate by landing a job at a popular Anglo nightclub 
Downtown, where they were paid very well for their talents. They would look at 
the poor Mexicans in East L.A. and say to themselves: "They just don't have 
what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, my grandparents never completely assimilated. They spoke enough 
English for the essentials -- to make a bank deposit, to meet and greet in 
their gigs at the nightclub. (For the tougher transactions, they relied on 
their only child, my father, who was born here and had a thorough American 
education and spoke English without an accent). But they were also as American 
as could be: Their ambition to succeed led them to close the door on their 
Mexican past. They returned only for brief visits; they became U.S. citizens; 
their home was this country. The irony, of course, is that they were only able 
to declare America their home by playing Mexican folk music to the Anglo elites 
of their day. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother, a native of El Salvador, remembers her arrival to this country in 
the late '50s. It began with a 12-hour flight on a Pan American bimotor. At 
dawn, the plane set down in San Francisco. She recalls an idyllic sight: the 
Golden Gate bridge gleaming and the waters of the bay dappled by the silver 
light bursting over the green hills of Berkeley. America. 
</P>
<P>
 America for her was freedom from the constraints of a conservative family in 
the Old Country. It was also the fulfillment of a dream that her mother had had 
in the '40s. "She used to talk about America as a place where women could wear 
pants and work," she says, the words coming out slow and thick with nostalgia. 
But when she speaks of her years of studying English, getting her first job, 
meeting her future husband, raising her children, going back to school and, 
finally, getting her license in family counseling, the voice lightens, 
quickens. It's the classic American story, but, of course, there was a price to 
be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ached inside, especially those first few years," she says. "I missed my 
family so much." It was more than family. It was a way of life, a way of seeing 
the world. It was growing up in one world, abandoning it for another and 
growing up all over again with a whole new set of values and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 My father strikes a more ambivalent note. "I can see things from both sides," 
he says. On the one hand, he's famous for referring to the recently arrived 
immigrants, just as his parents did, as chusma (rabble). But then he'll talk 
about the white survivalist types who are arming themselves to the teeth in 
anticipation of L.A.'s next riot. "Sure, I get angry when they talk about the 
Mexicans this, Mexicans that," he says. "I feel like they're the ones who would 
have looked at my parents and made fun of them for the way they spoke English." 
A visible hurt tightens the muscles of his face. 
</P>
<P>
 But my father protests when I mention his parents' lack of assimilation. "They 
never learned English well, but they spent all those years with the Americans, 
paying their bills, living in Silver Lake." He is saying that assimilation is 
as much an economic rite of passage as a cultural one. And he is, of course, 
right.  
</P>
<P>
 We were an American family, assimilated, middle class. We spoke English, 
except for my mother's terms of endearment like m'hijo (my son). And there was 
her heavy accent, which my brother, sister and I made fun of. My Mexican 
grandparents were mysterious figures from far-off lands, their voices even 
thicker with the accent of another time and place. They could only half 
understand their grandchildren. Isolated in their world, they waited for death 
while living in memory, satisfied that they'd done the right thing by ensuring 
their children and grandchildren a better life in the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 But I became the cultural revisionist in my family. I have been obsessed, for 
the better part of my adult life, with questions of cultural identity and its 
relation to the history of the city. In my 31 years, I have played the role of 
an accentless, perfectly assimilated American kid. But I've also betrayed my 
parents' and grandparents' ideals of assimilation. I have returned to the Old 
Countries; I have on occasion proclaimed myself separate from Anglo American 
culture; I've been known to warn Anglos that they just might be the ones who 
are going to get deported -- back to Europe -- when I hear them talking about 
deporting my Latin American brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 I have also dreamed of a California in which a historical wound hundreds of 
years old might be healed: a reconciliation between North and South, the 
Catholic and the Protestant, the First and Third worlds. I've come to admit 
that rock 'n' roll is as important to my spiritual well-being as la Virgen de 
Guadalupe . I will always be the outsider in Latin America. I also oftentimes 
feel like an outcast in the United States. The only place I could be at home is 
in the new -- the almost new -- Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 THE TRANSFORMATION OF L.A. IS NOT WITHOUT PRECEDENT. AFTER THE 
Mexican-American War of 1846-48, the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo 
and the U.S. annexation of the Southwest, Anglos overran Los Angeles, 
displacing the native Mexican "Californio" population. Along with WASPy 
descendants of the early Americans came more immigrants -- Chinese, Italians, 
French, Irish. Then during the Mexican Revolution that began in 1910, hundreds 
of thousands of refugees crossed the border and reasserted the Latino identity 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The years of the first Cultural Revolution here, the mid-1800s, were 
tumultuous ones. The radically different sensibilities clashed violently, but 
sometimes they melded seamlessly, too. Many of the Chinese merchants of the Old 
Plaza, near today's Olvera Street, were fluent in Spanish (as are many of 
today's Korean merchants). Some of the old rancheros intermarried with 
Italians. At the city's centennial celebration in 1881, booster speeches were 
shouted out in English, Spanish and French. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, L.A.'s primitive multicultural experiment was short-lived. 
Lynchings of Chinese and Mexicans weren't unheard of. The "Californio" 
rancheros saw their lands usurped, sometimes legally, sometimes not. By the 
late 1880s, the new dominant culture had just about wiped out L.A.'s old 
Mexican downtown. A Catholic Mexican town became yet another modern Protestant 
town of the American Southwest. Even the Latino influx during the Mexican 
Revolution couldn't tip the demographic balance away from the Anglo mainstream. 
In this century, migrants from the American South and Midwest made the biggest 
mark on L.A., until recently, when that distinction went to the foreign-born. 
(Latinos make up the vast majority of newcomers but Asians are also a 
significant percentage; from 1980 to 1990, their numbers in the city nearly 
doubled, to 10.6% of the population.) 
</P>
<P>
 All over the Southwest, pitched battles between the Anglo and Mexican 
conceptions of city life were fought after the Mexican-American War and well 
into this century. Historian William Estrada, who teaches Chicano studies at 
Cal State Northridge, notes that each city resolved the conflict in different 
ways. San Antonio, he says, "integrated its Mexican past." It is still visible 
in that town's pueblo -like buildings. In other cities, such as Albuquerque and 
San Diego, the Americans of the 19th Century were "successful in erasing 
historical memory." L.A., Estrada says, falls somewhere in between. "Downtown 
L.A. has Pershing Square and Bunker Hill, but it also still has the Old Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, when people talk about immigration problems, they are talking about 
what kind of city they want L.A. to be. Will it be a city of the North, or the 
South? Should it have vendors hawking mangoes and papayas on the sidewalk? (The 
proponents are mostly Latino and the opponents nearly all Anglo. The City 
Council has sided, narrowly, with the vendors.) Should it speak English only? 
(Whatever English-only laws remain on the books, the fact remains that L.A. is 
a city of dozens and dozens of languages. Studies have found that most Latinos 
in the U.S. are bilingual, and many, especially young Mexican-Americans, prefer 
to use Spanish.)  
</P>
<P>
 Demographers like David Hayes-Bautista don't see these culture wars as a 
win-lose proposition. For him, the Latin American concept of mestizaje , the 
mixing of European and indigenous cultures that gave rise to a third culture, 
is applicable to L.A. "The real melting pot occurred in Latin America," he 
says. "Anglo-Protestantism doesn't allow for half-breeds; Latino Catholic 
culture does. (Through immigration) we are continuing the mestizo tradition and 
fulfilling the promise of a real U.S. melting pot. We're the rest of the 
American story. What we're seeing in L.A. is the emergence of a truly American 
identity for the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 THE NEWEST OF THE NEW ANGELENOS TRY ON THE CONSONANTS AND vowels of their 
future in a classroom at Evans Community Adult School in Downtown. "Good 
morning, how are you?" says ESL teacher Sylvia Martinez, much too bouncy, loud 
and cheerful for a Monday morning at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Faahine, how are juuuu?" the class responds in unison, 40 or so voices -- men 
and women, teens to middle-aged people, Mexicans, Central Americans and a 
sprinkling of South Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The al-pha-bet," Martinez says. "The ahl-fa-beh," the class repeats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The al-pha-be ttt ." 
</P>
<P>
 "The ahl-fa-be hhttt ." 
</P>
<P>
 "A, B, C, D . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez prowls up and down between the rows of seats, tapping out a rhythm on 
the floor with a long wooden pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you from?" Martinez asks, enunciating every syllable, making a show 
of tongue, lips and teeth.  
</P>
<P>
 "Where ahhre juuuu frohhm?" Loose vowels, soft consonants.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ireland," Martinez says. "Irish," says the chorus. "Peru." "Peruvian." 
"Vietnam." "Vietnamese." "El Salvador." "Salvadoran," they say, noticeably 
louder. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask Yolanda Franco, who, in her 30s, is one of the older women in the 
classroom, what English sounds like to her. " Fabuloso! " she says, with all 
the immigrant hope in the world showing through her smile. English is her 
ticket to success. She's come north alone; a daughter waits in Mexico for her 
to gain a toehold here so that they can be reunited. Right now, Franco works as 
a housekeeper. But it's only a matter of time, she says. Just some more 
consonants, pronouns and practice stand between her and a better life.  
</P>
<P>
 Franco may be embracing transformation, but English and the American Way 
aren't all that fabuloso for Yesica Remedios, 18. She was born here, but she 
moved to Guadalajara at the age of 2 and only six months ago came north for the 
first time. "I have to learn English," she says, because most of the texts in 
children's psychology, her career choice, are in English. "But I don't like it 
here," she insists. "There's more freedom in Mexico. You can go out at night, 
stroll through the plazas without giving it a second thought. But here! The 
gangs! Este no es mi pais. (This is not my country.)"  
</P>
<P>
 What does the future hold for the students at Evans, most of whom have been in 
the United States for less than a year? Will Franco continue to believe life is 
fabuloso ? Will Remedios be seduced by America? 
</P>
<P>
 To find some answers, I visit the South Gate Women's Clinic, where a dozen or 
so Latinas who have gathered at random speak of their hopes and fears. They sit 
before me, many wearing sweat shirts and tennis shoes, the uniform of the 
Latina working class. Not one wears makeup, and most have deep, dark circles 
under their eyes. These are the women who sew in garment factories, clean up 
office buildings late at night, sell fruit or trinkets on the street. Most have 
been here several years and have done their time in crowded classrooms learning 
basic English. And many of them have begun to wonder whether they made the 
right decision in coming north. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you're here, you become something different," says Norma, in her 20s and 
a native of Michoacan (all the women gave their first names only, since most 
are undocumented). "The family changes. The children don't have the same 
respect for their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Nods of agreement around the table. "You have to work and leave them alone all 
day," says Rosario, who is Guatemalan. "It's the way of life in this country. 
I've never seen gang members in my homeland." 
</P>
<P>
 You can't discipline your children here, the mothers complain. "Here, the 
parents fear the children." Who knows, with all those laws on the books here, 
maybe a spanking could constitute child abuse, they say. But, Rosario insists, 
people aren't going to go back home. "No matter how bad off we are here, it's 
worse in one's own country." 
</P>
<P>
 Others aren't so sure. Hermila, from Guadalajara, is thinking of saving up 
some more money and then heading home. She talks about being looked at funny 
because she's brown, short and poor, about all the factories where bosses have 
tried to have their way with her. "I'll work a little longer and get out of 
here. Wilson can do whatever he wants," she says. More nodding of heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The mention of Gov. Wilson's name draws the most passion from the group. "Pete 
Wilson is a jerk," Rosario pronounces to much laughter. "We come here to work!" 
says Idelisa, another Guadalajara native, protesting Wilson's portrayal of some 
immigrants as welfare sponges. "Wilson thinks he can solve the problems, but 
he's just going to create more," says Rosario. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her talk of going home, Hermila acknowledges, "You can at least eat 
here. You can still get ahead. Querer es poder ." (It's a popular saying in 
Mexico, and it sounds like it comes straight out of a California motivational 
seminar: "If you want it, you can get it.") 
</P>
<P>
 And so the conversation goes, back and forth. Half the time, it's we've had 
it, we're leaving. But inevitably the dream is resurrected: We're going to make 
it here. It's a well-known Latino trait: to be terco , stubborn, to stake one's 
pride on doing what others say can't be done, especially when the odds are 
stacked against you. 
</P>
<P>
 THE OLD AND THE NEW SEEM TO FACE OFF DAILY IN L.A. THE ANGLOS SAY that 
bilingual education is bad; Latinos take pride in retaining their Spanish. The 
Anglos say that immigrants should assimilate; Latinos retaliate with quebradita 
. The Anglos say the immigrants are a drain on the economy; the undocumented 
immigrants start marching on City Hall. The gulf widens. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is this more apparent than on college campuses, where Latino students 
are now more militant than at any other time since the Chicano movement of the 
late '60s and early '70s. That generation started out with an ultranationalist, 
separatist philosophy, but most of the activists eventually wound up working 
within the (white) Establishment. Many of today's young Chicanos look upon the 
old activists as sellouts, even the region's most progressive Latino pols, up 
to and including County Supervisor Gloria Molina. For the new generation, 
activism and Aztlan, the mythical Chicano land of milk and honey, separate from 
white America, are viable again.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, there isn't just one "movement." There are several. Where 
Latino students of the '60s were mostly Mexican American and identified with 
MEChA, today there are also LASA (Latin American Students Assn.) and ALAS 
(Association of Latin American Students) for foreign-born Latinos who don't 
identify themselves as Chicano, and making an even narrower distinction, CASA 
(Central American Student Assn.).  
</P>
<P>
 I sit in on a CASA meeting at Occidental College in the Coons Boardroom, a 
corporate-style meeting hall for campus organizations. Lining the walls are 
portraits of gray-haired white men, the college's founders. In the swivel 
chairs sit the future powerbrokers of the city, brown-skinned children of 
Guatemalans, Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Panamanians -- wearing backward baseball 
caps, checkered flannel shirts, Doc Martens. The look is part grunge, part 
hip-hop, part university wiz-kid square. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been plenty of controversy surrounding CASA. "When we formed (last 
September), there were a lot of criticisms," says CASA president Melvin Canas, 
a 21-year-old premed student majoring in sociology. "People were saying, 
'You're going to divide the community, make a weaker front.' But the reason we 
formed was to learn our culture, not to fight Chicanos for political power on 
campus. It was to not lose our identity." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of gringos think that we're Mexicans," says William Vela, a 21-year-old 
Guatemalan psych major. "CASA formed to let the community know that there are 
other Latinos as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Such divergence -- on many fronts -- is apparent throughout L.A.'s Latino 
community. The issue of immigration itself, especially illegal immigration, 
divides many Latinos. A Los Angeles Times Poll last September showed that 75% 
of California Latinos view illegal immigration as either a major or moderate 
problem, and 43% have the same response to legal immigration. Two-thirds said 
charging a toll at the border to increase surveillance was a good idea. (Whites 
agreed on all counts, only more so -- 92%, 43% and 75%, respectively.) 
</P>
<P>
 But for the vanguard of the new L.A. -- activists like the students at 
Occidental and their counterparts at campuses across Southern California -- 
what divides the Latino community is not nearly as important as what unites it. 
When it comes to the hottest of the hot-button immigration issues, Latinos 
close ranks. More than 60% reject Gov. Wilson's proposals to deny citzenship to 
children born of undocumented parents and to cut off illegal immigrants' health 
and education services. And despite evidence of Latino hostility toward illegal 
immigration, 60% believe that any crackdown on illegal immigration will lead to 
increased discrimination.  
</P>
<P>
 There are other issues that unite the new L.A. as well, issues that CASA, ALAS 
and LASA might call the "real" immigrant problem. The economy, for instance. 
The new L.A. may be most successful at redefining cultural assimilation, but as 
my father pointed out, any assimilation is about decent wages and jobs. Once, 
immigrant pushcart vendors could open up a store; factory workers were union 
members with health benefits, pension plans and middle-class wages. Now, most 
of these economic routes upward are closed, and not only to immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Latino per capita income is only about 45% of the city 
average; nearly a quarter of Latino families live in poverty. The problem is 
that the jobs Latinos hold are concentrated in low-wage service and non-union 
manufacturing sectors. "In the past, people could enter the middle class much 
quicker," says Rodolfo Acuna, a professor of Chicano studies at Cal State 
Northridge. "You were socialized by your work place, and could afford to move 
out and were assimilated. There's been an elimination of those steppingstone 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Another troubling issue is voting. Mexican political scientist Jorge G. 
Castaneda and others warn of an "electoral apartheid" in California because its 
Latino immigrant population -- a majority of which is legal -- has yet to flex 
much political muscle. This is attributed to its disproportionately young 
median age, the fact that many legal residents are not yet citizens and, 
finally, because many are not registered to vote. "In effect, a small, 
privileged minority is determining the fate of a largely poor, non-voting 
majority," writes Castaneda in "The California-Mexico Connection," a collection 
of essays published last year.  
</P>
<P>
 It must be, then, the broadest possible interpretation of mestizaje , not 
separatism, that the new L.A. will need to assert in the face of such 
challenges. Castaneda says that one solution is for the white electorate to 
exercise enlightened self-interest and join with voting Latinos to increase, 
rather than decrease, social services to immigrants. The newcomers, after all, 
are the future of the city and the state. 
</P>
<P>
 For every separatist slogan, then, there is countervailing evidence of 
mestizaje . In the boardroom at Occidental, the CASA students might complain 
about the "white man," but they conduct their meetings in English. And who 
should show up here -- because, she says, she thinks she has things in common 
with her brothers and sisters from throughout Latin America -- but 
Mexicana-Chicana-Americana- vaquerita Griselda Mariscal. 
</P>
<P>
 I AM SURROUNDED BY THE OLD L.A. -- PASADENA, ACTUALLY, OLD PASADEna, monied 
Pasadena. The front yard of the house I've been invited to speak at is, 
literally, a 100-yard golf course. The Chardonnay sparkles in the smoggy 
afternoon sunlight. It is a fund-raiser for an exclusive artists' colony in 
Northern California where I had been in residence. I am to speak on -- what 
else? -- L.A.'s new immigrant culture. Here we go again.  
</P>
<P>
 I sip some Chardonnay and debate silently what tack I'll take this time. 
Should I try the sensitive multicultural routine, disarming them by listening 
sympathetically and replying to the inevitable fear in measured tones? Should I 
become the cultural guerrilla, threatening a violent takeover if demands of 
social and economic equal opportunity aren't met? Or how about the 
Jesus-at-the-temple variation, throwing each and every bottle of Chardonnay 
through the mansion's beautiful wood-framed windows? 
</P>
<P>
 I pick the California Idealist approach. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a plaque at Olvera Street, I tell them, that lists the names of the 
44 pobladores who arrived here in 1781 and founded the city of El Pueblo de la 
Reina de Los Angeles Sobre el Rio de Porciuncula. Do they know what the ethnic 
makeup of that group was? The majority were black or mulatto. The next-largest 
group was mestizo . There were Indians from Mexico. And there were a couple of 
Spaniards. Los Angeles, I say, has always held out the promise of 
multiculturalism. 
</P>
<P>
 I get polite applause at the end of the talk, and a few liberals -- the kind 
who assume I lived a nightmarish childhood in the barrio and made it out 
against the odds -- ask sympathetic questions. But later, as I'm making my way 
back to the appetizers, I am cornered by an agitated group, the conservatives 
who were afraid to voice their un-PC opinions before the larger crowd. They 
hurl questions at me: Isn't bilingual education failing to educate Latino 
children? Don't you think that there should be more birth control in your 
community? Don't you understand that the economy just can't handle any more 
immigrants? Doesn't the United States have a right to regulate its borders? 
</P>
<P>
 I try to maintain my composure. And then a tall, white-haired man in white 
slacks and snappy summer shirt tells me: "You're just trying to make yourself 
out to be a victim so I'll feel guilty. But I'm not guilty of anything. Your 
problems are not my responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrilla in me explodes. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't remember what I said. But what I should have said is this: In a sense, 
we're all victims of this crazy time we live in. We are reaping the fruit of 
hundreds of years of a great and violent history. A history of American 
optimism and greed. A history of Latin American solidarity and victimization. 
Racism, and, yes, reverse racism. I would like to meet you as an equal, on the 
border. Right smack between our two worlds; right here, in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 You must accept that the Latinos of California aren't going anywhere, I should 
have told him. We have always been here and we are here to stay. You must stop 
thinking and acting with the arrogance of a culture that sees itself as the 
arbiter of life in the city: your culture will become less and less dominant. 
</P>
<P>
 And I must accept that you aren't going anywhere, either. That your culture 
runs through my veins, that the immigrant that crosses the border leaves behind 
one world to enter a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 You must allow yourself to be transformed, even as we are being and have been 
transformed. It is a process that is at the heart of America's democratic 
identity. Resisting this change is to resist history itself -- and the 
consequences could be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 TRIQUI-TRIQUI . IT MEANS "trick or treat." It is Halloween, and I am on Sunset 
Boulevard in Echo Park. The sidewalks are choked with hundreds of costumed 
children and their parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents. Nearly all are 
Mexican and Central American. 
</P>
<P>
 I stand in front of a panaderia whose storefront windows display not only all 
the typical sugary breads, but also blow-up pumpkins, cobwebs and huge black 
widow spiders dangling over the kids' heads. Triqui-triqui . 
</P>
<P>
 A slightly tipsy father with a blurry pirate's mustache penciled on his upper 
lip trains his videocam on the scene. "Isn't it great?" he says. "It's so 
beautiful, Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
 At the counter, Marisela de la Rosa, who's been here only two years from 
Mexico City, smiles at a 5-year-old ninja warrior and drops candy into his 
plastic pumpkin basket. "But it's not like back home," she says wistfully, 
recalling el Dia de los Muertos , the Day of the Dead, which is celebrated in 
Mexico on Nov. 1 and 2. The holiday isn't a Mexican Halloween, it's a mestizo 
blend of pre-Columbian and Catholic rituals. "We go to the cemetery with 
flowers and offerings to the dead, their favorite food and drink. All the 
family gathers together and we clean off the grave. We prepare moles and 
ponches ." Halloween, she says, is more about "just having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 And fun is what people are having tonight. A sea of costumes on Sunset: 
Superman, Wonder Woman, ninjas, Ninja Turtles, little devils with red capes and 
pitchforks, gypsies, little angels with golden wings and magic wands. Looks 
like the battle between Halloween and the Day of the Dead is over and done. 
Triqui-triqui . 
</P>
<P>
 But this is L.A. I stop by a Mexican restaurant on Sunset Boulevard in Echo 
Park and watch a parade of kids walk up to Candelaria Reyes, who with her 
folkloric waitress outfit, her plumpness and her sweet demeanor reminds me of 
every Latino grandmother I've ever met. "Yes, Halloween is fun," she says, 
dropping candies in the succession of bags and buckets the kids hold up to her, 
acknowledging every one of them with a " m'hijito " or " m'hijita ." But, 
Candelaria says, that doesn't mean we have to lose our traditions. "In my 
house, we celebrate the Day of the Dead and Halloween. We have our nacimiento 
at Christmas. We go to church all Easter Week. We celebrate Mexican 
Independence. And the Fourth of July. We have to respect this country's 
traditions, too, become good citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 The wisdom of a grandmother, I think to myself. After 35 years in this 
country, Candelaria Reyes has brokered a treaty between the factions that have 
been at war ever since the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in 1848.  
</P>
<P>
 When I walk back out onto Sunset Boulevard, I see the scene with different 
eyes. I watch families, the big Latino families participating in a ritual as 
American as Jason and "Friday the 13th," but with the communal spirit of a 
Sunday gathering in a small-town plaza south of the border. It is Halloween and 
Day of the Dead all at once. It is the new Los Angeles.

GOING TO EXTREMES; "IF YOU FALL, YOU DIE"--THAT'S ONE WAY TO DEFINE EXTREME

 PAUL RUFF SCOOPED UP A HANDFUL OF SNOW, PACKED IT INTO A BALL AND overhanded 
it into the abyss below Lake Tahoe's Thimble Peak. Five long seconds passed, 
then came a reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "More to the left!" called a faint voice. 
</P>
<P>
 It was March 29, 1993, and Ruff was perched on a narrow ledge above Thunder 
Bowl -- a natural amphitheater capped by 9,000-foot peaks on the backside of 
Kirkwood Ski Resort. Still tied to the rope he'd used to belay himself from 
above, the 29-year-old extreme skier leaned out and strained to catch sight of 
his friend, Joe Gebhardt, standing far below. It was no use: The rope, secured 
by one of two Kirkwood Ski Patrol members who'd gone with him to the site, was 
just too short. 
</P>
<P>
 When he'd looked up at this piece of mountainside two weeks before, Ruff had 
thought it looked perfect. He told his friends it would make for close to 200 
feet of "monster air" -- easily the biggest cliff jump anyone had ever 
attempted -- with a clear shot from top to bottom. But now, after climbing to 
the summit, roping himself in and sidestepping down 150 feet, he discovered he 
couldn't safely get close enough to the edge to see past the jagged rocks and 
snowy chutes that angled out below him to open snow.  
</P>
<P>
 He knelt down, scrunched up another snowball and, with a lurch, fastballed it 
over the edge. "That's better, man," yelled Gebhardt, after watching the second 
snowball explode, like the first, on a patch of protruding rocks above him. 
"But you gotta chuck it farther out!" Ruff let another one fly, then another. 
</P>
<P>
 Gebhardt had watched Ruff jump many times before -- he'd even followed him 
over a cliff or two -- but those leaps were nothing compared to this. Cliff 
jumpers typically took off from obvious overhangs or sheer cliffs, but Gebhardt 
could see nothing obvious about this steep, rocky face. A jumper falling nearly 
20 stories would hit 70 miles an hour. His skis might act as wings, pushing him 
out of his aerodynamic tuck. Even if he could keep himself upright, he would 
still need plenty of momentum to clear the rocks, which extended 30 feet beyond 
the takeoff point. And he needed a clear line of vision from launch to landing: 
Basic cliff jumping technique called for him to be able to focus on the 
touchdown virtually before he took off. 
</P>
<P>
 But as each snowball came flying down the mountainside -- one crashing on the 
rocks, another on snow and another on rock again -- it became frighteningly 
clear, to Gebhardt at least, that accurately predicting this jump's trajectory 
would be impossible. His stomach muscles tightened and his hands began to 
sweat. He had never intended to direct the jump; he was here only because Ruff 
had asked him to help coordinate its filming. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruff had it all planned out. To record the jump, he'd recruited seven 
photographers, including Gary Nate, a veteran cameraman for ski-film producer 
Warren Miller, and Robbie Huntoon, an experienced cliff jumper in his own 
right, who ran a small local production company. Nate, Huntoon and the other 
cameramen would spread out around the massive bowl, staking positions up to a 
quarter-mile away. They would get close-ups and wide-angle shots with still 
cameras, on film and videotape, and once the jump was nailed, they would shoot 
Ruff chugging soda and wolfing down candy bars. The filming was all on spec, 
but Ruff had a lot riding on the outcome. He had told his fiancee, Kim Wiebe, 
that this would be his last big jump; he hoped to market the footage to 
ski-filmmakers and advertisers for more than half a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 As the photographers skied into place, Gebhardt wasn't the only one who was 
shocked by the size, scale and layout of the jump. Standing above the cliff in 
his bright magenta and violet ski suit, Ruff appeared in the photographers' 
viewfinders as a tiny pinpoint of color on a marbled background of white snow 
and black rock. "It couldn't have looked more extreme," Nate said later. "It 
was like watching Evel Knievel jumping the Grand Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 It had snowed six inches the night before, and though the morning dawned 
crystal blue, the weather was rapidly deteriorating. Broken clouds flew 
overhead at airplane speed, casting huge shadows across the bowl. Cold gusts 
whipped against the cliffs, causing the fresh snow to slip like sand through 
the cracks in the rocks. More than one of the group prayed that Ruff would call 
off the jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a bad scene, Joe," one of the photo assistants scowled to Gebhardt. 
"I don't want to be here, man." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no one called Ruff back. In the unwritten protocol of cliff jumping, 
once the skier is in position the decision to go is his alone. To warn him off, 
or even suggest a negative outcome, would violate one of the cardinal rules of 
the sport: Don't psych out the skier. It could break his concentration, and 
should he get hurt, everyone would know who to blame. "If I rattle him and he 
dies, then I'm responsible," Nate thought to himself. "If I say nothing, then 
I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Ruff was already famous for pushing the limits, and he had always 
landed safely before. He was cocky and confident, but no one thought he was 
stupid. Ruff was proud of his ability to case out a jump, evaluating the 
launch, figuring his trajectory, visualizing the landing -- even when he was 
using snowballs rather than his own eyes. "Whether it's 20, 30, 60 or 110 
feet," he boasted to the camera after a 110-footer in Warren Miller's 1990 film 
"Extreme Winter," "everything is calculated to perfection -- the takeoff, the 
air time, the landing, the run-out -- so that we can go off with a calculated 
confidence that there's no way we'll get hurt." Then, putting on a half-serious 
Clint Eastwood stare as the camera pulled in, he said, "Cuz dying's not much of 
a livin', boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Ruff sidestepped back up the mountain, calling across the bowl to Huntoon, 
asking for more advice. Huntoon yelled back: "You need to go higher," figuring 
that Ruff would need all the speed he could muster to clear the rocks. Ruff 
moved back another 10 steps, but Huntoon yelled for him to go higher still. 
Ruff took two more steps, then dug himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did he hear you?" asked Ruff's roommate, Jim Mathews, who was standing by 
Huntoon's side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," said Huntoon. "But he sees something totally different than I 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 A hundred yards away, Nate was standing with Ruff's brother, Frank, who had 
skied over to the cameraman's position to watch. "Isn't there anything we can 
do to stop this?" Nate whispered. Frank shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 At a little after 11 a.m., the sun poked through the clouds scudding over 
Thimble Peak and Ruff gave the signal, pointed his tips downhill and skied for 
the drop-off. But just before he reached the edge, he turned suddenly to his 
right -- perhaps a line readjustment, maybe a too-late premonition -- then shot 
into space. By the time he was halfway down, he was moving so fast that the 
photographers watching through their viewfinders had lost sight of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Their cameras, however, caught the sequence. One, equipped with a motor drive 
that could reel off four photos per second, captured 16 frames from the edge of 
the cliff to the bottom. In the first five, Ruff was in fine form -- a loose, 
cannonball tuck. But by the sixth, he began to lose it. He waved his arms in 
wide swoops, trying to keep himself in balance. Two frames later, he was 
falling back-first. In the 12th shot, he slammed into the rocky outcropping and 
bounced 30 feet in the air, his skis exploding off his heels and his limbs 
flailing. His momentum carried him down the hill, where he landed on his back, 
sliding head-first another 100 feet.  
</P>
<P>
 Forty-five minutes later, Ruff was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 MOUNTAINEERING PURISTS WOULD BRISTLE AT CALLING PAUL RUFF AN EX-skier. He was 
a stuntman, the alpinists would argue, a ski-model, more interested in mugging 
for the camera than practicing the art of extreme skiing. Likening him to the 
sport's French originators, whose death-defying technical descents of 50- and 
60-degree inclines stretched skiing to its physical limits, would be like 
equating a bungee-jumper with a mountain climber. 
</P>
<P>
 The term, the purists would say, should be reserved for skiers like France's 
Sylvain Saudan, Patrick Vallencant, Jean-Marc Boivin and Bruno Gouvy, many of 
whom had cut their teeth in the early '60s logging les premieres, first 
ascents, of the 15,000-foot peaks that surround Chamonix. But by the late 
1960s, with thousands of climbers looking to make their mark in the Alps, the 
remaining premieres made a short list. The only way to go, it seemed, was down. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudan, dubbed "Le Skieur de l'Impossible," made a series of les premieres 
descentes on sheer faces others had only climbed before. Getting to them 
required technical mountaineering skills and the level of difficulty was almost 
unfathomable. The descents, twice as steep as the most challenging 
double-diamond trails at today's resorts, followed super-steep chutes known as 
couloirs, sometimes no wider than a king-size bed, that plummeted thousands of 
feet. A slip would almost certainly send the skier sliding out of control to 
the bottom, where monstrous cliffs and 1,000-foot crevasses threatened. The 
sport's definition was as simple as it was morose: Si tu tombes, tu meurs -- 
"If you fall, you die." 
</P>
<P>
 Until his final jump, Paul Ruff had never pushed the limits that far. He was 
no mountaineer but a skier, first and last. And yet he had more in common with 
the French extremists than his purist critics might care to admit. For one, all 
but Saudan are dead. And all of them were tempted by a force perhaps greater 
than gravity itself -- fame. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Vallencant. He pushed the definition of extreme further than Saudan and 
reaped the rewards with sponsorships, his own clothing line and the need to 
keep pushing. He fell to his death in 1989 during a training climb. Next was 
Boivin, who added parachutes and hang gliders to radical skiing descents. His 
end, in 1990, came far from the ski slopes, though. During a 3,000-foot 
parachute jump from the top of Venezuela's Angel Falls, filmed for a French 
television adventure series, he smashed into a rock outcropping and bled to 
death before rescuers could reach him. Gouvy, who reportedly had dressed 
himself in a Marlboro-logo'd jump suit, fell 3,000 feet into a crevasse during 
an extreme snowboard descent on Chamonix's Aiguille Verte in 1990. (Saudan, now 
nearly 60, still trades on his past exploits -- with a heli-ski business, a 
Chamonix restaurant and other interests that market his reputation.) 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the commonalities, the essence of American-style extreme skiing is as 
different from the European original as Bartles & Jaymes is from Chateau Lafite 
Rothschild. The first distinction is setting. The Alps are filled with 
unrelenting steeps that are close to villages and ski areas. But most of 
America's accessible terrain is comparatively benign -- the mountains aren't as 
tall, the steeps not nearly so long. 
</P>
<P>
 And while in the '70s extreme and highly technical descents seemed a natural 
outgrowth of Europe's classic mountaineering tradition, the Zeitgeist in Ski 
Country U.S.A. at that time was embodied in the flashy, downright kooky 
discipline known as hot-dogging. When the French started polishing their 
reputations, the mainstream American ski heroes were guys like Wayne Wong and 
John Clendennan. Specialists in contorted aerials, back flips and helicopter 
jumps, they were acrobats, not mountaineers. And though their routines were 
demanding, they were far from life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1983, a young Squaw Valley skier named Scot Schmidt climbed to the top 
of the resort's 70-foot-high Palisades cornice and jumped off. Though he wasn't 
the first to pull the stunt, he was the first to have it featured in a Warren 
Miller film, "Ski Country." Its wide exposure marked a defining moment in 
extreme skiing's American evolution. Suddenly, a long jump off a high place, 
preferably recorded on film, seemed to really define the word extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hot-dogging, this was pure spectacle, stunts made for Hollywood and 
Madison Avenue. Over the next decade, cliff jumps became a mainstay of American 
ski movies, photography and advertising. Naturally, the bigger the jump, the 
greater the fame. By the '90s, a new Zeitgeist had taken hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tahoe ski resorts were the perfect place for this spirit to blossom. 
Situated on some of the steepest mountains in the Northern Sierra, they are 
pummeled by fierce winter storms that roll in off the Pacific packing 
100-mile-an-hour winds and carrying up to six feet of moisture-laden "Sierra 
Cement" in a single shot. Far above the lake, mountainsides mutate into 
monstrous cornices hundreds of feet high -- excellent for jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 The area boasts the nation's only 24-hour ski town -- South Lake Tahoe. From 
virtually anywhere on the nearby mountains, you can easily spot the South Shore 
casinos, jutting up into the horizon like a small slice of Manhattan skyline. 
With their flashing marquees welcoming everyone from Jerry Garcia to Wayne 
Newton and advertising bawdy late-night reviews, cheap buffets and 
million-dollar slot payoffs, the casinos are at the center of a town that owes 
its existence to fast living and risk taking. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not surprising, then, that in 1985, Paul Ruff joined the mass of 
immigrant ski bums who land in South Lake Tahoe every year. Ruff was a 
bartender, a born ham and a skiing maniac. He had been jumping off snow-covered 
bumps in the Northeast since he was 7 -- the wildest, craziest speed demon at 
New Hampshire's small King Ridge skiing area, one of the countless boys hooked 
on adrenaline, delighted by danger. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his teen-age buddies penned a school paper about Ruff's exploits. "I 
like jumping with my friend Paul," reads the 1977 essay. "One time, Paul went 
over this huge jump. He must have gone 40 feet. . . . I'm surprised he's alive 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 FOR A TIME, IN THE WINTER OF 1989-90, on billboards along the highways that 
lead skiers out of the coastal California cities, across the Central Valley and 
up into the High Sierra, Paul Ruff's blond good looks, his fireplug thighs and 
his flashy skiing form seemed to be everywhere. He was the Heavenly Valley 
poster boy, exploding through a field of powder, larger than life, an 
armchair-skier's fantasy and a marketer's dream. It was Ruff's dream, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh of eight children in a religious Catholic family, Ruff grew up in 
Reading, Mass., one of Boston's northern suburbs. When he graduated from high 
school (he was a Reading High tight end and the captain of the wrestling team), 
he moved to Atlantic City, where his older brother was bartending. Ruff 
followed his lead and learned the trade. During the winter, he fit in skiing 
day trips to Hunter Mountain in New York. But the five-hour drives and the 
mediocre conditions eventually found Ruff itching for something better. When a 
former girlfriend invited him to Park City, Utah, he packed his gear and drove 
west. Utah, however, with its strict liquor laws, was no place to make a living 
as a bartender, and after a few weeks, Ruff decided to move on to Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a job at the Cornice Cafe in Kirkwood and later tended bar at the 
Cantina Los Tres Hombres there. The same outgoing personality that had him 
leading his high school friends, lemming-like, over ski jumps at King Ridge 
earned him a following among the local pub crawlers. He'd do Pee-wee Herman's 
"Tequila" dance on the bar and perform a hilarious karaoke version of "I'm Too 
Sexy." Just about the only thing he took seriously was his skiing. He'd decided 
to try to break into ski-modeling, and he knew he had to be an expert on the 
slopes. But with his high-school-jock, go-for-broke style, he was quickly 
humbled by locals who could ski circles around him. 
</P>
<P>
 While trying out for a job on Kirkwood Ski Resort's squad of ski instructors, 
Ruff got noticed by two of the resort's staffers, Michael Allen and John 
Wagnon. "He was very young and very fired up," remembers Allen, Kirkwood's race 
director and another extreme skier. Allen and Wagnon skied with the kid from 
Boston, showed him the local ropes and helped him polish his bravado into 
skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed up against the Pacific Crest, Kirkwood, with its many cornices, is a 
favorite haunt of extreme skiers from around the lake. Jumping usually landed 
skiers in trouble at Eastern resorts, but at Kirkwood, where there are plenty 
of good jumps in bounds, the atmosphere seemed to encourage it. This was, after 
all, home turf for gonzo skiers like Mohawk-haired Glen Plake, whose outrageous 
coif and radical stunts had won him fame and lucrative gear endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruff improved quickly, and when it came time to shoot photos for Kirkwood's 
new brochure, Wagnon asked him to pose. That led to other modeling jobs for ski 
magazines and promotional appearances at the annual fall ski shows. Still, the 
big time meant getting a role in a Warren Miller ski film. Trouble was, 
breaking in was akin to being discovered by Hollywood. There were literally 
hundreds of young skiers willing to do whatever it might take to catch the 
filmmaker's eye. Undaunted, Ruff bartered beers for videotape and persuaded two 
local videographers to follow him around for a day as he bounced through the 
moguls and jumped off his favorite cornices. He synced the video to James Brown 
singing "I feel good" and sent a copy to Miller's production company. 
</P>
<P>
 To everyone's surprise, the gambit paid off. A month later, Miller sent Ruff a 
plane ticket to ski in a film he was shooting in Canada. Shortly after he 
arrived, however, bad weather shut down the filming. While the crew waited for 
blue skies and sunshine, Ruff skied, and one day, heading toward a chairlift, 
he took a freak fall and tore a ligament in his right knee. He returned home 
without appearing in a single Warren Miller shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really bummed out," remembers Allen, "but Paul wasn't the type to stay 
down for long." 
</P>
<P>
 After reconstructive surgery and a summer of aggressive rehab water-skiing on 
Lake Tahoe, Ruff was back on the slopes, and when the Miller camera crew came 
to Kirkwood in February, 1989, he was ready. On the fourth day of shooting, he 
watched as another local skier, John Tremann, made a 105-foot jump off the top 
of a huge cliff. Not to be outdone, Ruff launched himself from the same spot 
moments later. He landed in a puff of powder -- 110 feet from the takeoff -- 
and skied away in delight. His friends dubbed it Ruff's Revenge, and the jump 
ensured him a feature role in Miller's fall release "Extreme Winter." Miller 
captioned it a world record. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the season of the billboards, and Ruff became the toast of South Lake 
Tahoe. Posters of his jumps filled the walls of restaurants all over town, and 
sponsorships began to trickle in. He was invited to appear at the big ski shows 
and everyone started calling him Captain Kirkwood. Though the money was still 
pretty meager -- he had to stay on at Los Tres Hombres -- it seemed that the 
Miller feature had given him the break he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 But King of the Hill is a game of one-upmanship, and Ruff's reign was short. 
Two seasons later, while recovering from another ski injury -- this time to his 
other knee -- Ruff learned that Tremann had broken his record. On a 
mountainside close to nearby Donner Summit, he had bagged a 140-footer, 
outdistancing Ruff by 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruff hated to lose; he wouldn't allow even his closest friends to keep pace. 
Just weeks after his second knee surgery, he was on his mountain bike -- knee 
brace and all -- pedaling up a Tahoe mountain trying desperately to stay ahead 
of Wiebe, whom he'd met at Kirkwood's Cornice Cafe where she waited tables. The 
thought that a girl might beat him, says Wiebe now, irked Ruff no end. 
</P>
<P>
 After silently persevering to the top of the hill, Ruff unfastened the brace 
to find blood dripping from the surgical incision.  
</P>
<P>
 "Are you OK?" Wiebe asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," he replied with a tense smile. "It doesn't hurt at all." 
</P>
<P>
 He was still on crutches when he began to plot his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN THE GROUP GATHERED AT Kirkwood on March 28, Ruff seemed as confident as 
ever. He had borrowed a condo right at the mountain so that the photographers 
and the others who would be in attendance at the next day's jump could get the 
earliest possible start. After cooking up a batch of pasta and passing beers 
around, Ruff spread out a topographical map on the dinner table and handed out 
photos he'd taken of the cliff. "This is the spot right here," he said, 
pointing to a section of the map where the topo lines ran together like fine 
wood grain around a knot. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been looking for the right jump for months -- it had to be accessible, 
long and, of course, doable. He'd pumped other skiers for information on jump 
areas up and down the West Coast. He had also looked around in his own back 
yard, poking around near Donner Summit, where Tremann found his record-setter, 
before friends told him about the spot in the Kirkwood outback. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, Ruff psyched himself up for the jump by watching the video of 
Tremann's 140-foot effort. Tremann had barely landed the big jump, struggling 
with the forces of wind resistance and gravity. His skis whisked out from 
beneath him as his lower torso sought the fastest way to the bottom. (Luckily, 
he touched down safely in six feet of powder.) Ruff was determined not to make 
the same mistakes; he wanted to land cleanly and ski away. He stared intently 
at the video as he explained how he would hold himself in a tuck to compensate 
for the oncoming wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, nailing the jump was just the first part of his plan. The second, 
and perhaps most important, part was marketing it. For all his modeling and 
stunt-skiing success, Ruff was lucky if he saw more than a few thousand dollars 
in residuals annually. And with all those other wanna-bes waiting in the wings, 
there wasn't much chance of gaining any leverage with filmmakers or 
advertisers. This stunt, however, would be his baby from start to finish. In 
contrast to the negligible modeling fee he got for appearing in Miller's films, 
Ruff worked out a 50-50 split with his team of photographers. He alone would 
sell the rights to advertisers and ski-filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Gebhardt was going up the mountain with him specifically to help shoot 
some of the post-jump hype. He would bring along Power Bars and Mountain Dew, 
for example, for the star to consume just after the big event. Another plan was 
to shoot footage for a Disney World commercial. Ruff would land the jump and 
ski to a stop. "Hey Paul Ruff! What are you going to do next?" a voice would 
ask. "I'm going to Disney World!" he'd grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Mountain Dew or Disney World had bought into this -- Ruff had no 
contracts or even vague promises from any sponsors. He had, however, talked it 
all over with a talent agent who told him that if he played his cards right, he 
might walk away with as much as half a million dollars. His friends were 
skeptical of such pie-in-the-sky figures, but Ruff tuned out their negative 
talk.  
</P>
<P>
 Ruff knew it had to happen now : His days as Captain Kirkwood were coming to 
an end. After all, he had celebrated his 29th birthday in February; a few 
months earlier he had asked Wiebe to marry him. While he expected to continue 
his ski-modeling career, he'd seen the worried look on Wiebe's face when he 
talked about a new record, and it had already caused friction between them. 
"Don't give me any negative thoughts," he'd tell her. With all the money this 
jump would bring in -- money that could set them up and pay off his Jeep, his 
overdue credit cards and doctor bills -- he promised he would hang up the 
record-setting stuff for good. 
</P>
<P>
 The season's end was fast approaching and the huge dumps of February had 
already yielded to the March sunshine and, sometimes, rain. Ruff set one date 
for the jump, but bad weather caused him to call it off. Then a few days later, 
it was back on, and this time, he got Miller's cameraman Gary Nate to sign on. 
Nate just happened to be at Tahoe; Ruff spent one evening cajoling him into 
adding the attempt to his shoot schedule. Once Ruff had settled on the Kirkwood 
site, his roommate Jim Mathews said, he was "like a runaway train." 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE DAY OF THE JUMP, KIM Wiebe was working her regular morning shift at the 
Cornice Cafe, trying to keep busy while she waited for her fiance. "I'll be in 
for a martini," Ruff had told her the night before. She didn't want him to jump 
-- she had always been clear about that -- but she didn't consider him reckless 
and she couldn't help but be proud of him: "I thought it was pretty neat," she 
would admit later, "He was going to push through and do it despite the 
obstacles." 
</P>
<P>
 By 11 a.m., when there was no sign of him, she thought, "No news is good 
news." But then the phone started ringing, and people at the lodge started 
rushing around. 
</P>
<P>
 When the helicopter landed outside the base lodge, Wiebe figured the outlook 
was either really good or really bad. If he had been injured, she thought, the 
helicopter would be on its way to the hospital. When the helicopter doors swung 
open and paramedics, not Ruff, stepped out, she almost fainted. 
</P>
<P>
 What Wiebe didn't know was that, for a while, back on the mountainside, the 
news had been good. When Joe Gebhardt got to Ruff's still form right after the 
fall, Ruff was unconscious but still breathing. Gebhardt ripped open Ruff's 
suit to check his heartbeat. Miraculously, there wasn't a scratch on him. And 
after a few minutes, Ruff awoke with a start and tried to get up. Worried that 
Ruff might injure himself further, Gebhardt, Huntoon and the two ski patrol 
members who had rushed to his side held him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you?" Gebhardt asked him, checking to see if Ruff was in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kirkwood!" 
</P>
<P>
 "What's your name?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul! Let me get up! I'm OK!" 
</P>
<P>
 His friends moved him to a flat spot they'd carved out in the snow. The 
helicopter was called on the ski patrol's walkie-talkies, and Frank, high on 
the ridge above the bowl, tried to console his brother over the airwaves. "Hang 
in there buddy, you're going to be OK." But the color began to drain from his 
face and the group watched in horror as his ears turned a deep purple. His 
aorta torn and bleeding internally, Ruff came to only because his body had been 
pointing downhill. Now he lost consciousness for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank got back to the base lodge as quickly as he could. He and Wiebe huddled 
together, crying uncontrollably, as the technicians wheeled Ruff's body into 
the resort's emergency clinic.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a nurse asked Wiebe if she wanted to be alone with Ruff for a few 
minutes. The woman led her into a doctor's office and closed the door. Ruff's 
body was lying on the examining table. Wiebe walked over to him, put her hand 
on his shoulder and stood in silence. She thought about how he had told her to 
be strong like him and she remembered how he had always said he was made out of 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey there, Man of Steel," she would say. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's twisted blue steel," he'd grin as he flexed his biceps. 
</P>
<P>
 ON A BRILLIANT SUNDAY MORNING last April, Robbie Huntoon set up a trampoline 
in the back yard of his Tahoe cabin. He began to bounce, and with each landing, 
he sailed higher and higher -- three, five, seven feet. At the apex of each 
jump, a wispy tuft of auburn hair levitated momentarily above his forehead, his 
eyebrows arched, his toes pointed straight down and his mouth opened in a 
boyish half-smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel so free," he said after a half-dozen bounces. "I feel better in 
the air than I do on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 After a few more leaps, Huntoon got the height he wanted, and flung his feet 
above him. Upside-down, he fell toward the mat. But just before he landed on 
his head, he tucked his chin into his chest, curled his body around and hit 
safely on his butt. "That's the most important move in ski jumping," he said. 
"If I go too far forward, I can always just bail out with that move and land 
safely. We used to call it the suicide stall, because as the jumper almost hits 
his head, he quickly tucks his chin down to his chest and spins forward. If 
Paul had planned to land that way he might still be alive, maybe hurt, but at 
least alive." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an old argument between Huntoon and Ruff. Huntoon favored landing as 
square on his skis as possible, which kept his weight forward and allowed for 
the alternative of the suicide stall. Ruff, with two bad knees, believed in the 
hip-check landing -- where you land with your weight a little back, roll onto 
your hips and let more of your torso take the force. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was only one of Ruff's fatal mistakes that Huntoon played over and 
over again in his head. Almost everything had been wrong, he thought now: The 
cliff wasn't sheer enough, the landing was too flat, the snow was too heavy and 
Ruff had broken the rule of always knowing where the landing was, from the top, 
before you jump. 
</P>
<P>
 At 36, Huntoon is one of the oldest of Tahoe's extreme skiers, but his 
receding hairline and sun-weathered face hardly give away his age. His yard is 
strewn with boy-toys -- motocross cycles, mountain bikes, the trampoline -- and 
his house, with its '70s-vintage hot-dogging posters and old skis cluttering 
every corner, remains the skier's crash pad it's been for a decade or more. 
Friends say he's mellowed over the years, but Huntoon still takes 60-foot-plus 
leaps with the best of them, and he was back on the snow within a week after 
Ruff's accident, scouting big air during a trip to Mammoth Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Ruff's death had shaken him up. At the memorial service, he could 
barely bring himself to look at the open casket. And when Ruff's father, trying 
to make sense of his son's death, asked Huntoon why people jumped, the skier 
didn't know quite how to respond. What was there to say? Why do people climb 
mountains? Why do they race cars? How could he explain the rush of confidence 
he felt after facing his fears and overcoming them. It was more than just a 
power trip, more than the adrenaline rush. It was a whole way of living, a way 
of squeezing all he could from life, of experiencing it to the fullest. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntoon, too, had a girlfriend to think of, and parents who worried about him. 
Of course their concerns mattered to him. But other people's worries had never 
stopped him from doing something he knew he could pull off. Besides, he told 
himself, Ruff had made those serious mistakes. He'd let outside pressures push 
him over the edge. But Huntoon knew better. His body might not be as nimble as 
it once was, but his mind was razor sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 After the doctor at the clinic officially pronounced Ruff dead, Huntoon had to 
hike back to the bowl to retrieve some photo equipment he'd left on the hill. 
It was a long slog through the melting snow, but after all the hysteria back at 
the clinic, the silence of the backcountry was a welcome relief. When he 
finally reached the bowl, he felt a ghostly calm come over him. He could see 
Ruff's tracks leading down from the summit, then nothing. From below, the jump 
looked amazingly doable, a clean, straight shot. This must have been how Ruff 
first scoped it out, he thought. "I could go up there and do that," Huntoon 
said to himself. "I could do it for Paul."

COMMENTARY; WHY THE 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' BACKLASH?; CHARGES THAT THE HOLOCAUST 
HAS BEEN 'SPIELBERGIZED' MAY CONCEAL THE DEEPER BELIEF THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE 
DRAMATIZED AT ALL 
</P>

<P>
 "Schindler's List" has won the best picture award from all three major film 
critics' societies, so it's not surprising a backlash should set in. Highly 
acclaimed movies usually inspire counterinsurgencies, and sometimes the back 
talk is even justified: Critics groups, along with the Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences, have a way of favoring the safe and respectable over 
the innovative and the disreputable. But the "Schindler's List" backlash is 
somewhat unique for appearing to be less a corrective to the overpraise than a 
cry of betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing to argue that "Schindler's List" is something less than a 
masterpiece. I would concur in that. As powerful as it is, it's a bit too 
buffed and noble, it doesn't have the clarifying transcendence of great art. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outrage goes deeper. What the naysayers are saying is that Steven 
Spielberg has, in the words of the Village Voice's Jim Hoberman, 
"Spielbergized" the Holocaust. He's made "a feel-good entertainment about the 
ultimate feel-bad experience of the 20th Century." Hoberman -- who at least has 
the distinction, along with the New Republic's Leon Wieseltier, of writing the 
film's best knock -- also writes: "The poster of a father grasping a child's 
hand is not the only aspect of 'Schindler's List' that recalls 'E.T.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Rich, in the New York Times, refers to the scene where Oskar Schindler 
"gives a sentimental speech to the Jewish factory workers he saved, and they 
look up at him awe-struck, as if he were the levitating mother ship in 'Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind.' " (Wieseltier's piece is titled "Close 
Encounters of the Nazi Kind.") Excepting Ben Kingsley's Jewish accountant, Rich 
describes the other Jewish characters as "generic" -- "as forgettable as the 
chorus in a touring company of 'Fiddler on the Roof' or, for that matter, the 
human dino-fodder of 'Jurassic Park.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One would like to put these critics to the test: If it could be rigged to show 
that an unremarked young American or British director had made "Schindler's 
List," would the references to the mother ship in "Close Encounters" or "E.T." 
spring so readily to mind? One of the real-life Schindler survivors said of 
Schindler, "He was our everything, our mother, our father, our savior," and her 
remark is representative. This closing moment in the movie is appropriately 
full of awe because so were the Jews in the presence of the man who finally 
saved them. 
</P>
<P>
 Can anybody look at this film and seriously assume Spielberg invested the same 
emotional energy in characterizing its Jewish protagonists as he did in 
knocking over the screamers in "Jurassic Park"? Rich wishes that the Schindler 
Jews were as "individually and intimately dramatized as Anne Frank or even 
Meryl Streep's "Sophie," but, of course, Anne Frank is symbolic if any human 
being ever were, and, as long as we're overcorrecting, Sophie the Auschwitz 
survivor was Gentile, not Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 This "generic" rap against the Jews in "Schindler's List" doesn't allow for 
its many piercing moments of human loss. How can it be said that the Jewish 
maid of the mad Nazi Amon Goeth is just a generic blur? Her hair-trigger terror 
around Goeth, her shuddering self-will, is entirely specific to her 
predicament. When the Jewish servant boy of Goeth is at first "pardoned" for 
failing to remove a bathtub ring and then, almost as an afterthought, shot in 
the back, the moment is casually horrific. Like so much in the film, the death 
belongs to the individual but it has a collective horror. There's no way to 
dramatize the Holocaust without invoking this collectivity; each death assumes 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind these criticisms may lie the deeper conviction that the Holocaust 
should not be dramatized at all -- by anybody; that however one does so is a 
disservice, an obscenity. This is not a new concept. Jonathan Kirsch, in his 
pan of "Schindler's List" in the Jewish Journal, quotes Theodor Adorno: "After 
Auschwitz, to write a poem is barbaric." That may be so, but isn't it also 
essential? And can one rule out dramatizations of the Holocaust as somehow 
beyond the grasp of art without also ruling out all dramatizations of life's 
horrors? Is "Schindler's List" any less defensible than, say, "Gettysburg"? 
</P>
<P>
 Kirsch compares the scene in the film where a trainload of women are 
mistakenly routed to Auschwitz to "The Perils of Pauline." Fearing they will be 
gassed, the women are shaved and herded into the showers. But they are not 
gassed. Hoberman calls the sequence, with its "thriller suspense and 
last-minute rescue," the film's "nadir." So now Spielberg's narrative gifts -- 
the same gifts that brought him to the preeminent position to make a Holocaust 
movie, in black-and-white, in Hollywood -- are being held against him. (Charles 
Dickens employed suspense and last-minute rescues for emotional effect too. Why 
the double standard?)  
</P>
<P>
 The sequence in question actually happened -- it's there in the Thomas 
Keneally book from which it's adapted -- but its expansion in the movie is 
denounced as a way of giving aid and comfort to the enemy. "Why," asks Kirsch, 
"did (Spielberg) play out an elaborate scene in which the fundamental premise 
of the Holocaust deniers -- no gas chambers actually existed -- is played out 
in vivid and explicit detail?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Spielberg doesn't deny their existence. As Kirsch himself notes, in the 
next scene we see the ashes from a crematory wafting into the night sky. Is 
there anyone who can watch this shower scene -- which expresses the redemptive 
miracle these women experienced as "Schindler Jews" -- in the context of the 
entire movie and believe Auschwitz was anything but a charnel house? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Holocaust-deniers could. But why frame your movie to refute them 
when logic plays no part in their thinking anyway? "Schindler's List" may deal 
with a monumental insanity but it should not be faulted for speaking to the 
sane. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg comes out of a popular tradition of movie making that binds 
audiences with shared emotions -- whether it be uplift or terror. There have 
been great renderings of the Holocaust -- ranging from from the documentaries 
"Night and Fog" and "Shoah" to Primo Levi's "Survival in Auschwitz" and Art 
Spiegelman's "Maus" -- that were not pitched for the mass audience. Spielberg, 
however, at his best, is a popular entertainer with a gift -- a genius -- for 
moving audiences simply and directly. (At his worst he's a nerveless 
enchanter.) There is nothing esoteric or ruminative about "Schindler's List." 
Like Keneally's extraordinary book, the film works up its power by an 
inexorable accumulation of events that adds up to a complete vision of hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg's popularized technique in this film is there to make us see more of 
that vision, not less. And he doesn't popularize indiscriminately. We are never 
made to understand why Oskar Schindler, the Nazi war profiteer, risked his life 
to save more than 1,200 Jews; there is no defining Aha! moment that accounts 
for his heroism. It's a mystery, and Spielberg, like Keneally, honors that 
mystery by refusing to "explain" it. He also doesn't try to "explain" Amon 
Goeth, for to do so would be to "explain" the vicious riddle of Nazism -- a 
riddle far greater than Schindler's. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing of the film in the Jewish daily newspaper the Forward, Ilene 
Rosenzweig says, "Given a chance to project to the world an image of Jewish 
life, Hollywood's undisputed box-of fice king chooses one of humiliation and 
death." In a commentary on the film in The Times, Rabbi Eli Hecht wrote, "I am 
sick and tired of this generation identifying Judaism with suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, it is bad PR to express the sufferings of the Jewish people; 
better to forget. This is a dreamland concoction far more dangerous and denying 
than anything Spielberg is accused of. (And, in this age of ethnic cleansing, 
it also implies the lessons of the Holocaust only apply to Jews.) As one Times 
reader wrote in response to the rabbi's piece, "Does Rabbi Hecht propose that, 
as Jews, we let Passover and Purim rest along with the Holocaust?" 
</P>
<P>
 Should "Never Again" become "Never Mind"? 
</P>
<P>
 It's also considered bad PR for a movie about the Holocaust to feature a 
non-Jew. "Unafraid to accentuate the positive," writes Hoberman, " 'Schindler's 
List' necessarily focuses on Gentiles." Rosenzweig writes, "A reluctant 
Christian rescuer is a curious choice for Hollywood's definitive Holocaust 
hero." 
</P>
<P>
 This is an argument based on the needs of propaganda, not drama. Schindler 
saved over 1,200 Jewish lives, and the survivors' offspring account for many 
thousands more; he was honored as a Righteous Gentile in Jerusalem's Yad Vashem 
Holocaust Museum. The concept of the Righteous Gentile in Rabbinic literature 
predates Maimonides -- it needs no defense now. 
</P>

 Rosenzweig sums up "Schindler's List" as a "feel good movie of Christian 
redemption and Jewish defeat." But this assumes that Schindler's fate and the 
fate of the Jews were not entwined; that their redemption was not mutual. Is it 
blasphemous to suggest that one can feel happiness at the end of a Holocaust 
movie if, in the end, thousands of Jews are saved? Their rescue does not deny 
the fate of the 6 million who were not rescued. Quite the contrary: 
"Schindler's List" derives its power precisely from how abjectly exceptional 
its story is. The most damning criticism made against the film is that it 
gussies up the Holocaust by framing it as a scenario of salvation. But lives 
were saved. They, too, deserve -- even require -- memorialization.

GETTING OVER IT; HOW DOES A STRAIGHT GUY GET BEYOND HOMOPHOBIA? A GAY FOOTBALL 
PLAYER GIVES HIM SOME ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SILVERMAN, Jeff Silverman last wrote about golfer Fred Couples for this 
magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am an American, New York born, male by construction and heterosexual by 
design. At 43, I have some history behind me. My behavior is relatively 
consistent. My patterns have been set. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vietnam was raging, I returned my draft card and stood vigil at the 
Pentagon. I've marched for civil rights and women's rights, protested the Gulf 
War and the first Rodney King verdicts. I refuse to cross a picket line. I've 
never missed an election, never voted Republican, and when I go to the polls to 
choose a president I always wear a tie out of respect for the office. I worry 
about whales and guns and ozone holes and movie violence. I hate artificial 
turf and the designated hitter. I even recycle.  
</P>
<P>
 I believe, unshakably, in the words of Thomas Jefferson: All men are created 
equal. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, I continue to carry a particular prejudice like a hump. It doesn't 
feel right -- in your heart, what prejudice does? -- but it's been part of me 
for so long, I tend to ignore it. I can't ignore it anymore.  
</P>
<P>
 Half a lifetime or so ago, I was living in Washington, D.C., valiantly trying, 
Monday through Friday, to become an adult. I would atone on weekends by 
dropping into various watering holes. I was particularly fond of a joint in the 
shadow of the Capitol dome called the Hawk 'n' Dove, an apt enough name for a 
place in which I lost an early skirmish in a war I wasn't even aware back then 
I was waging. The front, nearly two decades later, is the same: the internal 
battleground on which straight men like myself must eventually assess and 
confront our history of intolerance -- sometimes benign, sometimes not -- 
toward homosexuals.  
</P>
<P>
 I've begun to see the light at the end of my tunnel, though. Going eyeball to 
eyeball with myself, my prejudice has finally blinked.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hawk, back in the late '70s, catered to a Carter-era clientele of 
Congressfolk and their staffers, journalists, bureaucrats, and anyone else -- 
male, female, young, old, black, white -- who could carry on a decent 
conversation and remain vertical through post-midnight rounds of peppermint 
schnapps.There, late one afternoon during football season, I slipped into the 
verbal passing lanes of an aficionado who was making the hidden complexities of 
the gridiron as understandable as the pregame coin toss.  
</P>
<P>
 He looked like an athlete, this guy: chiseled face, bulky and broad across the 
beam, tall and thick-legged. He had a quick laugh, loud and full, and seemed to 
know everyone who walked into the bar, or at least they all seemed to know him. 
He introduced himself as Dave, but I didn't catch his last name. He'd obviously 
played the game; some high school, maybe college, I assumed, like I had.  
</P>
<P>
 In bits and pieces, stops and starts, our conversation continued over the next 
few weekends in the semi-anonymous way these things do at saloons. Then I saw 
his picture in a bookstore window, and everything, from my perspective, 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave knew football, all right. He had captained his University of Washington 
team in the 1964 Rose Bowl, then gone on to a solid career as an NFL running 
back with the San Francisco 49ers, Washington Redskins, Green Bay Packers and 
others for more than a decade. But that wasn't all the yardage his book 
covered. Dave Kopay had become the first professional jock to publicly proclaim 
his homosexuality; through his book, he was coming out of two very 
claustrophobic and secret places: the locker room and the closet. (Kopay 
remains one of very few professional football, baseball or basketball players 
to have done so.) 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1976, the world I knew, the world of straight men, didn't know how to 
accept that yet. Now, more than a quarter-century after the riot at the 
Stonewall Inn in New York's Greenwich Village that marked the birth of the 
modern gay rights movement, it still doesn't. Our prejudice remains ingrained, 
its roots as tangled as a houseplant's in a too-small pot. The law can force us 
to act fairly, but it can't force us to think or feel that way.  
</P>
<P>
 Men like myself may speak of tolerance and equality and even support gay 
rights vocally from a distance, but that doesn't mean that in our hearts we 
live by our words. The gap between voice and action forms the black hole of 
bigotry, and, once sucked in, these places take work, real work, to escape 
from.  
</P>
<P>
 I never again spoke to Kopay at the Hawk. My decision didn't grow out of 
routine intolerance or dark seeds of hate. It stemmed from ignorance and its 
distant cousin, confusion. I was having trouble making sense of the image and 
information I was trying to process. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopay was certainly not the first gay man I'd ever met; he was, however, the 
first to cut so violently against the stereotype I had learned and held onto. 
So I denied him rather than confront something that made me feel oddly 
uncomfortable. (What if he found me attractive? What if he didn't?) I had 
beaten racial prejudice into submission, but this was different. Become friends 
with a queer? Get outta here!  
</P>
<P>
 But then, I grew up in an America where men were men, and if you couldn't 
catch a pass, drill a fastball or can a jumper from the top of the key, we 
called you a faggot. (If there was a faggot who could, we never heard of him, 
which is what has made the Kopays of the world so threatening to our definition 
of masculinity; he could catch a pass and relate to another man intimately.) 
Weep openly, and we called you a 'mo. Listen to opera, write poetry, display 
emotion, seek companionship more tender than the swagger of fraternal bonding, 
touch another man anywhere but on the butt during a ballgame -- fill in the 
cliche -- and hormonally raging young heterosexuals (even if we, too, listened 
to opera -- Maria Callas is currently wailing "Norma" from my stereo) 
psychologically abused you, branded you a pansy, turned their backs and erased 
you from existence. 
</P>
<P>
 What I couldn't understand then was that bigotry tells us more about the hater 
than the hated. We all have dark closets of fear and prejudice and confusion 
that need airing. The gay world has found a key to unlock its closet; the door 
to the straight world might be better served by dynamite. We can open our door, 
peek out timidly into the world and go blithely about our business as we always 
have, or we can blow the damned thing off completely and take our chances.  
</P>
<P>
 We'll remain prisoners of our sex until we do. 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE SUBURBAN, MIDDLE-CLASS, WHITE-BREAD (RYE WAS THE ACTUAL loaf of choice 
in my Long Island neighborhood) world where I grew up, sex and sexuality were 
limited to the bedroom, not paraded through the streets. Homosexuality existed 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural osmosis taught us that to be homosexual was to be silly, dirty, 
perverted and weird. It was shameful and sinful. It was a mental illness, 
classified as such by the American Psychiatric Assn. as late as 1973. It was 
something you could go to jail for. Hell, it was something to go to hell for. 
</P>
<P>
 So, among all the things that we didn't want to grow up to be, gay, from the 
get-go, was down in the basement, hidden in the crawl space with Nazi, Commie, 
Klansman and ax murderer. Tolerate it? Accept it?  
</P>
<P>
 Every image associated with it was negative, and every story built around it 
had a horrible second act. When I was maybe 8 or 9, the man who came to the 
house once a month to wax the floors -- he was warm, affectionate, loving and 
as unthreatening a human being as could be -- was arrested on a morals charge 
for soliciting an undercover cop in a men's room. My parents refused to let him 
near the house again, fearing, they told me years later, that I would be 
corrupted. Not long after they'd planted that seed, at the outset of my 
puberty, I had a nightmare about John violating me. I ran from my bed to the 
bathroom to wash myself off. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, I learned that a college professor, the older son of two of my 
parents' friends, was gay. Such a tragedy, said my parents. Not so much that 
Danny was, to use the Yiddish, a faygeleh, but the way his folks reacted: They 
cut off communication, then mourned him in the Jewish custom of sitting on a 
bench for a week as if he had died. When I posed the hypothetical question of 
what my parents would have done had it been me, my mother quickly responded 
that that couldn't happen, and then, just as quickly, changed the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, my senior year, I experienced the horrible second act directly for the 
first time; a colleague on the school paper hanged himself. He was a nice guy, 
funny and clever, but we wondered about him; he was artistic, effeminate, hated 
sports and had a knack for inserting Oscar Wilde quotations into his 
editorials. For a day or two after his suicide, we talked about him, with 
hushed tones of bewilderment, not any real understanding. But it was the week 
before graduation, we had other things on our minds, and none of us wanted to 
admit the truth: We could have been more decent to him, befriended him, 
listened to him. The lingering regret is that he'd never tried to talk to us. 
The harsh reality is that we couldn't let him.  
</P>
<P>
 In a culture that clings to the notion of "We're No. 1," being No. 1 means 
nothing without a No. 2 to hold sway over, and strutting, virulent masculinity 
was clearly the ideal. Defining ourselves as the best, the strongest, the 
smartest, the bravest and the most manly required defining someone else as less 
than that. Thus homosexuality became a target, the antithesis that gave shape 
and boundary to what we were, and what we were was not that. And we were 
relieved.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, in my most secret moments, I wondered about the mechanics of how "they" 
did it. I wondered about where the attraction lay. I wondered why, in the 
locker rooms I frequented, I would find myself admiring the grace and strength 
of another man's body. And I wondered why I was wondering, praying that next 
month's Playmate would still have the zip to charge my erotic fantasies.  
</P>
<P>
 But knowing I was straight was not enough. What if I changed? What if 
homosexuality crept up and strangled me as I got older? What if I were 
recruited into The Life? What if I wound up on the end of a noose? Men build 
walls around themselves to keep from being penetrated in every meaning of the 
word.  
</P>
<P>
 The real problem was that there was nothing out there in the world to dispel 
that. The closet was closed. The images still held. 
</P>
<P>
 And continued to. For an abnormal psychology class my sophomore year at Union 
College, then still an all-men's enclave in Upstate New York, I wrote an 
analysis of a case study in our textbook on a middle-aged gay man. "Nobody 
loves an old homosexual," commented the professor in the margins, the exact 
words that he'd penned on a similar study my best friend had turned in the year 
before. "He should know," my friend and I smirked when we discovered the 
coincidence.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, we both liked this professor a great deal and decided to take him to 
lunch before we both transferred to a just co-ed Vassar. Yes, he told us, he 
was gay, and, in his mid-50s, he was tired of keeping the secret any longer; 
not being himself, he said, was just too damned hard a job. 
</P>
<P>
 His honesty plucked a chord within us, and my friend and I talked a lot over 
the next months -- at Vassar, at that time, it was hard not to -- about what 
masculinity means. The women around us were challenging and changing us, taking 
some of the starch out of our shorts, so to speak. They actively encouraged us 
to acknowledge that there were feminine aspects to our character and to go out 
and explore them. To survive in this changing environment, we men learned we 
simply had to talk to one another, comfort and console one another, support one 
another, even put our arms -- both in solace and in joy -- around one another.  
</P>
<P>
 I met openly gay contemporaries for the first time, and through simple 
proximity, friendship developed, and through friendship, prejudice and 
ignorance began to fade. Suddenly, the group that was not me miraculously 
condensed into individuals not altogether unlike me, but still not enough like 
me to send out to sea the last undercurrents of superiority my heterosexuality 
engendered. The '60s had turned into 1970, and the colors of the human rainbow 
were no longer so difficult to celebrate or respect -- respect being one of 
bigotry's more powerful antidotes. 
</P>
<P>
 I was so busy celebrating my own freedom, I forgot what intolerance felt like. 
And then. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after college, two years back into the Real World, Esquire ran a 
story on the men of Vassar. The piece centered on a small, flamboyant group of 
gay students that entered as freshmen my final year. I laughed when I read the 
piece; it captured the outrageousness of these guys whom I had so liked for 
daring to be different and open and defiantly proud. But I was also trying to 
make my way up the lower rungs of journalism, and virtually everyone I met over 
the next year or two, from colleagues to potential employers, had read that 
story.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the piece, the question I was most asked about Vassar was whether I 
scored a lot. (About 10 points a game for the basketball team, was my standard 
reply.) After the piece appeared, everyone just assumed that I was gay. I never 
quite understood the logic, but logic doesn't necessarily hold when someone's 
initial enthusiasm over meeting you turns into a cold silence. I lost more than 
one potential job in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 So that's what it's like to be the object of bigotry. I didn't like it. But at 
24, I wasn't confident enough to keep beating it back within myself. On this 
front, at least, it was easier to dunk my head in the water, swim with the 
prevailing tide, and keep homosexuality at arm's length. And so, when I met 
Dave Kopay, I had no trouble letting my prejudices drift me farther out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the last few years, I found myself sinking. Living and working in 
Hollywood, living and working beside gay men, has made it harder and harder to 
keep the old stereotypes afloat and harder not to care about the people I was 
meeting, and liking, regardless of whom they slept with.  
</P>
<P>
 It's also hard not to care about people dying. The grace and courage and 
loyalty exhibited by the gay community in the face of AIDS has revealed 
compassion in me I wasn't willing to admit I had. In 1969, Life magazine 
displayed the name and photograph of every soldier wasted in one particular 
week in Vietnam; it brought the madness of the war home in stunningly human 
detail. So, too, has the constant litany of the dead and dying, from the famous 
Rock Hudsons to the anonymous neighbors I've only nodded to in passing, that 
fills the obituaries in the trade papers and news magazines.  
</P>
<P>
 And then there have been the public performances and pronouncements of the two 
men for whom the gay community should pray daily for good health and long life 
(and maybe a hot time in eternity): Pat Buchanan and Jesse Helms. To see two 
public faces so twisted with anger and fear, to hear their words so filled with 
hate, does wonders to the well-intentioned. We see how close to Helms and 
Buchanan we can be and how far from them we want to be. Then we reassess who we 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buchanans and Helmses talk about homosexuality as a threat -- to the 
family, to the moral fiber of the nation, to our children, to our communities, 
to our health and to our souls. There is a threat, a powerful threat, but not 
the one they're implying. It's a threat that nips at my masculinity every time 
I meet a gay man who has wrestled his demons, emerged from his closet and 
actually seems at peace with himself. The truth is, nothing so threatens a 
human being who's afraid of exiting his own closet, whatever that closet may 
be, as seeing another man set himself free. And if that man seems proud, happy, 
content, loved and loving, the threat is even greater. 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding that, I could understand how the prejudice that had buoyed me 
for so long was weighing me down. But there was still one particular place I 
needed to go to confront it. 
</P>
<P>
 I had to find Dave Kopay. 
</P>
<P>
 I'M NOT SURE WHY I WANTed to find Dave Kopay. I'm not seeking forgiveness for 
the past. Still, finding him might close my incomplete circle. When I arrive at 
his apartment in West Hollywood -- he had suggested I come by to watch a Monday 
night football game -- the door is open and he is hunched over the phone. He 
motions me to come in and sit down. The game is already on.  
</P>
<P>
 He's talking to the father of a friend in Washington state who is in the last 
throes of AIDS, and he's trying to figure out when he can get back for a final 
visit. There have been too many final visits of late. He excuses himself as he 
hangs up and exits the room to compose himself. Underneath the violent sounds 
of televised football, I hear the quiet sound of a man unabashedly weeping at 
the imminence of human loss.  
</P>
<P>
 When Kopay re-enters, he asks if I've experienced an AIDS death of someone 
close to me. I tell him not really. He says I am lucky, then we talk about the 
old days at the Hawk. "I don't think your behavior was unusual at the time," he 
says with no sadness or anger. At 51, there is a peace in his eyes that comes 
from self-knowledge and the struggle to attain it. "It takes time. It takes 
time." There were other slights, he says, but he didn't pay that much 
attention. "I was so caught up with what I was doing and how full I felt that 
the bulls- - - didn't much matter. I knew that it was all going to be better."  
</P>
<P>
 Many straight men, then and now, saw his coming out as a betrayal, and we are 
both intrigued by that, and what it reveals. "It fractured what they believed 
me to be," he explains, laughing at the contradiction. "How could this guy who 
was nicknamed Psyche (for his intensity) by his coaches be a wimp? How did this 
queer play football?" Others offered sympathy. "I want to puke when I hear that 
word. What do I need sympathy for? For what I am? No."  
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few hours, our conversation skips from the game that is on in 
the background to his battle -- well-documented in his eponymous autobiography 
-- to accept himself, to his frustrations at being denied coaching jobs, to the 
support he's received from old teammates, to the fulfillment he feels when 
other men thank him for being the role model he never sought to be. Kopay, who 
works in the family business, Linoleum City, a flooring company in Hollywood, 
admits he still chuckles to himself when a straight male art director or 
interior designer comes in for supplies; the stereotypes die hard on either 
side of the line. We smile at that.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, I realize, what our conversation is about is simply two men -- no 
adjective before the noun -- talking about the myriad possibilities we contain 
and the frustrations and fears that prevent us from reaching them. "I really 
believe," he insists, "that most people do not fall 100% in either scale of 
sexuality, male or female. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accepting who you are, what you are, where you are, and the responsibility 
for who you are," he says assuredly, contentedly, "that's the only thing that 
defines manhood. We haven't even scratched the surface of defining 
masculinity." Then he says something so obvious that we overlook it every day: 
"Love doesn't have a gender." 
</P>
<P>
 No, it doesn't. Love is so damned hard to find in this world that who among us 
has the right to deny it to anyone else wherever it can be found?  
</P>
<P>
 So, this, then, is how it commences, face to face, the work to beat back 
bigotry, with the simplest and most universal observation of all. The circle, 
closed, begins again. Which is what this is, a beginning. As Kopay said, it 
takes time, and at this time in my life, I'm willing to give it all the time it 
needs. It's certainly not a great accomplishment on my part. But the door has 
opened. And that's a start.

POP MUSIC CHARTS: COUNT 'EM IN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More alternative rock albums are making the Top 10 these days. The latest to 
swoop in is Counting Crows' "August and Everything After," which debuted at No. 
6 on The Times' Southern California chart -- a notch ahead of Smashing 
Pumpkins' "Siamese Dream." Ace of Base just missed having two singles in the 
pop Top 10. Its new "Sign" is No. 8, while long-running "All That She Wants" is 
No. 11. Speaking of long-running hits, if you can believe it, Tag Team's 
"Whoomp! There It Is" -- a hot single last summer -- is still selling: No. 16

RANDALL HANDS CHAVEZ FIRST LOSS IN 91 FIGHTS; BOXING: TENNESSEAN WINS A 
12-ROUND SPLIT DECISION TO GAIN THE WORLD BOXING COUNCIL SUPER-LIGHTWEIGHT 
TITLE. DEDUCTIONS FOR LOW BLOWS PROVE CRUCIAL. 
</P>

<P>
 It was, more than anything else, decisive. No quirky judges' scoring logic. No 
bizarre moments of intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 First Julio Cesar Chavez went down to the canvas, victim of a perfect right 
cross by unheralded Frankie Randall, then he went down in defeat for the first 
time in his long career. 
</P>
<P>
 In a split-decision that rocked the fight world, Randall, the No. 1 
challenger, defeated Chavez and took his World Boxing Council super-lightweight 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 One judge, from Mexico, scored it 114-113 for Chavez. Another, from Puerto 
Rico, had it 114-113, and a third, from Las Vegas, had it 116-111, both for 
Randall of Morristown, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight turned on a momentous 11th round, one that will change Chavez's 
career forever. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Chavez was penalized a point for the second time by referee Richard 
Steele for a low blow. Then, with about 45 seconds to go in the round, Randall 
caught Chavez flush with a sharp right hand, dropping him instantly. Chavez got 
up at the count of three, but the fight was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The two points that were deducted from Chavez would have given him a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez's longtime promoter Don King attempted to console the fighter 
immediately after the decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not this time," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . you, King!" Chavez shouted at King before leaving the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never hurt me," Chavez said. "How could he win the fight? I'm very upset 
with Richard Steele. The knockdown surprised me, but you can't judge a fight by 
one fall. I want a mandatory rematch. I'm going to take Richard Steele and 
argue this to the (boxing) commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez (89-1-1), merely outclassed by Pernell Whitaker five months ago, was 
shockingly out-punched and out-worked by Randall (49-2-1) before a stunned 
crowd of about 11,000 at the MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can win a decision, that's what I have to believe," Randall said before the 
fight. "If I'm the better man, I'll win." 
</P>
<P>
 Randall looked sharp in the early going, answering every Chavez attack with 
quick combinations to the head. Chavez scored with a couple of hard left hooks 
to the body in the first, but in the second and third, Randall seemed to 
frustrate him the same way Pernell Whitaker did last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall is listed as having only a one-inch reach advantage, but through three 
rounds, appeared to get the best of every outside exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the early rounds, Chavez seemed to take control of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth round was vintage Chavez. He absorbed several shots as he worked 
inside, then delivered powerful hooks to Randall's body. A double-hook 
combination, first to the head and then to the body, rocked Randall in the 
middle of the round. 
</P>
<P>
 By the sixth round, Chavez was teeing off on the retreating Randall, and the 
challenger's counter-punches had lost much of their early zip. Chavez stunned 
Randall with a left hook to the cheek with about a minute left in the sixth, 
then rocked him with several blows when he trapped him in the corner with about 
10 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele deducted a point from Chavez near the end of the seventh for a low 
blow. After Randall took about 10 seconds to recover, he came out swinging to 
finish the round in the best action of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh seemed to energize Randall, who caught Chavez early in the eighth 
with a wild right to the chin. Chavez didn't regain his aggression in the round 
and took 15 consecutive punches late in the round. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the flurry was stopped by the bell, Randall had opened up a cut on 
the bridge of Chavez's nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier on the card, International Boxing Federation welterweight champion 
Felix Trinidad won an unanimous decision over Hector (Macho) Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third round, and then in the 10th, Trinidad landed left hooks and right 
uppercuts and had Camacho (44-3) ready to fall for the first time in his 
career. The only thing that kept him up was his ability to grab the taller 
Trinidad, for which Camacho was penalized a point in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old Trinidad (23-0, 19 knockouts) suffered a small cut over his 
left eye in the second and was penalized a point in the fifth for holding the 
back of Camacho's head, but neither seemed to bother him as he piled up the 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges' scoring was 116-110, 117-109 and 119-106. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Brown, who won the WBC super-welterweight title in December, retained it 
in a 12-round majority-decision over Australian Troy Waters (21-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Heavyweight Donovan (Razor) Ruddock (28-4-1) made an inauspicious return to 
action, taking a sluggish 10 rounds to win a unanimous decision over 290-pound 
Anthony Wade (22-4). 
</P>
<P>
 In the first televised bout, six-time former champion Thomas Hearns stunned 
little-known cruiserweight Dan Ward with a roundhouse right midway through the 
first round, then knocked him down 20 seconds later with another. 
</P>
<P>
 Meldrick Taylor (31-3-1, 17 KOs) battered Craig Houk (42-3) with two crisp 
right hands and was awarded a technical knockout in the third round.

OFFICIALLY, KINGS GET HELP TOWARD VICTORY; HOCKEY: INFURIATED DUCKS GIVE UP TWO 
QUICK GOALS AFTER LINESMAN'S LATE CALL IN 5-1 DEFEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There aren't many times when an NHL linesman emerges from virtual anonymity 
and takes it upon himself to make a decision to help determine a game. 
</P>
<P>
 For King fans, linesman Shane Heyer may very well have been the No. 1 star of 
the game. And for Mighty Duck fans? The No. 1 villain, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyer's surprising second-period call got the Kings going on their way to a 
5-1 victory over the Ducks at the Forum on Saturday night before a sellout 
crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Kings' third consecutive victory over their new Southern California 
rival, and the teams are tied with 44 points each in the Pacific Division and 
share eighth place in the Western Conference. This was the Kings' first victory 
after a five-game streak in which they had an 0-3-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game had long been decided, there was some cause for concern when 
King left wing Luc Robitaille was checked by Duck defenseman Sean Hill. 
Robitaille went into the boards feet first and appeared to jam his right foot. 
He had to be helped off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury was diagnosed as a sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the Kings were leading, 5-1, and Robitaille had contributed one goal 
and two assists. Goaltender Kelly Hrudey faced 44 shots and had a shutout going 
until Patrik Carnback's goal at 10:01 of the third period. The third meeting 
between the Kings and Ducks was nothing like their two other games, which were 
tense, with one-goal outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 But what proved to be the major turning point on Saturday was the unusual 
occurrence of Heyer alerting referee Kerry Fraser to a missed penalty several 
seconds after it happened. Play had stopped and Wayne Gretzky said something to 
Fraser and headed to the Kings' bench at 7:34 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Duck defenseman Don McSween was assessed a five-minute major penalty 
and an automatic game misconduct for high-sticking Gretzky. With a five-minute 
power play, the Kings promptly scored twice -- on goals by Robitaille (28th of 
the season) at 9:54 and Rob Blake (12th) at 11:15 -- and took a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck captain Troy Loney had argued strongly when the penalty was announced, 
and the two goals only fueled the anger on the Duck bench. Immediately after 
the Blake goal, the Ducks were assessed a bench penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you should go in and ask Wayne to see the cut," Duck Coach Ron Wilson 
said. "A five-minute major is when you cut someone maliciously. I wouldn't even 
have called a two-minute minor in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see it at the time. Shane Heyer claims he did. Unfortunately, it 
completely changed the game because we were dominating them. You can't have a 
linesman making a call when he's not 100% sure. Wayne must have made the call 
himself. He said his gum was bleeding. Give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
 Said King Coach Barry Melrose: "It was a good call. He was cut on the nose. I 
wouldn't say he was (bleeding) profusely. I'd never lie about a thing like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks had outshot the Kings, 15-4, in the first period. But the McSween 
incident kept the Ducks off balance, and they came out shaky at the start of 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Guy Hebert was erratic, giving up two early third-period goals in 
32 seconds to Tomas Sandstrom and Shawn McEachern. It was McEachern's first 
goal since Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon Ward scored at 4:01 for his second goal in two games, making it 5-0.  
</P>
<P>
 Hebert was pulled for Ron Tugnutt, having allowed five goals on 28 shots, 
including the final three goals on only four shots. King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Gary Shuchuk collided with Duck defenseman Don McSween along the left 
boards and suffered a sprained left knee at 5:19 of the first period. He was 
taken to a hospital and will be re-evaluated today. . . . The other injured 
King is center Pat Conacher, who has missed consecutive games because of sore 
ribs. . . . The Ducks were without forward Anatoli Semenov, who had a sore left 
elbow after playing his first game on Friday night since dislocating it.

MORNING BRIEFING: AT LSU, SHAQ THE QUITTER IS NO HALL OF FAMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal made big plays and earned lots of honors during three seasons 
of basketball at LSU. Then he got a huge NBA contract. 
</P>
<P>
 What he didn't get is a degree, and because of that he won't get something 
else: a place in the LSU athletic hall of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "A degree is mandatory for induction so Shaquille absolutely does not deserve 
to be in the Hall of Fame," said Hugh Buckingham, a member of the LSU Athletic 
Council. "He not only didn't get a degree, he left in the middle of the 
semester after his last season. It makes our rhetoric about educating athletes 
look like a sham." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which of today's Super Bowl coaches earned a Phi Beta Kappa key? 
</P>
<P>
 One man's view: John Nelson of the Associated Press had this to say about the 
Super Bowl: 
</P>
<P>
 "Warning! Sunday afternoon, when you're setting out the platters of head 
cheese, the bowls of barbecue chips and the buckets of beer, don't bury the TV 
Guide. If the Super Bowl kickoff is on time, at 3:18 p.m. PST, you'll need it 
by 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "By then, figuring the Cowboys start slow, unlimber a little, find their wives 
in the stands and order pizza, they should be ahead of Buffalo by about four 
touchdowns. Goodby, NBC." 
</P>
<P>
 Popular date: UCLA's basketball team -- or it's schedule maker -- apparently 
isn't much of a Super Bowl fan. For the second year in a row, the Bruins are 
scheduled on Super Bowl Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 They play California today at the Oakland Coliseum Arena at 1 p.m., opposite 
the Super Bowl pregame show. Last year, they played host to Notre Dame, also at 
1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding horizons: The Amateur Athletic Foundation sportsletter reports that 
the New Jersey Nets of the NBA have hired two bilingual staff members, one 
fluent in Japanese and the other in Hindi, the language spoken in India, to 
concentrate on attracting growing ethnic groups in their area. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift Soviet: Detroit's Paul Coffey, the NHL's all-time leading scorer among 
defensemen, is a great fan of teammate Sergei Fedorov, the former Soviet Union 
star who won the fastest-skater competition during the All-Star game break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been fortunate in my career to play with some of the great skaters, but 
nobody skates like Sergei," Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Return engagement: Entertainer Phil Harris, who teamed with Dutch Harrison to 
win the Bing Crosby National Pro-Am in 1951, will celebrate his 90th birthday 
next Wednesday during the 3M Celebrity Challenge by attempting to make a 
90-foot putt on the 17th green at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A long putt by Harris on that green helped the team win the pro-am 43 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't 90 feet, but it felt like 90 miles," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new look: Michigan State forward Anthony Miller was known as "Pig" to his 
teammates last season. This year, having lost 25 pounds, he's called "Pig 
Light." 
</P>
<P>
 No Nicklaus: Danny Ainge, who played baseball in the majors before switching 
to the NBA, had this to say to Toni Ginnetti of the Chicago Sun-Times about the 
chances of Michael Jordan making it the other way around: 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I'll say is Michael has a better chance in baseball than making the 
PGA Tour. I've golfed with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Buffalo's Marv Levy, from Coe College in Iowa.

HARPER PUTS THE HURT ON TIMBERWOLVES; PRO BASKETBALL: HE SCORES 31 POINTS 
DESPITE SORE ANKLE AND HELPS CLIPPERS END FIVE-GAME HOME LOSING STREAK, 103-93. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ron Harper, who had averaged 27.5 points in his last two games, thought he 
might have to sit out the Clippers' game against the Minnesota Timberwolves 
Saturday night because of a sore left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teammates are trying to force me to play," Harper jokingly said before the 
game. "It's been swollen the last three days." 
</P>
<P>
 But Harper played and played well, scoring 31 points as the Clippers ended a 
five-game home losing streak by beating the Timberwolves, 103-93, before 10,634 
at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time the Clippers have played at the Sports Arena since Jan. 
8. They moved their last two home games to the Forum and Anaheim Arena because 
the Sports Arena was being repaired after suffering earthquake damage on Jan 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who scored a season-high 37 points in Tuesday night's 111-103 victory 
at Seattle, made 12 of 22 shots, including three three-pointers as the Clippers 
(15-25) won for the second time in their last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper had 11 points in the third quarter as the Clippers built a 16-point 
third-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps distracted by contract negotiations, Harper, who is in the final year 
of a contract that pays him $4 million this season, has been inconsistent on 
the court and outspoken off the court. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has been consistent lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper played well as the Clippers handed Seattle its second home loss of the 
season Tuesday and he had 18 points as they came within three points of 
defeating the New York Knicks Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contract doesn't bother me," Harper said. "I ain't got no fear about it. I 
know I'm going to make $3 or $4 million next season. The thing is you have to 
enjoy playing the game of basketball and you have to enjoy playing for the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to be successful the rest of the season, we're going to have 
to put all that behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning, who had 19 points, thinks Harper has picked up his game a 
notch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron is going to the basket very well and shooting the open jump shot very 
well," Manning said. "He's playing great." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading 87-72, the Clippers were outscored, 15-6, as Minnesota cut the lead to 
93-87 with 3:09 left on a layup by Doug West, who had 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark Jackson, who had 10 points, seven assists and six rebounds, scored on 
a drive and Harold Ellis and Harper each made two free throws as the Clippers 
beat Minnesota (14-27) for the first time in three games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, who had a season-high six steals, did a good job on rookie guard Isaiah 
Rider, who scored a season-high 32 points in a 15-point win against the 
Clippers last month at the Sports Arena. Rider missed his first four shots and 
wound up missing nine of 13 shots as he scored 10 points. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward John Williams began working out with Clipper shooting coach Kiki 
Vandeweghe and conditioning coach Carl Horne Saturday after spending the last 
four months at a weight reduction program at Duke University. Although no date 
has been set, he could return to play after the All-Star break. "John looks 
like he's in good shape," Vandeweghe said. "He's anxious to come back as soon 
as possible, but we don't want to rush him. We're going to take it fairly 
slowly and see how things progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Williams declined to reveal his weight, it appears that he lost at 
least 50 pounds and now weighs about 280. Williams, listed at 6-9 and 290, 
reportedly weighed 330 pounds when he entered the program, which included a 
low-fat, low-salt diet of about 1,500 to 2,000 calories a day. "I feel great 
now," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can look in the mirror and say, 'Hey, you've done something nice.' I see 
myself now and see a totally different person. When I got dressed to come to 
the game and I tried on some old clothes and they didn't fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who averaged 18.2 points in the first 12 games of the 1989-90 season 
before tearing a ligament in his right knee, thinks he'll improve the Clippers 
when he returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I'm about where I was before I got hurt," Williams said. "The level 
where I was before I got hurt was pretty good. The thing I see with the 
Clippers is that it looked like everyone is going in different directions. When 
I get back things are going to change."

NBA ROUNDUP; MAVERICKS END HOME SLUMP AFTER 19 LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks found out what it felt like to be in a winning home 
locker room Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks ended their NBA-record streak for home-court futility at 19 
games, getting 24 points from Jim Jackson and defeating the Sacramento Kings, 
108-101. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big relief," said Jamal Mashburn, who scored 16 points. "I'm not 
expecting the fans to fill up the place next time, but for a change it's nice 
to be in this locker room and not be talking about a moral victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas, which ended a 16-game overall losing streak, also avoided the U.S. 
record for consecutive home losses in any pro sport with its first victory at 
Reunion Arena this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1953 St. Louis Browns lost 20 consecutive American League home games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who have lost seven in a row, trailed by only 101-99 after Spud 
Webb's layup with 2:01 to play, but Mitch Richmond, who led the Kings with 34 
points, missed a three-point shot that would have put the Kings ahead. Lionel 
Simmons was called for a foul on the ensuing rebound with 1:12 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks' third victory in 42 games was sealed when Jackson intercepted a 
pass and Fat Lever made two free throws with 17 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 106, Seattle 92 -- Patrick Ewing had 21 points and 18 rebounds and 
the Knicks slowed the SuperSonics in the second half at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks put the defensive clamps on the SuperSonics after Seattle led, 
58-51, at halftime. The SuperSonics were outscored, 55-34, in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's Shawn Kemp scored one point in the final three quarters against the 
Knicks, who limited Seattle to 32% shooting in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 128, Detroit 110 -- Brian Williams scored seven consecutive points 
during a 21-3 run late in the third quarter and early in the fourth that 
carried the Nuggets at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The spurt erased an 88-87 Piston lead and gave Denver a 108-91 advantage with 
9:30 remaining. Detroit made only one shot in a span of nearly seven minutes 
during the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant Stith scored 23 points to lead the Nuggets, who got 20 points from 
Reggie Williams, 17 points from Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and 15 points and 15 
rebounds from Dikembe Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit has lost five in a row and 19 of 20. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 120, Golden State 106 -- Kenny Anderson scored 24 points to lead 
the Nets at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Coleman added 19 points and 12 rebounds for the Nets, who defeated the 
Warriors for the second time in eight days. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 113, Cleveland 98 -- Glen Rice scored 28 points and the Heat 
out-rebounded the Cavaliers, 54-25, at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat won for the fourth time in five games. At 10-10 on the road, Miami 
has matched the franchise record for road victories in a season, including its 
first-ever victories at Cleveland, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Daugherty, who scored 16 points for Cleveland, moved past Austin Carr to 
become the Cavaliers' all-time scoring leader with 10,271.  
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 100, Atlanta 87 -- David Robinson scored 35 points and Dale Ellis 
had a season-high 28 to lead the Spurs at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson also had 12 rebounds and six assists and Ellis made three of six 
three-point shots as the Spurs ended the Hawks' four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 94, Milwaukee 89 -- Dana Barros matched his career high with 28 
points and sparked a fourth-quarter comeback at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Barros, who had 11 points in the fourth quarter, also had a career-high 13 
rebounds. Eric Murdock had 23 points and 10 assists to lead the Bucks, who have 
lost three in a row and eight of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 103, Washington 99 -- Anfernee Hardaway of the Magic scored 21 of his 
24 points in the second half at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hardaway made two free throws to give the Magic a 100-97 lead with 29 
seconds to play, 7-foot-7 Gheorghe Muresan scored to bring the Bullets within 
one. After an Orlando timeout, Hardaway was fouled and again made both foul 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 119, Houston 108 -- Reggie Miller scored 21 points and the Pacers made 
61% of their shots to win at Houston for the first time since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers became the first visiting team to make more than 50% of their shots 
at the Summit this season. They made 48 of 79.

LAKERS CRITICIZED BY MAGIC; PRO BASKETBALL: THE PLAYERS SEEM TO HAVE LOST THEIR

 It used to be in vogue to go watch the Lakers play, but now the in thing seems 
to be deriding the Lakers, and the latest to join in is Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the guys have pride," Johnson said. "I see teams coming in here 
laughing at us." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, in Atlanta on Thursday night to play in an exhibition at Georgia 
Tech, was interviewed by TNT's Craig Sager. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the interview was shown during halftime of Friday night's Golden 
State-Utah game on TNT, and it will be shown in its entirety Monday night 
during halftime of a Cleveland-Detroit game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sager asked: "How painful is it to pick up the newspaper and see the Lakers 
(near) the bottom of the Pacific Division instead of the top?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johnson: "It's more painful going to games. That's painful. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's so bad about it is the fact that it is something that you have built 
up and you have pride in that. I never thought in my wildest dreams that after 
I retired it would be this bad so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that really disturbs me -- and this is the first time I've said 
this because I haven't been interviewed by anybody on this subject -- what's so 
painful is the fact that I don't think the guys have pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had pride. We lost a game and you'd think we had lost 20 games. Nobody 
said a word. We showered and no words. And we came back and made a point the 
next game we were going to kick somebody's butt because we weren't going to 
lose two games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took losses hard, and I don't think I see the same thing now. I don't see 
it and I'm there all the time. I don't see guys getting better, and I don't 
know if they're not working at it or what. It's tough for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've said it, and now L.A.'s going to go crazy saying, 
'Oh, you didn't say it to us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Laker General Manager Jerry West, reached at his home Saturday: "It's 
really not that provocative. A lot of people think much the same way. . . . 
They just don't say it. Magic has the right to say whatever he wants to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where I disagree with him is where he says we're not getting better. I think 
we're making progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some nice young players, but they really haven't learned what it 
takes to win in this league. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember that when Magic played, not only was he a great player, 
but he was also fortunate enough to play with one of the greatest players of 
all time (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different now and Magic, like a lot of us, has a tough time dealing with 
it. I know this much. I know Magic wants us to win."

U.S. COMES BACK AND GAINS TIE AGAINST RUSSIANS ON LATE GOAL; SOCCER: DEFENDER 
ALEXI LALAS SCORES WITH FIVE MINUTES REMAINING IN 1-1 GAME PLAYED IN FRONT OF 
43,651 AT SEATTLE.

<P>
 The faintest of smiles played across Bora Milutinovic's face, lingered, then 
disappeared. The coach of the U.S. national soccer team had almost praised his 
team in a manner previously unknown to him. 
</P>
<P>
 What drove Milutinovic to the brink of a superlative was his team's 
come-from-behind heroics Saturday night to tie a jetlagged Russian team, 1-1, 
before 43,651 raucous fans in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Defender Alexi Lalas scored off a header with five minutes remaining for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time in three games this month that the United States has 
come back with a late goal. It opened with a 2-1 upset of Norway on Jan. 15 and 
a 1-1 tie against Switzerland on Jan. 22. Each time the U.S. team fell behind, 
and each time the players have come back. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that characteristic that prompted Milutinovic to admit that the team's 
last three games, taken together, have been their finest. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the best," he said, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the taciturn Russian coach, who has been staving off an insurrection on 
his team this week, remarked about the Americans' resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a lot of drive to win," Pavel Sadyrin said through an interpreter. 
"The most important thing for them is that they want to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadyrin's team looked sluggish in the first half, understandable given its 
itinerary. The team arrived here late Friday night after a 17-hour flight and a 
24-hour travel day. Before they left Moscow, the Russians were halved, as 14 
national team members signed a petition seeking the removal of Sadyrin as 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal struggle, plus travel delays, left the Russian players tired and 
the coach cranky. Sadyrin dismissed the problems as "normal" and added somewhat 
cryptically: "In soccer, there are always replacements." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether he was referring to players or coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly confident U.S. team put together what was perhaps its best half of 
play in Saturday's first half. Dominic Kinnear was the creative force at 
midfield and exploited space on the wings by getting the ball to Chris 
Henderson on the right and Cobi Jones on the left. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tone was set in the locker room (before the game)," Kinnear said. "We 
took a look at them in warmups and they looked tired. We decided to jump on 
them right away. We knew they had a long journey." 
</P>
<P>
 And a hard road in the game. The United States won most of the balls, 
controlled the game in the first half and got a few scoring chances. The 
Americans also surprised the Russians with their willingness to match physical 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia scored on one of only three shots they took, when Oleg Salenko lofted a 
lead pass to Dmitri Radchenko. Radchenko caught the U.S. defenders out of 
position, and his uncontested shot eluded Tony Meola in the 52nd minute. 
</P>
<P>
 In not-so-distant days, the U.S. team might have given up after falling 
behind. But this team exuded confidence in its ability to come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were confident that we could score," said Lalas. "We don't panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas' goal came in a familiar fashion -- off a set play and off his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudio Reyna, in as a substitute, was preparing to take a free kick from 30 
yards. But as he saw a defender charging, Reyna opted to dribble the ball to 
space. Free of the Russian defender, Reyna spotted to Mike Lapper on the left 
side and sent the ball to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lapper shot a pinpoint cross to Lalas, who headed the ball in for the score in 
the 85th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an unbelievable ball from Mike Lapper," Lalas said.

 The Black Coaches Assn. probably will follow the NCAA in accepting a 
government offer to mediate their dispute, director Rudy Washington said 
Saturday in Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 While noting that his group had not made a final decision, Washington, the 
coach at Drake, said: "We expect to go along. It's just a matter of setting up 
a meeting and getting everyone together." 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA on Friday accepted the mediation offer from the Community Relations 
Service of the U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's offer headed off a threatened BCA-led boycott of college 
basketball games. The BCA made the threat after delegates at the NCAA

 A former aide's sexual harassment claims against Norm Green were the main

former team executive Pat Forciea said in a deposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Green has publicly blamed the team's financial fortunes for last year's move. 
</P>
<P>
 After the harassment allegations by Kari Dziedzic became public, Forciea says, 
he concluded that it would be only a matter of time before the team left 
because Green would not tolerate the publicity.

 Forciea said Green ordered him to concentrate publicly on the financial

 Olson, the Orioles' all-time save leader, developed elbow problems last season

LONG BEACH STATE GETS A BIG JUMP ON HEALTHY TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week at Cal State Fullerton, Josh King's cheeks were the size of canned 
hams, Greg Vernon was so ill he looked as if someone forced him to watch 10 
hours of the Lorena Bobbitt trial and David Frigout's left foot felt as if it 
was going to split in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, playing with a complete roster for the first time in nine days, 
still lost to Long Beach State, 91-69, on Saturday night in front of 1,479 at 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off of a 66-57 victory Thursday at UC Santa Barbara, Fullerton (4-13, 
2-7) was encouraged by King's return (he missed the UCSB game because of oral 
surgery for impacted wisdom teeth), Vernon's regained strength (from the flu) 
and Frigout's fortitude (he's forced to play the rest of the season with a 
stress fracture). 
</P>
<P>
 The good vibes lasted about as long as it took to break a sweat after tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton got behind quickly, 30-13, before its driver was finished gassing up 
the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were thoroughly outplayed at both ends of the court," Fullerton Coach Brad 
Holland said. "They played very physical and aggressive and we didn't respond 
to that. We took a lot of bad shots and they forced us out of what we wanted to 
do offensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State (10-5, 5-3), which has won eight of its past 10 games, made 
59% of its first-half field goals and played a suffocating zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as good offensively as we've been in the second half," said 49er Coach 
Seth Greenberg, whose team shot 79% from the floor in the final 20 minutes and 
69% for the game. "We took something like 60 three-pointers in the last two 
games. We had a soul-searching meeting to decide how to win basketball games. 
You win basketball games with high percentage shots and by shooting threes 
inside-out." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Atkinson scored a game-high 24 for Long Beach State. Winston Peterson had 
17 for Fullerton and Fred Amos had a career-high 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Add a Big West officiating crew that couldn't find its head with both hands 
and it was a long night for everyone concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Titans shot only 24% from the floor in the first half and played 
defense as if it were something they could do while standing still, they still 
had a better 20 minutes than the officials, who turned the game into a fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Cartmell, Bill Kennedy and Ronnie Hernandez couldn't go more than two 
possessions without blowing their whistles and, when they did, they were often 
unsure of what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times they made technical errors: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The first came after Fullerton had compiled its ninth team foul, when the 
49ers should have been in a one-and-one situation. The officials mistakenly 
gave the 49ers two shots and didn't realize their error until after the first 
shot was missed and the ball hit the floor. Faced with a dead ball, they 
awarded it out of bounds to Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The second came when Vernon was fouled on a three-point attempt with five 
seconds left before halftime. Vernon was awarded only two free throws -- at 
first. After he made the second one to make it 42-27, Long Beach State advanced 
the ball to the other side of the court before the officials heard Holland's 
plea, blew the play dead, and agreed they should have given Vernon a third 
free-throw attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The third came immediately thereafter when, after Vernon missed that third 
attempt, Long Beach's Atkinson was fouled on a three-point attempt at the 
buzzer. Again, the officials mistakenly awarded him two free throws until 49er 
Coach Seth Greenberg convinced them to look at the television replay on the 
sideline. Of course, Greenberg was correct and the officials changed their 
minds and gave Atkinson a third attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Atkinson swished it, Holland and his team were in the locker room 
for the intermission. It was hard enough to watch already. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the Titans had managed to match the officials mistake for mistake. 
Facing a highly effective 49er zone defense, Fullerton made only six of 25 
first-half field goals and committed 10 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem was that the Titan offense didn't work when Peterson 
wasn't in the middle of it. Peterson made four of five field-goal attempts -- 
mostly from the lane -- to finish the half with 13 points. No other Titan had 
more than six.

LONG BEACH SHUTS DOWN FULLERTON, 91-69

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach State got off to a fast start and defeated Cal State Fullerton, 
91-69, Saturday night in a Big West Conference game at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (10-5, 5-3) played their best first half this season.They made eight 
of their first 14 shots, refused to allow the Titans to get low-post baskets 
and held a 21-12 lead after a basket from center Mike Atkinson with 9:13 gone 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris St. Clair of Fullerton (4-13, 2-7) made one of two free throws, then Tim 
Caviezel made two free throws and a basket for Long Beach. Rod Hannibal 
followed with two free throws and a three-pointer and Long Beach led, 30-13, 
with 7:50 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, which shot 53% in upsetting UC Santa Barbara on Thursday, suffered 
through a terrible shooting slump in the first half. The Titans made only three 
of their first 16 shots and six of 25 overall in the first half. They kept Long 
Beach from making it a total blowout by making 10 consecutive free throws to 
open the game and held a 20-15 advantage in rebounding in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that, Long Beach stretched its lead to 44-27 and in the second half 
led by as many as 22 points. Fullerton made a few runs, getting within nine 
points with 4:20 to go. PAUL McLEOD

PEPPERDINE BURIES LOYOLA, 86-56 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pepperdine, stung by an upset loss to Loyola Marymount on Wednesday, left 
nothing to chance in the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves took a 16-point halftime lead, extended it to 37 behind a barrage of 
Damin Lopez three-pointers and finished with a convincing 86-56 West Coast 
Conference victory Saturday night before 3,148 at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who scored 19 points and made five of seven three-pointers, said 
Pepperdine needed to regain its focus after a 76-74 loss to Loyola at Firestone 
Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had something to prove to ourselves," Lopez said. "Let's face it, 
on Wednesday (Loyola) just wanted it more than we did. We came out with a lot 
more intensity tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 By ending a two-game conference losing streak, Pepperdine (11-7, 3-3) moved 
into a four-way tie for third place in the WCC, three games behind leader 
Gonzaga. Loyola fell to 2-15 and 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the guys we can still have a little something to do with (the WCC 
title)," Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said. "We play (Gonzaga) twice in six days 
and they still have to go down to San Francisco and San Diego. It's not quite 
over yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the absence of center Derek Noether, sidelined with a strained right 
arch, Pepperdine was never challenged Saturday. The Waves quickly built on a 
38-22 halftime advantage and led by its biggest margin, 76-39, shortly after 
Lopez hit four consecutive three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Dana Jones led Pepperdine with 21 points and 10 rebounds.

UC IRVINE BLOWS LATE LEAD, LOSES AGAIN IN OVERTIME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine made the second stop of a four-game road swing Saturday night and 
the Anteaters found yet another way to lose, falling, 92-88, to UC Santa 
Barbara in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine had a three-point lead with 51 seconds remaining in regulation, saw 
that evaporate on Clayton Madden's three-pointer with 30 seconds left and then 
saw Lloyd Mumford's high-arch 12-footer fall short at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime, Santa Barbara made two three-pointers and seven of nine free 
throws to hand Irvine, 5-11 overall and 2-6 in the Big West Conference, its 
second consecutive overtime loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let another one get away that we should have won," said Mumford, who 
finished with 22 points. "I think I was fouled on the last shot (in 
regulation), but you know they're not going to call that." 
</P>
<P>
 This is one game the Anteaters should have won in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 With 12:50 remaining in the second half, Irvine center DeForrest Boyer fouled 
Phillip Turner when he blocked Turner's layup attempt. Boyer then drew a 
technical foul for taunting while going face-to-face with Turner. Anteater 
forward Jermaine Avie joined in the fray and also got a technical. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner made five of the six free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had intelligence breakdowns," Irvine Coach Rod Baker said. "Those are the 
kinds of things we can't afford." 
</P>
<P>
 Madden had a career-high 27 to lead Santa Barbara (8-11, 4-5). JOHN WEYLER

USC DEFEATED BY STANFORD AS STREAK HITS FIVE GAMES; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: POPPINK 
SCORES 18 POINTS AND CARDINAL MAKES 31 OF 45 FREE THROWS IN 76-67 VICTORY.

 USC suffered its fifth consecutive loss Saturday night, which meant only one 
thing to Coach George Raveling. 
</P>
<P>
 Better call a medic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was a first-aid course, they would say stop the bleeding, protect the 
wound and treat for shock," said Raveling, whose Trojans dropped a 76-67 
decision to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly that would be a good recommendation for me as a coach -- to stop 
the bleeding. Right now, it's gushing out." 
</P>
<P>
 This thing may need more than a Band-Aid. Also right now, the Trojans don't 
seem to be all that much in the flow of things. Their five-game losing streak 
is their longest since the 1988-89 season, when they lost 13 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth, USC was 10-22 that season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans are still 10-7 in spite of their skid, which is the good news for 
anyone looking for some. Count Raveling as someone who is doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll find a way out of this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This would be encouraging because the path they followed against the Cardinal 
was certainly disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenzo Orr, with 19 points, and Tremayne Anchrum, with 12, were the only 
players who scored in double figures for the Trojans, who nearly played 
themselves out of the game in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having three starters in foul trouble, Stanford led, 38-26, at 
halftime, largely because of what USC contributed. The Trojans shot 33% and had 
12 turnovers and only one assist in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Poppink scored 18 points, 12 at the free-throw line, to lead Stanford. 
Freshman sensation Brevin Knight played only 18 minutes because of foul 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling threw everything at Stanford except his black silk shirt. He tried 
zone defenses, man-to-man, full-court pressure and half-court traps. The only 
thing he couldn't figure out how to deal with was cutting off penetration by 
Stanford's guards. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the Cardinal shot 45 free throws, made 31 and withstood USC's one and 
only run. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaha Wilson's rebound basket and another by Anchrum got USC to within 59-53 
with 6:30 to play. The Trojans never got any closer. David Harbour's driving 
layup and an offensive rebound and basket by Darren Allaway got the lead back 
to 10 points and USC never got closer than eight again. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not an easy verdict to accept for Raveling, who kept the locker-room 
door closed for 19 minutes after the game. After a few minutes of silence, the 
speech he gave was long and spirited, even by Raveling standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said just play hard and keep your head up," said Avondre Jones, who could 
use a little bit of the advice himself after a five-minute, five-foul, 
zero-point performance. "What he said, it was all positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Next for the Trojans, 3-5 in Pacific 10 Conference play, is a game Thursday 
night against UCLA at Pauley Pavilion. Jones was asked how well losing five in 
succession serves as game preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not too good," he said.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE ROUNDUP; THUMBS UP FOR ARIZONA'S 
REEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Arizona's Khalid Reeves, who is nursing a thumb injury, hadn't been able to 
play, it might have been a decent game. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reeves scored 35 points as the 13th-ranked Wildcats defeated Oregon State, 
100-56, Saturday at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin of defeat matched the largest ever for the Beavers, who also lost 
by 44 points to UCLA in 1966. It also represented the most lopsided victory 
this season for Arizona, which improved to 16-3 overall and 5-2 in the Pacific 
10. Oregon State is 5-11, 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves nearly reached his 23.2-point average in the first half, scoring 22. He 
left the game with 11:02 to play, having made 11 of 14 shots. He was three for 
six on three-point attempts and 10 for 10 from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 "My thumb's been feeling better," Reeves said. "Everything I put up went in. 
One time, I put up a shot I thought was off, but it went in, so I knew I was 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arizona Coach Lute Olson: "It was one of those rolls where it seemed like 
he could have scored 60." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves' backcourt mate, Damon Stoudamire, added 16 points and had 10 assists, 
three steals and four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Barry led the Beavers with 15 points and Kareem Anderson had 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson was particularly pleased with the Wildcats' defensive play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense was as solid as it's been in a long time," he said. "We did 
everything well. The key to containing Barry is not allowing him to penetrate." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State 67, Washington 46 -- Isaac Fontaine scored seven points and 
Mark Hendrickson five during a game-breaking 16-0 Washington State run late in 
the first half of the Cougars' victory at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies (2-14, 0-7) lost their eighth in a row under first-year Coach Bob 
Bender. They are off to their worst conference start ever and have dropped 11 
Pac-10 games in a row over two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-point loss is Washington's worst this season, and its 46 points matched 
its season low. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Harris led Washington State (14-5, 4-3) with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State 84, Oregon 78 -- Ron Riley scored 21 points as the Sun Devils 
(10-6, 4-3) beat the Ducks (6-10, 2-5) at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State led, 69-66, with 5:47 to play, but Dwayne Fontana and Riley 
keyed a 9-2 Sun Devil run that secured the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Arizona State starter reached double figures. Fontana had 19 points, 
Mario Bennett 18, Stevin Smith 13 and Isaac Burton 11.

 Charlie Ward made a driving layup with two seconds left to give Florida State 
a 74-73 victory over No. 21-ranked Georgia Tech in an Atlantic Coast Conference 
game Saturday at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, playing in his fifth game with the 
basketball team, drove past Travis Best and was fouled by James Forrest as he 
made the shot. Ward missed the free throw and Georgia Tech grabbed the rebound 
and called time out with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
 Forrest missed a 20-footer as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward finished with 11 points and six assists. Bob Sura led Florida State (9-7 
overall and 2-6 in the ACC) with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech (11-7, 2-5) lost its second in a row and sixth in eight games. 
Forrest led Georgia Tech with 22 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 Duke 75, No. 18 Maryland 62 -- Cherokee Parks scored 24 points and

Terrapins at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-11 junior center from Huntington Beach's Marina High outplayed 
Maryland freshman Joe Smith, who came into the game averaging 21.5 points and 
10.8 rebounds. Smith was held to 11 points on three-for-11 shooting and nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke (15-1, 6-1) took sole possession of first place in the ACC. The Blue 
Devils beat Maryland for the 14th straight time and the 20th time in their last 
21 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting 50% in the first half, Maryland (12-4, 5-2) lost its momentum 
with a slow start in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Kansas 87, Colorado 53 -- The Jayhawks had 10-0 and 13-0 runs to start 
each half and handed the Buffaloes their worst home loss since they began 
playing at Events Center in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jayhawks (19-2, 4-1) posted their most lopsided Big Eight road victory in 
84 years. Colorado (9-8, 1-4) had 23 turnovers and shot 32%. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Arkansas 65, Tennessee 64 -- Scotty Thurman's three-pointer with 9.3 
seconds left at Knoxville, Tenn., gave the Razorbacks (14-2, 5-2) a victory 
over the only Southeastern Conference team they hadn't beaten since joining the 
league for the 1992 season. They are 1-3 against the Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee (3-12, 1-7) got one last chance, but Ed Gray's three-point attempt 
in traffic was deflected at the buzzer by Corliss Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Connecticut 88, Pittsburgh 67 -- Donyell Marshall, averaging 29 points 
in his last five games, scored 25 points to lead the Huskies (18-1, 8-0) to a 
Big East victory over the Panthers (12-5, 6-3) at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut played without Coach Jim Calhoun, who Thursday was found to have 
pneumonia. Assistant coach Howie Dickenman took his place. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7 Purdue 75, No. 17 Minnesota 72 -- Glenn Robinson, scoreless after the 
first 13 minutes, scored 16 points in a 12-minute span and finished with 27 
points, 12 rebounds and four steals in the Boilermakers' Big Ten victory over 
the Gophers at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory followed Purdue's (17-2, 5-2) tough loss at Penn State. Minnesota

CAL LUTHERAN BEATS CALTECH TO STAY IN 1ST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are times when first impressions can be deceiving, but Saturday night's 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference basketball game between 
Caltech and Cal Lutheran was not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment the teams took the court for pre-game warmups, it was obvious 
that Cal Lutheran not only had a sizable height advantage, but that the 
Kingsmen were stronger, quicker and more talented. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a 101-41 victory for Cal Lutheran (16-1, 5-1 in conference 
play) which kept the Kingsmen in a first-place tie with Pomona-Pitzer in the 
SCIAC. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran, which tied La Verne for the SCIAC title last season, will play 
on the road against the Leopards on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier upset La Verne, 81-76, Saturday night, but Cal Lutheran is expected 
to have its hands full against the Leopards. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Caltech (8-6, 0-6), the Kingsmen hit 12 of their first 15 shots to 
take a 28-8 lead with 10 minutes 47 seconds left in the first half. They made 
16 of their first 19 shots in the second half to take an 82-24 lead with 11:32 
top play. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Clark (15 points) capped Cal Lutheran's 37-8 blitzkrieg to start the 
second half with a 180-degree, reverse, two-handed dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted Kingsmen Coach Mike Dunlap to call time out and make mass 
substitutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little hard to stay real intense in a game like that, but we wanted to 
play well so the second-string guys could get a chance to play," Cal Lutheran 
guard Paul Tapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Cal Lutheran's starters scored in double figures, led by Damon Ridley 
with 19 points and Tapp with 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapp, who moved into the starting lineup at the start of SCIAC play to replace 
injured Jason Smith, hit seven of nine shots and made four of six 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really feeling good about my shot right now," Tapp said. "We all felt 
like we had to pick it up when Jason went out and I'm glad I've been able to do 
my part." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran led, 45-16, at halftime, despite substituting freely and running 
deliberate plays to take time off the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Tsai led Caltech with 14 points, all in the second half.

CANYONS SNAPS LOSING STREAK BY DEFEATING VALLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than three weeks without a victory, the College of the Canyons 
men's basketball team finally snapped out of the doldrums Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars used a strong inside game to defeat Valley, 95-81, in a Western 
State Conference South Division game at Canyons.The victory snapped a five-game 
losing streak for Canyons (7-15, 1-1 in conference play). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offense executed well," Canyons Coach Lee Smelser said. "We extended them 
out (on the court) and were able to break behind them for some easy baskets." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key players for Canyons under both boards was 6-foot-5 freshman 
forward Kwesi' Fulton, who scored 25 points and had 10 rebounds. Seven of his 
10 baskets came on layups or offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton had outside help from forward Randy Eason, who scored 20 points, 
including three three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They exploited some of our weaknesses on defense," Valley Coach Doug 
Michelson said. "We had poor reads on a couple of pick and rolls. A couple of 
players lost vision a couple of times and gave up layups." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley (9-14, 1-2) opened the game with baskets by forwards Darius Moses and 
Kenyth Henry to take a 4-0 edge but never led again in the first half. The 
Monarchs trailed at the half, 43-40. 
</P>
<P>
 But Valley, behind guard Craig Griffin (28 points) rallied to tie the score, 
58-58, with 11 minutes 40 seconds to play. Griffin scored 14 points in each 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-point basket by Henry from the corner put Valley ahead, 64-63, with 
9:40 remaining but Canyons assumed control thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars went on a 12-2 run that gave them an 84-75 advantage with 2:19 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our flat spot right before the half but we started executing our 
offense in the second half," Smelser said.

 Where the Cal State Northridge basketball team plays and practices, reporters 
and camera crews follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, it seems, are finally getting the media attention they have 
always relished. 
</P>
<P>
 If only people were watching for another reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Team Tragedy took its road show to the Windy City on Saturday and got swept 
away by Northeastern Illinois, 85-69, between questions about aftershocks and 
its crumbling campus. 
</P>
<P>
 On the court, rust was apparent.

 Playing for the first time since Jan. 17 because of the earthquake that 
morning, Northridge (3-13) committed 21 turnovers and was charged with 29 
personal fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not playing in a game for a while, you're obviously going to be rusty," said 
Andre Chevalier, who paced the Matadors with 18 points, six assists and four 
steals. "But that's no excuse for the turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
 And the fouls? 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of stuff went their way," Chevalier added. 
</P>
<P>
 Take away a three-point basket at the end and Northeastern Illinois (12-7) 
made only three baskets in the last 10 minutes 33 seconds. However, the Golden 
Eagles attempted 32 free throws in the second half, making 26, enabling them to 
overcome a 33-32 Northridge halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very unique situation, to hold a team to three field goals in 10 1/2 
minutes and they increase their lead," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to comment further, noting, "It's against NCAA rules to say what I 
really want to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Smith, Northeastern Illinois' sharp-shooting forward, had 21 of his 24 
points in the second half to equal his scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was playing its first game since learning that Chris Yard, the 
team's top rebounder, will miss the rest of the season because of a torn 
ligament in his right knee and a broken right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Already shorthanded, the Matadors suffered further when Peter Micelli and 
Shane O'Doherty, their top remaining post players, both landed in early foul 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Doherty fouled out in 17 minutes. Micelli finished with four fouls in only 
20 minutes. The pair combined for 12 points and only five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge made 50% of its shots, but attempted 10 fewer field goals and 11 
fewer free throws than the Golden Eagles. Northeastern Illinois outrebounded 
Northridge, 34-25. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Martin was a bright spot for the Matadors, coming off the bench to score 
14 points in 31 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn McLinn, Northridge's top scorer, made only one of six shots and 
finished with seven points. He had scored in double figures in 11 consecutive 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's on to South Bend, Ind., where Northridge will play Notre Dame on 
Monday night -- in between interviews, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is really pulling for us because we're a bright spot for the school 
right now even through we're not winning much," Micelli said after talking to a 
local news station. "We're playing for pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game gets the cobwebs out. Now we're ready. The turmoil is over and it's 
time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Northridge will have to keep moving, like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Bob Hiegert told the team after the game that it might not 
play in the Northridge gym again this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited parking and concession problems, then added, "And how many people are 
really going to want to come into our gym?" 
</P>
<P>
 The players would like to. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's disheartening to hear because we play well at home," Chevalier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, the Matadors should be used to getting bad news.

<P>
 After almost two weeks off, Cal State Northridge got back to playing 
basketball Saturday night. The Matadors' rust was evident. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first game since a few hours after the Jan. 17 earthquake, which was 
centered near its campus, Northridge committed 21 turnovers and was charged 
with 29 personal fouls in an 85-69 loss to Northeastern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Smith scored 21 of his game-high 24 points in the second half as the 
Golden Eagles pulled away at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Take away a last-second, throw-away three-point basket, and Northeastern 
Illinois (12-7) made only three field goals in the last 10 minutes 33 seconds. 
But the Golden Eagles shot 32 free throws in the second half, making 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very unique situation, to hold a team to three field goals in 10 1/2 
minutes and they increase their lead," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said.

<P>
 Andre Chevalier paced Northridge (3-13) with 18 points.

 Northeastern Illinois outrebounded Northridge, 34-25. MIKE HISERMAN

MOTOCROSS; MCGRATH KEEPS HIS RECORD PERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeremy McGrath, the undefeated supercross champion from Murrieta, fought off 
an early challenge from Jeff Emig to win his third Coors Light Challenge of the 
young American Motorcyclist Assn. season before 43,938 at Anaheim Stadium on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Ward came off the starting line in front, but was quickly passed by Emig 
and McGrath, the defending Anaheim champion. After trading the lead a couple of 
times with Emig, McGrath pulled steadily ahead to win by a substantial margin 
in the 20-lap main event. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Stanton, a former three-time supercross champion from Sherwood, Mich., 
finished second, also on a Honda, with Ward third on a Yamaha. Emig dropped 
back to finish fifth with Mike Kiedrowski of Canyon Country fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike LaRocco, who had finished second behind McGrath in earlier races at 
Orlando, Fla., and Houston, dropped out on the second lap because of a broken 
crankcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Huffman, Suzuki's teen-age rider from Saugus, repeated his victory in 
the 125cc support race. Pedro Gonzales, the reigning motocross champion of 
Mexico who now lives in Los Angeles, was second on a Kawasaki, with Craig 
Decker of Palm Desert third on a Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-lap race followed form. Huffman and Gonzales had won the two 
preliminary heats. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath gave an early indication of how he dominates supercross with an easy 
victory in the eight-lap second heat. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting a hole-shot off the starting line, McGrath was shuffled back to 
fourth in the first turn, but before the field had completed the first lap, he 
was tucked in behind leader Michael Craig. Biding his time, McGrath followed 
Craig before pulling alongside as the pair took a long jump, side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 As they came off the jump, Craig went wide to sweep off a berm, but McGrath 
tucked inside and grabbed the lead. From there, it was only a matter of 
finishing the eight laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Lamson of Riverside was a surprise winner of the first heat, finishing 
ahead of Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Johnson, the winningest supercross rider in history and the man who 
recruited McGrath for the Honda team five years ago, credited a combination of 
brains and balance for the success of the 22-year-old who won 10 races in his 
rookie season last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeremy is never out of control," Johnson said after watching his former 
protege in action. "He is very smart, racing smart. He is not afraid to use 
innovative lines, but he never uses a foolish one. And he is patient. The way 
he set up Craig for his pass was a textbook move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeremy also has the knack of being stronger at the end of the race. A lot of 
riders go fast at the start, but not at the finish. That's one of Jeremy's 
strongest points -- finishing strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who won 28 supercross races and two championships with Honda before 
retiring to become a stadium off-road truck racer, will drive a stock car in 
selected Winston West and Busch Grand National races this year, in addition to 
racing his Chevrolet truck in the Mickey Thompson stadium series. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge chunk of Anaheim Stadium was missing where engineers were patching the 
upper portion of the stadium that was damaged by this month's earthquake, which 
toppled the Big A scoreboard. About 20,000 seats were blocked out by engineers 
for safety purposes. This caused a 30-minute delay in the start of the program 
as officials tried to relocate about 2,500 spectators.

NHL ROUNDUP; CROWD OF 26,652 SEES SHARKS BEAT LIGHTNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gaetan Duchesne's goal at 1:01 of the third period gave the San Jose Sharks a 
2-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday night before 26,652 at St. 
Petersburg, Fla., the second-largest crowd in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
 The record of 27,227 was set in the Lightning's home opener on Oct. 9, a 2-0 
loss to the Florida Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchesne skated down the slot and knocked home a loose puck after Roman 
Hamrlik of the Lightning slid to break up a two-on-one rush by the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory extended the Sharks' road unbeaten streak to five. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 7, Winnipeg 1 -- Ray Sheppard scored three goals at Detroit for his 
fifth career hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard netted his 31st, 32nd and 33rd goals and added an assist for the Red 
Wings, who are 11-2-3 in their last 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Fedorov, second in the NHL with 80 points, scored his 33rd goal and set 
up two third-period goals by Vyacheslav Kozlov. Martin Lapointe also scored for 
Detroit, which got three assists from Paul Coffey and two from Steve Chiasson. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 4, Philadelphia 2 -- Sylvain Cote scored the go-ahead goal with 
1:44 to play at Philadelphia, helping Capital Coach Jim Shoenfeld even his 
record at 1-1. Schoenfeld replaced the fired Terry Murray on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Lindros, who has seven goals and eight assists in his last seven games, 
scored twice for Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec 3, Hartford 2 -- Curtis Leschyshyn scored the go-ahead goal at 7:06 of 
the third period at Hartford, Conn., to help the Nordiques end a five-game road 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexei Gusarov and Mike McKee scored in the first period for Quebec, which was 
outshot, 28-23, while winning for only the third time in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 3, Montreal 2 -- The line of Dale Hawerchuk, Brad May and Donald 
Audette had a hand in all three Sabre goals at Montreal. Hawerchuk and May each 
had a goal and two assists, and Audette had two assists. Hawerchuk and May set 
up Richard Smehlik for the third goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 6, New Jersey 3 -- Pavel Bure scored two goals to lead the Canucks 
at Vancouver. Bure was slowed earlier in the season by injury, sitting out 
eight games, but has picked up his production since the All-Star break. He had 
four goals and nine points in four games last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 2, New York Islanders 1 -- Bryan Smolinski tipped in Don Sweeney's slap 
shot from the blue line midway through the third period to lift the Bruins at 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the fourth in a row for the Bruins, whose goaltending duo of 
Jon Casey and Vincent Riendeau has given up only three goals in that four-game 
span. Riendeau, acquired from Detroit for a conditional draft choice Jan. 17, 
won his second start. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 5, Edmonton 3 -- Brent Gilchrist's third-period goal helped the Stars 
win at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilchrist jumped on a loose puck in the Oilers' zone at 7:24 of the third 
period and tucked a backhand shot high into the net over a falling Bill 
Ranford. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 5, Calgary 3 -- Brett Hull scored two goals at Calgary. Steve 
Duchesne, Brendan Shanahan and Philippe Bozon also scored for the Blues, who 
headed home for nine games with a four-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 4, Pittsburgh 4 -- Light-scoring Bill Berg scored two goals at Toronto 
for the Maple Leafs, who are unbeaten in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg had only three goals in 50 previous games this season in a mainly 
defensive role. He has 33 NHL goals in 263 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa 3, Chicago 3 -- Defenseman Kerry Huffman's first goal of the season -- 
at 5:56 of the third period -- helped the lowly Senators earn a rare road point 
at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the tie, the Senators' road winless streak reached 13 games.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; CONCORDIA EXPANDS HORIZONS IN VICTORY

<P>
 The Concordia women's basketball team mostly is known as the one Gitte Mejer 
plays for. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer, a senior center, is fifth among NAIA college scorers with a 25-point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Eagles showed they are not one-dimensional in an 80-71 overtime upset 
of Southern California College in a Golden State Athletic Conference women's 
basketball game Saturday at Concordia. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer was limited to four points in the first half after getting her second 
foul with 11 minutes 31 seconds to play. She was benched the rest of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Her teammates showed great hustle against taller SCC, and Concordia led, 
33-29, at the break. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer finished with 17 points, including five in overtime, before fouling out 
with 1:55 left. Southern California used a double-team defense to limit her to 
nine shots. She made all five of her free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Giem had 20 points, and Julie Workman added 18 for Concordia (12-8, 3-2 
in conference). Kara Stephens came off the bench to score 14 for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "People focus a lot on Gitte," Concordia Coach Sharon Campbell said. "But 
tonight showed that there is lot more to this team. I'm just so proud of them 
because we aren't very tall or very deep, but we play hard and with a lot of 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California College (16-5, 2-2) rallied to lead, 40-37, five minutes 
into the second half. But Concordia went on a 11-0 run and was up, 48-40, with 
9:55 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 62-62, at the end of regulation, but Mejer had five 
consecutive points in overtime to put Concordia ahead, 69-64, with 2:58 left. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Eagles' next possession, Mejer took a pass from Workman but tossed it 
back, and Workman made a wide-open three-pointer to put Concordia ahead, 72-64, 
with 2:16 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles made nine of 10 free throws in overtime to keep SCC from coming 
back. Kikka Jarvelainen made four, and Workman and Giem two each. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles could have avoided overtime but blew a 60-56 lead in the final 1:02 
of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC's Tina Demarsh made two three-pointers in the final 45 seconds to force 
overtime. Her first came with 45 seconds left and cut the Concordia lead to 
60-59. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer made two free throws with 34 seconds left to make it 62-59. But Demarsh 
(23 points) made another three-pointer with 10 seconds left to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia's Workman missed an open three-pointer with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 In Big West Conference women's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Las Vegas 92, Cal State Fullerton 64 -- The Titans were never able to 
keep up with UNLV (13-3, 8-1), which had five players in double figures, led by 
Gwynn Hobbs with 20 points. Forward Autumn Hollyfield, who had six 
three-pointers, scored 25 points for Fullerton (2-13, 1-7). 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State 66, UC Irvine 64 -- Forward Anita Maxwell hit a shot with 
three minutes left to put visiting New Mexico (14-3, 6-2) ahead for good. 
Tamera Thomas brought the Anteaters (2-14, 1-7) within two points with eight 
seconds left, but Irvine was unable to get the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
 In Golden State Athletic Conference men's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California College 81, Concordia 70 -- Southern California College 
scored 50 second-half points to defeat Concordia (13-8, 2-3). Danin Bryant 
scored a game-high 32 points for Southern California College (10-11, 1-4). 
Craig Martin scored 17 for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 In California Coastal Conference men's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Christian 83, Pacific Union 63 -- Charles Ross had 27 points and 13 
rebounds for Pacific Christian (15-13, 6-1), which remained on top of the 
conference's Southern Division. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's nonconference tennis: 
</P>

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; MARINA WINS, CLOSES IN ON FOURTH TITLE IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it's the tradition, or the gymnasium. Maybe it's the proven player, 
Shandy Robbins, or the unheralded one, Martita Emde. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever it is, Marina has it, and with the Vikings' 49-43 victory Saturday 
over seventh-ranked Fountain Valley, they are in an ideal position to win their 
fourth consecutive Sunset League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (16-5, 9-1), ranked fifth in Orange County, extended its home winning 
streak in league games to 25 against a team that had beaten the Vikings twice 
this season -- by three points in overtime, and by two. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina now has leads of one game over sixth-ranked Ocean View and two over the 
Barons (15-6, 7-3). 
</P>
<P>
 They can thank Robbins -- an all-league player last year as a sophomore -- who 
scored 18 points and had nine rebounds, as well as Emde, who scored 17 points 
and keyed a third-quarter comeback with eight -- two drives to the basket, two 
shots from 18 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina used a halfcourt trap to fluster the Barons into nine third-quarter 
turnovers, overcoming a six-point halftime deficit. Emde scored six of her 
team's first 10 points, and her 18-footer with 3 minutes 43 seconds left gave 
Marina a 30-28 lead. The Barons went the final 5:38 of the quarter without a 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (Pete Bonny) said we were being timid in the first half," Emde said. 
"He said we should take the ball and go for it -- be more aggressive -- and to 
step it up on defense. We just needed to get that aggressive, confident 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Marina was all over the floor and all over the listless Barons in the second 
half. The Vikings played as if a championship was at stake, and Fountain Valley 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really want to four-peat," Robbins said. "This game was really important to 
me because I want to be a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Marina's defense was the biggest factor and got some big plays from Sonya 
Bryant (seven points, eight rebounds) despite foul trouble. Almost every 
Fountain Valley shot was contested; the Barons have shot about 43% from the 
field this season but shot only 33% (17 of 52) Saturday. Nicole Strange (10 
points, 11 rebounds), shooting 54% this year, was three for 17. Jen Ludwicki 
(12 points, seven rebounds), shooting 47%, was five for 14. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 60, Santa Ana 29 -- Freshman point guard Jennifer Tuilosega had 16 
points, and Farrah Magee added 14 for visiting Ocean View (14-4, 8-2). Santa 
Ana dropped to 10-12, 2-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosary 80, Huntington Beach 62 -- Rosary (10-7, 4-6) moved into a fourth-place 
tie with Edison and ended a six-game losing streak. Jennifer Chey scored 24 and 
Kathleen Celio had 19 points and 15 rebounds for Rosary. Huntington Beach is 
7-12, 3-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster 63, Edison 50 -- Amber Farroux scored 21 points and had 13 
rebounds in Westminster's upset. Lisa Tamamasui added 14 points and 13 rebounds 
for Westminster (8-13, 3-7). Marie Philman led both teams with 23 points for 
Edison (13-8, 4-6).

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; GONZALEZ GETS POINTS; SERVITE GETS VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe the best way to beat Huntington Beach, the 10th-ranked team in Orange 
County, is to let Tony Gonzalez do whatever he pleases. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, a 6-foot-6 forward who has orally committed to attend California, 
had 37 points and 16 rebounds, but Servite kept its Sunset League title hopes 
alive by defeating the Oilers, 67-63, Saturday at Servite High. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gonzalez got his points, the Friars (14-7, 7-3 in league) kept the 
rest of the Oilers in check. Mark Seaton scored 20 points, Kristian Vallas had 
17, and David Downs had 15 to lead a balanced attack for the Friars. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite moved to one game of the Oilers (14-8, 8-2), tied for first with 
Fountain Valley (16-5, 8-2) after the Barons defeated Marina, 55-42, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been kicked around lately," Servite's acting coach Kevin Reynolds said. 
"We lost our coach, we lost to Fountain Valley on Friday . . . but this game 
was about Servite's spirit and pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Servite is 3-1 since Reynolds took over for Scott Hamilton, who was suspended 
for the rest of the season. Hamilton was involved in an altercation with game 
officials after a game Jan. 19 against Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Seaton and the rest of the Friars had redemption on their minds. 
Earlier this season, Huntington Beach defeated Servite, 54-46, and Seaton, the 
Friars' leading scorer, was a non-factor, scoring only five points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight was Seaton's best ballgame of the year," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaton, a 6-9 junior, scored nine of his 20 points in the second quarter, when 
the Friars took charge by outscoring Huntington Beach, 23-13, making eight of 
11 shots from the field (73%) to take a 36-25 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaton opened the second quarter with a two-hand dunk off a perfect feed from 
Downs, then he scored a rebound basket and a free throw to cap an 8-0 run to 
put Servite ahead, 30-23, with 1 minute 53 seconds left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite extended its lead when point guard Mike Hoffman made two 
three-pointers, and a three-point play by Vallas gave the Friars their biggest 
lead of the game, 57-42, with 6:47 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez tried to rally Huntington Beach, scoring 16 of his 37 points in the 
fourth quarter. Matt Malmquist who had 13 points, made his third three-pointer 
to cut the lead to 66-60 with 50 seconds remaining, but the Oilers drew no 
closer until a Gonzalez tip-in with two seconds remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 In other Sunset League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 67, Westminster 44 -- Micah Kroeger had 20 points and 10 rebounds for 
Edison (12-7, 5-5). Chad Baird added 10 points and nine assists and Ben Beard 
had nine points and 12 rebounds. Westminster is 5-17, 1-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 55, Marina 42 -- Phil Domingo scored 21 points, Brandon 
Leimbach added 15, and Daniel Keller 12 for Fountain Valley (16-5, 8-2). Andy 
Nieto scored 22 points for the Vikings (9-13, 3-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 69, Santa Ana 38 -- Ocean View (12-10, 7-3) took a 19-5 
first-quarter lead. Aaron Hatch scored 12 points to lead four Seahawks who 
scored in double figures. Santa Ana is 2-15, 1-9. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Chadwick 78, Brethren Christian 60 -- Richard Mendoza scored 21 
points, including five three-pointers, for Brethren Christian (13-8). Todd 
Ammons scored 33 points, including eight three-pointers, and Neil Thakur had 32 
with six three-pointers for Chadwick.

SANTA ANITA; BIEN BIEN WINS SAN MARCOS; THE BIG 'CAP MIGHT BE NEXT TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trudy McCaffery, who owns Bien Bien along with John Toffan, got her wish 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bien Biens don't come around very often," she said. "Every time they come to 
the racetrack, you hope they go out and do what they are supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just hoping he'd have a nice time out there and not get pushed around." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of a field that didn't include Kotashaan or Star Of Cozzene, 
the 1-2 favorite was a success in his first start of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 With Laffit Pincay riding for the suspended Chris McCarron, the 5-year-old 
Manila horse took charge from 3-1 second choice Explosive Red in the final 
sixteenth to win the $132,100 San Marcos Handicap by 1 1/4 lengths. Bien Bien 
completed the 1 1/4 miles on turf in 2:00 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran a great race, but then he's a great horse," Pincay said. "I was a 
little concerned, though, coming down the stretch. Corey Black (on Myrakalu) 
got through when (Robber Ramble) drifted out, and I thought he had a good 
chance because he was saving ground most of the way and he had a fresh horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I had a fresh horse, too, and when I set him down, he just shot through 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Explosive Red, content to track overmatched pacesetter Robber Ramble for most 
of the way, got the lead in the stretch, but couldn't hold off the 122-pound 
high weight approaching the wire. Explosive Red finished a length in front of 
Myrakalu, then came Navire, Fanatic Boy and Robber Ramble.  
</P>
<P>
 "He never looked like he was in trouble and if he gets that close at the 
quarter pole, you know he's going to finish strong," Toffan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Anita Handicap on March 6 or the San Luis Obispo on Feb. 21 are both 
possibilities for Bien Bien's next race. The former is on the dirt, a surface 
over which he has only one victory in seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Trainer Paco Gonzalez) would like to try him once more on the dirt and so 
would I, just to see what he can do," Toffan said. "He likes this track, and I 
think he would run well." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Remaining unbeaten against fillies other than Sardula and Phone Chatter, 
Tricky Code held on to defeat Fancy 'N Fabulous by a nose in the $104,575 Santa 
Ynez Breeders' Cup Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning for the fourth time in seven starts, the 3-year-old Lost Code filly 
completed the seven furlongs in 1:22 under Corey Nakatani. Owned by Jeff 
Kallenberg and trained by Gary Jones, the 8-5 second choice has lost only in 
the Oak Leaf, Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and the Hollywood Starlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Always close to the lead, Tricky Code discouraged a bid from 
Sophisticatedcielo, who was coupled with Noassemblyrequired as the 7-10 
favorite, then barely held off the maiden Fancy 'N Fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's just a trier," Jones said. "She really gives you all she's got every 
time she runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I freshened her up after her last race (the Starlet on Dec. 18). I was afraid 
she was a little short today and she darn near got beat. She only had four 
works since her last race, but she ran well and she ran game and Corey rode her 
perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophisticatedcielo finished third, a half-length behind Fancy 'N Fabulous. 
Noassemblyrequired, who won the Pasadena Stakes by 5 1/2 lengths last month, 
was 3 1/2 lengths back in fourth. Bayou Plans, the Santa Ynez longshot at 12-1, 
finished last after setting the pace for a half-mile. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Wild Harmony, narrow winner of the Hollywood Turf Express in his last start on 
Nov. 20, is the 9-5 morning-line favorite for $107,100 Palos Verdes Handicap 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to get into the Breeders' Cup Sprint, the 5-year-old Wild Again horse 
finished 1993 with five victories in nine starts and has won three of six at 
Santa Anita. With McCarron absent, Eddie Delahoussaye will ride Wild Harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Concept Win, second to Diazo in the opening-day Malibu Stakes, is the 2-1 
second morning-line choice and J.F. Williams, who ended a nearly 14-month 
losing streak, is the 5-2 third choice in the field of six. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three entrants in the six-furlong Palos Verdes are Davy Be Good, 
fourth in the San Carlos, Scherando, second to J.F. Williams as the 4-5 
favorite on Jan. 12, and Excavate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Loon's Cry, a 4-year-old making his first start, led wire to wire in the 
$65,175 Debonaire Junior on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Mrs. Georgia Ridder and trained by David Hofmans, the gelded son of 
Lear Fan out of the stakes-winning mare Winter Solstice beat favored Crackerjax 
Max by a half-length in 1:21 3/5 for the seven furlongs under Corey Black. 
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Only Alpha, who broke down during Friday's eighth race, had to be destroyed. 
The 4-year-old son of Alphabatim suffered a broken right foreleg. . . . 
Numerous, a $1.7-million yearling and one of two promising 3-year-olds in the 
Charlie Whittingham barn, will make his first start of the year in the third 
race today. The Mr. Prospector offspring has four opponents in the 1 1/16-mile 
allowance race, and he is the even-money morning-line favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Have Fun looks like a threat for the Santa Anita Handicap based on his recent 
improvement. The 5-year-old Topsider horse is perfect in two starts since being 
treated with Lasix with a three-length victory over Slerp in the seventh race. 
He covered the 1 1/16 miles under Corey Nakatani in a fast 1:40 4/5.

 Approaching the second-to-last jump in a steeplechase race here Saturday, 
favored Killula Chief fell, losing the lead and sending jockey Mark Dwyer to 
the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Davies, riding Concert Paper, then took what proved to be short-lived 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwyer, who had managed to hold onto the reins, was quickly back on board his 
mount, although with his feet still out of the stirrups. 
</P>
<P>
 After clearing the final fence, Dwyer rode Killula Chief to a 2 1/2-length 
victory amid tremendous cheers from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dwyer: "Funnily enough, going to the (second-to-last jump) so far in 
front, I was thinking to myself that I probably had time to fall and still win. 
Lo and behold, that's exactly what goes and happens!"

FOLTZ WINS NEWPORT CLASSIC IN PLAYOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Foltz, a Nike Tour pro from Phoenix, birdied the first hole of a 
three-way playoff to win the 20th Taco Bell Newport Classic pro-am golf 
tournament Saturday at the Newport Beach Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz's three on the 339-yard par-four first hole was one better than Paul 
Stankowski of El Paso, Tex., and Sonny Skinner of Sylvester, Ga., and gave 
Foltz the $13,000 first prize from the purse of $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The three finished two rounds tied at six-under-par 136. Foltz shot a 
four-under 67 and Skinner a 69 to catch Stankowski, the first leader who 
ballooned to a 72 after an opening 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Three teams tied for the pro-am championship at 14-under 128: Foltz and Jim 
Glidewell of Newport Beach; Jeff Coston of Orlando, Fla., and Buz Knyal of Los 
Angeles, and Stankowski and John Jester of Mercer Island, Wash.

INS AND OUTS OF BUSINESS ON SUPER SUNDAY; FOOTBALL: BIG-SCREEN TV AND PIZZA 
SELLERS GET LAND-OFFICE RUSH; SO DO SPORTS BARS. BUT PITY THE GOLF COURSE AND 
THE SHOPPING MALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Goldenberg -- the guy who modestly proclaims himself "The King of Big 
Screen" -- sold so many humongous TV sets last week that he extended the hours 
of his La Habra store until midnight and scheduled deliveries before sunup. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Sporting Goods, on the other hand, expected such a poor showing this 
weekend that it isn't even opening its doors today. "People who like sports are 
going to be watching the Super Bowl, not shopping," store manager Francel 
Esquivel said. 
</P>
<P>
 For some businesses, Super Bowl Sunday is as exciting as a 90-yard punt 
return. For others, it's a fumble. Sports bars and liquor stores thrive, but 
golf courses become neatly mowed vacant lots. Malls suffer, too, though all 
things TV-related score big. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dallas Cowboys last Sunday clinched a place in the ultimate football 
game, Derrick Riggs rushed out and bought a 35-inch big screen at Paul's. Then 
he decided 35 inches weren't enough and traded up for a 50-incher. The 
television temporarily inhabits his former roommates' Anaheim house, site of 
the friends' Super Bowl bash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to buy a new TV sometime this year, though I didn't plan to so 
soon," said Riggs, 26, a youth counselor in Altadena. "But I've been a Cowboys 
fan my whole life, so I decided to go ahead with it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of customer Goldenberg has been seeing a lot of lately -- 
football-philes committing in the 11th hour to that $2,000-or-more purchase 
they've been fantasizing about for months. Usually, he sells about 30 
televisions a day. Last week, the number quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Super Bowl comes along, and people say, 'Why not now?' " Goldenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who aren't ready to splurge can always rent. Demand for rental TV sets 
at Rentronics in Anaheim climbed at least 15% last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "A group of guys will chip in $10 apiece to rent a big screen so they can get 
together, have a few brews and enjoy the game," Rentronics manager Jonas Bowen 
said. "If you're having a party, you don't want to stick your friends with the 
19-inch TV you have sitting in the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Other people will party with strangers in sports bars. The National Sports 
Grill's restaurant section is booked solid, and the bar and pool hall will 
offer standing room only to most of the 400 customers anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sales will be up about 40% from a normal Sunday," said Arthur Cruz, 
assistant manager of the Buena Park tavern, which has two big screens and 45 
smaller sets situated in every possible field of vision. "We ordered extra 
liquor and extra glasses to replace those schooners clanged together a bit too 
hard after a good play." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry & Harry's Goat Hill Tavern in Costa Mesa also has stocked up. "St. 
Patrick's is our biggest day, but Super Bowl comes right behind it," manager 
Gary Monahan said. Even so, he can still find cause to lament: "If the Raiders 
and 49ers were playing, business would be even better." 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers for Seashore Beverage Distributors in Newport Beach were stretched so 
thin delivering beer to taverns, grocers and liquor stores that even the owner 
helped make runs. "I've been getting in a truck and doing deliveries myself -- 
I haven't done that in years," said Robert Gallagher. "We've hired temporary 
drivers, and we're working 14-hour days. The Super Bowl, the World Series, 
Wimbledon -- we love 'em!" 
</P>
<P>
 Where there's beer, there's pizza. The Domino's in Irvine expects orders to 
more than double. "We usually have one driver on Sundays, but (today) we'll 
have five," said the store's manager, Tracy Sanchez. "Nobody wants to leave the 
TV set." 
</P>
<P>
 Supermarkets sell more chips, six-packs and avocados for guacamole. (Super 
Bowl Sunday follows only Cinco de Mayo in avocado sales.) But the turkeys, 
brandy and baking supplies purchased during the holidays make for heftier 
revenue, observed Darrell D'Arnall, service manager for a Vons market in San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sales are up about 10%, compared to 100% Thanksgiving and Christmas," he 
said. "The Super Bowl brings in a more casual crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Come kickoff time, though, grocery stores empty out. "The only people we get 
in here are housewives looking for an excuse to escape the game," said Greg 
Cleaver, assistant manager for a Lucky in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Trader Joe's, which sells unusual appetizers such as hummus dip and peanut 
butter-filled pretzels, also benefits -- until the actual day of the event. 
"Our sales are up 30% or 40% this week, but on Super Bowl Sunday traffic almost 
dies," said Donny Alvarado, a manager in the chain's Irvine store. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, as well, score big in advance, then lose yardage during the game. 
Sports Fan Paradise in Costa Mesa has been selling Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo 
Bills shirts like mad all week. But on Sunday, the sports paraphernalia store 
will close at 1 p.m. "Our customers are not people who would miss the Super 
Bowl," manager Fran Thiele said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many businesses, however, stand only to lose from the spectacle that will glue 
an estimated 130 million Americans to their TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Family restaurants that do best in the early evening have little to cheer 
about today. "Last Sunday was soft because of the playoffs," said Tom Harris, 
manager of Mrs. Knott's in Irvine. "I expect dinner on Super Bowl night will be 
even lighter." 
</P>
<P>
 And shopping till you drop, for most, can wait.  
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, the mall has been empty on Super Bowl Sunday," said Stephanie 
Greene, marketing director for the Mall of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, it's fighting back. The mall hopes to attract customers with three 
big-screen televisions, $1 hot dogs and a clearance sale coordinated by 30 
stores. "We'll know Monday morning if it worked," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 Automobile dealers see better days than the one they're about to experience. 
"Usually, we would sell 15 cars on a Sunday, but we'll be down to 11 or 12," 
said Mike Shepard, owner of Santa Ana Chrysler Jeep and Santa Ana Isuzu 
Hyundai. "We end up with a few folks who aren't football fans, and believe it 
or not, there are some of those in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 There won't be many people out buying plywood and electric drills, either. 
"It's a very dismal day for us -- maybe the worst day of the year," said Dick 
Wolsfelt, manager of Buena Park Lumber & Hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 Even computer junkies opt for the Super Bowl over seeking out the latest 
software. "Our business will be down 50% at least," said Margaret Jaibaji, 
manager of Software City in Lake Forest. "The majority of our customers are 
male, so that tends to affect our performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are few lonelier places during the Super Bowl showdown than a 
golf course. "We're booked solid from 6:30 a.m. until 2 p.m., but starting at 
about noon we'll get a lot of no-shows," predicted Lucien Guy Morin, a golf 
instructor at San Juan Hills Country Club in San Juan Capistrano. "By 3 p.m., 
it'll empty out completely."

THE WAR INSIDE THE PENTAGON; DEFENSE-BUDGET AX MEN RUN INTO ANGER, REPRISALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What began for Col. Sandy Mangold as a prestigious Pentagon assignment to 
recommend cuts in the Air Force's $20-billion spacecraft and nuclear forces 
budget ended up a rancorous odyssey through an institution trying to come to 
grips with an austere future. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangold thought the need for huge spending cuts was compelling, but when he 
advocated canceling programs favored by senior Air Force officials -- such as 
the Milstar satellite system and the Titan IV rocket -- an angry general told 
him: "You are not one of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The world crashed down on the 45-year-old colonel last year, when Air Force 
investigators received anonymous allegations that he had pressured a contractor 
to give a friend a job, and had forced a subordinate to house-sit for him. 
</P>
<P>
 In a suit recently filed in Virginia state courts, Mangold charged that he was 
the victim of a conspiracy of Air Force officials and defense contractors 
attempting to use phony accusations to displace him and thwart his proposed 
budget reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 After the allegations were made, Mangold was reassigned, derailing a career 
that had received high marks. The Air Force formally reprimanded Mangold 
earlier this month, but the Pentagon inspector general and Congress have begun 
looking into countercharges that he was framed. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter who prevails, Mangold's case -- and others like it -- may signal an 
unsettling road ahead for an institution some critics say is wracked by enmity 
and fear. A sharp budget ax is going to fall on sacred programs that escaped 
earlier, undermining military careers, damaging major industrial corporations 
and eliminating thousands of civilian jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The stresses of making those cutbacks in programs made obsolete by the end of 
the Cold War are creating an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust never before 
seen in the defense business. 
</P>
<P>
 The venomous nature of these budget battles is leading some experts and 
critics to say that rational decisions will be harder to reach, especially at a 
time crucial to the nation's defense posture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The procurement system has always resisted nonconforming opinions, but in 
today's very harsh environment, nonconformists are getting their heads handed 
to them," said Loren Thompson, a Georgetown University defense expert. "The 
system has a way of making you shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 Many officials defend the procurement system. They say the reductions have not 
diminished its integrity. Darleen Dryun, the Air Force's deputy assistant 
secretary for acquisition, said the formal budget process is handling the task 
of cutbacks well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a pretty open system within the Defense Department and within the Air 
Force," Dryun said. "If somebody doesn't feel that something is being presented 
in the right fashion, there is plenty of opportunity to raise that issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger refused to concede one 
dollar of defense spending after the Pentagon budget peaked in 1985, the agency 
has been loath to make its own cutbacks. And within each service, officials 
have staunchly defended their turf. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tendency to defend every large program could backfire and force the 
Pentagon to make even deeper cuts, because so much money will have been spent 
on designing unaffordable weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study conducted by Pentagon analyst Franklin C. Spinney, a frequent 
acquisition critic, substantiated this risk. The study found that so much money 
is flowing into developing big-ticket weapons for the future that just 2% of 
current aircraft inventories are being replaced each year. As a result, the 
average combat aircraft, in the long run, could be 50 years old before it is 
replaced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Pentagon conducted a "bottom-up" review last year to adjust its 
planning for the post-Cold War era, analysts noted how few major systems were 
cut and how minor were the adjustments to military forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, however, Clinton Administration officials discovered a 
$50-billion gap between defense spending and planned funding over the next five 
years. The gap resulted from overly optimistic assumptions about inflation and 
a pay raise Congress had granted enlisted personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 To many experts, the episode showed that the Defense Department has yet to 
confront the reality of smaller future budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a complete administrative breakdown in this building," said 
Spinney, an Air Force analyst for tactical aircraft. "The budget has been 
predicated on continued growth, but now it is coming unglued." 
</P>
<P>
 While civilian employees such as Spinney have freedom to express such candid 
views, a military officer such as Mangold can quickly fall from grace for 
expressing similar opinions. In a memo last year, Lt. Gen. John Jacquish, a top 
Air Force acquisition official, railed at those who break ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suggest it is timely and appropriate to remind our people that there is a 
time to argue a different approach and a time to accept and support the 
decisions made within the corporate process by those charged with that 
responsibility," Jacquish wrote to his subordinates. "It is only destructive of 
our process if Air Force people or support contractors advocate their personal 
opinions outside the corporate process, simply because the decision was not the 
one they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jacquish was responding to a report leaked to Congress. It had asserted that 
the Air Force could save $10 billion by updating the Defense Support Program 
satellite system rather than continuing to develop a new generation of 
spacecraft that would warn of missile attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary advocate of the lower-cost approach was Col. Edward Dietz, the 
Defense Support Program manager in Los Angeles. Amid the controversy, Dietz was 
removed from his job and reassigned another with less responsibility. Engineers 
at Aerospace Corp., who assisted in writing the report, received unfavorable 
job evaluations as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force investigated allegations by industry executives and Air Force 
officers that Dietz's report was discredited and squelched by senior Air Force 
officials intent on preserving their new-generation program. That investigation 
found no wrongdoing, but it revealed serious problems in military acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, Lt. Gen. Marcus A. Anderson, the Air Force inspector general, 
wrote that the intense competition for future defense funds "is producing 
distrust, suspicion, breakdowns in communications and ultimately allegations of 
impropriety, both from within the Air Force and from defense contractors." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Timothy L. Rude can attest to that. Rude, an engineer, was the Air Force 
manager for advanced guidance systems for intercontinental ballistic missiles 
in San Bernardino. Rude figured that the end of the Cold War had diminished the 
need for sophisticated guidance devices. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when Rude suggested that less sophisticated systems might suffice, at 
a savings of $150 million, he rankled his bosses. He further angered them when 
he claimed they had shifted funds for missile programs in violation of federal 
law, a charge later substantiated by a General Accounting Office audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Rude was drummed out of the service a year ago, he said, on charges that he 
had sexually harassed a female junior officer, which he denies. Rude claims 
that senior officers coerced the woman into filing the complaint, which said he 
had sat too close to her in a restaurant booth, touched her knee and asked her 
for a date. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, this was a convoluted form of reprisal," he said. "This whole 
thing came up a year after I reported the waste, fraud and abuse here. The 
system has gotten pretty corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 To outsiders, the idea that military officials and private contractors would 
resort to making phony allegations may seem far fetched. But when billions of 
dollars are at stake, players in defense procurement "know how to play 
hardball," says RAND Corp. vice president George Donohue. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young program manager, Donohue recalled discovering that a contractor was 
altering test data to conceal problems in a weapon. When Donohue disclosed the 
falsifications, the contractor used its congressional contacts to brand Donohue 
as an incompetent novice and a menace to national security, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he survived the incident, he said he learned that "people in this 
business are always skating on thin ice. When I hear about these things, I 
don't find it terribly surprising that people would make false allegations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue doesn't suggest that lying is widespread, but he says the pressure is 
becoming more and more intense. Any government or private organization would 
have a tough time coping with the depth of cutbacks the Defense Department 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon budgets dropped 17% from their peak in 1985 to 1992, and are 
projected to decline 27% further between 1992 and 1997. Procurement spending 
has fallen off even more sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangold described the system in a recent interview as being "affected by a 
cancer." In August, 1992, two months after he was appointed chief of resource 
allocation for space and nuclear forces, Mangold dropped his first bombshell: 
He suggested canceling the $27.4-billion Milstar communications satellite. He 
argued that it was fraught with inadequacies and unnecessary in the post-Cold 
War era. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangold did not have direct authority to cut any program, but his 
recommendations went to the most senior Air Force officials and carried 
significant weight. He managed a staff of 38 colonels and lower-ranking 
officers who examined 250 programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangold also questioned the Air Force's increasing use of nonprofit federal 
research corporations, such as Aerospace Corp. and RAND, which was costing the 
service upward of $1 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The abrupt end came last June, just days after Mangold had been assigned a 
second tour of duty as team chief. The Air Force's inspector general opened a 
probe into whether Mangold had threatened to cut the contracts of Anser Corp., 
a nonprofit Arlington, Va.-based consulting firm, unless it hired one of his 
personal friends, according to interviews with Pentagon officials, confidential 
Pentagon documents and Mangold. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangold's lawsuit alleges that Anser would have been hurt badly by the cuts 
recommended. He accuses Anser President John Fabian, Vice President Paul Adler 
and Lt. Col. James Rooney, a former subordinate on Mangold's staff, of 
conspiring to file the false allegations, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Anser officials would not comment. In legal papers responding to Mangold's 
suit, the firm denied his allegations and said its officials had made no 
allegations against Mangold. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Rooney who made the allegation that he was ordered to house-sit, 
according to Mangold, who denies the charge. Rooney's apparent motive was his 
allegiance to the Air Force's space community, which had targeted Mangold as an 
adversary, Mangold said. Rooney did not return calls asking for his comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangold denies that he ever coerced Anser, though he acknowledges that he gave 
Anser officials the resume of a woman he considered to be qualified for a 
special job. The woman was never hired, and Mangold said he continued to award 
contracts to the firm until he was reassigned as a planner in June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon investigators say military officials are not barred from recommending 
an individual for a job. An ethical breach would have occurred only if he had 
threatened Anser, something Mangold's friends called unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he worked for me, he was totally honest and loyal and dedicated," said 
retired Air Force Gen. Richard Henry, a former commander of the Los Angeles 
Space and Missile Systems Center. Mangold was Henry's aide in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangold's case is also under investigation by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich), 
chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, which expects to hold 
hearings next month into the Mangold and Dietz cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was viewed as a pariah," Mangold said. "I said if we really want to take 
massive cuts, we all have to take our share. There aren't any team chiefs 
coming forward now with radical proposals after they have seen what happened to 
me. My career has been ruined." WHAT THE COLONEL WANTED TO CUT

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: THERE ARE SOME INVESTMENTS YOU CAN'T BANK 
ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Do you know how safe your bank investments are? According to a newly released 
national survey, the answer is probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the people who buy mutual funds and annuities through banks 
wrongly assume that these investments are protected by federal deposit 
insurance. Another 35% of those who buy individual stocks through banks think 
their principal is federally insured, according to the survey commissioned by 
the North American Securities Administrators Assn. and the American Assn. of 
Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, a great deal of the problem may be semantics. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers don't differentiate between the terms federally insured , insured 
and guaranteed , says Marcia Selz, president of Marketing Matrix, a financial 
services research firm in Los Angeles. And they are particularly likely to 
misunderstand -- even with a clear disclosure document -- when they are 
standing in a bank branch where years of experience has told them they can't 
lose any money, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, you can lose money on "government-guaranteed" and "insured" 
investments because, in the complicated realm of finance, different guarantees 
have different meanings. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, bank deposits are "federally insured" and "guaranteed" by the 
federal government. That means that if your bank fails, a representative from 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will show up with a checkbook, ready to pay 
you virtually on the spot the amount in your account, up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter when you take the money out, the dollar value of your savings 
account cannot decline. It can only increase as interest accrues. This is 
generally what people picture when they hear "government guaranteed." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if you buy a mutual fund that invests in 
government-guaranteed securities, such as Treasury bonds, your guarantee means 
something else entirely. A Treasury bond is a long-term IOU from the federal 
government. And the U.S. government has issued a blanket guarantee that it will 
pay back every dime it borrowed, with interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the value of your mutual fund account -- even if it is invested solely in 
government-guaranteed bonds -- does not slowly rise like the value of your 
savings account. The value of this investment rises and falls with the going 
market price for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 How could a government bond be worth less than what you paid? If inflation or 
interest rates rise, the market value of bonds drops because investors have 
better options. In other words, why pay $1,000 for an old Treasury bond that 
pays 6% interest when you can get a new Treasury bond that pays 7%? If you want 
to sell that 6% bond, chances are you could only get $900 for it today. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the government will eventually pay back the full $1,000 does 
nothing to compensate you for your $100 trading loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investments also boast some insurance. In the event of a brokerage 
failure, the Securities Industry Protection Corp. will step in to guarantee 
payment of cash and securities of up to $500,000 per account. (Only $100,000 
can be in cash.) Does that mean you can't lose by buying stock? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The SIPC guarantee is really a guarantee against fraud. Let's say your 
brokerage fails after a broker takes off with all the cash and securities held 
in customer accounts. If you can show that you had $50,000 in cash and 200 
shares of IBM stock, the SIPC will step in and make sure that the cash and 
securities you entrusted to that brokerage firm are returned to you. But the 
SIPC does not protect you from bad investment decisions. If you bought IBM at 
$120 and it now sells for $60, the SIPC isn't going to compensate you for your 
$60 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Annuities are also insured, but not by the federal government. Insurance 
products are backed by state-run guarantee associations that generally promise 
to compensate you for all or part of your loss in the event your insurer fails. 
It's impossible to generalize about insurance guarantees, however, because the 
guarantees vary based on the type of insurance product you buy and where you 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 Some state-guaranteed funds promise to pay up to $100,000 on annuities and up 
to $300,000 in death benefits. Others guarantee more -- or substantially less. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the best insurance guarantees are less attractive than the guarantees 
for bank deposits. That's because insurance guarantee funds generally do not 
have the money to pay you right away. 
</P>
<P>
 If your insurer fails, they will step in and try to determine the total loss. 
Next they'll contact other insurers still operating in your state and ask them 
to kick in some money to pay you off. Healthy insurers agree to do this because 
they want people to feel safe about investing in insurance products. But the 
payoffs don't come quickly. In many cases, such as when Executive Life 
Insurance Co. failed three years ago, it takes several years for customers to 
get their money.

CONSULTANTS HELP COMPANIES NAVIGATE AD AGENCY MAZE; ADVERTISING: FIRMS ARE 
SAVING TIME, MONEY BY PAYING REVIEW EXPERTS TO THIN THE FIELD OF ADVERTISERS 
AND THEN NEGOTIATE TOUGH DEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Advertising directors used to go to the dance alone. Now they're taking 
chaperons. 
</P>
<P>
 When they choose agencies to handle their advertising dollars, companies as 
diverse as HomeBase do-it-yourself stores, the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain and 
health care provider PacifiCare are increasingly doing so through consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen a review lately that hasn't used a consultant in some form," 
said William Bryan, president of WBA Inc., a management and marketing 
consultant in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are willing to spend as much as $60,000 a shot for the services of 
review consultants. Their aim is to save time and, ultimately, money. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants negotiate contracts that generally set the ad agency's 
commission at 8% to 12% of what the client spends, said Mike Agate, president 
of Select Resources International in West Hollywood. Until recently, 15% was 
the industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
 While the consensus is that increased competition, client savvy and the 
recession were contributing to shrinkage of the 15%, review consultants "have 
nagged at it," said H.E. McDonald, a Rancho Palos Verdes consultant who 
specializes in ad agency compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are merely middlemen, the consultants can "be nasty, walk away 
and save a bundle" for the client, said Alan Gottesman, an analyst with 
investment company PaineWebber Inc. in New York. "The client can't be nasty" to 
prospective ad agencies, Gottesman said, "because whoever he picks he's got to 
live with." 
</P>
<P>
 Review consultants guide their clients through the maze of advertising 
services available. Then they negotiate contracts for the specific services 
that a company wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advertising industry is fragmenting, and it's hard to keep up with who's 
out there doing the best work," said Agate, whose company is one of the 
better-known review consultants in Southern California. "We know." 
</P>
<P>
 One-stop full-service agencies, which used to count on winning 80% of a 
typical company's advertising budget, now are lucky to garner 30%, said Fred 
Zandpour, a professor of communications at Cal State Fullerton. The rest goes 
to direct marketers, researchers and firms that buy air time and print space 
for a company's advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rules are changing," Zandpour said. "Any time that happens, you want to 
bring in some fresh blood, an outside perspective. I wouldn't be surprised to 
see more and more consultants involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Review consultants appeared on the scene five or six years ago in Chicago, New 
York and Paris. They have been gaining popularity on the West Coast in the past 
two years and now handle about 20% of account reviews nationally, McDonald and 
others say. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a big enough share to give the consultants considerable clout. "Anybody 
who doesn't figure that out within 20 minutes doesn't deserve to be in this 
business," said one principal of a major Los Angeles advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Most consultants charge the client a fee for the review. The amount is 
typically determined by the size of the client's budget and by the time 
required to conduct a search. Some consultants have a minimum fee. Agate also 
charges ad agencies a fee to be listed with his company. 
</P>
<P>
 Though consultants say they examine all options for their clients, they have 
their biases, agencies say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a consultant doesn't think highly of you, you're automatically excluded," 
said Bruce Silverman, president of Los Angeles advertising agency Asher/Gould. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these consultants, in one way or another, have a stable of agencies 
they're familiar with," said Silverman, whose company competed for but failed 
to win the Carl's Jr. account. 
</P>
<P>
 Familiarity, though it may limit the field, brings efficiency for both sides. 
And that is one reason for the growing popularity of consultants, said Leonard 
Pearlstein, president of ad agency Lord, Dentsu & Partners in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are really busy," said Pearlstein, whose agency won HomeBase's 
business. "That's why consultants are taking more and more of a role." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Orange County companies hiring consultants have included 
Clothestime, Secure Horizons, Mazda's now-defunct Amati division, National 
Education Centers, Children's Hospital of Orange County Thrift Stores and 
Western Financial Savings Bank. Most of them have annual ad budgets ranging 
from $5 million to $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeBase, headquartered in Irvine, hired a review consultant in August after 
its low-key Stick Man TV campaign, created by Colby Agency in Los Angeles, 
failed to reverse the company's profit decline. 
</P>
<P>
 David R. Kenshol, HomeBase's vice president for marketing and advertising, 
said he did not want to take the time required to hear pitches from all 60 or 
70 agencies that could be expected to show interest in the company's 
multimillion-dollar account. He chose Mike Agate as his middleman. 
</P>
<P>
 With Agate's help, HomeBase narrowed its list to 18 candidates, each of which 
completed in-depth questionnaires. Kenshol then interviewed nine of those and 
selected four to make full presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a 14-week process, Kenshol said, which is not unusual. But the amount 
of time he devoted to it was greatly diminished. "I spent one or two weeks' 
time" over the 14 weeks, he said. "Normally, I might have spent 10 to 12 weeks 
of my time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, Dentsu & Partners won the business. Agency President Pearlstein would 
not reveal details of the contract, but did say that he considers the 
compensation fair. 
</P>
<P>
 He likes working with consultants, Pearlstein said, because they "help clients 
focus on their key priorities. . . . We get an earlier picture of what the 
business involves and whether we'd be right for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all agencies are so willing, however, to accept the consultants' terms.  
</P>
<P>
 Chiat/Day, renowned for its Energizer Bunny campaign, pulled out of the Carl's 
Jr. review, citing compensation issues. The agency, based in Venice, did not 
return telephone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles Turpin, head of the agency that won the fast-food company's account, 
conceded that "consultants are tough on costs." However, said Turpin, who is 
chairman of Grey Advertising in Los Angeles, "most consultants come out of the 
agency business, and they realize that an agency has to make a profit too." 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant for the Carl's Jr. review was Michael W. Marsak, owner of 
Effective Marketing Strategies Inc. in Marina del Rey. His introductory letter 
identifies him as a proponent of "incentive-based compensation" and "direct 
accountability" -- phrases designed to appeal to the recession-racked retail 
companies that are his specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 The job demands enterprise. Marsak, formerly an executive in the Los Angeles 
office of ad giant J. Walter Thompson, says he rises at 4 a.m. weekdays and 
works half a day on Saturday and Sunday to keep in touch with 250 companies he 
considers potential clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a successful consultant, you have to reap and sow every day," Marsak. "I 
contact them long before they need me." 
</P>
<P>
 Such activity limits the new business prospecting that an ad agency can do, 
for a client inclined to use a consultant will not be open to direct approaches 
-- the consultant is the gatekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher/Gould's Silverman said that, each January, he makes a list of about 20 
companies he would like to court as clients. "The use of consultants, to a 
degree, negates that," he said. Instead, "it becomes very important for me to 
know a Mike Marsak or a Mike Agate." 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of a consultant, however, does not always guarantee a speedy 
process. Secure Horizons, the senior division of Cypress-based PacifiCare 
Health Systems Inc., has had a $10-million account in review since May. 
</P>
<P>
 The review was being handled by review consultant Don Dorward, principal of 
Dorward & Associates in Oakland. An agency had been chosen, a PacifiCare 
official said, and the review would have been completed last month except that 
the parent company decided at the last minute to seek a new agency for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare Advertising Manager Ellen Santoni, who joined the company in 
October, hired WBA Inc. in Rancho Santa Margarita to finish contract 
negotiations for Secure Horizons and to conduct the PacifiCare review. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timing became critical because of some other factors in our business," 
Santoni said. "With health care changing every five seconds, it's good to have 
someone who is keeping up with the agencies -- who's moving, who's stable, 
who's had a shift in philosophy."

 Real Estate Loans Rise: Orange County bucked a Southern California trend last 
year by posting a small gain in real estate lending. 
</P>
<P>
 Dataquick Information Systems in La Jolla said Friday that $30.8 billion in 
real estate loans were made in the county last year, up 1.7% from 1992's $30.3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Southern California real estate lending was down 1.8% for the year. 
For the state as a whole, lending was up 3.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 The $274 billion loaned statewide last year set a record and was "good news 
for the economy," said Dataquick, "as during the past few months we've seen 
more and more buyers come into the market."

REAL ESTATE INVESTOR PLEADS GUILTY TO BANK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard J. Meyer, accused of looting a failed savings and loan, pleaded guilty 
Friday to bank fraud and misusing bank funds in return for a five-year federal 
prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer, 57, admitted to what prosecutors said was a "wide-ranging scheme" to 
use Cal America Savings & Loan Assn. in the Bay Area city of Walnut Creek "as 
his personal piggy bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the millions of dollars in deposits that prosecutors said Meyer 
siphoned from his thrift ended up in his real estate projects around Orange 
County such as Anaheim Civic Center Plaza, the Fullerton Business Center and 
Imperial Saturn Business Park in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 When federal regulators took over Cal America in 1986, it had a deficit of $83 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, the deficit had jumped to $110 million, two-thirds of which was 
attributable to bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The government got much of that money back by selling the thrift and some of 
the real estate the thrift had wound up owning. But Meyer or companies he had 
an interest in still owed Cal America $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the government indicted Meyer, who lives in Los Angeles, on 14 
counts of fraud and misusing thrift funds. Among the allegations: That he 
swindled the thrift he owned from 1983 to 1986 of $114,000 for a Rolls-Royce; a 
$25,000 monthly operating bill for an airplane; and $376,000 to pay his ex-wife 
to decorate his offices. 
</P>
<P>
 He had faced a sentence of up to 70 years in prison and a fine of up to $2.6 
million on all 14 counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plea bargain, Meyer also admitted to a second count charging him 
with using $1 million of depositors' funds to pay off a debt to Union Bank in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In averting a trial, Meyer agreed to serve five years in prison and five years 
of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer has already paid $1.5 million to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to 
settle a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer also agreed to open his personal financial records; if he has more money 
than he contended at the time when he settled the civil suit, the government 
can go after more of his money for restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer also owns a stake in Anaheim's Pacific Inland Bank, where he was 
chairman; he resigned after being indicted in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said he now runs a real estate company called Meyer Asset 
Management in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer's lawyer said Friday that his client would have no comment.

BETTER LEFT UNSAID?; NOT DISCUSSING RACE MAY ALLOW US TO AVOID UNPLEASANT 
SITUATIONS. BUT SOME WONDER IF WE CAN EVER MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT CONFRONTING OUR 
FEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are no manuals. No widely syndicated columns offering tried-and-true 
advice, no well-worn para digms from which to trace a trail. If Thomas Brothers 
commissioned a clear map of the territory, retail-outlets -- the country and 
world over -- would struggle to keep it on the racks. 
</P>
<P>
 Many wander through this maze -- foggy as it is forbidding -- and it often 
seems impossible to find the way out. Stumbling free, one hopes never to repeat 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the well-meaning attempts to build bridges, the discussion of race 
remains, even now, taboo -- off-limits like personal finance queries or 
religious discussions among strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Race is the crashing crystal at the well-appointed dinner party at dusk. The 
only difference is that, afterward, seldom does anyone offer to help clean up 
the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco's North Beach, shortly after 5 p.m., five women install 
themselves at a cocktail table. The drink is wine; the topic, women's issues. 
Conversation blooms surprisingly exploratory, commensurately emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 One shares details of her rape, more than a dozen years past. The others are 
compassionate, holding the speaker protectively in their collective gaze. 
Until, that is, she mentions that her attacker was black. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversation careens into a wall of silence. Eyes shift to goings-on outside 
or are suddenly transfixed to the table's water rings. The women -- two black, 
three white -- shift in their seats until one voice (a black woman's) gingerly 
pulls them from silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt prickly all over my body. I felt slapped, personally chastised for 
bringing it up," says the woman, who is white. The experience has permanently 
altered the way she tells the tale. Since it was never discussed, she can only 
ponder the details, the roots of silence: 
</P>
<P>
 "My perception was that the discomfort was about something I said. I guess 
they felt that I was feeding a stereotype." Not harboring race-based 
resentment, she says, she was simply blindly grabbing at details, filling in 
the picture. "I made (all the women) uncomfortable and I felt bad for bringing 
it up. It had the effect," she says with a leaden laugh, "of the sinking of the 
Titanic." 
</P>
<P>
 Altering a few details, this scenario is probably uncomfortably familiar. 
Maybe you were there, maybe you spoke the words. Or maybe you were on the 
receiving end. If so, you've probably had time to ponder the possible outcomes 
and decide which is worse: A storm of words or a blanket of silence? 
</P>
<P>
 Slogans of peace and harmony that haunt the recent past ring hollow, sometimes 
inspiring a cynical chuckle. The reticence to broach matters of race and have 
adult -- and, quite possibly, charged -- discussions only underscores a 
nation's failings and the arduous work ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inability to talk about race in anything resembling honest terms 
compounds the very misunderstanding that renders silence necessary," writes 
Ellis Cose, contributing editor and essayist for Newsweek, in his book "The 
Rage of a Privileged Class." 
</P>
<P>
 "For those blacks and whites who come into closest contact, it stands as a 
huge barrier to their ever truly accepting one another or finding common 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a tumbleweed, the subject of race gathers all sorts of cast-aside 
delicate issues in the course of its travels: class or privilege, or an exact 
definition of who and what is racist. People prefer not to have that tense, if 
not unpleasant conversation. Instead we walk in circles; talk in metaphors. The 
avoidance at times is as intricate and showy as a modern dance phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no social graces when race is concerned," says Patricia D. Johnson, 
35, a counselor who specializes in interracial/multicultural issues. "I know 
when I walk in a room and start talking about it, people bounce off the walls 
or the room goes silent. But I realize that is so unconscious. . . . People 
just are so afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear manifests in various guises, finds roots in fertile ground. There is 
fear of committing a faux pas; fear of the consequential reprimand -- just for 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
 And some feel most uncomfortable tackling the subject in racially or 
ethnically mixed groups, fearful they lack not just the knowledge, but the 
language to do so as well. In his collection of essays, "Race Matters," 
professor and theologian Cornel West says most Americans "remain trapped in the 
narrow framework of the dominant liberal and conservative views of race in 
America, which with its worn-out vocabulary leaves us intellectually 
debilitated, morally disempowered and personally depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Still others ponder whether they may harbor deep-seated racism that might leap 
from their lips at an inopportune moment, or that a comment may not be 
perceived as "politically correct" enough. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more often, well-meaning souls are afraid to step into that fraught 
arena, Johnson has found. For some, the tentativeness is so great, they 
subconsciously choose not to address, let alone recognize, the matter. Rather, 
they deny its very existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just really scary to talk about it," Johnson says, "because emotions run 
so high when you do. I (see people) going out and attempting to do 
(race-related) work who still have some reservations about dealing with the 
subject. The repercussions can be a strong incentive not to touch the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are days where I don't want to deal with it. It's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the dramatic sidestepping, it's easy to lose sight of 
precisely what is being avoided, what needs be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the necessity for dialogue about race deals with enhancing one's 
education and broadening a social or professional circle. It requires working 
to demystify the "other" through contact and education, thus shattering blindly 
accepted stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the level of anxiety over even broaching the subject, the solutions 
aren't as unfathomable as they might seem. Bridging the chasm mostly requires a 
little patience and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could really move (the discussion) forward," says performance artist and 
gay activist Luis Alfaro, "but that only happens when you take that mask down. 
We come to this thing with very mixed feelings about language, about community. 
. . . (You) have to hear people talk about resentment . . . about rage and 
anger. We're not going to get over that unless we are going to deal with those 
things. And there really isn't any criteria for this." 
</P>
<P>
 For some Angelenos, April 29, 1992, served as an impetus. Not waiting until 
the smoke cleared, the events of three days forced the issues of race and class 
not simply to the front page, but to the dinner table, cocktail party and 
locker room as well. For some, it made it that much more difficult to formulate 
questions and opinions; for others, it provoked a long-couched dialogue -- 
often for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 Others believe that the avoidance of this abstract, now given flesh-and-bone 
import, is lodged somewhere at the root of what turned into L.A.'s -- pick your 
term -- civil unrest, riots, disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 The feelings that lie behind the language we use (or choose not to) are 
clouded by a patina of euphemism. Forced to look at our inadequate language, at 
insensitive jokes and sarcasm often standing in place of probing conversations 
about issues of difference, it is difficult to predict a future trajectory. 
Rhetoric and platitudes are easy. But can they bring about change? 
</P>
<P>
 The old routes are well-traveled, and those most accustomed to them take their 
directions by reading the winds. Silence, and the codes embroidered within it, 
have long dominated. We have become conversant in signs that masquerade as 
language. Some call it antennae, others say it's common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember this one guy, whose name was John. He was white," says Byron 
Bonner, 34, an African American who grew up in L.A. "The only thing that John 
and I had in common was that we liked to build model cars. It was cool for him 
to come over to my house. . . . But me going over to his house? No. I had to 
sneak into his bedroom window." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner says they never discussed the ritual, and he never questioned it. Nor 
did he examine how he felt about it: "His parents didn't like black people. . . 
. I don't know why or how (I knew). Anytime you have to crawl through the 
bedroom window, that pretty much lets you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner has long since abandoned silence. He found that by not addressing 
issues when they arose, his anger grew into something larger, more difficult to 
define. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial slurs or sloppy assumptions about "just who and what is black" prompted 
him, instead, to fortify his walls: "In college, I was 'Mr. Militant' . . . 
(now I realize) I could have handled it a lot better, instead of walking around 
evangelizing and preaching. I was really . . . pissed off." 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing pride and tolerance, a mellowed Bonner believes, is an education 
unto itself. And deciding when to don the teacher's mantle when it comes to the 
issues of race takes more than social savvy. It takes, he says, a diplomat's 
skills: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not shy about raising it if it needs to be. And it really is about 
educating people who don't really know a lot. There is intentional (racism) and 
there is stupidity. . . . I don't claim to know all the answers. I know what I 
know. And it all depends: Do I feel like telling these people what I know? Do I 
feel like arguing with them when they challenge my knowledge?" 
</P>
<P>
 This enervating process, Bonner notes, doesn't ensure plaudits: "I can't 
remember the last time . . . when I walked away feeling, 'I think that person 
really learned something.' At this age, I think people pretty much are set in 
their beliefs and all you can do is try to . . . catch them in an open-minded 
moment. . . . (But) if it's not a high priority it won't get done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people know what to do. They're just too lazy to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the wager is far too high: emotional fireworks, public embarrassment 
or loss of a friendship. People of color say they find themselves exhausted by 
the effort of explaining, while many whites fear saying something that will 
brand them racist -- forever. 
</P>
<P>
 At 28, Marcus Kuiland-Nazario, of Puerto Rican descent, feels frustrated by 
the psychological impasse: "Even though I have white friends, I feel as though 
there is a wall between us that will never come down." 
</P>
<P>
 When race-charged issues arise, he also saves his words for those he believes 
will truly hear: "I have some white friends who are aware. Some of them 
understand. And there are others (with whom) I know it is pointless to discuss 
these issues . . . because they are so myopic. But I don't want to just 'preach 
it to the choir' either." 
</P>
<P>
 This selective approach, however, doesn't stop him from honing in on 
particularly egregious remarks, then administering something a bit more severe 
than a verbal wrist-tapping. "People of color (are) going to talk about this 
now . . . like it or not," he says. "And the dominant culture is not used to us 
speaking up." 
</P>
<P>
 Such confrontations, Kuiland-Nazario notes, are more often than not met with 
hostility, defensiveness and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it is often impossible to quell the rage and move to reasoning, 
he says: "(People) get really angry because I'm challenging a belief that 
they've held for most of their lives. . . . It's like I'm telling them that 
they are never going to get married, or that they are never going to have an 
orgasm again. . . . People are just really angry. People don't like to be 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Essayist Pearl Cleage calls them "weird race moments" -- the almost tangible 
limbo that exists between instantaneously regrettable words and the dreaded 
reaction. One minute that feels like five hours, or a bomb that blasts in a 
nanosecond. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Fitch can't forget hers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember going to my first sleep-away at 'Y' camp. I must have been a 
second-grader," says Fitch, 38. "You know how kids make fantasy games . . . I 
was into exotica at that time, Cleopatra movies . . . and I remember telling a 
girl whose bunk was above mine, 'Let's play Cleopatra. I'll be the queen and 
you'll be the slave.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She, a black girl, hit the roof (and shouted) 'I'm not your slave!' I had a 
moment of epiphany. Gee, I was really sorry. Because my conception of 'the 
slave' was someone with a fan. . . . I certainly never put it together. . . . 
And that was a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who grew up near the Crenshaw District and now counsels teen-agers at 
Foshay Junior High, says she's still cautious wandering down certain avenues of 
conversation: "They (the administrators) say to 'try and talk to kids about 
their feelings,' but I'm very . . . hesitant to talk to them about race. I 
don't know about the theories or the current philosophy of how 'politically 
correct' people deal with the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (student body) is just black and Chicano, and we never do talk about 
race, because I'm very conscious of being this white person, 'coming down' to 
help. I am helping these kids . . . but as somebody who was raised in the '60s, 
the image of the 'white bleeding-heart liberal' going down to the 'ghetto' to 
help these 'poor kids,' was drummed into me at the time as so offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 The whirlwind that has developed around race, without the language to explore 
it, has rendered people not just cautious, but silent, too timid to take risks 
or wander out on a limb. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an element in the black community that is very anti-white," Fitch 
notes, "and there is an element that says, 'Let's more than get along, let's 
see where the other is coming from. . . . But as a liberal white person, you 
never know whether you will be appreciated, tolerated or they wished you'd 
stayed home." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, she says, "You don't know unless you do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch believes that 1992's civil disturbances served to rebuild, as well as to 
reinforce urban fear, the after-images wreaking havoc on interpersonal 
dialogue: "I think nobody expected that it would have such a long-term negative 
reverberation on people who had been doing pretty well. That fear element came 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 It simply has added another complex layer to an already prickly matter. 
Listening to people unwittingly make sweeping generalizations about different 
races, she says, makes one ask: "Has this generated a new emotion or is it 
uncovering an emotion that was always there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although priming discussions about race initially may be difficult, they're 
almost impossible to quell once they've gathered steam. Endless anecdotes 
unfold. One memory births three. Although it may begin with a hesitant stutter 
or a couched inquiry, there seems to be a real desire to try to get things 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 This basic inability to talk affects the real work, just as backstage concern 
moved out of the abstract for those at Rebuild L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a society where we define politeness in a way that encourages 
avoidance," says Jackie Dupont-Walker, 47, RLA's senior project director and 
manager of urban development/housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it is impolite to confront a reality that may be unpleasant for a moment, 
even if we realize that it might bring us to a better situation ultimately. I 
think it's very difficult in L.A., where there is such a large number of 
subcultures, for us to really avoid it without creating problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Not recognizing and discussing differences, and not addressing flagrant acts 
or remarks, she says, is precisely what has lowered the volume on discourse: 
"So, for example, if I'm in a work setting and somebody happens to say 
something that is particularly insensitive to me as a black person, I don't 
make them feel uncomfortable by pointing it out. I just kind of go along and 
say later how awful it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are ways to deal with that. And yes, there might be a moment of 
discomfort. But what we're talking about is creating the kind of sensitivities 
that (will help us) learn to respect and love each other differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Dupont-Walker looks at RLA as a microcosm, its membership -- like the city's 
populace -- realizing that these long-cordoned-off zones of difference must be 
examined. A community could not mend physically unless attention was paid to 
its spiritual welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we had a Racial Harmony Task Force that was fairly diverse," she says. 
"(In) their initial days, they found they had to deal with personal pain before 
they could deal with community pain. Some people were not willing to go through 
the personal pain. So while a large number of people signed up, when they 
started to deal with those kinds of issues, people tended to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonia Hernandez, 45, a task force co-chairwoman, recalls the arduous process 
of scaling interpersonal walls: "People we're sort of posturing in the 
beginning . . . finger-pointing, playing (their) roles. But unless we went 
beyond the posturing, the committee wouldn't exist. The (task force) wasn't 
going to be a vehicle for just a lot of haranguing. We had to respect one 
another and listen, no matter how out-to-lunch you thought someone was." 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian community "felt very hurt, the African American community felt hurt. 
We just kept working together. . . . We tried to listen to all of the anger and 
really talk . . . to respect and understand the difference," she says. "I don't 
know where RLA is going as an institution, (but) I do know that there are more 
people with goodwill in L.A. The city needs to deal with this issue. We are the 
most multicultural community in the world. And if we don't make it here, we 
won't make it anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Dupont-Walker allows that the task force is not unlike many other bicultural 
dialogues that optimistically started up, then ultimately lost their thunder: 
</P>
<P>
 "Having participated in some of them, I am of the opinion that they refused to 
deal with the tough issues. I think we have this history of setting up 
something that appears to accomplish a goal, without really struggling with the 
goal. . . . When we got to those issues that were troublesome, we tended to run 
away from them." 
</P>
<P>
 The real question, says Larry Fondation, 36, of the South Central Organizing 
Committee, is whether you can move from just talking about issues to action. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the city's diversity, it seems silly not to confront race issues, says 
Fondation, who is white but often finds himself speaking to black and Latino 
congregations, preaching the import of various grass-roots issues -- from 
housing to liquor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to be conscious and sensitive of how I'm dealing with people. And I 
don't always succeed," he says. "You just try just to continue to be open, and 
ask other people to be the same in return." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, he believes, there is "sort of automatic comfort being around others 
of the same background. But it isn't realistic. The city will be largely Latino 
and there are those . . . who are not looking at that. So when people ask me . 
. . what I'm doing here, I tell them I think (these issues) affect all of us. 
If I can (communicate) that successfully, I do it. If I can't, I'll move on. 
And try to find somebody else to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 For others also attempting to forge coalitions, mining for the common bond is 
often bandied as the glue. The push is to connect similarities rather than 
linger over the differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Alfaro, however, warns against blind idealism. 
</P>
<P>
 A common bond doesn't always ensure unity, especially if racial and cultural 
issues are swept into the corners. A member of the Gay Men of Color Consortium, 
Alfaro, 32, says he too was initially much more idealistic: "I thought we were 
going to create this sort of very interesting rainbow, (but) what's been really 
apparent to me is our differences. I think we know what the common goals are. 
But we don't know how to talk to each other. It's really, really hard to talk 
and not offend, and to stay conscious. And you cannot come into it with all of 
this baggage." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the riots, he has also noted a growing cavalierism, a sort of verbal 
countercurrent that devilishly plays fast and loose with the subjects of race 
and culture. But this strain of candor isn't always constructive, he says, and 
the bulk of it is informed racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the time to heal," says Alfaro, wincing at the cliche. "It is the 
time to bring it out in the open, lay your cards on the table. But really, it 
hasn't been that at all. It's been people sorta laying their racism on the 
table." 
</P>
<P>
 Racism's sting aside, he says, the communication process brings enough pain: 
"You can't make the opera if you don't start with the street theater. And the 
process of understanding each other, and negotiating each other, sort of gets 
thrown by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Activists are offended by the lack of process. We're just supposed to love 
each other, we're supposed to just understand each other and the truth is that 
it is just a very complex issue . . . and when you start to get into those 
territories, you really have to start to figure out all those little things 
that come into play. Expression is not a very valued commodity. And until then, 
'proper expression' -- whatever that is -- is not going to be allowed to come 
to fulfillment." 
</P>
<P>
 Counselor Patricia Johnson says that fulfillment -- with all its rosy 
connotations -- comes from raising the shade of denial. She hopes to help 
people face fear and anger, to uncover what lies beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those who really want to try and understand and open up . . . I try and 
start to help people deal with their own emotions -- the anger, their own 
rage," she says. "I just allow them to talk about their experience . . . to 
express how they feel, because I really don't believe that unless we are 
willing to look at our own stuff, we can't go out and point a finger." 
</P>
<P>
 Once people identify the roots of the more dramatic emotions, then sift 
through what is indeed a racial issue and what is personal, it is easier to 
disengage from the conflicts when they arise, she says: "Some people are easier 
to move there than others. And I don't move them. It's their willingness to 
move. I think people really do want to have intelligent, informed conversations 
about these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Some think the solution is a conundrum for children to ponder; others look to 
the sages. But much of it, most agree, will come from breaking out of 
self-segregation, wandering unfamiliar territories. At the heart is 
understanding the pain of the process and the importance of forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all need education," says Phyllis Moberly, 44, a local publicist. "If I 
make a faux pas, what I wish is that the person I am talking to could have some 
faith in my goodwill and take the opportunity to educate me -- even if it is 
with some anger. . . . I live in fear of saying something stupid or that's 
going to hurt someone's feelings. I don't want to do that. But what happens . . 
. is that it makes it easier not to even try." 
</P>
<P>
 Moberly, who is white, speaks of constructing bridges as an antidote to 
uneasiness. "I think that people need to find a context, a place where they are 
involved with people of other cultures. . . . Some sort of community or 
artistic event . . . where you have a reason to become acquainted with . . . 
people, so conversation can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Fitch says people don't have to go to Florence and Normandie to contact 
the "black community": 
</P>
<P>
 "You have more in common with people who are in the same neighborhood or who 
have the same interests as you. To go down to Martin Luther King and Vermont 
and say: 'Here I am, I want to be friends with you!' . . . is a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 Because opportunities tend to shrink as one matures, broadening one's 
monochromatic circle can take a little work and lots of creativity. The first 
attempts more than likely will be awkward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race thing is not unknown waters. It's just a tiny effort," Fitch 
assures. But a half-hearted effort is easily unmasked: "Just going to a black 
club isn't going to change you in any way. I know people who have more than a 
little problem with racism in their head or . . . (who say) 'I marched in the 
race day parade, but I still don't have a black friend who I can have a beer 
with.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One of L.A.'s premiums, says Anjali Raval, "is that you can actually live 
someone's culture without leaving the country." Raval, an Indian born in Kenya, 
is experienced in cracking cultural codes and understanding the importance of 
racial sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't hesitate to ask questions and I would hope that nobody's hesitant to 
ask me," says Raval, 28. "I don't put out a vibe that I would be offended if 
anybody asked me what the dot on my forehead or my nose ring means. There's a 
difference between being ignorant and just innocently not knowing." 
</P>
<P>
 What knowledge cannot be attained through interpersonal communication and 
experience is thus left to other, larger channels. That too takes a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the media has been fanning this fire for a long time," Marcus 
Kuiland-Nazario says. "And media (needs) to be responsible -- for real. Not 
that hogwash '60s stuff. Not a two-minute (public service announcement). But a 
town hall meeting with Clinton up there." 
</P>
<P>
 He admits that he holds no easy answers, "but I am here to push the button 
real hard. There are other people who need to do their work. I think everybody 
needs to make a commitment to try to change things." 
</P>
<P>
 Each day we walk out the door, he says, "we put ourselves out on the limb. I 
think if you are going to enter this dialogue, it's not about your 
expectations. You have to just see what happens . . . be open to the 
experience. And it's a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of our time."

MIRACLE MUSCLES; UCI RESEARCHERS SEEK A PILL TO MANIPULATE GROWTH AND STIMULATE 
BRAWN WITHOUT EXERCISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pump iron for a month and, presto, your muscles get stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 Take to your La-Z-Boy for a month and your muscles go soft. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows this happens, but no one knows exactly why. Why should you have 
to work to keep your muscles in shape? Why can't you relax and take a pill that 
duplicates two hours at the gym? 
</P>
<P>
 The surprising answer is: One may be on the way. Depending on which scientist 
you ask, it's just around the corner or it's 40 years away. But researchers 
agree they are closing in on the most basic, biological processes by which 
muscles decide whether to become stronger or weaker, quicker or slower. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers are already beginning to manipulate the process. One chemical 
administered to laboratory rats duplicates some effects of daily workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean that someday couch potatoes can look like Arnold 
Schwarzenegger? Probably not, says Kenneth M. Baldwin, professor of physiology 
and biophysics at UC Irvine and a leading researcher in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does mean that the muscles of people with cancer and AIDS may not 
become so debilitated. And it might mean that ordinary people, who typically 
become sedentary and start weakening around age 60, can enjoy a stronger, less 
accident-prone old age. 
</P>
<P>
 But first in line to benefit are the people who have paid for so much of the 
research: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the early days of space flight, they and their Russian colleagues have 
been trying to prevent the weakened muscles caused by the zero gravity of 
space. Early Soviet cosmonauts, the first to be aloft for long periods, 
sometimes could not even stand up after returning to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial-and-error experiments with muscle-taxing space suits and exercise 
equipment have yielded only slight gains. Baldwin -- who has a 10-year NASA 
research grant and serves on three NASA science advisory committees -- and 
other researchers have taken a different approach. They are studying how 
muscles work at their most basic level in hopes of isolating the process that 
keeps human muscles strong so they can duplicate it with safe drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they are closing in. 
</P>
<P>
 They have discovered that muscles react not only to the amount of stress 
placed on them but to the type of stress, rapid or slow. Somehow these 
distinctions are transmitted to the genes in muscle cells, which then produce 
the appropriate kinds of muscle fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 The muscles become not only stronger or weaker but can change their very 
character. They may switch, say, from muscles with stamina and efficiency to 
muscles that provide short bursts of power and speed. Muscle research today is 
concentrating on just what signals make these changes take place, and, to find 
the answers, researchers are looking down to the level of the muscles' 
molecules. 
</P>
<P>
 You know what your muscles look like if you have ever examined a beefsteak. 
They are not a solid mass but a dense package of thin, fleshy layers. 
</P>
<P>
 View one of these layers through a very high-powered microscope and you can 
see the actual engines of the muscle -- the millions upon millions of muscle 
filaments. Each is composed of short chains of protein molecules called myosin 
and actin, which together provide all of the muscle's movement and force.  
</P>
<P>
 The actin chain lies atop the myosin chain like a sliding hatch. When the 
muscle fiber is relaxed, the hatch lies "open," and the two chains are at their 
greatest combined length. But when the myosin receives the power command, it 
pulls the hatch "closed." That shortens the combined length of the two chains 
and provides the filament's tiny share of the muscle's contraction. 
</P>
<P>
 This filament's force is all or nothing, Baldwin says. It always applies the 
same amount at the same speed. Equivalent types of filaments are identical in 
Michael Jordan and Mother Theresa. But there the resemblance ends. 
</P>
<P>
 The filaments are bundled into muscle fibers about the size and shape of a 
thin hair a few millimeters to a few centimeters long. Jordan's fibers are 
perhaps twice as thick as Mother Theresa's, because physical conditioning and 
the male hormone testosterone have added more filaments for additional 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 to 500 fibers are wrapped together like a package of spaghetti to 
form a "motor unit," the smallest muscle unit that can be controlled 
individually. When Jordan shoots a basketball, his brain calculates just how 
many and which motor units are required in various muscles and activates only 
them. If the calculation is correct, Jordan scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Your genes may not have endowed you with a professional athlete's muscle 
makeup, but you make similar calculations every time you lift a box or open a 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 The brain's orders reach the muscles because a nerve from each motor unit is 
plugged into the spinal cord like a telephone plugged into a wall socket. But 
unlike the telephone, if you unplug the muscle, it still works. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is that muscles take orders from more than the brain, Baldwin says. 
Some nerves from motor units go to the spinal cord and up to the brain, but 
others loop back and connect to other motor units, to the skin and to other 
body tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 Through these loop-back circuits, muscles and skin can communicate among 
themselves, allowing muscles to react faster than the brain can. The classic 
example is touching a hot surface. Your skin sounds the alarm, and the muscles 
pull your hand away before the news even reaches your brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar, routine reactions are happening in your body every waking instant. 
The fact that you can, without thinking, stand on two legs or hold your head 
erect is due to direct communication among muscles assigned to oppose gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some tasks are easier to do if you keep your brain out of it. 
Cocktail servers are taught to balance their drinks on a tray supported by the 
palm of one hand and to avoid watching it. Even the most top-heavy trays rarely 
spill, because the arm and hand muscles balance the tray continually and 
automatically. But start watching the tray and the brain will almost always 
over-correct and spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Such muscle communication can be incredibly sophisticated. Cats that have lost 
all nerve communication between brain and legs can still walk on a treadmill 
with only the slightest loss of coordination, Baldwin says. 
</P>
<P>
 This back-door communication is the key to why our muscles change, Baldwin 
says. Through this system, signals flow to muscles and prompt quick 
adaptations. 
</P>
<P>
 Muscles can change because they are constantly being built and rebuilt, 
Baldwin says. In only seven to 14 days, half of the protein in your muscle 
cells has been broken down, discarded and replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if you had a contractor constantly tearing down the rooms in your 
house and rebuilding them with new materials," Baldwin says. "After a month, 
you've got a brand new house. Next month you'll have another brand new one." 
</P>
<P>
 What every body builder knows is that increased stress on muscles -- lifting 
more weight than you did last week -- somehow signals cells to build bigger, 
and therefore stronger, muscles. (Bigger muscles are always stronger, Baldwin 
says.) 
</P>
<P>
 But what more recent studies discovered is that a further change takes place. 
The character of the stress was changing the character of the muscle fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 Marathon runners were developing a type of slow-moving but high-stamina fiber, 
which was named Type I or "slow twitch." Sprinters and power lifters were 
developing a type of high-speed, high-output fiber -- a group called Type II or 
"fast twitch." 
</P>
<P>
 The typical person has half one type, half the other throughout the body. But 
when muscle cells are somehow informed of the type of unusual activity the 
muscle is performing -- slow-moving or fast, long-lasting or intense -- some 
muscle fibers change character to the appropriate type, Baldwin says. 
</P>
<P>
 The change begins quickly, according to Baldwin's research associate, Vince 
Caiozzo, assistant professor of orthopedics at UCI's College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have rats that pump iron. It sounds funny, but they aren't standing up 
curling weights. They take their feet and push against an object. The whole 
thing is computerized, so it can simulate every aspect of you going to the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have them do about two minutes of weight training a day, within two 
days we begin to see changes in the (muscle fiber types) they are producing." 
</P>
<P>
 Five of Baldwin's rats went up on a space shuttle in November to determine 
just what was happening to muscles in space. On their return, Baldwin 
discovered that being in zero gravity for 14 days had converted a large portion 
of their muscle fibers from Type I, which is particularly suited to opposing 
gravity, to Type II. 
</P>
<P>
 Muscles, freed from the effects of gravity, were merely adapting to their new 
environment, normally a good thing. "When they're up in space, they no longer 
need their legs to balance and control gravity," Baldwin says. "They can float 
around from one location to another with just fingertip force." 
</P>
<P>
 But astronauts return to Earth suddenly, where zero-gravity adaptation 
instantly becomes a liability. They found that not only were the muscles that 
helped them stand weakened, the nervous system that operated their muscles had 
become lazy in weightlessness. So had the astronauts' breathing and blood 
circulation systems. In some cases, the astronauts could not stand without 
fainting. 
</P>
<P>
 This is merely an inconvenience when returning to Earth. With the flight over, 
the astronauts can spend several days or even weeks to work back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 But it could be a major problem on a long mission to another planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's take Mars; that's where they plan to go next," Caiozzo said. "It's 
projected to take 1 1/2 years just to get there. The problem is, when they land 
on Mars (and once again encounter gravity), are they going to be able to 
function?" 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Baldwin says, exercise programs in space using treadmills, cycles and 
bungee cords have not solved the problem. The solution, he says, is more likely 
to be a combination of physical stress and drugs that either prevent the change 
in muscle fibers or deceive the muscle cells into thinking they've been 
exercising. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests on Baldwin's rats have shown that a chemical called beta 
guanidinopropionic acid acts to deplete muscles of a naturally occurring 
substance called phosphocreatin. Normally, this substance is used up when 
muscles work. Baldwin believes that artificially depleting it makes cells react 
as if the muscles had been through a workout. So far, rats have reacted to the 
chemical by converting some Type II muscle fibers to Type I fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing the thyroid hormone from circulation seems to block the conversion of 
muscle fiber that occurs in zero gravity, Baldwin says. This shows the process 
can be regulated chemically, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing or maintaining muscle size is a different matter, Baldwin says. 
Researchers believe that the simple brute force generated by muscles serves to 
signal how much muscle mass is needed. The muscle builds up or shrinks 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not been able to unlock a chemical that would act in place of force, 
but we think we have some clues," Baldwin says. A substance now available 
called insulin-like growth factor is being studied. It seems to work directly 
on muscle cells to increase their size, Baldwin says. Unlike steroids, the 
increase in size occurs without exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 (It appears that steroids only allow a person to exercise more strenuously; it 
is the increase in exercise that actually increases muscle size, Baldwin says. 
Steroids administered to a couch potato would probably have no muscle-building 
effect, but this has not been scientifically tested.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another researcher in the field, Frank Booth, professor of physiology at the 
University of Texas Medical School in Houston, believes the answer may be genes 
rather than drugs. Injecting certain genes into muscles like a vaccination 
could promote production of desired substances within the muscle that would 
maintain muscle fiber without exercise, he says. Something that could be used 
by human beings is only five to 10 years away, he estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm describing will be possible on a very limited scale for a very few 
people," Booth says. "I don't think it would be used by the normal population. 
It would probably be used very selectively. I think it would be costly and not 
applicable in all cases." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he adds, subsequent advances "may take it to the general public." 
</P>
<P>
 V. Reggie Edgerton, professor of physiological science at UCLA and another 
researcher in the field, says he is concentrating on the nervous system. It is 
already known that the efficiency of a body's nervous system plays a role in 
how much force its muscles can apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Within certain bounds, a person with smaller muscles but a better nervous 
system can be effectively stronger than the person with the opposite 
attributes. Edgerton and others say the typical person cannot voluntarily exert 
all the potential force of his or her muscles. But some scientists disagree, 
and the point remains controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgerton says the nervous system may by itself play a role in determining how 
muscles will change, but "we're pretty far away from knowing all the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Humans have been wanting to believe there's an easy way for a long time. Do 
you remember that book about how to stay fit with only 30 minutes of exercise a 
week? It stayed on the bestseller list for months. It just told everybody what 
they wanted to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10 years ago, muscle biologists thought every property of muscles was 
determined by the muscle's activity. Now it's now plain that's not true, 
Edgerton says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we could easily get to the point where we could minimize some of the 
negative effects of aging" by controlling the chemistry of muscle cells. 
Movement Mechanics 
</P>
<P>
 Muscles consist of bundles of fibers connected to the brain by nerves. The 
nerves carry chemical messages telling the muscles when to contract and how 
much exertion is needed. Almost all muscles move the bone connected to the 
joint just below the muscles affected. A look at the muscle system when the 
lower arm is raised: 
</P>
<P>
 Origin: Where muscle attaches to bone that does not move with each contraction 
of the biceps. 
</P>
<P>
 Muscle pairs: Biceps and triceps work together. As one contracts, the other 
relaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Triceps: As it contracts, elbow straightens. 
</P>
<P>
 Biceps: As it contracts, elbow bends. 
</P>
<P>
 Insertion: Where muscle attaches to bone that moves with the bicep's 
contractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Elbow joint 
</P>
<P>
 Forearm: Muscles flex and extend the hand and fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Inside Story 
</P>
<P>
 Filaments are the muscle's engines. Each filament is composed of chains of 
proteins, myosin and actin.

<P>
 Actin 
</P>
<P>
 To provide movement, myosin pulls actin toward it. When resting, the 
myosin-actin interaction is inhibited and tension is relaxed. * Pulling the 
Weight 
</P>
<P>
 Humans have 700 muscles comprising about 50% of body weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Eye: Fastest contracting muscles in the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Ear: Smallest muscle; steadies bone in middle ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Tongue: Almost all muscle; fibers provide complex movement.  
</P>
<P>
 Face: It takes 14 muscles to smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Heart: Muscle with greatest endurance; beats about 100,000 times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Back: Moves spinal column; strained back is second highest cause of lost work 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttocks: Largest combined muscle group in body. 
</P>
<P>
 Thigh: Potentially strongest -- yet least used -- muscle in the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Foot: Humans lost grip and precision manipulation muscles when they became 
bipedal. Sources: UC Irvine, Dr. William Honigman, World Book Encyclopedia,

 Death and whimsy. For Roberta Halporn, a natural combination. 
</P>
<P>
 "You either laugh or you cry," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Halporn is sitting in a straight chair in her snug store, a former storefront 
church whose arched windows filter the light of a rainy afternoon through 
frosted panes. 
</P>
<P>
 The chair is low, which suits her; she is perhaps 5 feet tall, a size that 
helped when she was a dancer but has hindered her since: The usual prejudice of 
banks against making business loans to women is heightened, she says, when the 
woman is short. 
</P>

 Halporn is a speck of vivid life in a large roomful of death. Books about 
death and dying line the walls. Tombstone rubbings fill the closets and framed 
ones adorn the walls. Stacks of postcards offer death-themed recipes: Mexican 
Pan de Muertos, an old New York-Dutch Funeral Pie, an Armenian Soup to Save a 
Dead Soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelves in a standing coffin hold a mix of small objects that tend toward 
humor: a small stuffed Dracula doll; a skeletal hand that seems to beckon; a 
bumper sticker that says, "I Brake for Old Graveyards"; a pair of fuzzy 
slippers made to look like graves -- turf-green bottoms, fresh-earth brown 
tops, gray tombstone tongues with "Over the Hill" printed like an epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
 Death as livelihood: Welcome to the Center for Thanatological Research, a 
fixture on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn since 1980. It is, in terms of sales 
volume, a small-press publishing house wed to a mail-order book business. The 
whimsical things -- what Halporn calls "the popular stuff" -- is a much smaller 
part of her operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But everything focuses on thanatology: "The study of aging, dying, death, 
bereavement and recovery," in Halporn's succinct definition. 
</P>
<P>
 Halporn, it should be noted, is not death-obsessed. She is not morbid, not 
ghoulish, not gloomy. Death neither delights nor threatens her. It interests 
her as a scholar, as a businesswoman and, she believes, as a person who 
suffered an early loss. 
</P>
<P>
 This last -- the death of her father when she was 5 years old, followed by the 
death six years later of the uncle with whom she had gone to live -- is what 
sets her among a group of people, mostly academics, counselors and writers, who 
deal with death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thought about this," she says. "I've met all the pioneers in this field. 
We were all in our late teens when World War II stopped and the death camps 
were opened. We had dropped the Bomb and knew we could commit global suicide. 
The other thing was, 90% of them had lost someone while they were young." 
</P>
<P>
 The best-known of these pioneers is probably Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, a 
prolific author whose works include "On Death and Dying" and "On Children and 
Dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Halporn has sent out several specialized catalogues of books, and these give 
an idea of how large and varied the field is: Her "Widowhood and Related 
Issues" list has almost 100 titles. "Administering Death by Law" has more than 
170, ranging the alphabet from "Abortion & Infanticide" to "Youth Suicide." She 
keeps her list pruned to about 1,500 titles (of about 5,000 available from 500 
publishers) and tells customers she will special-order any book that is in 
print. 
</P>
<P>
 Halporn began her professional life as a modern dancer. She had her own dance 
troupe and she choreographed three off-Broadway shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in Brooklyn," she says. "Went to NYU. I was a pre-med student and I 
would have been a good doctor, except I couldn't multiply. Which was death in 
chemistry." She went on with a self-designed humanities major and eventually 
got a master's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 She turned away from academics to dance, supplementing her income by teaching 
dance in adult education programs in Queens schools. "I was doing really well," 
she recalls. "I had a car. I was making a living dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 Both jobs ended when a robust male partner tossed her over his head and, on 
landing, she broke a bone in her foot. She could neither dance nor drive to her 
classes with a cast on her leg. "I ran into debt," she says. "I was 
heartbroken. I really felt I had my hand on the ladder of success as a 
choreographer." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was able to look for work, she did not mention dance. "I told people 
about the master of arts in education," she says. "If you tell people you're a 
dancer, oh, you're the lowest. Dancers are almost as low as opera singers, who 
don't run to great intellect." 
</P>
<P>
 She ended up working at Macmillan Inc., the publishing house, handling the 
foreign sales of books. That was in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years and a few publishing jobs later, she became promotion director for 
Law Arts, a Varick Street publisher then gearing up to do a series of books on 
entertainment-industry law. The owner, Abraham Meilen, asked her first to sort 
out another project: a line of books on death and dying. She thought it was an 
odd and bad idea. Her misgivings soon vanished, to be replaced by enthusiasm 
for the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1978, she was ready to go out on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a single parent," she says. "I had my daughter's first year of college 
tuition in the bank. I could afford to do something new. I decided I was going 
to set up a company of my own and draw a circle around this small market. Build 
the complete mousetrap. I knew how to produce a book, how to publish a book and 
how to write a book." 
</P>
<P>
 In her first year, her gross sales were $5,000 and all of her inventory fit 
nicely in the basement. By the third year, the inventory was scattered in spare 
rooms all over the neighborhood and the apartment was bursting. "It was either 
expand or close," Halporn says. She bought the Atlantic Avenue building with an 
inherited $15,000 as a down payment.  
</P>
<P>
 Her fourth-year gross was $160,000. She took that number to the banks. "I had 
a track record, I employed four people, I was spending X amount of money, I was 
running a book club, paying salaries. All this with no outside capital. The 
banks told me: 'Go away, lady. You're crazy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She stops halfway between anger and resignation. "Well, they didn't use those 
words, of course, but that's what they meant," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banks hate bookstores. To them a book is worth five cents. It's nothing. They 
can't see that there's a guaranteed interest in this strange subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Halporn's subject puts such things as banks and money in perspective and there 
are lessons for anyone who visits. 
</P>
<P>
 What, after all, are we to compare with the experience of William and Sarah 
Langley, whose names adorn an immense tombstone rubbing on Halporn's wall? 
</P>
<P>
 The broad stone has six divisions, one for each Langley child laid to rest 
beneath it. Three were named Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then let my murmuring Heart cheer up with this," the stone says. "They with 
their Saviour art in endless bliss." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's from the Common Burying Ground in Newport," Halporn says quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 "A wonderful place."

FIRST PERSON: CLASS PROJECTS AREN'T WHAT THEY USED TO BE

 I want to issue a disclaimer before I launch into what is basically one long 
complaint against school projects: I loved school, did well, and was one of 
those kids who carefully drew and colored special covers for even the most 
ordinary reports. 
</P>
<P>
 But now I am a parent with three students in schools ranging from elementary 
to middle and I'm about projected and art-worked out of my tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Take your basic book report. I recall those as one- or two-page neatly written 
reviews of books I'd read. Today's book reports are much more visual and 
complicated (although, in my opinion, not necessarily better). 
</P>
<P>
 They can take strange and wondrous forms, like dioramas, in which you convert 
a shoe box into a proscenium of sorts, turning it on its side and drawing a 
scene on what used to be the bottom of the box. Next, you draw, color and cut 
out the book's main characters to complete the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The only writing is on a card that's attached, which carries the title and 
author's name. The effort that goes into these can be enormous, from finding 
the shoe box to helping those little hands draw and carefully cut out the 
characters. Getting these projects to school intact can require a large 
shopping bag and extra tape and glue. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the book report as poster. Actually, almost anything can be done 
as a poster. My newest favorite is a poster that's a collage of your child's 
life, divided into three segments: the past, the present and the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Your children cut out pictures that show things they do (or are), or used to 
do (or be), or want to do (or be). They then make lists of these things, glue 
them to the back of the poster, and write a statement of affirmation about 
themselves (no kidding -- could I make this up?), and attach that to the bottom 
of the collage. 
</P>
<P>
 I just helped my youngest son complete this project, cutting and gluing and 
pasting, working with him on future goals and trying to figure out what 
"affirmation" is. Turns out he knew -- he had to write all the good things 
about himself, as his brothers cackled in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 The Life Collage (as I like to call it) was due on the same day my middle son 
had to construct an arthropod model. (For those who have forgotten 
elementary-school science, arthropods are part of the invertebrate world and 
include such creatures as spiders and shrimp). 
</P>
<P>
 As I helped my youngest son complete his final pasting, my mother finished 
sewing the last eyeball onto my middle son's spider -- we decided a soft 
sculpture, complete with pipe cleaner legs and knotted-yarn eyes was the way to 
go. Just how many adults does it take to complete these projects? 
</P>
<P>
 My oldest son, now in middle school, had his own worries. He was in the midst 
of constructing a social studies dictionary, but had misplaced the notebook in 
which he had written terms and definitions. An hour later, we'd located that 
sucker. Now all he has to do is illustrate the dictionary and draw a cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest you think he is overdoing it, I learned at Open House night at middle 
school that no effort is too great on this project. His social studies teacher 
held up some of her favorite examples of past dictionaries, and Picasso would 
have been hard-pressed to do better. 
</P>
<P>
 But we're hopeful at my house, and we were fresh from a victory over the 
geography mobile our fifth-grader had handed in the week before. After 
painstakingly coloring and cutting out six of the world's continents (you get 
to leave out Antarctica), he had even done the extra-credit topographical maps 
complete with special keys, before punching holes in each continent and 
attaching them with strands of different-colored yarn to pieces of hangers in 
varying lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Still with me? At any rate, he'd received an A on this project, which should 
have made him ecstatic, except that another child, who had figured out how to 
gracefully bow the hangers, had received an A-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes. The teachers assign, the students attempt, the parents assist. 
I sure hope the kids are learning from these projects. I know my pasting skills 
have improved enormously.

SHHHH! IT'S AN NSA MUSEUM, BUT SPY AGENCY IS UNCLEAR ON CONCEPT; WASHINGTON: 
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY OPENED IT IN JULY BUT TOLD NO ONE. IT'S HARD TO FIND, 
AND ITS PHONE NUMBER MAY NOT EXIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN RINGLE, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the shadowy world of U.S. intelligence agencies, the National Security 
Agency has always been the most clandestine. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20,000 people work at the mirror-windowed complex at Ft. Meade between 
Baltimore and Washington, but until 1989 there wasn't even a sign in front of 
the buildings. The 1952 executive order that created the agency was itself 
classified. For years it was a federal crime even to say it existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, as might be expected, when the NSA opened its own museum recently, 
it did things a little differently. It held the first opening in July and 
didn't tell the public. It held a second ribbon-cutting in December for the 
public but didn't tell the press. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter heard of the museum recently from a source close to the NSA, 
he was able to locate it only after an extended series of calls to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tend to be a bit sensitive around here," said Stephen J. McAnallen, a 
surprisingly good-natured man finally located under the oxymoronic title of NSA 
public affairs officer. "It sort of comes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
 With McAnallen's help, the National Cryptologic Museum was ultimately 
discovered in a defunct motel at the end of a crumbling road behind a Shell gas 
station just off Route 32 from the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. It would be a 
highly anonymous location were it not surrounded by a high chain-link fence 
with barbed wire on top. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is the latest step in the gradual demythologizing of the agency -- 
a process former director and until recently Defense Secretary-designate Bobby 
Ray Inman started more than 10 years ago, said David A. Hatch, 51, an NSA 
historian waiting inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some fairly detailed books and articles" about the long-secret agency had 
appeared by then and, although many in the agency remain almost pathological in 
their passion for anonymity, "people have discovered the world won't crumble if 
the words "cryptology' or "sigint' appear in print," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigint -- intelligence gleaned from the interception and decryption of 
government and military signals -- is, of course, what NSA is all about. And, 
as exhibits in what once was the motel's bar indicate, its origins are as old 
as coded writings and invisible ink. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum displays two books on cryptography dating from the 16th Century, as 
well as a small but elegant wooden cipher machine, found in West Virginia and 
dating from around 1800, that may have originated in the fertile mind of Thomas 
Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
 Other exhibits show how sigint multiplied during the Civil War, when Union and 
Confederate signal corpsmen read each other's wigwagged troop-movement signals 
and tapped each other's telegraph lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bulk of the museum is devoted to sigint's boom years -- those between 
World War I and 1974, when publication of F. W. Winterbotham's book "The Ultra 
Secret" finally disclosed the greatest and most closely held secret of World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 An improbable combination of Polish foresight, British genius, American 
technology and German hubris permitted the Allied forces to read German and 
Japanese radio signals for most of the war. It was so vital that most 
historians now recognize it as the key ingredient in the Allied victory, 
particularly at such crucial moments as the Battle of the Atlantic against 
German U-boats; the Battle of Midway, which halted Japan's advance in the 
Pacific; and the invasion of Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the code-breaking struggle was the storied Enigma cipher 
machine, an ingenious electromechanical typewriter fitted with a system of 
adjustable rotors designed to produce a cipher so complex it would defy human 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans considered their Enigma-based codes unbreakable. And so they might 
have been had not some Polish cryptographers managed to reproduce an Enigma 
machine from documents sold to them by an embittered German aristocrat whose 
fortunes had reduced him to a signal clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 After the invasion of Poland, the replica Enigma was smuggled to Britain, 
where British code-breakers managed to devise a pioneering electronic computer 
called "the bombe," designed to exhaust and therefore solve the mathematical 
possibilities of Enigma rotor settings. The rest is, quite literally, history. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum curator Earl J. Coates, 54, appears mildly miffed that NSA's own bombe 
was loaned to the Smithsonian Institution's "Information Age" exhibit before 
his own museum was up and running. The NSA museum, however, is awash in Enigma 
machines -- Luftwaffe Enigmas, U-boat Enigmas and even an Enigma visitors can 
play with themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on display is the U.S. Sigma machine, the only cipher machine of World 
War II whose codes were never broken. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Cryptologic Museum, reached by exiting the Baltimore-Washington 
Parkway at Route 32 and heading behind the Shell station, is open from 9 a.m. 
to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday. Some at NSA say you can reach it at 
301-688-5849. Others at NSA deny that number exists.

SURPRISING NUCLEAR SAFEGUARD FOUND IN 1979 ACCIDENT; THREE MILE ISLAND: MOLTEN 
FUEL COOLED TO SOLID FORM BY WATER IS CREDITED WITH AVERTING A GREATER 
CATASTROPHE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH KIRKPATRICK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Molten nuclear fuel cooled to a solid by water surprisingly provided a 
safeguard against a greater catastrophe during the 1979 accident at the Three 
Mile Island nuclear plant, a recent study asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 When molten uranium and other metals first flowed to the bottom of the 
reactor, they formed a ceramic crust that acted as an insulator. Scientists 
think pathways carrying water opened between the crust and the steel wall of 
the reactor and in a mass of molten fuel above the crust. 
</P>
<P>
 The water and solid fuel prevented the uranium from melting through the vessel 
and falling to the floor of the containment building, a situation that would 
have complicated the cleanup further. 
</P>
<P>
 "The molten fuel had a very important protective capability. That's news," 
said Eric S. Beckjord, a research director for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission who wrote a paper analyzing the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven major industrial nations formed a consortium in 1988 and spent $9 
million on the TMI Vessel Investigation Project to determine why the steel 
reactor vessel didn't fail despite being subjected to searing temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Samples were taken from the vessel in 1990; a report was issued last October. 
Details are working their way through the scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
 The report dramatically confirmed the theory that water can stop molten fuel 
from breaching a steel reactor vessel, said Steve Sholly, a senior consultant 
with MHB Technical Associates of San Jose, Calif., who was not connected to the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 If all water had been lost, the reactor vessel probably would have failed, 
Sholly added. 
</P>
<P>
 But people should not conclude that reactor vessels are a lot stronger than 
once believed, said Jim Riccio, an attorney with the Public Citizen Critical 
Mass Energy Project. The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission doesn't really 
know how brittle reactor vessels have become because of radiation over long 
periods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Pollard of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which is often critical 
of the nuclear industry, said he had not seen the report and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 During the accident, the worst ever at a U.S. nuclear power plant, the upper 
two-thirds of the 12-foot- high reactor core was destroyed when mechanical 
failure and human error allowed it to lose its cooling shield of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a two-minute period, nearly 20 tons of molten fuel and debris flowed to 
the vessel's bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a fictional scenario made popular by the movie, "The China 
Syndrome," which was playing at area theaters when the TMI accident occurred, 
melting nuclear fuel would burn its way through the bottom of anything built to 
contain it and sink deep into the ground, releasing deadly radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 A hot spot of more than 2,000 degrees did form in the steel wall at a point 
where the crust was thin. Previous studies said the heat should have spread to 
the rest of the vessel and triggered a failure, but the water cooled it within 
30 minutes. Steel melts at 2,642 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists had expected the molten mass to sit tightly against the vessel wall 
and melt through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was personally surprised," said Mansur A. Alammar, senior engineer for the 
TMI operating company, GPU Nuclear Corp., and a chairman of a nuclear industry 
study group on the accident. "I always predicted vessel failure. Now we see 
this mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the new study, scientists believed the "China syndrome" was more 
Hollywood plot line than scientific reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the insulating property of the fuel and the strength of the steel 
vessel, previous studies had shown the concrete bases on which U.S. reactors 
are built also would hold up against melting fuel, Beckjord said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said scientists will further examine the cooling process and try to 
determine if it would happen again in another accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Sholly declined to predict the effect of the report on future reactor designs. 
But he said some designs already incorporate safeguards that the new study 
indicates will be effective, such as putting reactor vessels into cavities that 
can be completely flooded in an accident.

SURVIVORS OF AIDS VIRUS INSPIRE RESEARCH; MEDICINE: ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THOSE 
WHO CONTRACT HIV ARE STILL HEALTHY AFTER 14 YEARS. SCIENTISTS THEORIZE ON 
POSSIBLE REASONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rob Anderson remembers how angry he felt back in 1985 when he read experts' 
predictions about AIDS. Everyone who catches the virus would surely die from 
it, they said. By then, Rob Anderson had been infected for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided, 'I'll show them,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson has had HIV, the AIDS virus, for about 15 years. He still is healthy. 
This raises a question that has begun to fascinate scientists: Why does the 
AIDS virus kill some people much more slowly than others? 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the brief history of this disease, death seemed to be the only 
certainty. More than 200,000 Americans have been lost so far; about 100 more 
die each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the longer people are infected with HIV, the more likely they are to 
fall ill with full-blown AIDS and die. But the course of this decline is 
unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists wonder why, for instance, that 12% of those infected with HIV go on 
to develop AIDS within five years of catching the virus. Why do half stay 
healthy for 10 years? Why are a third still going strong after 14 years? 
</P>
<P>
 The study of long-term HIV survivors has become a hot area of study in AIDS; 
researchers would very much like to figure out what makes these lucky few 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a question of following clues," said Dr. Lewis Schrager of the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "We hope the clues will give us 
new ideas and directions for vaccine development and therapeutic strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 The disease is so new that no one really knows how long people can live with 
the infection. The latest projections, however, suggest that 10% to 17% still 
will be alive and free of disease 20 years after they catch HIV. Perhaps some 
will live out full lives with their infections. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so much in AIDS, there are few clear answers to the "why" questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term HIV survivors like Anderson, a 40-year-old San Francisco artist, 
have their own theories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it all goes back to my attitude," he said. "I won't let this make me 
ill. I've watched quite a number of friends go from being relatively healthy to 
sick and dead in very short periods of time. In every case, they all bought 
into the idea that you have to die from AIDS if you have HIV. I just simply 
don't agree with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Others credit their diets, their vitamins, their medicines, their exercise, 
their meditation. But as far as scientists can tell, long-term survival has 
little to do with how people get infected, their sex habits, the food they eat 
or anything else they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they are looking at three main theories of why some people survive 
longer with HIV: 
</P>
<P>
 * They are genetically different. 
</P>
<P>
 * Their immune systems work better. 
</P>
<P>
 * They are infected with less rapacious strains of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 All three possibilities could be true. 
</P>
<P>
 Most information about long-term survivors comes from studies of gay men that 
began in the early 1980s, shortly after the AIDS epidemic started. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of these is the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study conducted by the 
National Institutes of Health. Of 4,954 men enrolled in the study, 1,809 
already were infected at the outset in 1984. Two similar studies in San 
Francisco are following a total of 2,700 men. 
</P>
<P>
 The men in these studies give blood samples regularly so doctors can track the 
course of their infections. The AIDS virus attacks a crucial variety of white 
blood cells called helper T-cells or CD4 cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy people have about 1,000 of these cells per cubic millimeter of blood. 
Most people experience an initial drop in helper cells immediately after they 
get infected. Then, the loss almost -- but not quite -- levels off. For years, 
the totals drop slowly. Eventually, they fall below 200, and this puts people 
at risk of overwhelming infections, the hallmark of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers are especially fascinated by Anderson and others who escape 
this inexorable damage. He, like perhaps about 5% of all infected people, has 
not continued to lose helper cells. Instead, his levels are close to 800. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be imperative to follow these people for long periods of time to see 
what happens," Schrager said. "Some may suddenly start losing CD4 cells. Some 
may never, which would be fascinating. There is clearly a hope that at least 
some of these people will represent a unique group, not just the tail of a 
normal distribution." 
</P>
<P>
 If a difference in immune responses explains long-term survival, some experts 
believe another type of virus-suppressing blood cells called CD8 cells could be 
the key. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Phair of Northwestern University and others have noticed that 
long-term survivors have abnormally high levels of these white cells in their 
bloodstreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tells us that CD8 cells play a very important role in the response to this 
infection," Phair said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just why is unclear. But scientists are especially intrigued by the possible 
role of a variety of CD8 cells known as cytotoxic lymphocytes, which recognize 
HIV-infected CD4 cells and destroy them. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers theorize that long-term survivors might have more of these cells, 
or that the ones they have might do a better job of hunting down infected CD4 
cells before they release more copies of the virus into the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is: What's different with these people?" asked Dr. Susan 
Buchbinder of the University of California, San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 She thinks genes may play a role, especially the human leukocyte antigens, or 
HLA, genes. These genes vary from person to person and play an integral role in 
regulating the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchbinder has found a particular pattern of HLA genes that appears to be more 
common among longtime HIV survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Other evidence suggests, however, that differences in the strains of virus 
people catch could be just as important as variations between people. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Vlahov of Johns Hopkins University studies genetic diversity in the 
virus. He found that some long-term survivors carry forms that stay genetically 
stable. Those who fall sick have HIV that mutates rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 A strange tragedy in Australia adds more evidence of the importance of viral 
strains. 
</P>
<P>
 Between nine and 13 years ago, six people got HIV from blood transfusions 
donated by one infected man. They ranged in age from 35 to 77 and got blood for 
different medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing they have in common is the outcome of their infections: All of 
them, as well as the donor, remain healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Differences in immune system responses may account for some people's longevity 
with HIV, said Dr. Jennifer Learmont of the Red Cross Blood Bank in Sydney. But 
"in this case," she said, "we think it's the bug." 
</P>
<P>
 While long-term HIV survivors may find such theories interesting, many seem to 
view the virus as a personal foe, one that may eventually catch up with them. 
Even Anderson admits to apprehension when he catches the flu or a cold. 
</P>
<P>
 LeBaron Moseby of Boston, who has been infected for at least nine of his 49 
years, simply feels lucky to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people want to be long-term survivors," he said. "But I'd rather be 
newly infected any day, knowing what I do about this virus."

 Workers for Fiat, Europe's second largest auto maker, blocked a highway near 
Milan and slowed down traffic on a provincial road Friday in an escalating 
protest against thousands of planned layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiat workers had disrupted train traffic at Milan's main railroad station 
Thursday and had blocked the highway on Wednesday.

<P>
 The Alfa Romeo factory of Arese, as well as Fiat units in Turin and near 
Naples, are facing a major reorganization to combat dropping sales.

 Negotiations over Fiat's plans to lay off 11,800 workers by next year 
collapsed two weeks ago, but the company and trade unions have indicated talks 
may resume soon.

SERIAL SUSPECT SAID TO SHOOT FROM THE LIP; MURDERS: SOME WONDER IF 
MILD-MANNERED HANDYMAN IS TAKING THE BLAME FOR CRIMES HE DIDN'T COMMIT BECAUSE 
OF SOME LUST FOR NOTORIETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police say the outwardly mild-mannered handyman led them to believe that he is 
a child killer and even drew a map showing where a body is buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some wonder if he's taking the blame for crimes he didn't commit because 
of some lust for notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis S. Lent Jr. was charged in a recent botched kidnaping and a 1990 
child-murder, and quickly became a possible suspect in other child 
disappearances, including that of a 12-year-old girl in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 An interstate task force tracking Lent's past is getting daily police calls 
"from one end of the country to the other" checking for any ties to crimes in 
their areas, said FBI agent William McMullin, the team's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say Lent incriminated himself in the 1990 slaying of a 
12-year-old local boy last seen near the movie theater where Lent worked. He 
has pleaded not guilty to the murder and an alleged Jan. 7 kidnaping attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 They say he also drew a map to show where they could find the body of the New 
York girl who vanished in August while bicycle riding. Questions about Lent's 
credibility are being raised partly because after nearly two weeks of digging, 
searchers haven't found a body or even a single clue. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, who have been tight-lipped about the case, must proceed 
cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 It's rare, but sometimes suspects who leap from anonymity may exaggerate their 
crimes or make false confessions "for self-aggrandizement," said Eugene Levitt, 
a psychologist who has testified on the psyche of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The news media are all around you; you might sell your story to Hollywood," 
he said. "It is also possible for someone who lives on the edge of fantasy in 
any case to actually believe that he . . . committed a fantasized act." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about the case include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 12-year-old neighbor says Lent once told him gruesome details about the 
1990 slaying, but without implicating himself. The boy disappeared near the 
theater where Lent worked as a custodian, so Lent could have learned case 
details from co-workers and others questioned by police at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater manager said Lent showed a similar fascination with a series of 
local child rapes for which someone else was later convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Newspaper reports, citing unidentified police sources, say Lent has claimed 
he has multiple personalities, including an evil alter ego named "Stephen." 
That's also the name of the alter ego that convicted "Hillside Strangler" 
Kenneth Bianchi blamed for his Los Angeles-area killings in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities concluded Bianchi faked his multiple personalities; documented 
cases are virtually unknown in the annals of serial killing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Serial killing experts say such murderers are usually intelligent young men 
who cleverly evade notice and capture. Lent is a 43-year-old high school 
dropout accused of trying to kidnap a girl in broad daylight at the busiest 
street corner in Pittsfield, a city of about 42,000. 
</P>
<P>
 She got away and a witness took down a partial license plate number of a truck 
Lent reportedly drove through two stoplights. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-known case of seeking notoriety for serial killings is Henry Lee 
Lucas, convicted of 13 murders in Texas and Florida. He once claimed 
involvement in more than 360 murders, but now says he killed only his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like this do lie," said Robert Keppel, chief investigator in the case 
of Theodore Bundy, who was executed for three Florida slayings. "They all read 
about each other. It wouldn't surprise me at all if at some point a book about 
the 'Hillside Strangler' was in (Lent's) possession."

RUSSIAN TV SEEKS U.S. SPONSORS FOR NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A breakthrough Russian TV station is seeking U.S. advertisers to sponsor news 
programming free of the state control that's still around in post-communist 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 NTV features some of the nation's top professional broadcast journalists who 
left their previous anchor and reporting jobs because of government 
interference, NTV President Igor Malashenko said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "News is our profession," is the NTV motto. It is boldly emblazoned on a 
slick-looking, if awkwardly-phrased English brochure that Malashenko brought to 
Washington where he was seeking to drum up support. 
</P>
<P>
 He also stopped in Miami to buy films for broadcast on NTV, and was heading to 
New York to visit ad agencies in search of U.S. sponsors to buy commercial time 
on the station. 
</P>
<P>
 NTV, leasing studio space and offices from the Ostankino Broadcasting Company, 
Russia's largest TV network, advertises itself as Russia's only independent 
network, financed by three Russian banks that have pledged $32 million in the 
network's first 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Since premiering in October, NTV's two nightly news shows have risen to the 
top of the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the reform government that has replaced the old Soviet system, he 
said, "They perceive themselves as being democrats, but for them it means, OK, 
the media should support them." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he notes that things have improved. 
</P>
<P>
 NTV's news staff of about 200 includes personalities who had already achieved 
renown on other stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American equivalent would be if 'Nightline' and 'MacNeil-Lehrer' and 
Connie Chung and Peter Jennings" all got together to form a news team, said 
Allen Weinstein, president of the nonprofit Center for Democracy, which was 
helping Malashenko get attention in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 NTV's staff features journalists such as Tatyana Mitkova, whose fame was 
assured after she refused to read the official version of the Soviet military 
response to the 1991 breakaway uprising in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
 Malashenko left his job as the No. 2 executive at Russia's largest TV station 
a year ago after a new politically appointed chairman arrived. Interviews with 
bureaucrats and politicians were forced on the news operation and "news was 
distorted," Malashenko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Malashenko believes that the state-controlled TV actually helped increase 
popular support for ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky in the recent 
elections even while criticizing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "By trying to undermine him, they create an enormous publicity," he said.

U.S. EXPLORERS TRY TO STOP TRASHING ANTARCTICA; SCIENCE: ALL THE WASTE FROM 
MCMURDO STATION AND THE AMUNDSEN-SCOTT SOUTH POLE STATION IS TO BE LOADED ONTO 
A CARGO SHIP AND SENT HOME FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.

<P>
 Al Martin, manager of the largest scientific research station on this frozen 
continent, takes pride in the unsightly but well-organized piles of compacted 
and crated junk. 
</P>
<P>
 The trash awaiting removal includes a 7-million-pound backlog from years past. 
It is expected to be disposed of sometime within the next three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody arriving at McMurdo must attend a briefing on what to do with the 
waste. Bins to segregate every imaginable kind of material are everywhere, 
inside buildings and on the slushy, unpaved streets outside. 
</P>
<P>
 At the peak of the austral summer, as many as 1,200 people live here. Workers 
and scientists alike are hammered with the same message: Keep the place clean. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurdo, which looks a lot like an old Western mining town on ice, is the hub 
of U.S. Antarctic research, operated by the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, at the end of this scientific season in late February, all 
waste materials from McMurdo and the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station -- 
more than 5 million pounds altogether -- will be loaded onto a cargo vessel, 
the Green Wave, and shipped home. A private contractor in Washington state will 
handle the final disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many years we treated Antarctica the way any town was treated back in the 
States," said Dwight D. Fisher, senior foundation representative at McMurdo 
before his recent return to headquarters in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, we've gotten rid of anything that has PCBs in it," Martin 
said. "You almost have to see a before-and-after picture to see how much effort 
we went to." 
</P>
<P>
 Even dirt and ice contaminated by spilled diesel fuel are scraped up and put 
in barrels for return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 At scientific field camps, restrictions are even tougher. Human waste is 
sealed in drums. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, partly in response to pressure from environmental 
organizations, $42 million has been spent to clean up McMurdo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an unmistakable shift that reflects the emphasis in our society, 
nationally and internationally," said oceanographer Cornelius W. Sullivan, who 
is director of the foundation's Office of Polar Programs. "We are no longer 
conquerors of the Earth. We are viewers of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the last few years, McMurdo, which has been in operation since 1956, was 
a smoldering eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash and garbage were burned in an open dump. Waste-filled steel drums were 
plowed under. Worn-out machinery was towed onto the ice of adjoining Winter 
Quarters Bay. When the ice melted, the debris sank to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the dump is gone, although residues of toxic materials remain in the 
ground. Some of them continue to leach into the bay. Once a rich haven for sea 
life, the small body of water has been virtually a dead pond since the 1970s. 
Discharge of diesel fuel from ships at an ice dock has contributed to the 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 A garbage-burning incinerator was installed in 1991. But the science 
foundation was forced to shut it down, at least temporarily, last June. A 
successful lawsuit brought by the Environmental Defense Fund charged that its 
toxic emissions were too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for me to believe that an incinerator operating on a 
continent that big can't be quite effective, very energy-efficient and 
environmentally sound, particularly when you look at the alternatives," said 
John S. Oliver of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative -- "to load the waste on a ship, use all the energy to steam 
it back to our country, and either burn it there or bury it there -- is just 
stupid," Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewage disposal is still a headache for McMurdo's managers. Untreated frozen 
sewage is chopped up, mixed with warm brine and flushed underwater through a 
160-foot-long pipe. Solid waste piles up on the ocean bottom. In late November, 
divers used high-pressure hoses to disperse it in "Operation Big Flush." 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements in sewage treatment are being studied. Options include extending 
the disposal pipe into deeper currents of the Ross Sea or building some kind of 
treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 the 26 nations conducting scientific research in Antarctica signed a 
protocol to strengthen environmental protection. The U.S. Senate approved the 
agreement in 1992; Congress may act this year on legislation to implement it. 
</P>
<P>
 Four bills have been introduced. Some would dilute the authority of the 
National Science Foundation and give more environmental oversight to other 
agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration.

GAO INVESTIGATING REPORT THAT GOVERNMENT COVERED UP '47 UFO INCIDENT; THE OUTER 
LIMITS: CONSPIRACY THEORISTS THINK THAT A FLYING SAUCER CRASHED IN NEW MEXICO, 
KILLING ALL ABOARD. 
</P>

<P>
 Where television's "Unsolved Mysteries" has tried and failed, the General 
Accounting Office is unafraid to venture. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Rep. Steven H. Schiff (R-N.M.), Congress' investigative 
branch has launched a study to determine whether the government covered up a 
story alleging that the bodies of alien space voyagers were removed from a 
crashed flying saucer found near Roswell, N.M., in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 After the purported crash of the spacecraft, the bodies of the 
extraterrestrial visitors were said by a local undertaker and other conspiracy 
theorists to have been autopsied and then secretly flown to an Air Force base 
in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the "Roswell incident" has been repeatedly dismissed by the 
Defense Department as nothing more than UFO fantasies triggered by the 
discovery of a downed weather balloon, the GAO has begun searching for 
documents to prove allegations that the Air Force "suppressed" information 
sought by Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff is a member of the House Government Operations Committee, which 
oversees the GAO. 
</P>
<P>
 GAO spokeswoman Laura A. Kopelson said the office's investigation, first 
reported in the Albuquerque Journal earlier this month, stemmed from a meeting 
in October between Schiff and GAO Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher. 
Schiff complained then that the Defense Department had been "unresponsive" to 
his inquiries about the 1947 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, only one investigator had been assigned" to the case so 
far, Kopelson said, adding that not enough work had been done to report any 
results to Schiff. At another point, Kopelson said, "The people doing it are 
either on sick leave or are unavailable." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that there was no way of estimating how much the investigation would 
cost, and that the GAO does not release such information anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO conducted 1,380 inquiries into government operations in 1992. Its 
budget has risen from $46.9 million in 1965 to $490 million last year. The 
agency has been criticized, especially by Republicans, as the "lap dog of the 
requesters," producing reports that tend to support whatever conclusion the 
requesting member of Congress suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopelson said Schiff had asked the GAO "to see if there is any evidence that 
information regarding UFOs had been suppressed" after the Roswell incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, however, said that at a routine October meeting he had merely 
complained about the Defense Department's lack of responsiveness. But a GAO 
official said, "We're willing to take a stab at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, in a telephone interview from Albuquerque, said that last March, after 
receiving inquiries from "UFO believers" and some Roswell residents who were in 
the military in 1947, he wrote to Defense Secretary Les Aspin asking for more 
information about the reported spacecraft crash and the alleged disappearance 
of the aliens' bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash 75 miles northwest of Roswell of a mysterious object, which the Air 
Force said was a weather balloon equipped with a radar-reflecting device, was 
the subject of several books and remains many UFO buffs' greatest riddle. 
</P>
<P>
 A privately owned museum in Roswell contains a number of documents and 
photographs purporting to prove the existence of the aliens. It also displays a 
re-creation of the spacecraft surrounded by figures portraying the dead 
extraterrestrials. 
</P>
<P>
 UFO buffs contend the incident marked the beginning of a government conspiracy 
to suppress evidence of alien life. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the speculation stems from claims by William Haut, a former Air Force 
public affairs officer, who said that on July 2, 1947, he was told to prepare a 
news release reporting that the Air Force had recovered parts of a flying 
saucer and then was told to change the story to report a weather balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a nurse reportedly told a local funeral home director that she witnessed 
the autopsies of the spacemen, whom she described as having oversized heads and 
beetle-like features. The nurse subsequently died in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 After the autopsies, conspiracy theorists said the bodies were flown to Ft. 
Worth, Tex., and then to what is now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries" investigated the controversy, which the 
program's host, Robert Stack, concluded remained unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff said that after calling Aspin last March to request a Defense 
Department briefing on the Roswell incident, he received a call from an Air 
Force lieutenant colonel, who brusquely told him the documents had been turned 
over to the National Archives. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Schiff said, Archives officials told him they did not have the records on 
Roswell, even though they did have records of "Project Blue Book," a 1969 Air 
Force study of reported UFO sightings. That study, Schiff said, did not deal 
with the Roswell case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting pretty upset at all the running around," Schiff said, adding 
that at his meeting with GAO officials, "they made an offer to help." 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, I'm a skeptic on UFOs and alien beings, but there are indications 
from the runaround that I got that whatever it was, it wasn't a balloon. 
Apparently, it's another government cover-up," Schiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 He called the Defense Department's lack of response "astounding" and said 
government accountability was an issue "even larger than UFOs." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the GAO might not be extending itself, Schiff acknowledged that the 
agency "usually does fiscal investigations, and at present I can't find a 
fiscal impact" in the Roswell incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the agency said, " 'This is beyond our realm of expertise,' " Schiff said, 
"I wouldn't insist on it." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "If the Defense Department had been responsive, it wouldn't have 
come to this."

 A jury awarded $8.1 million to survivors of a surgeon killed in the 1992 crash 
of USAir Flight 405 at New York's LaGuardia Airport.

MAYORS URGE U.S. AID TO FIGHT VIOLENCE; CITIES: GORE PROMISES ALL-OUT ATTACK ON 
ROOT SOCIAL CONDITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mayors from more than 100 cities sought assurance from the Clinton 
Administration Friday that they will get the help they need to curb violence in 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore assured the U.S. Conference of Mayors that the 
Administration would try a comprehensive attack on underlying social 
conditions, rather than focusing solely on law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot look at a single problem in isolation," Gore said. "Working as a 
team, we can revitalize the inner city. Voters in your cities elected us all. 
Now it's our turn to do our job for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's crime package would provide 100,000 extra police officers to patrol 
the streets; funds for building more prisons and establishing military-style 
boot camps, and life sentences for three-time violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said Clinton's plan also would set tough penalties for drug kingpins, 
even on the first offense. "One strike and they're out," Gore said. "We've got 
to convince people by our actions, not by our words." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayors, though, say Clinton's long-term approach doesn't take care of 
their immediate needs. They planned to ask the President for fast relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got an epidemic in your community, it's time for a vaccine," said 
Louisville, Ky., Mayor Jerry Abramson, president of the mayors conference. 
"We're talking about a situation where we literally have got to get that 
vaccine." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayors were ending their annual winter meeting in Washington, a session 
that focused on escalating crime and finding an appropriate way of dealing with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, they presented Clinton a plan for combating crime. One key element 
would allow cities to use federal law-enforcement funds not only for hiring 
extra police officers, but also for overtime, training and equipment for 
veteran officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayors said they expect some resistance from Congress, much like last year's 
defeat of Clinton's economic stimulus plan, which sought to allow cities to use 
their discretion in spending certain federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Soglin, mayor of Madison, Wis., said he hoped Congress would not tie up 
anti-crime legislation in political battles over money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those members of Congress are so concerned about our spending that money 
wisely, let them come home and run for mayor," Soglin said.

TINY STEELVILLE ISN'T JUST SURVIVING, IT'S THRIVING; REDEVELOPMENT: TOWN'S 
RENAISSANCE IS BASED ON COMMITMENT, HARD WORK AND INGENUITY. A NUCLEUS OF ITS 
1,470 CITIZENS MADE DIFFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the story of a town that nearly lost itself only to find how much it 
had. It is about a nucleus of citizens who made the difference between slow 
death and a life full of possibility. It is about commitment, hard work and 
ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, it's about hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The Census Bureau places Steelville's 1,470 citizens at the geographic center 
of the nation's drifting population. The honor, which came with a commemorative 
plaque a few years back, provided a nice little psychological boost. But the 
town's renaissance was rooted in something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up by our own bootstraps," said John Britton, who owns the local funeral 
parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sensed we were dying -- and that no one was going to salvage us. We had to 
do it ourselves," added Ike Lovan, who owns a jewelry shop and local rooming 
house known as the White Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour south of St. Louis, the town had some basic raw materials -- a 
local newspaper, a shoe factory, a small machine tool company, a county 
courthouse, several churches and the Meramec River, which, along with a ring of 
wooded hills, was something of a tourist draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on the western frontier of the Ozarks," Lovan said of the town, which 
runs a mile and a half from east to west. "Like the pioneers, we're making our 
way. We see something out there, and we're using our resources and people to 
get there." 
</P>
<P>
 The big key to Steelville's success has been the local telephone company, a 
cooperative that citizen shareholders for their own quirky reasons had always 
maintained independently. It was in many ways this bit of historical whimsy 
that gave the town its first break. 
</P>
<P>
 It started a few years ago with a gamble: The telephone company's board risked 
$5,000 to buy a shot at a federal lottery for regional cellular phone rights -- 
and won. Quickly reselling their license to a larger communications company 
netted a tidy profit of several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 A large chunk of that windfall was plowed immediately into a community 
development corporation, which since has provided seed money for a number of 
public projects. For starters, the town invested in state-of-the-art telephone 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bargaining chip, something to offer prospective businesses in 
addition to enterprise-zone incentives like tax breaks and free property. With 
a telecommunications system sophisticated enough to compete with those in many 
major cities, Steelville would be a viable alternative for businesses looking 
to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Building on that idea, leaders figured good housing at affordable prices could 
only make the town still more appealing. So they set to work, designing a 
family-friendly housing development that might also attract retirees with 
disposable income. It didn't hurt that with each new installation, the phone 
company's assets would increase and the overall economy would grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Such enterprises, and the pooling of local resources, have driven a lot of 
Steelville's best efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens got together to clean up Yadkin Creek, landscaping its banks and 
stocking it with trout. The Brown Shoe factory, which has grown from 300 to 600 
employees while others in the region have been shut down, originally came to 
this town partly because a corporate executive born here lobbied for it. 
</P>
<P>
 A dentist who dreamed of having a country music show found a consortium of 
investors interested in buying an ugly, abandoned car dealership. It now is a 
motel with a 400-seat auditorium that draws steady summer crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of churches runs a volunteer food pantry. Another group convinced 
Burlington Northern Railroad to donate a vintage caboose it plans to use either 
as an information bureau or jungle gym for kids. Technology buffs are setting 
up an interactive video resource center so citizens can tune in classes at any 
Missouri state university or browse through the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, this community is the model of what this country was like years 
ago: Life is on an intimate scale," said the Rev. William Guyer Birch, 
co-pastor with his wife at the local Presbyterian church. 
</P>
<P>
 "You still have here everything you have in a city -- crime, drugs, domestic 
troubles. The difference is, people here have taken the initiative. There are 
plenty of communities nearby where grass is growing up between the crumbling, 
abandoned stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "People knew things were changing. And they asked the important question: What 
are we changing to? Change is threatening. But we all still have to ask 
ourselves: What kind of people are we becoming?" 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most obvious answer is on Main Street itself, where the newly 
refurbished shops all seem to be named for someone: Al's Cafe, Bill's General 
Store, Sherry's Flowers, Nancy's Antiques. 
</P>
<P>
 It started several years ago with a town dinner at the Golden Echoes 
retirement home, which in itself embodies the town's entrepreneurial flair. 
Constructed with local money, the center includes a reception hall where 
residents cater events, using the profits to subsidize senior meals. 
</P>
<P>
 So at this dinner a few years back, fancy homemade hors d'oeuvres were served 
with wines from local vineyards. Merchants were shown an architect's plans for 
returning Main Street to its historic roots. A local banker offered $500,000 in 
loans at 5% -- half the going rate -- to anyone who joined in the renovations. 
Nineteen shop owners immediately signed on, and the number soon doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to be part of something positive," said Ed Leonard, who runs 
a graphics business and monthly tourism guide. "Five years ago, things here 
were desolate, abandoned. But we started out with a few people and watched most 
of the community join in." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are those who object. They see a self-interested cabal of 
self-styled community leaders out only for themselves. Most recently, a vocal 
group of naysayers opposed plans to build a new town pool to replace the 
decrepit one constructed in 1953. In a survey taken several years ago, 85% of 
the citizens said they wanted a new pool. 
</P>
<P>
 David Keymann, proprietor of the Rainbow Hotel, apparently was not among them: 
"Spend a half-million on a swimming pool? For who? Who's going to pay for it?" 
he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ballot came up, the group lobbying against won narrowly. The pool was 
dead, supporters thought. Until a local philanthropist stepped forward. He 
offered to match whatever funds the community could raise during 1993. Progress 
has been charted in posters around town. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, nearly $70,000 had been raised, bit by bit. At a 
community auction, a family offered a home-cooked gourmet meal that sold for 
$150. A local innkeeper offered a free night in a cabin and a canoe ride that 
fetched $200. And so it went. 
</P>
<P>
 The town raised $15,000 in one night, which has been added to the proceeds 
from an antique doll show, bake sales and other fund drives. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this town, if you have a problem and ask a hundred people for help, 80 or 
90 will stand up and pitch in, whether it's going to pick up rocks in the park 
or whatever," said Bob Bell, 30, who grew up here. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's latest project has been Wildwood Springs. He sat one recent evening in 
one of the old rocking chairs he cherishes. Like the drafty old lodge, they are 
part of his dream. It was a ramshackle mess when he and some other family 
members formed a corporation to buy the place a year or so ago. They'd grown up 
across the street, watching its 1920s splendor fade along with the sound of the 
big bands that used to play on Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying Wildwood Springs was a bit cockeyed, Bell said. But he heard a voice 
not unlike the one that inspired Kevin Costner's character in "Field of 
Dreams": If you restore it, they will come. 
</P>
<P>
 He can see future seasons, hear the laughter of families like his gathering 
around the big hearth and ambling down the rambling lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very strong 'Take care of yourself' attitude here," said Bell, 
whose brother is mayor. "It's a family. And the neat thing is, there's more 
than one person pushing the buttons. We've got a community here and, to a lot 
of people, it's worth working for."

MAINE FIRM HOPES TO CATCH BUSINESS BY USING NETS TO GROW SEAWEED; FOOD: 
AMERICAN ENTREPRENEUR HAS DESIGNS ON SUSHI BAR STAPLE TRADITIONALLY IMPORTED 
FROM THE FAR EAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Swim aside, sardines. Stand back, salmon. Seaweed is moving in as this busy 
little fishing burg's latest treat from the deep. 
</P>
<P>
 A new company is growing the Japanese variety of nori -- a staple of sushi 
bars -- in waters better known for salmon aquaculture and the herring that used 
to supply a number of sardine canning plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal Plantations International Inc. claims to be the only seaweed farming 
company in North America. Its president and chief executive officer, Ira 
Levine, says most of America's nori comes from Japan, China and Korea, where it 
is grown in abundance and considered an everyday food. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing the plants on 6-by-60-foot nets suspended in the cold waters off the 
nation's easternmost city, Coastal Plantations hopes to produce 1% of the nori 
consumed in the United States this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Within three years, Levine hopes to capture 10% of the domestic market -- that 
is, if Americans take to eating the nutrient-rich seaweed with soup and salads 
and using it to flavor hamburgers and make tea. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultivated seaweed grows into what resembles a dark red-brown, leafy 
lettuce. It's grown up to 10 inches before it's clipped and taken to a factory 
where the clippings are chopped and dried to form 8-by-8-inch sheets. The 
worldwide market is estimated at 12 billion to 15 billion sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who prefer nori by itself can break off pieces of the dry, paper-thin 
sheets. Place a piece on your tongue and it melts in your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine, who describes the taste as "nutty, roasty, smoky," said nori has been 
known for its medicinal qualities since 3000 BC. 
</P>
<P>
 It is known to lower cholesterol, and studies are being done on its ability to 
cure stomach cancer and ulcers, said Levine, who has a doctorate in seaweed 
farming and teaches at the University of Southern Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier attempt to farm nori, aided by University of Washington 
researchers, failed in the 1980s because of a lack of aquaculture lease sites 
on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine, then an aquaculture consultant, was looking for an opportunity to 
start his own business. He found ample seaweed farming grounds off Maine's 
rocky coast and had the advantage of other Americans' experience growing the 
plant, whose scientific name is Porphyra yezoensis. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Coastal Plantations reaped its first harvest in its second year in 
the business -- only a third as long as it took the Western growers to reach 
that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our learning curve is steep, but not as steep as other people's," said Steve 
Crawford, who oversees operations at the company's Eastport plant, a former 
sardine cannery jutting over Cobscook Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford, who has been in fish aquaculture for 23 years and once ran the 
largest catfish farm in Oklahoma, had obtained aquaculture permits and had set 
up a processing plant by the time Levine came on the scene and Coastal 
Plantations was formed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal Plantations has leases to grow nori on 80 acres of the bay, parts of 
which resemble a floating checkerboard where salmon and rainbow trout are also 
grown for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 Maine's growing season runs from June to December, when the water matches the 
temperatures of Tokyo Bay where Japanese grow nori from January to June. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine hopes to be an active player in the local sea-farming industry that has 
been filling the vacuum left by the sardine industry. 
</P>
<P>
 For a century, sardine canning, which has nearly disappeared in the last few 
decades, was the major industry in the town of nearly 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine's company has applied for nori-cultivation leases on 140 acres of water 
off Eastport where others could grow nori for Coastal Plantations. 
</P>
<P>
 The salmon farmers, according to Levine, are likely prospects. The two 
products, he says, complement each other, since nori thrives on salmon 
excrement. By placing nori plantations around salmon aquaculture sites, salmon 
farmers would cleanse the water of salmon waste while nourishing the nori. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just a seaweed company," said Levine, whose company will work to 
genetically improve the four local species of nori with hopes of making them 
more palatable and commercially viable. 
</P>
<P>
 Nori's world market price is fixed regularly on the basis of quality. At the 
health food store or sushi bar, prices for the poorest quality nori are 19 
cents a sheet; the best sheets can cost $10 each. Coastal Plantations' midrange 
nori is running 45 to 60 cents a sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 The company produced about 100,000 "sheets" in 1993. "This year, we will make 
3 million sheets," Crawford said.

SCIENCE MASTERS KILLER VIRUSES, DEBATES THEIR DISPOSAL; MEDICINE: SMALLPOX HAS 
BEEN CONQUERED BY VACCINE. A FEW FROZEN VIRAL SAMPLES ARE ALL THAT'S LEFT ON 
EARTH. SHOULD THEY BE PRESERVED OR DESTROYED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here, in the bland buildings of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, is a murderers' row of hundreds of killer viruses, guilty of 
uncounted millions of human deaths over the ages. They languish in deep frozen 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 But they pose a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 What should science do with a killer virus when it has been rendered helpless? 
Some call for its execution. The instant culprit is smallpox, but there are 
others condemned to Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, these tiny threadlike strands have ravaged the human race from time 
unremembered, stifled human progress more than all the wars humans have waged 
upon each other. 
</P>
<P>
 In the viral kitchens of CDC one need only add living cells, water and oxygen 
to the dried and frozen viruses to re-create their ancient lethal brews. The 
value of this catalogue of viruses is not questioned. In the recent outbreak of 
a mystery disease in the southwestern United States, the guilty agent was 
tracked down, even though it was not considered one of the prime suspects, 
through the viral archives of CDC. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the viruses on store here is what many consider the most lethal known 
to man. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Zairean strain of the Ebola virus, fetched from the sick and dying 
of Central Africa. It is still active in the wild; it can kill in days and 
spread faster than a California wildfire. The value of keeping the captive 
virus is not in question. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of captive smallpox virus is. The World Health Organization 
proclaims the disease eradicated from the earth and calls for destroying the 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
 The few remaining samples are carefully stored in deep freezes at this center 
and in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists hope to decide their fate by this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallpox is the first killer virus to reach the status of dispensable. 
</P>
<P>
 Polio is approaching that point. It has been wiped out in the Western 
Hemisphere and faces the same fate elsewhere on earth before the century is 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallpox poses a unique predicament. Incinerate it, or keep it against an 
unforeseen recurrence, for further study, or just as a reminder of the unkind 
side of Mother Nature. The ethics may be easier with nuclear warheads and 
poison gases. 
</P>
<P>
 Viruses are tougher. In 1967 when the World Health Assembly resolved to wipe 
out smallpox with the use of an effective vaccine and concentrated public 
health measures, more than 40 countries were still fighting the disease within 
their borders. Ten years later the last natural case was recorded in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the waning months of the disease, there was a $1,000 reward posted for 
information leading to any case of the disease. Humankind is the only natural 
reservoir for the variola virus which causes smallpox. Likewise, polio. 
</P>
<P>
 But even on the ropes, variola, transmitted mostly through the air, is an 
insidious enemy. Dr. Brian Mahy, director of the division of viral and 
rickettsial diseases at CDC, outlined some slip-ups along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1973, a vaccinated woman who had observed egg inoculation with variola 
virus at the London School of Hygiene became ill, and before her smallpox was 
correctly diagnosed she infected another patient at the hospital. Two persons 
who visited the secondary case subsequently contracted smallpox and died. 
</P>
<P>
 "A worse tragedy occurred in 1978 at Birmingham University (a year after the 
virus was adjudged eradicated in the wild) where a 40-year-old photographer 
became infected with the Abid strain of variola virus that had apparently 
leaked through a service duct from a laboratory where experimental research on 
the virus was being carried out. Filled with remorse, the poxvirologist who was 
head of the laboratory took his own life a few days before the photographer 
herself died of smallpox. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although vaccination of persons believed to be at risk successfully contained 
a potential outbreak of the disease, the photographer's 70-year-old mother also 
became infected, even though she had been previously vaccinated. She was the 
last person to replicate variola virus, and fortunately she survived." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Mahy, who has encouraged debate on the question of smallpox destruction, 
has himself voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
 In sum, the argument is that the agent is too deadly to be tolerated and once 
the genetic sequence of the virus is documented there is no further need for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Colin Howard, head of pathology and infectious diseases at the Royal 
Veterinary College, London, said there is still much work to be done. Not all 
of variola's secrets are known. 
</P>
<P>
 He asks what Edward Jenner, the 18th-Century English physician who discovered 
the original smallpox vaccine, would say. "I am sure Jenner's natural curiosity 
would have exceeded his desire to accede to popular opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, if danger is measured by virulence alone, then what of other more 
virulent viruses? "Are we to destroy stocks of all pathogens once they are 
eliminated?" Howard asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the smallpox genetics are completely known, it will be very 
difficult to synthesize the virus again, so once gone, all gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists know the genetics of the maverick that is the Ebola virus. It kills 
88% of the people it infects, as opposed to 40% in the most severe outbreaks of 
smallpox. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is science has a very effective vaccine against smallpox. "In 
the case of a virus like Ebola," said Mahy, "we have absolutely no vaccine, no 
treatment. . . . We don't know where it comes from. Despite an enormous amount 
of investigation, it's never been determined where this virus resides. 
Fortunately or unfortunately, it's a virus that has only occurred in a couple 
of isolated epidemics." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists here have shown in laboratory work that the virus is "absolutely 
lethal" to non-human primates, but nothing else is sure except that 274 people 
died out of just over 300 infected in one outbreak in the late 1970s in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ebola work is curtailed, said Mahy, because of the crisis in the 
southwest, in which CDC scientists in the Special Pathogens Division were able 
to pin to a most unlikely virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Pathogens deals with all sorts of organisms which require the most 
stringent laboratory safety procedures, and this crosses all types of viruses. 
</P>
<P>
 It studies a flock of viruses besides Ebola which kills in four or five days 
but may appear to be quicker -- two days from the onset of symptoms. It also 
studies the Lhasa virus which kills up to 50% of those hospitalized within 14 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 there was a Lhasa fever case in Chicago, when a man came home to his 
father's funeral, became sick and died within 48 hours, but not before his 
mother and sister were infected and also died. Isolation was the only weapon 
public health doctors had to confine the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But the major mandate at CDC is to be the barrier between the world's killing 
stock and the U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Viruses are known tricksters. The influenza viruses, for instance, are in 
constant change. 
</P>
<P>
 And last spring nobody knew what it was that began striking down people in the 
American Southwest until CDC went back to its biological laboratory and sent 
its detectives into the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 It became "an interesting opportunity," said Dr, Thomas Ksiazek, chief of 
diagnostics for Special Pathogens. "This could be held up as an example of how 
modern science can be brought to bear in a rapid way on what appears to be a 
new problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Cases didn't appear until early to mid-May when the state health department in 
New Mexico was notified. 
</P>
<P>
 They looked in vain for a match with standard respiratory pathogens known to 
attack the lower respiratory tract. 
</P>
<P>
 CDC was called in by May 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Epidemiologists were sent to New Mexico to document the pattern of the 
disease. How many cases were there? When? Where? Were they all of one 
particular form? They used statistical techniques to try to pinpoint the most 
likely causes of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 When biological samples became available, they were sent to Atlanta where 
specialists in all the pathogens were alerted. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Memorial Day weekend, Special Pathogens began dividing up the 
specimens between scientists schooled in bacterial diseases, rickettsial 
diseases, viral diseases, parasitic diseases and possible environmental 
contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knew what they were looking for, least of all the virologists. There 
were 25 or 30 probabilities, hundreds of possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly the Hanta virus was the furthest thing from our minds," said 
Tsiazek. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Tsiazek and Dr. Pierre Rollin, a French physician working as chief of the 
pathogenesis section, sifted through about 40 specimens on a weekend and found 
antibodies to the Hanta virus in about a third. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first indication that we might be close," said Rollin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hanta viruses came to U.S. attention during the Korean War, when up to 
3,000 United Nations troops were stricken. Early the virus claimed 15 out of 
100 of its victims, although as doctors came to know it better the mortality 
rate went down to 5% or 6%. Since, it has been found around the globe from 
China to Scandinavia and the major port cities of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that Hanta viruses were carried by rodent feces, two scientists drew 
traps from the CDC stores and went to the scene. From the specimens they 
shipped back to Atlanta it looked like the deer mouse was carrying a Hanta 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the known forms of Hanta killed by acute renal failure. The New Mexico 
agent killed by respiratory failure. The Special Pathogens branch needed more 
proof. 
</P>
<P>
 That fell to Dr. Stuart Nichol, who began a detailed probe. 
</P>
<P>
 He used genetic detection techniques on autopsy materials and rodent feces, 
pulling up genetic pieces, sequencing them for comparison. They were the same 
as the virus in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "So now we knew we were dealing with a newly recognized virus and a newly 
recognized disease," Nichol said. The difference was that the old virus 
destroyed the capillaries in the kidney, and the new one attacks the 
capillaries in the lungs, drowning its victims in their own fluids. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took one to two weeks to get really conclusive evidence from serology and 
from genetic approaches," said Tsiazek. "In the old days, without all the 
modern technology, it would take months or years to identify the etiologic 
agent in a newly emerged disease. And yet here we were in a matter of days 
actually with an agent nobody suspected." 
</P>
<P>
 Most viral detective work never ends. Influenza is a case in point. In World 
War I influenza killed almost as many people, give or take a few million, as 
died in World War II, the world's bloodiest war. That virus and its sisters and 
brothers haunt the Earth today. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a virus with an incredible ability to change form and dodge the vaccines 
prepared against it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a widespread reservoir of the disease, not the least of which are the 
ducks and pigs of China where the virus is alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viruses are not in themselves replicating organisms," said Tsiazek. "They are 
the ultimate parasite. They require a living animal cell that is of the right 
type to provide all of the machinery to replicate their genetic message. If you 
remove them from that environment where they don't have living cells, you must 
keep them very very cold or by some other means, like freeze-drying, remove all 
of the water and oxygen so that no chemistry is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, there is a large library of flu viruses at CDC, and because of a 
virus' ability to mutate or reassort itself, the library grows every year. The 
main flus on file are the Swine flu, the Hong Kong flu and Influenza B. On the 
basis of reports from the field, the CDC prepares a new formula for its vaccine 
of the year. There is a worldwide reporting system for influenza. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the scientists at CDC keep up their relentless search for answers to 
hepatitis, HIV, herpes, the more well-known viral entities, as well as the 
nature of parasitism and infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Joseph McDade, associate director for Laboratory Sciences, said nature's 
really successful parasites are very clever. Some, like malaria, that cause 
persistent infections in people, mutate and change even while in the body. The 
body develops resistance to the first invader but misses the mutants that 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to think about it as a universe. These microorganisms have been with 
us hundreds of thousands of years. As long as there have been people and 
primates they have been there. And they know how to make a living and live 
well. What they try to do actually is live at the expense of their host without 
killing him. So that disease and especially fatal disease is a failure of the 
microorganism because it is killing its host."

STUDY OF STREETS, SIGNS DRIVES HOME WAYS TO MAKE LIFE SAFER FOR PEDESTRIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MALCOLM RITTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year in the United States, more than 5,000 pedestrians die in traffic 
accidents and more than 90,000 are injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedestrian accidents are common enough that they seem just the inevitable 
result of inattention, carelessness or plain bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, once you've provided traffic lights and crosswalks, and told people 
to be careful, what more can you do? 
</P>
<P>
 A lot, say experts who are investigating ways to make life safer for 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting research in the United States and abroad, they cite an array of ideas, 
including better designs of streets and signs and teaching such tricks as the 
safest path for reaching the diagonal corner of an intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we observe people walking and crossing streets, we see a tremendous 
number of errors" by both pedestrians and motorists, said Dan Burden of the 
Florida Department of Transportation. "So the eventual injuries are highly 
predictable in a society based on automobile travel, with neither one looking 
out for the other." 
</P>
<P>
 One problem, ironically, is with the most visible part of pedestrian 
protection, the illuminated signs that say "Walk" and "Don't Walk." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with "Walk" signs, experts say, is that people take them too 
literally. It's the "starting-gun phenomenon," said Richard Blomberg, president 
of the research firm Dunlap & Associates Inc. of Norwalk, Conn., which studies 
highway safety and other topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adults and children will stare at the signal and leave when it says 'walk,' " 
rather than looking for cars that are turning into their path or running a red 
light, he said. "I can show you thousands of accidents" that resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 A flashing "Don't Walk" sign poses problems too. Studies show most pedestrians 
do not understand what it means, Blomberg said, and that can be deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Many think "they're being told to get out of the street as fast as they can, 
so they run straight into the path of a motorist" who is turning right on red 
or completing a left-hand turn, Burden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they suddenly stop in the middle of the street or turn around and walk back 
toward their starting point, rather than continuing to walk forward as 
motorists are counting on them to do. 
</P>
<P>
 So a driver turning left or right "wipes out the pedestrian, thinking . . . 
they're OK, that they've already watched that pedestrian (and now) all they 
have to do is look at the rest of the traffic," Burden said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: A flashing "Don't Walk" sign means not to enter the street. If 
you're in the street already, you should have enough time to walk at a normal 
pace to the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies of non-traditional pedestrian signals show some promise for reducing 
the hazard of misunderstandings, said Charles Zegeer, associate director of the 
University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 One experimental model told pedestrians to "Walk With Care" rather than just 
"Walk." Tests in several cities found a marked reduction in incidents in which 
either the driver or the pedestrian had to take action to avoid a collision, 
Zegeer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another experimental model, which replaced the flashing "Don't Walk" sign with 
a signal saying, "Don't Start," also reduced such incidents at three of four 
test sites. Burden said he hopes to test that signal further in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar reductions appeared when researchers posted a sign for turning drivers 
that said, "Yield to Pedestrians," or another for walkers that said, 
"Pedestrians Watch for Turning Vehicles." Zegeer said such signs would have to 
be reserved for particularly hazardous intersections or they would be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Some European countries are using or exploring improvements for busy streets 
where pedestrians must push a button to get a signal to cross, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem is that some people who push the button will not wait for the 
signal, but just dart across the street at the first apparent gap in traffic. 
Not only does that remove the protection from the signal, but it also stops 
traffic needlessly when the signal eventually comes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Some signposts in Britain respond to a button push with a lit-up sign that 
says, "Wait," while others in Germany use a sign that says, "Wait for Signal," 
Zegeer said. That acknowledgment, similar to seeing a light turn on after 
pushing an elevator button, encourages pedestrians to wait for the signal, 
Zegeer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some European countries are also experimenting with infrared motion sensors to 
monitor a pedestrian's progress after he or she pushes the button and gets a 
"Walk" signal. The sensors can keep traffic stopped until the pedestrian has 
reached the far curb, which helps the elderly or others who walk slowly. 
Preliminary studies suggest the sensors are workable and practical for areas 
with few pedestrians, Zegeer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further testing of the experimental pedestrian signals and the European 
devices is needed to prove their usefulness before they could be adopted into 
national guidelines for use in the United States, Zegeer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still other measures deal with street design. Florida now plans to install 
medians in future multilane arterial streets, Burden said. Medians let 
pedestrians deal with just one direction of traffic at a time and take some 
refuge in mid-crossing. Moreover, if they include a channel that angles the 
pedestrian to the right, they encourage pedestrians to face the traffic they 
must watch for in the second half of the trip, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, pedestrians themselves can make their lives safer. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, consider a pedestrian at an intersection of a couple of two-way 
streets who wants to end up on the far corner, diagonally across the 
intersection. The safest path is to cross each street so that the intersection 
is always on his right, Blomberg said. That way, during the especially 
dangerous first half of the crossing, the pedestrian is not exposed to vehicles 
that are leaving the intersection and speeding up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To increase visibility to drivers, pedestrians should travel in groups and, at 
night, carry a lit flashlight or wear reflective material that reflects 
headlight beams directly back at cars, experts say. Just wearing white at night 
doesn't provide enough of a signal to drivers when traffic is moving faster 
than 35 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 But researchers say the most important bit of advice to pedestrians is the 
traditional one: Stop at the curb and look left-right-left before entering the 
street, and train children to do the same. Blomberg found that animated films 
starring a character named "Willy Whistle" reduced accident rates in children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pedestrians in general don't make sufficient use of their eyes," Blomberg 
said. "It's not your feet that get you into trouble."

SCOTLAND RELISHES MYSTIQUE OF ROBERT BURNS AS HIS BICENTENNIAL NEARS; 
LITERATURE: MANY A COMMEMORATION IS BEING READIED FOR 1996, 200 YEARS AFTER THE 
BELOVED POET'S DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD SMITH, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a wintry evening, fat snowflakes fall on the thatched roof of a three-room 
stone cottage by a country road. Inside, a cow and some chickens rustle in 
their stalls. In the adjacent room, a family gathers around a fire to hear 
father read Scripture by candlelight. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening with an expression of rapt attention is a curly-haired 8-year-old 
boy who is destined to become the national poet of Scotland -- and among the 
most intensely adored figures in English literature. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18th-Century people and animals are replicas in wax. But the cottage is 
the real birthplace of Robert Burns, whose fans consider one of the greatest 
writers in the language -- and whose reputation for genius, passion and excess 
continues to intrigue readers to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently installed tableau of Burns' early life is complete with sound 
effects and some of the cottage's original furnishings, including the bed in 
which Burns was born in 1759 and the chair in which he was nursed. 
</P>
<P>
 This refurbishment of the poet's childhood home is only one of an outpouring 
of commemorations being readied in Scotland and around the world in 
anticipation of the 1996 bicentennial of Burns' death at age 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Devotees annually observe "Burns Night" on or about the date of the poet's 
birth, Jan. 25. During these events, his works are recited, sung and discussed 
amid the playing of bagpipes, eating of traditional Scottish dishes such as 
haggis (a meat pudding) and, typically, much drinking of Scotch whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two international conferences are being planned for the bicentennial 
to reassess the poet's life, works and legacy. One will be held at the 
University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. The other will be at the University of 
South Carolina in Columbia, site of the most extensive collection of printed 
Burns materials in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Library of Scotland will open a major traveling exhibition of 
Burns memorabilia in Edinburgh, and a motion picture about the poet's life is 
being planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the world, about 600 Burns societies are expected to hold special 
observances of the bicentennial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally remarkable," said Burns scholar G. Ross Roy of the University of 
South Carolina, comparing the poet's near-cult status to other noted writers. 
"How many Milton clubs are there?" 
</P>
<P>
 John Manson, curator of the Burns cottage and adjacent museum in Alloway, 
attributes the fascination to the mystique that surrounds the poet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's partly the popularity of his marvelous songs and poems," Manson said, 
"and partly the fact that he had a short, full, rich life. He had a lot of bad 
press about being a hard drinker and womanizer, which is not really strictly 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 The matter of Burns' passions is one of continuing controversy. Although he 
evidently went through a succession of lovers, for each of whom he professed 
undying devotion, some scholars believe his reputation as a rounder was 
somewhat contrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burns was a theatrical personality," said J. Derrick McClure of the 
University of Aberdeen. "He himself exaggerated some of these things. But, at 
core, he was thoroughly honest and very sincere about his fondness for his 
home, his family and the common people. He was very sincerely a champion of the 
rights of oppressed people." 
</P>
<P>
 Son of a tenant farmer, young Burns came under the influence of a gifted 
teacher, John Murdoch, who awakened his interest in language and literature. 
Betty Davidson, an elderly woman who lived with the family, stimulated his 
imagination with her stories and songs of Scottish history and folklore. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns began writing poems at age 14. Prophetically, his first began with the 
line, "Once I loved a bonnie lass." 
</P>
<P>
 By 26, his talent matured and he was writing some of his finest work, 
including "The Jolly Beggars," "The Cotter's Saturday Night," "To a Mouse" and 
the acclaimed satire on religious hypocrisy, "Holy Willie's Prayer." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns' themes of egalitarianism and the natural nobility of the common man, 
exemplified in "A Man's A Man for A' That," earned him a hallowed place in 
popular political movements throughout the world, including revolutionary 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he would have approved of the Soviet government, however, is 
debatable. An early supporter of the French Revolution -- he once tried to 
donate a cannon to the cause -- Burns turned against what it became and railed 
against its excesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern readers find some of Burns' poetry tough going, since he wrote much of 
his best work in the lowland Scottish dialect he grew up speaking. A glossary 
is advised. 
</P>
<P>
 But many poems, such as "My Love Is Like a Red, Red Rose," are accessible and 
timeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is one of the greatest songs in English," said Roy. "It's 16 
lines long, with one three-syllable word, seven two-syllable words, and the 
rest all one-syllable words. To make an immortal song out of that simple 
material is something that has always appealed to people." 
</P>
<P>
 After a period of deteriorating health, Burns died July 21, 1796, of rheumatic 
fever, surrounded by his wife, Bonnie Jean, and five children. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the songs he left behind has become a New Year's tradition around the 
world: 
</P>
<P>
 For auld lang syne, my dear,  
</P>
<P>
 For auld lang syne.  
</P>
<P>
 We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet,  
</P>
<P>
 For auld lang syne.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; BILLS HAVE MUCH MORE TO 
PROVE THAN COWBOYS; PRO FOOTBALL: BUFFALO'S PRIDE COULD GO A LONG WAY TODAY TO 
OFFSET THE SUPERIORITY OF DALLAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All the physical advantages, plus the skills and techniques, belong to the 
richly endowed Dallas Cowboys. They also talk a better game. The only thing 
they don't have in the Super Bowl equation is the psychological edge. 
</P>
<P>
 But since they overwhelmed the same Super Bowl rival by a 52-17 score a year 
ago, they'll take center stage today knowing that on the genuine premise of 
measuring ability they should prevail again. The odds-board supports the 
contention, listing the Cowboys as a 10 1/2-point favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, when men are ridiculed, told they're inferior and a professional disgrace 
it can provide an incentive that often -- but not always -- transcends natural 
talent. The Buffalo Bills are in just such a position. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been to the Super Bowl prom three previous times and have yet to 
dance. To the contrary, the Bills have fumbled and stumbled. They also have 
been spurned and humiliated by the Washington Redskins and Cowboys while coming 
close the first time, failing by a mere 20-19 to the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest motivational element the Bills have going for them is a desire 
to regain their personal and professional pride. To do that they must establish 
respect for their achievement in being good enough to qualify for the Super 
Bowl four straight years. 
</P>
<P>
 That should add up to something but in America, as epitomized by the Super 
Bowl, second place doesn't count. They have had not only to take beatings on 
the field but hear themselves tagged unfairly as a collection of chronic 
losers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bills have any character, and they certainly do, this should provide 
impetus enough for them to play the game of their lives against the Cowboys. 
There's no reason for Marv Levy, the Bills' erudite coach, who likes to 
pontificate in locker room dissertations, to say a word in the pre-kickoff 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 If he wants to be effective and dramatic while making a talk it only needs to 
be two words. End of speech. All Levy need do is stand before them, look into 
the faces of his players, pause and merely say, "Let's go." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's now defer to a profound essay contributed by one of America's 
illustrious journalists of the past. His name was Paul Gallico. In this 
instance, he would grant what he called the Fifth Factor to Buffalo. It's 
nebulous yet important. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fifth Factor, as described by Gallico, was how public opinion often 
softens a team, or an individual, to a confident mind-set that can become 
fatal, regardless of how many times they are made aware of the qualifications 
of a so-called lesser opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the genesis toward the creation of upsets, going back to Biblical 
times when David and Goliath had a pre-Super Bowl shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills have far more to prove than the Cowboys. And, prematurely, the owner 
of the Cowboys, Jerry Jones, is proclaiming that if his team wins a second 
successive Super Bowl, it must be regarded as one of the best in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 He obviously never heard of such awesome teams as the Chicago Bears, Cleveland 
Browns, Green Bay Packers, Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones further suggests Troy Aikman, a gifted talent, also will be included 
among the great quarterbacks of all-time. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, he needs to be told about John Unitas, Sammy Baugh, Otto Graham, Sid 
Luckman and Terry Bradshaw. It could be that Mr. Jones is being somewhat 
presumptuous in his evaluation of the Cowboys and their quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any way you slice it, we'd be considered one of the top four or five teams of 
all time," added Jones, the self-professed historian. Can such an assumption be 
regarded as realism or just another fanciful Texas brag? 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman's opposite number, the Bills' Jim Kelly, has gone 0 for 3 in Super Bowl 
appearances. There are accusations he's regressing but don't minimize the 
results that got him this far. He has directed the Bills to the ultimate game 
again, which means he is not exactly shooting blanks when he pulls the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst scenario for the Bills is if they fall behind early. Dallas is more 
explosive and capable of playing "firehouse" football. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bills stay away from self-incriminating mistakes and the score is close 
when the teams reach intermission, it will be a momentous second half. The 
Bills could even somehow win, despite playing against a superior force.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: SUPER BOWL

 SUPER COLD: Don't be so quick to change the channel at halftime during today's 
Super Bowl. That's a Tustin company producing the show at the Georgia Dome in 
Atlanta, with country music stars Wynonna Judd and Clint Black. . . . But 
Dennis Despie, founder of Select Productions International, says his cast of 
hundreds of Southern California dancers, choreographers and musical directors 
aren't used to the frigid weather that has hit the area. "We're pretty 
thin-blooded," he said. "But at least we missed the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 EXTRA HOT: Lose or not, the Buffalo Bills can't return to the big game enough 
times for Buffalo Wings 'N Things, a Huntington Beach restaurant frequented by 
visitors and transplants from western New York and one of many businesses 
expected to profit today (D1). As with the Bills' previous three appearances, 
owner Don Hayes is expecting his biggest day of the year. "In a sense, it's a 
day you dread. When it's over, you really know you worked." . . . Last year, 
Hayes sold about 15,000 Buffalo chicken wings on Super Sunday, and he figures 
that number could reach 20,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 GOLD BARS: They may not be made from precious metal, but they might as well 
be. Super Bowl tickets with a price tag of $175 have been going for nearly 10 
times their face value in some places. . . . One Anaheim ticket broker reports 
that a man initially offered to sell him a pair for $700 each. But then, he 
quickly reneged, explaining, "I didn't know how hot a ticket this was. . . . 
I've got them sold for $1,000." 
</P>
<P>
 PRESS-ING FLESH: Bob Hoyt has an in. A Santa Ana title insurance executive and 
president of the Orange County Sports Assn., Hoyt is attending his first Super 
Bowl and has a friend who managed to get coveted media pins, allowing them to 
crash interviews and parties. . . . "It's unbelievable what goes on. I can't 
get used to how much food they serve you," Hoyt said. A highlight: meeting 
players such as the Bills' Don Beebe. "He probably thought I wrote for the Wall 
Street Journal."

W. LEVITT; MASS-PRODUCED SUBURBIA WITH LEVITTOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William J. Levitt, the prophetic builder whose inexpensive, nearly identical, 
mass-produced houses set Americans on the road to suburbia, died Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Associated Press said he was 86 and had been undergoing treatment for a 
progressive kidney disease when he died in a hospital in Manhasset, Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on Long Island that his Levittowns -- planned communities surrounded by 
shopping, swimming pools and playgrounds -- established him as America's 
foremost builder. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1947, Levitt & Sons constructed more than 17,000 moderately 
priced homes for about $8,000 each. Most were repetitive boxes of 800 square 
feet set side by side, but they enabled city dwellers to escape the growing 
inhospitality of New York for a safer life on tree-shaded streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "William Levitt was to suburbs as Henry Ford was to the auto," said Kenneth T. 
Jackson, author of "Crabgrass Frontier," a history of American suburbanization. 
"Neither one of them invented it. Neither one of them made any major 
contribution to the technology or the idea, but both of them popularized it, 
both of them did it in a bigger way than anyone had done it before." 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt's methods emulated Ford's mass production innovations, enabling him to 
build three dozen homes in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it amounted to," he once said in an interview, "was a reversal of the 
Detroit (assembly) line. There the cars moved while the workers stayed at their 
stations. In our case, it was the workers who moved, doing the same jobs at 
different locations. . . . No one had ever done that before." 
</P>
<P>
 Desmond Ryan, executive director of a Better Long Island, said that the first 
Levittown almost wasn't built. 
</P>
<P>
 He explained that Republicans on the Hempstead Long Island Town Board felt 
that an overnight suburb filled with New York City Democrats would unfavorably 
transform the political power structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they didn't realize was that when you put young Democratic families into 
their own homes, they become Republicans," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levittown, which was built in the middle of a potato field, is now a mature 
community where people take enormous pride in their homes, Ryan said. Those 
homes -- painted many times over to remove the drab colors that Levitt favored 
-- sell for more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt began as his father's employee with Levitt & Sons in the years before 
World War II. The firm was headed by patriarch Abraham, an attorney, who got 
into the housing business because he had acquired land through mortgage 
foreclosures and built houses on it. William Levitt was the abrasive, confident 
businessman, while his more soft-spoken brother, Alfred, was a designer without 
formal architectural training who designed the Levittown homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s, their homes were selling for $12,000 to $20,000 each. But when 
World War II began, the Levitts learned mass housing practices through a 
contract for 2,350 Navy rental units at Norfolk, Va. Just before the war ended, 
they began amassing farmland on Long Island and gathering the stockpile of 
building materials that was to become the first Levittown. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his successes, the developer, who was named one of the 100 most 
important Americans of the 20th Century by Life magazine, fell on hard times in 
the late 1970s and '80s and was accused by New York state officials of looting 
millions of dollars from a charitable foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams accused Levitt of mishandling the Levitt 
Foundation. Levitt agreed to pay $11 million in penalties in 1992, but 
according to a July, 1993, memo from Abrams' office, the state was able to 
collect only $7.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt was also accused by the Federal Elections Commission of making illegal 
contributions in 1986 to Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s (D-Del.) presidential 
campaign. The FEC, citing the developer's advanced age and financial troubles, 
last month dropped its attempt to collect $39,000 in fines from him. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsday, in its obituary on Levitt, quoted one of his original Levittown 
tenants: 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a fair man, he really gave a lot, and it was quality," said Gene 
DiGennaro, who still lives in the Levitt home he bought in Hicksville after the 
war. "We paid $7,995 and we still have a lot to show for it."

SCOTT HARRIS: A FOUNDATION CRACKS BUT NOT HIS SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Miller of Granada Hills had a typical reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mine was just get up and go for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Their house was cracked and, of course, a mess. A 300-pound piano danced away 
from a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott and his wife, Kathi, gathered up Ryan, 7, and Julianne, 5, and stepped 
out into the eerie darkness of their front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could see fires in five different directions," Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the flames reminded him of another night, nearly two years earlier, Scott 
Miller didn't say so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the name is familiar. Maybe you recall the Scott Miller story. For 
many people in the San Fernando Valley, Jan. 17, 1994, will be an unforgettable 
date. In the history of this unfair city, Scott Miller's name will forever be 
attached to another calamity -- the riots that began April 29, 1992, just a few 
hours after police were acquitted in the beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Miller, a city firefighter, was piloting a hook-and-ladder through the 
flames of Western Avenue when a gunman reached out the window of a car and shot 
him in the right cheek. The bullet severed his carotid artery. Miller would not 
be alive but for the heroics of his comrades who applied first aid and rushed 
him to Cedar-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the police officers, firefighters and other authorities who responded 
to the riots, Miller was the most severely injured. Doctors warned him that he 
might never walk, talk or even swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the only sign of his injury is the paralysis that remains in his left 
arm and hand. During his recuperation, he was promoted to captain and assigned 
to supervise a team of high-rise fire safety inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is most memorable about Miller is the extraordinary grace with which 
he handled adversity. In a city filled with anger, Miller spoke with empathy 
about the riots and his causes. The First A.M.E. Church honored him for setting 
an example of tolerance. When people sent donations toward his recovery, Miller 
turned the money over to a fund for widows and orphans. Once, Miller received a 
letter from the mother of the man who would ultimately admit to the shooting, 
and he expressed sympathy for her predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked him once if he ever felt bitter. "Why?" Miller responded. "What 
purpose would it serve? What good is it going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 So the other day, when I heard a tip that Miller's home had been severely 
damaged in the quake, it seemed that the fates were especially cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the reports had been exaggerated. I had been told, for example, that 
the Miller home had been knocked off its foundation. Miller says the foundation 
had been cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 This is hardly good news. Yet Scott Miller, in his laconic way, made it seem 
OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty typical for the area. There are some cracks in the walls," he 
said. "It's worse than some, not as bad as others." 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, homes burned to the ground. The Kaiser Permanente building that 
collapsed is about a half-mile from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors' calm impressed him. "They were surprisingly well-prepared. 
Everybody was pretty much able to take care of themselves -- and make efforts 
to look in and take care of other neighbors. Nobody seemed to panic. Nobody was 
running around frantically." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller expressed a common theme: "As a city, we're awfully darn lucky we 
didn't lose more people. If this had occurred during business hours, we'd have 
seen a lot more loss of life and injury . . . It would have been devastating to 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of the damage, he said, "didn't surprise the Fire Department . . . 
But for the general public, it is a very big eye-opener." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news was that, in Miller's neighborhood, not many people are planning 
to move out. "Some people have said, 'I'm leaving town until things calm down a 
little bit.' I haven't heard people say, 'I'm leaving for good.' The consensus 
is this is part of living in Los Angeles . . . You just roll with the punches 
and keep on going." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, and Scott Miller, have been through much in recent years. I 
couldn't help but wonder how he compared the riots to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 His answer was typically sensible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's apples and oranges," he said. "They're completely different animals, 
completely different types of events, with the completely different types of 
origins." 
</P>
<P>
 True, there's a lot we can do about preparing for earthquakes, but the tremors 
themselves are beyond our control. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why the riot -- albeit less deadly and less damaging -- was a much 
sadder calamity to me. 
</P>
<P>
 The causes weren't beyond our control. 
</P>
<P>

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SIMI VALLEY RESIDENTS LOOK FOR SIGNS FROM 
DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clutching a free bag of Fritos outside Simi Valley's emergency center, Frances 
Ramirez offered her theory -- call it the "garage door hypothesis" -- about the 
fearsome quake that rattled her townhouse two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days there's so much ugliness and bitterness around that no one talks 
to anyone -- you just drive into your garage and close the door behind you," 
said Ramirez, 76, emphatic and emotional before a cluster of Red Cross 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This earthquake was a message, telling us, 'Hey, guys, wake up -- you do have 
neighbors,' " she said. "I know for me, the fence in the back of my house broke 
down and for the first time, I saw my neighbor's face. Now, we've vowed to go 
out to lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks have passed since that first terrifying jolt sent Ramirez fleeing 
into her closet. But, like other Simi Valley residents, she is just beginning 
to untangle her thoughts about the powerful earthquake that roared through the 
city before dawn on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.6-magnitude quake tossed books from shelves in the Simi Valley Library, 
shattered windows in the east county courthouse, snapped water lines in homes 
and knocked trailers off their foundations. It rocked the schools, the police 
station and City Hall. And when it heaved on toward Fillmore, it left an 
enormous cleanup bill behind in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the city's most important structures have been fixed. Except for Simi 
Valley High School, all campuses have been declared safe. The courtrooms will 
reopen on Monday. Even Simi's library has been pronounced structurally sound 
and should be ready to welcome back readers within six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But still "there's obviously a lot to be done," said Mayor Greg Stratton. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow police tape still blocks access to scores of listing buildings. Red 
tags still warn of unsafe conditions at dozens of homes and businesses. And 
dusty cars still line the curbs outside the emergency center on Sycamore Drive, 
where the "No Parking" signs have been covered up with plastic garbage bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to commercial and industrial property exceeds $80 million, and 
residential buildings have taken a $32.5-million blow, Deputy City Atty. Laura 
Herron said. And those staggering figures do not even account for the 
substantial cost of repairing the city's schools, churches and public 
buildings. Nor do they factor in the quake's human cost. 
</P>
<P>
 At the emergency center, Red Cross relief workers, always cheerful, see that 
toll on the weary, lined faces of people seeking help. In response, they 
dispense supportive hugs and sugary snacks, and offer heartfelt sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help yourself, help yourself," Page Spencer said, handing out free cookies. 
"Either that, or we'll twist your arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer's week in Simi Valley has made her fluent in American Red Cross 
disaster-speak. She talks of sending DATs in ERVs to the DACs -- in other 
words, dispatching disaster action teams in emergency response vehicles to 
disaster assistance centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her alphabet soup sounds dispassionate, but Spencer says she empathizes with 
each victim who comes forward. So do many others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're to the point of trying to understand the damages and put people's lives 
back together," Mayor Stratton said. "Now's when we start really hearing about 
the personal tragedies." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials still are fielding calls from bewildered residents: How can I 
get my gas turned on? Where can I return my library books? What should I do 
about the hole that mysteriously appeared in my front yard after that last big 
tremor? 
</P>
<P>
 And, most plaintive: How could the building inspectors pronounce my house safe 
when it's full of cracks and the chimney's collapsed? 
</P>
<P>
 Tina and Joe Lamia have asked that question again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 City inspectors first gave their Cochran Street house a red tag, signifying 
serious structural damage. But three days later, they returned and pasted a 
green sign on the front door, indicating that the hefty cracks, shattered 
mantelpiece and sloping second-story floors were purely cosmetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our inspectors are not going to give a building a green tag if there's a 
question about safety," Deputy City Manager Herron said. "It may not look good, 
but it is safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lamias are not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time there's a fairly decent aftershock, something else happens to this 
place," Lamia said. "This house is trashed." 
</P>
<P>
 Still unable to sleep two weeks after their bedroom window crashed down onto 
their pastel comforter, the Lamias have their own theory about the earthquake's 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their own personal wake-up call, they say -- a rattling, jouncing, 
petrifying signal that they should leave Southern California. Immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they still have a hefty mortgage on their Cochran Street home, the 
Lamias left for Arizona on Saturday, along with 2-year-old Anthony and year-old 
Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
 They have applied for federal assistance to cover the deductible on their 
earthquake insurance policy and to help pay for extensive repairs. But they're 
not going to stick around to check up on the contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked my dad one question: 'Does Arizona shake?' " said Joe Lamia, whose 
parents live near Phoenix. "He said no. I said, 'I'm there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Kraenkel had the same reaction when the quake struck her Simi Valley 
home, dashing furniture, dishes and her young son to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she has had a chance to calm down and she is prepared to stay in Simi 
Valley, reasoning that disasters can strike anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But her eyes still glisten with tears at every new tremor. And Kraenkel, a 
receptionist at Mitchell Realtors on Tapo Canyon Road, keeps a safari helmet 
next to the potted fern on her desk -- just in case an aftershock tosses shards 
of glass her way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel better," she said, patting the helmet's hard shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their fear and anger at the quake, the Lamias and Kraenkel agree with 
the garage door hypothesis: a natural disaster breeds camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors barbecue swiftly defrosting steaks for a darkened block, colleagues 
dive under desks together at the first rumble of an aftershock, strangers share 
information about the best way to snag federal loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, that's always been a real strength of our community," Stratton said. 
The quake, the mayor added, "has been binding people together to work against a 
common enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar spirit has motivated the intensive cleanup work on the other end of 
the Moorpark Freeway, at the hard-hit Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairing the collapsed metal ceiling and buying new books to replace 10,000 
waterlogged volumes will cost at least $2 million, said Steve Brogden, deputy 
director of library services. He expects the library to reopen in four to eight 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, librarians in jeans, sneakers and face masks pick through the 
books in the library, scrutinizing each page for flecks of mold. A single mold 
spore can multiply and spread through an entire shelf, ruining hundreds of 
books and potentially creating respiratory problems for asthmatic readers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just breaks your heart to throw them away," librarian Chris Stensvold said 
as she sorted children's books in a putrid-smelling wing of the library. 
Nearby, a wheelbarrow full of moldy stuffed animals stood ready for the trash, 
a plush green parakeet tossed haphazardly atop a solemn owl and a perky pink 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The librarians have also been busy moving some key reference material to the 
Newbury Park branch. Digging through the rubble in the Thousand Oaks Library, 
they found a few handy guides for earthquake victims, including a thick, black 
binder full of information on federal grants and books on replacing china and 
repairing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most popular volume, senior librarian Susan Odencrantz said, is an 
almanac listing the best cities to live in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been the favorite book around here," she said.

CITY STILL ANGUISHES OVER DEATH OF FOOTBALL PLAYER; VENTURA: WHILE THE KILLER 
OF JESSE STROBEL, 17, REMAINS AT LARGE, OFFICIALS STRUGGLE TO MAKE SCHOOLS AND 
STREETS SAFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The anguished questions started just days after 17-year-old Ventura High 
football player Jesse Owen Martin Strobel was stabbed to death as he walked 
home on Jan. 29, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are children being killed in our streets? anxious residents asked police 
and city leaders. What can be done to make our schools safer? parents demanded 
at a town hall meeting attended by 700 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The most poignant questions came from members of Strobel's own family: Who 
killed our son and why? And will his death be in vain? 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, many of those questions remain unanswered. Nabbing Jesse's 
killer -- who is still at large -- has become more difficult than officials 
first anticipated. With each passing day, the trail leading to the killer grows 
colder, police admit. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to make Ventura's two high schools safer have been met with mixed 
reactions. Tighter dress codes have been accepted, but residents are still 
battling over the closure of a major road near Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 And the city's ability to stem the growing gang problem that police say 
contributed to Jesse's death is making little headway. Meanwhile, members of 
Strobel's family have struggled to cope with their loss in their own way.

<P>
 Jesse's father, John Strobel IV, canceled his newspaper subscription and 
stopped watching television for a year. His mother, Claudia Strobel, became 
distrustful of strangers and for many months, could not bring herself to say 
the word murder . 
</P>
<P>
 She is still trying to navigate the delicate line between moving on with her 
life and remembering her first-born son, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like he's in every breath I take," she said. "I'll never be over 
it. My heart will always be broken." 
</P>
<P>
 The crime touched Ventura residents in a way that other homicides in the city 
had not. Jesse was a good boy from a good family, citizens said repeatedly at a 
dozen forums convened after his death. 
</P>
<P>
 He performed well academically, practiced the saxophone and played defensive 
end on the varsity football team. He didn't belong to a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 His attack came as he walked home from his father's pizzeria, where he worked 
part time after school delivering pies and washing dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse's slaying struck at the very core of Ventura's middle-class 
sensibilities. If this could happen to Jesse, residents gasped, it could happen 
to my son or daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe more than one assailant jumped Jesse Strobel on North 
Catalina Street shortly before midnight last Jan. 29. He was found lying on the 
porch of a house and was taken by ambulance to Ventura County Medical Center, 
where he died at 1:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks before the stabbing, Jesse was allegedly threatened by Ventura 
High gang members who had beaten his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented display of concern about gang violence, nearly 700 Ventura 
residents packed a town hall meeting called Feb. 10 by city officials to 
discuss what can be done to prevent further bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse's father and grandfather also created a grass-roots citizens group, 
called SOS Jesse, to raise awareness about the rise of gangs and gang-related 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 And school administrators responded by passing several measures designed to 
tighten security at the city's two high school campuses. The school board 
adopted a new dress code that banned hats and other headgear favored by gangs, 
and restricted lunch time passes to go off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also closed a section of Poli Street that runs directly behind the 
school to reduce the chance of drive-by shootings. Educators had talked for 
more than two decades about closing the major thoroughfare, but it took Jesse's 
death to make it become reality, said school board member Velma Lomax. 
</P>
<P>
 The security measures have had a beneficial effect on parents, teachers and 
students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has heightened awareness of violence on campus and in our neighborhoods," 
Lomax said. "But I don't think we should let our guard down yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides those changes, there is little visible evidence to show that anything 
has changed in the city to protect children from further violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge always is how do you maintain that kind of momentum," said 
Ventura Mayor Tom Buford. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford said the city has an array of programs designed to reach out to 
troubled youths. Volunteer groups labor to offer children a place to play and 
activities to keep them busy after school and have been in place in Ventura for 
many years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Police Department has officers trained specifically to find out about 
possible gang fights and other planned violence before it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Buford, "there is no one particular program or organization that is 
going to solve the problem of gang violence by itself. The work is ongoing and 
it is not always visible." 
</P>
<P>
 For the family and for police, the most frustrating aspect of Jesse's death is 
the fact that no one has been arrested. Detectives have interviewed hundreds of 
people and believe that Jesse was the intended target of the attack. They also 
believe there were several witnesses to the slaying.  
</P>
<P>
 But no one has stepped forward to give evidence needed to make an arrest, Lt. 
Brad Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The puzzle is not complete until you get all the pieces," Talbot said. "And 
until we get those pieces, we don't have a case that we can submit to the 
district attorney's office." 
</P>
<P>
 Talbot, who heads the detective division, said police have investigated 
several new leads over the past six months. But all have come to dead ends, he 
said. Detectives continue to investigate any new tips as they come in, Talbot 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the possibility of an arrest becomes less likely each day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As time drags on, it makes it more difficult to gather the evidence we need," 
he said. "People's memory fades." 
</P>
<P>
 John Strobel said he is satisfied with the police effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to have them find someone and convict them," he said. "But I 
know this isn't Hollywood -- every story doesn't have a tidy ending. They are 
working on it and I have a high regard for what they have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Strobel said he dropped out of SOS Jesse after a few months because dredging 
up the circumstances of Jesse's death time and time again became too painful. 
The group has been inactive for several months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I went to a meeting and started talking about it, it just hurt too 
much," Strobel said. "It brings on feelings that aren't going to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Strobel said he has thrown himself into his business, selling pizza at a small 
shop in the Pierpont area. Still, he said, Jesse creeps into his consciousness 
several times a day. It has been particularly difficult in the days leading up 
to the first-year anniversary of his son's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was robbed," Strobel said, his voice breaking. "I'm never going to hold his 
children. I've never going to have the joy of watching him graduate from 
Ventura High. I miss him a lot. I miss him tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Strobel said the past year has been a nightmare for her emotionally. 
She has become more guarded of her family and doesn't trust strangers. She 
eventually sought counseling from therapists at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center in Oxnard in an effort to get control of her grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it feels utterly unbearable, I breathe and ask Jesus to help and he 
does," she said in a letter to The Times. "It's been an awesome spiritual 
warfare." 
</P>
<P>
 The sorrow of losing her son has been so intense it's "incomprehensible," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should know such grief, but I do. . . . Grief will be my companion for 
the rest of my life," she said. A Mother's Letter 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 29th last year I lost my son, Jesse. I still find it hard to believe.  
</P>
<P>
 Unless it's happened to you, you don't know how painful it is to lose your own 
precious child to such a senseless, violent death. The fact that it was 
intentional is insane to me. No one in his right mind, knowing Jesse, would 
have murdered him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse didn't have a mean bone in his body. He had the character of a "true 
blue" friend. He had integrity and was responsible beyond his age. He had his 
whole life ahead of him.  
</P>
<P>
 Nothing has meant more to me than my children. My children are not neglected. 
I handpicked every one of their teachers until they got into middle school. I 
made Jesse be accountable, and he was. He was not associated with any gangs, as 
has been printed by some media, nor was he abusing drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 He was on his way home -- doing what he was supposed to be doing. He was 
attacked and brutally murdered. We have no idea why. He stood 6'4" and there 
were no signs of resistance on his body. I can't imagine the shock and terror 
of what happened to him that night. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't understand how so many people seem to know who killed him but refuse 
to talk.  
</P>
<P>
 Our lives will never, ever be the same. The grief is so intense, it's 
incomprehensible. No one should know such grief. But I do. And I know others 
do, too. Grief will be my companion for the rest of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been asked what I think about the closure of Poli Street. I think it's a 
good thing. City traffic does not belong driving through a high school campus. 
The closing of the hillside streets, though, is wrong. It puts those who may 
need an ambulance, fire truck or police car at a greater risk when blockades 
are up and time is of the essence.  
</P>
<P>
 And, personally, I resent being forced to drive where I saw my son's bloody 
handprints in the street where he collapsed and crawled to the nearest house 
for help, before he died alone on someone's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 Honestly, at times, I don't know what's kept me from going insane. When it 
feels utterly unbearable, I breathe and ask Jesus to help me and He does. It's 
been an awesome spiritual warfare. Every day is truly a miracle to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 I am deeply grateful to all those who have prayed for us and continue to do 
so. I am grateful to those who gave their time, money, food and flowers. I am 
grateful for those who cared enough to reach out to us, even through it felt 
awkward to them to say, "I care" and "I loved Jesse, too." I am grateful that 
St. John's Medical Center offers bereavement counseling free of charge.  
</P>
<P>
 God promised He would not leave me comfortless. In my darkest hour, He sent me 
a guardian angel and the simple fact that I am still alive is testimony to His 
word. 
</P>
<P>
 God bless you all.

EXECUTIVES TO REVIVE BUREAU FOR TOURISM; OXNARD: AGENCY, WHICH FELL VICTIM TO 
BUDGET CUTS THREE YEARS AGO, STARTS ITS COMEBACK THIS WEEK WITH $75,000 IN CITY 
SEED MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to pull Oxnard's tourism industry out of a nose-dive, business leaders 
are preparing to resurrect the city's visitors bureau which fell victim to 
budget cuts three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greater Oxnard and Harbors Tourism Bureau will start its comeback in 
earnest this week when the city pours $75,000 in seed money into the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau's board members currently are fashioning an advertising campaign 
and searching for an executive director to head the agency which hopes to lure 
tourists to Oxnard with the promise of unspoiled beaches and uncrowded harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two weeks, the bureau is expected to be doing business at the historic 
Heritage Square office complex in downtown Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oxnard is a wonderful but well-kept secret," said Michael Koutnik, president 
of the tourism bureau and a longtime Oxnard businessman. "If I have one 
mandate, it is that we are now going to share our secret with the rest of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of the new campaign is a proposal to boost the city's bed tax to 
help pay for the effort to lure tourists and their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed increase -- from 9% to 10% -- is expected to generate hundreds of 
thousands of dollars each year in new revenue for the city. Hotel operators say 
they are willing to support the increased bed tax in return for a renewed 
commitment to promote Oxnard as a vacation destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members are scheduled to consider the matter Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really something that we all feel has been overdue," said Renee 
Spingola, sales director for the Financial Plaza Hilton. "When you say Oxnard, 
people really don't know where it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Burk, marketing director for the Radisson Suite Hotel, said the 1% 
increase will raise Oxnard's bed tax to the same level as that charged by 
hotels in Ventura and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel we are going to be at a disadvantage," Burk said. "And we feel 
this is going to create additional dollars that are going to be put into the 
promotion of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Oxnard's old tourism bureau folded in 1991, the city has seen hotel bed 
tax revenue slump nearly $300,000, twice the drop experienced by neighboring 
Ventura which has maintained its visitors bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard also has lost sales tax revenue as fewer tourists have come to town to 
spend money, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tourism trade has been choked, in part, by recession and gloomy weather in 
recent years. But business leaders and city officials say that the absence of a 
tourism bureau has only served to exacerbate that slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been three years without a bureau which has the effect of being 
invisible in the tourism world," said Steve Kinney, the city's economic 
development director. "This is an effort to bend that trend line upward again 
and start to recapture some of the losses over the past few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, the City Council last month agreed to spend $211,000, 
including the $75,000 in seed money, to fund the first five months of the new 
tourism bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the agreement, the visitors bureau must come up with an additional 
$37,500 in start-up funds from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the bureau's five-year spending plan, the council will be asked 
to spend about $1.6 million in support of the tourism campaign over the next 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But by fiscal year 1996-97, when the council will be asked to spend $373,000 
toward that effort, the city expects to receive $420,000 in return from the 
increased bed tax and other tourism-related sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "City government just doesn't have a lot of discretionary money to fund new 
projects, so the bureau needs to be self-supporting," said Liz Stuart, director 
of sales for the Mandalay Beach Resort. "I think once people are aware of what 
we have, they will come to visit." 
</P>
<P>
 Koutnik said the bureau hopes to immediately tap into the 8 million potential 
tourists in Southern California. And he said he expects the tourism bureau to 
produce results by this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If, in fact, the ship is or has been stalled in the water or drifting 
backwards, it will take us awhile to get the momentum up," he said. "But if the 
weather cooperates, I think we're going to have some dramatic increases." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Burk from Radisson Suite: "Our story is good. The place we are talking 
about, what we are trying to sell, is good. I think the overall effort is going 
to be terrific."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; ARSON SUSPECTED IN VEGETATION FIRE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A tough-to-reach vegetation fire burned about 20 acres in the Santa Clara 
riverbed late Saturday, creating an orange glow in the sky between Ventura and 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire -- which started in several spots and then burned together -- was 
reported to the Oxnard Fire Department at 7:30 p.m. and was about 90% contained 
shortly after 9 p.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura city firefighters carried hoses through several hundred yards of thick 
bamboo to reach the front line of flames. Water was pumped from three tankers. 
Eight engines, one helicopter and one bulldozer also were assigned to the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearest structure to the flames was radio station KBBY-FM on Olivas Park 
Drive, which firefighters used as a base for equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials believe the fire was arson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's probably mischievous," said Ventura Battalion Chief Brian 
Gordon. "We had three separate spots that were quite a ways away from each 
other." JULIE FIELDS

 A tip from county firefighters in Thousand Oaks led to the arrest of an 
18-year-old man on suspicion of vandalizing a city sign, authorities said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Anthony Brewer was cited for misdemeanor vandalism Friday night and 
released, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, an engine company of firefighters saw someone running from a 
freshly spray-painted city sign near Lynn Road and Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearby sheriff's deputy saw a car leaving, and interviewed the driver and 
passengers, but made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies working in Thousand Oaks later identified Brewer as the suspect.

<P>
 Ventura police arrested three teen-age boys early Saturday on suspicion of 
ambushing and robbing a Domino's Pizza deliveryman at a house on the city's 
west side, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong-arm robbery occurred about 12:40 a.m. when three or four suspects 
attacked the deliveryman as he was knocking on a door in the 200 block of West 
Flint Street.They punched and kicked the driver before making off with several 
pizzas, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver then returned to his store and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers went to the house from which the original pizza order had been 
placed, and questioned several people there. During a search of the house, they 
found six alleged gang members in a back bedroom. All six were taken to the 
Ventura Police Station for questioning and three, ages 15 to 17, were arrested 
and booked into Juvenile Hall, said Officer Ralph Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is continuing. JULIE FIELDS

CONSERVATIVE PARENTS SPEAK OUT IN MOORPARK; EDUCATION: THE ACTIVISTS ARE HAVING 
AN EFFECT ON LOCAL POLICY. LATEST BATTLE INVOLVED FOUR BOOKS ON STUDENTS' 
READING LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR., SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The issue was whether the Moorpark Unified School District should continue to 
recommend that 11th-graders read four Jean Auel novels some said are sexually 
explicit and offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting was a marathon meeting of the Moorpark school board. 
</P>
<P>
 And standing behind the speaker's podium, again representing her religious and 
conservative ideals and an increasingly vocal constituency, was Moorpark 
resident Helen Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt strongly that I needed to stand up for what I believe in," said 
Taylor, a community activist and failed mayoral and school board candidate. "I 
was shocked when I found out that books that had that kind of content were on 
the recommended reading list." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the school board early Wednesday voted 4 to 1 to keep the books on 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a concession aimed at dissenting board member Tom Baldwin and the vocal 
contingent that objected to the books, the board agreed that parents should be 
provided a synopsis of every title on the reading list and that the document 
itself should include a warning telling parents that some of the books may 
contain "adult" material. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say the battle over "Clan of the Cave Bear" and other Auel 
books, as well as the end result, are indicative of a growing activism among 
religious conservatives in Moorpark and the slow but steady effect they are 
having on local policy.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we're being slowly pushed to the right," said Baldwin, a board 
member with strong religious beliefs who labels himself politically left of 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, though, I haven't felt that we've been pushed anywhere that we 
shouldn't be. In every way that the members of Moorpark's conservative 
community have influenced the school district, I feel they've influenced it for 
the better." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin and board members who consider themselves even more liberal agree that 
conservative parents have a right to try to shape district policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything wrong with the fact that conservative groups are 
organizing and petitioning the school board for what they feel are issues and 
actions in the best interests of their children," said board member Clint 
Harper, a liberal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I don't agree with them all the time, my feeling as a school board 
member is that we have to embrace them rather than fight them. We need to bring 
them into the process," Harper said. "They have to be active participants 
accepted within the system." 
</P>
<P>
 An increasing number of Moorpark conservatives are demanding that they be 
recognized as active participants with valid points of view, particularly in 
relation to school issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "This community is filled with young families who are very interested in their 
children, and I think a growing number of them are fed up with a school 
district that doesn't care about their views," said Errol Hale, pastor of 
Shiloh Community Church and an outspoken Moorpark conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that the books aren't the issue," Hale said. "It's a 
philosophical difference between a district administration and teachers who 
will stand up all night long to justify the use of books that parents don't 
want recommended to their children." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frank DePasquale, the district's assistant superintendent for instruction, 
rejected the criticism, saying educators have taken conservative views into 
account and will continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to winning some concessions on the Auel decision, DePasquale said 
conservative opinion helped shape an abstinence-based sex-education curriculum 
adopted by the district last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conservative voices on the Growth and Development Committee did have an 
impact on our curriculum," DePasquale said. "It's a very restrictive 
curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who served on the advisory committee, said she supported its desire to 
stress abstinence but still objects to a recommendation to include some sex 
education as early as kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought long and hard to get it out of the early elementary grades," she 
said. "That was my biggest complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 As in the case of the Auel decision, however, Moorpark conservatives are not 
walking away from such battles empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we're seeing now is that the conservative majority that has 
existed for many years, not just in Moorpark but in Simi Valley as well, is 
really asserting our own rights," said Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery, 
the council's staunchest conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways, they've been trampled over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, conservatives say they are made to feel like outcasts when approaching 
teachers or administrators with concerns, and even some school officials 
concede that the district must do a better job dealing with the now-vocal 
contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I see happening in our district, unfortunately, is that the people who 
run the district -- the school board and the administration -- very often see 
groups like the ones we're seeing organized as a threat," Harper said. "They 
put up this line of defense. I see it as fundamental to education that you 
allow a wide variety of opinions and views. If educators can't embrace a wide 
range of philosophies, who can?" 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said the five-hour hearing on the Auel books evidenced how conservative 
thought is sometimes received in Moorpark. During the stormy, often-bitter 
session, critics of Auel's work were accused of supporting repression and 
censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "They label people who come out and say, 'I don't want books on the 
recommended reading list that give detailed descriptions of oral sex' right 
wing," Taylor said. "They consider the Ku Klux Klan right wing and then 
consider parents who don't want a certain book on the reading list right wing 
and it just seems like there should be a dividing line at some point." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Taylor said she and her fellow conservatives will continue to 
pick their battles where they see them, taking advantage of opportunities to 
bring Moorpark school philosophies more in line with their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just take it as it comes," Taylor said. "Usually conservatives, they're 
more quiet. A lot of time they don't make a big scene and they don't have a 
loud voice. I think that people are feeling the need to join together and 
preserve our values, our conservative ideals, because they're under attack."

CITY ORDERS ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY ON PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT; THOUSAND OAKS: THE 
COUNCIL IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS THE LARGE ADVENTIST PROJECT COULD HAVE 
ON SMALLER BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski says she's as happy as anyone when big-name 
department or discount stores move into Thousand Oaks and start sending a gush 
of sales-tax dollars to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But every jingling cash register at a Circuit City or Home Depot sparks fear 
as well as excitement, Zukowski says. Her primary concern: that large chains 
are driving long-established mom-and-pop stores out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 To help determine just how much the so-called "big box majors" affect small 
family businesses, the Thousand Oaks City Council has ordered up an economic 
impact study assessing a proposed development on the Seventh Day Adventist 
property in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in an unusual step to ensure the study's objectivity, the council has 
requested that city staff -- not the developers -- work directly with the 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past few years, there has been this competition among cities to pack 
in what they can in terms of big box users, and sometimes the decision-making 
is not based on the healthiest economic or community principles," Zukowski 
said, explaining the rationale for ordering an economic impact study on the 
Adventist development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's often looked at as 'Hey, there's a big chunk of sales tax dollars coming 
from one company,' and it's true, there is a big injection of income," Zukowski 
said. "But you have to also talk about the other businesses that are affected, 
because they have given a lot to the community in ways that may not always be 
measured." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's last attempt to assess the economic impact of a proposed retail 
center came more than a decade ago, when a consultant evaluated plans to build 
a major strip mall on the Cohan property in Newbury Park -- a project that 
later collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other such study was commissioned for The Oaks mall, back in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the size and scope of the Adventist proposal -- which calls for a 
bevy of one-story buildings on a parcel the size of The Oaks shopping center 
and parking lot -- the council decided last month to step in. The Adventists 
will pay the $29,400 consultant fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rare that the city would require this kind of study," senior planner 
Lawrence Marquart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But people in the community have raised the questions: 'What about the 
commercial businesses that are teetering on the brink? What will the infusion 
of 85 additional acres of commercial space do to existing businesses?' 
"Marquart said. "Those are valid questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Most small-business owners already think they have the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of David-and-Goliath battles against Kmart, Toys R Us, Office 
Depot and other national chains, they greet the prospect of more competition 
with weary resignation -- but surprisingly not outright pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurs who have survived Thousand Oaks' first influx of discount stores 
are reasonably confident that they will keep most of their customers even if a 
Target, Mervyn's or Staples moves into the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I despise Circuit City," said Dennis Grodman, owner of a television and video 
store on Thousand Oaks Boulevard. "But a place like that wouldn't put us out of 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Grodman, like other small-business owners, said he has found a niche -- in his 
case, quick repairs and free, immediate delivery -- that allows him to compete 
with the big chains. He checks out Circuit City's sales once a week and adjusts 
his prices accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy worked for Councilman Frank Schillo, who said his recent 
purchase of a television set at Grodman's -- after some serious comparison 
shopping -- persuaded him that the little guy can compete with national chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot believe that when one business comes in, another one goes out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo will get a chance to test the scientific validity of his gut instinct 
when the economic impact study is released in the next six weeks. An 
environmental impact report on the Adventist project is also in the works, and 
should be available for review in March. 
</P>
<P>
 While they wait for the consultants' reports, Adventist property developers 
have been busy with some paperwork of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 They recently filed applications for a zone change on part of their 400-acre 
parcel adjacent to the Rancho Conejo Industrial Center, just north of the Wendy 
Drive interchange at the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Project directors Francisco Behr and Dale Ortmann would like permission to 
change the zoning so they can build retail centers, restaurants and perhaps a 
multiplex cinema on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 They would like to replace the current hodgepodge of Adventist buildings -- a 
boxy yellow school, rambling equestrian center and tidy senior citizen 
bungalows -- with a modern commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, the project would include a sprawling Target store and two 
other major chains, including a discount warehouse. A separate building -- also 
one-story with a red tile roof -- would house smaller stores, strip-mall style. 
</P>
<P>
 A third phase of construction might bring in a food court and entertainment 
plaza filled with bookstores, record stores and movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council will decide Tuesday whether to hold a study 
session next month to explore the project's details. Formal public hearings are 
expected to begin in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the Adventist team has zeroed in on its key argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousands of people go over the Conejo Grade to shop, taking their money out 
of the city," architect Behr said. "This project will give the city an 
opportunity to stop the leakage of sales-tax dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 If their commercial development wins council approval, the Adventist Church 
would move its school, sanctuary and senior housing to a now vacant church 
property. The Seventh Day Adventists own more than 400 acres in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate shoppers' traffic in the new mall, they would redesign the 
freeway exit and extend Wendy Drive north. 
</P>
<P>
 Building the new road, installing utilities and readying the site for 
construction would cost the Adventist Church at least $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that price tag, each individual tenant would pay for building a 
chunk of the commercial center. Target, for example, might have to spend $10 
million to purchase a plot of land and build its store according to the 
Adventist Church's strict design criteria, Ortmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the huge expense, Adventist leaders confidently predict they will 
attract tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 They are certain the economic impact study will show that Thousand Oaks needs 
a new regional shopping center, especially now that biotechnology giant Amgen 
has announced plans to hire thousands more workers over the next decade. Amgen, 
Baxter Labs and Blue Cross are all located just a few miles from the Adventist 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Also working in the Adventist Church's favor, the Conejo Valley retail vacancy 
rate has dropped to 7%, the lowest in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Adventists' competitors agree that the area can absorb another mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will only change retail for the positive," said Barbara Teuscher, 
general manager of The Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Thousand Oaks bargain-hunters now travel to Simi Valley or Oxnard 
for discount stores, Teuscher said the Adventist project could convince more 
residents to shop locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Another boon for the local sales-tax pot will be renovations at the Janss 
Mall, including the addition of a Mervyn's department store, a Barnes & Noble 
bookstore, The Wherehouse record store and The Good Guys electronic store.  
</P>
<P>
 "New stores improve business because they draw more people to a community," 
Teuscher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone wants to see retail along Thousand Oaks Boulevard 
destroyed, and the city has an obligation to protect that," she said. "But it's 
not the kind of situation where you build something and then every shop across 
the street goes down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracey Benedict, owner of The Bookaneer on Thousand Oaks Boulevard, agreed. 
The presence of another Barnes & Noble or Crown Books would make her job 
tougher, she said, but customers seeking "the personality of a small business" 
still flock to her tiny store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put it this way," she said. "I would be happy if (the national chains) don't 
come in. But we do have a special niche. I don't think they would drive us out 
of business."

STRONG AFTERSHOCK CAUSES LITTLE DAMAGE IN COUNTY; IMPACT: THE 5.0 TEMBLOR 
FURTHER JANGLES RESIDENTS' NERVES AND MAY HAVE CAUSED A GARAGE FIRE IN THOUSAND 
OAKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 5.0 aftershock that jolted Ventura County residents awake at 3:20 a.m. 
Saturday caused little physical damage around the county, police and fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the area finally settling back into a routine, the American Red Cross 
announced Saturday that it will close the Piru School shelter after breakfast 
this morning and move the Simi Valley service center Monday morning. The 
center, now at Sycamore Drive Community Center at 1692 Sycamore Drive, will 
move to 1494 Madera Road, Suite B. 
</P>
<P>
 In place of the Piru shelter, the Red Cross will set up a feeding site at an 
as yet undecided location, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The one reported incident of physical damage involved a garage fire in 
Thousand Oaks, a blaze that fire officials said may be linked to the early 
morning temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors on El Cerrito Drive heard an explosion just before 4:30 a.m., then 
saw flames coming from a garage and called the Fire Department, said Frank 
Whealon, a friend of the family that owns the residence. The family was on 
vacation in Lake Tahoe when the fire began, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire appears to have started when a water heater pulled away from the wall 
-- possibly as a result of the earthquake -- and knocked loose a gas pipe, 
Whealon said. Gas from the pipe may have drifted to the heater's pilot light, 
causing an explosion and igniting the fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire damaged the garage and an upstairs bedroom, Whealon said. Fire 
officials estimated the damage at about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, most county residents said they suffered more emotional disturbance 
than physical damage from the aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just won't stop -- they just keep on going," said Devon French, 21, a 
Simi Valley resident, of the thousands of aftershocks that have hit the area 
since the magnitude 6.6 quake Jan. 17. "We ran outside the house again this 
morning, and then we were up for a good hour. I was really scared." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tremors spurred Francisco Martinez, 32, of Fillmore to spend his morning 
at the local FEMA relief center, stocking up on canned goods to store in his 
van. "I just want to have it there in case a stronger one comes," he said, 
relaxing with his two young sons on a bench at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 He was supposed to spend his morning working at a construction job, but stayed 
home instead, he said. "I got afraid and didn't want to leave my family alone," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, were more sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to do?" said Ken Ing, owner of a Simi Valley Donut Inn 
franchise. Ing was frying his doughnuts at the store when the aftershock hit 
and sent him scurrying back from the stove fire. "It's an earthquake. Nobody 
can stop God."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AIRBORNE COMMUTERS TAKE FLIGHT FROM TRAFFIC TO 
AVOID GRIDLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the freeways slowed to a nightmarish crawl and the trains leaving well 
before dawn, it was only a matter of time until some people looked to the skies 
for relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing an earthquake-borne business opportunity when they see one, a 
number of small aviation companies have rushed to offer service connecting the 
Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys with the San Fernando Valley and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest entry in the field is Heli USA, a Santa Monica-based helicopter 
company that began shuttling people between an impromptu helipad at Saugus 
Speedway and Van Nuys and Santa Monica airports Thursday. It has the capacity 
to serve 400 passengers a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was delightful," said first-time chopper commuter John Peterson of the 
10-minute ride, which is accompanied by classical music. "It's smooth as silk; 
you're pampered -- very relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed aside, it's definitely a cool commute," added Peterson, who lives in 
Beverly Hills and is an advertising agency executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Northridge earthquake, a pair of Van Nuys companies -- Key 
West Air and Atlantis Aviation Services -- teamed up to offer on-demand service 
-- virtually an airborne taxicab -- between William J. Fox Airfield in 
Lancaster and Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 A flight school based at Van Nuys Airport also joined the rush, hoping to 
match private pilots with desperate commuters looking for someone to ferry them 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Quan, a masseur who lives in Valencia, took a helicopter from Saugus to 
Van Nuys on Thursday because, he said, it was the only realistic way to reach 
his Westside clients, who footed the bill for his $98 round-trip flight.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get in . . . but the traffic was horrible," he said. "My clients 
were willing to spring for the helicopter because they didn't want me stressed 
working on their stress." He expects to make the client-sponsored trip twice a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding traffic at any cost is what it's all about, say airborne travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopter passenger Peterson had driven from his Beverly Hills office to 
Santa Clarita on Wednesday. Once was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 His problem: He had to get materials to a client by 10 a.m. Thursday, and he 
figured his cellular phone bill alone from sitting four hours on the freeways 
would have exceeded what he paid for the round-trip helicopter ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Flights in Atlantis Aviation's four-seat Cessna 172s take just 25 minutes from 
Lancaster to Van Nuys, hours less than the traffic-jammed road commutes that 
have become part of life on the south end of the Santa Clarita Valley since the 
quake knocked down portions of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-way ticket on Heli USA is $59; round-trip tickets are discounted to $49 
each way. The trip to Santa Monica is $79 each way from Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuting in fixed-wing aircraft isn't much cheaper. Key West/Atlantis 
Aviation is charging $33 each way between Lancaster and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "That probably doesn't appeal to the low-end consumer," said Lance Alsheimer, 
chief pilot at Atlantis. "There are lawyers and actors who do (fly). Their time 
is worth a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Kurasch is neither a lawyer nor an actor, but she said flying between 
Van Nuys and Lancaster is "cheaper than a cab." 
</P>
<P>
 As owner of a Santa Monica video production company making a music video in 
Lancaster, she needed to get there to check on things. Flying was the only 
reasonable way to get around, she said. Since the earthquake crippled the 
Southland freeway system, Kurasch said, her primary mode of transportation has 
been plane or helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 For Philippe Lesourd and his business partner visiting from France there's 
been no alternative but to fly. Lesourd, who lives in Valencia and co-owns an 
auto auction company, found it was faster to drive to Lancaster and hop on a 
plane to Van Nuys than to fight the gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cost is not a concern," Lesourd said. "Thirty-three dollars is nothing. . . . 
We can't spend six hours on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport-based Argosy Airways had hoped to run commuter service from 
the Antelope Valley but was unable to meet federal requirements. To offer 
scheduled air service, approvals are required from the federal Department of 
Transportation as well as the Federal Aviation Administration -- a process that 
can take up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For unscheduled flights -- flights on demand or air taxis -- the lengthy 
review is not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Argosy Airways is an approved air taxi service, it can offer on-demand 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody wants to charter me," said Argosy President Gail Black, "I could 
do it tomorrow." But, she said, to be both affordable to customers and 
profitable for business, she needs to offer scheduled service. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreational pilots are not allowed to haul passengers for hire. The only way 
a private pilot can transport people and take money for it is to equally share 
the costs with the passengers.  
</P>
<P>
 Julianne Feuerhelm's West Winds Aviation is trying to coordinate a fly-share 
program that would match up pilots with wanna-be plane commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 800 pilots in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys," she said. 
"There are 250 private aircraft owned by people in that area. We're trying to 
get the aircraft owners and people who would be interested in flying . . . 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 If the service can be arranged, Feuerhelm said, passengers would pay $15 to 
$70 depending on the number of people on board and the flight distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters may agree that driving is a hassle, but it's unknown whether they'll 
flock to air travel. Heli USA, for an additional $10, will shuttle passengers 
from the airport to their nearby final destinations. Other air passengers must 
fend for themselves once they touch ground -- which could mean costly cab or 
limo rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Business at SkyWest Airlines out of Palmdale Regional Airport was booming the 
first few days after the quake, said Ron Reber, senior vice president of 
marketing. But it has dropped off sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Jan. 17 quake, the company's six daily flights from Palmdale to Los 
Angeles International Airport were about 35% full, well below the 50% needed to 
break even. In the days immediately after the quake, the 19-passenger planes 
were 80% full. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased demand for the $59 one-way seats had officials of the Utah-based 
airline considering reversing their decision to halt service out of Palmdale 
effective March 1. But Reber said Thursday the company would still pull out of 
Palmdale as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the quake, the number of SkyWest passengers had decreased to just 
55% of capacity, he said.

DUARTE THEATER SAVED IN CLIFFHANGER; FINANCES: COMMUNITY PLAYHOUSE AVERTS 
CLOSURE OVER PAST-DUE RENT WITH THE HELP OF 'ANGELS' IN THE WINGS.

 The Duarte Center Theatre staged a nail-biter. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, however, took place offstage and threatened the future of the 
fledgling community theater. Fortunately for Duarte theater, a dramatic rescue 
enabled the show to go on. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the theater's director, Mary Bowman, was taking ticket orders recently 
for her company's season opening adaptation of Gilbert and Sullivan's 
"Ruddigore," she wasn't sure she had a venue from which to stage the satire. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman and the Duarte Center Theatre were locked out of the theater, at 2160 
E. Huntington Drive, earlier this month after being evicted for not paying 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, who is in her 60s and has been staging shows for 15 years, had not 
paid rent for the theater since she brought it to Duarte a year ago. She said 
that money has been tight because public support for the theater was building 
slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman's attorney, John Blackburn, said she had spent money improving the 
facility and that there was also a dispute, now resolved, over how much the 
landlord should pay of the improvements' costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest problem is being undercapitalized," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no question that Duarte Center Theatre owed landlord Harry Nazarian 
money. Municipal Court proceedings determined that the theater owed $18,708 in 
rent. "They never paid rent. They just kept giving excuses," said Diran 
Afarian, Nazarian's son-in-law and real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes were raised when Nazarian agreed in September to give Duarte Center 
Theatre another chance to enliven the Duarte arts scene. The compromise called 
for the theater to begin repaying a modest chunk of its debt on a payment 
schedule before resuming regular rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked out what we thought would be an exceptionally reasonable plan for 
them, but they haven't been able to comply," Peter E. Ronay, Nazarian's lawyer, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the opening date fast approaching, it looked like curtains for the Duarte 
Center Theatre's 1994 season. Then came the white knights. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Kevin Kaufman, the 43-year-old executive director of Broadway on 
Sunset, a North Hollywood-based theater company. "We are the only West Coast 
theater exclusively producing originals," said Kaufman, whose group is also 
sponsored by the Songwriter's Guild of America and features two-time Tony award 
winner Grover Dale as creative director. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman had planned to launch five original shows this year on the Duarte 
theater's cabaret stage. Two more were scheduled for the 99-seat main stage, 
including "American Twistory." 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership with Duarte Center Theatre elevates the status of the 
community theater, Kaufman said, while allowing him to reach new audiences. "We 
are interested in areas that are not saturated with theater and are interested 
in original musicals," Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Kaufman heard that Duarte's 1994 season might be lost, he had 
already sent out flyers and releases touting the partnership. To help save the 
season, Kaufman and his managing director, Ron Gaiser, lit into a frantic 
fund-raising drive that netted a couple of thousand dollars. Kaufman would not 
give an exact figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it for Duarte because of our interests," Kaufman said. But they were 
still short of the more than $8,000 that Duarte Center Theatre needed to get 
back the keys to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the city of Duarte pitched in. City Manager Jesse H. Duff authorized 
advance ticket purchases of $4,000 to aid the theater. Duff said the city will 
resell the tickets later. "We think they bring enough of value to the city to 
support them," Duff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined efforts of the city and Kaufman, along with last-minute donations 
Bowman was able to obtain, raised enough money to get the theater back in the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 The final hurdle was to resolve some lingering animus between Bowman and 
Nazarian. This was done in time for a rehearsal or two before preview shows 
Jan. 22 and Jan. 23 that played to a three-fourths and one-fourth capacity 
audience, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman welcomes the theater's new lease on life. "We know we can make it," she 
said.

COUNCIL FILLS TWO SEATS VACATED IN RECALL EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Bradbury City Council has appointed two new members to fill seats vacated 
in November's recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Mark Flewelling and Rick Barakat were the only candidates to file for 
the posts, the city made the appointments Monday in lieu of an election. 
</P>
<P>
 Flewelling, a business attorney and six-year Bradbury resident, was appointed 
to fill the seat of former Mayor Audrey Hon. Barakat, a business-owner and 
four-year resident, will fill the seat of former Councilman Tom Melbourn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hon and Melbourn were recalled in November, seven months after former City 
Manager Aurora (Dolly) Vollaire was fired for spending tens of thousands of 
city dollars on personal luxury items. Some residents complained that council 
members had failed to notice Vollaire's spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members new and old said Monday's appointments heralded a new era of 
clean government and community involvement in Bradbury.  
</P>
<P>
 "What I hope to do first is to restore confidence in City Hall," Flewelling 
said of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Flewelling said he hopes to more closely scrutinize city contracts, some of 
which he said never went to bid during Vollaire's term, and diversify the 
city's investments in order to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
 He also hopes to open the line of communication to city officials, and bring 
residents of the city's disparate council districts together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we need to restore a sense of community. Certainly the last year 
has been a tumultuous one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barakat won local fame when he dug through the city trash with resident Robert 
Penney Jr. last spring, uncovering city credit card receipts that betrayed 
Vollaire's expensive tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main thing is just to try to make it harmonious," he said. "I want to make 
our City Hall and its staff resident-friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 The new mix on the council should strengthen the city, he added.

ROBBINS MAKES PLEA TO KEEP REAL ESTATE LICENSE; COURTS: EX-VALLEY LEGISLATOR 
TELLS JUDGE HE SHOULDN'T BE DEPRIVED OF LIVELIHOOD OVER POLITICAL CORRUPTION 
CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former state Sen. Alan Robbins, looking haggard and thin after nearly 19 
months of imprisonment, has asked a judge to let him keep his real estate 
license, contending that he should not be deprived of his livelihood and 
punished again for pleading guilty to political corruption charges.  
</P>
<P>
 But an attorney representing the state Department of Real Estate, now seeking 
to revoke Robbins' license, told the same judge that Robbins was one of the 
"most highly destructive men in California history" who had not yet proven that 
he was rehabilitated and deserved to hold a real estate license. 
</P>
<P>
 After a five-hour hearing Friday, Administrative Law Judge Richard J. Lopez 
took the revocation matter under submission, saying he expected to issue his 
proposed order to state Real Estate Commissioner Clark Wallace in the next few 
weeks. Wallace will make his own decision based on Lopez's recommendations, 
although even Wallace's final ruling can be appealed in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was the Van Nuys Democrat's first public appearance since he was 
released Jan. 12 to a Hollywood halfway house after spending almost 19 months 
sentenced to the Lompoc federal work camp. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 1, 1992, Robbins pleaded guilty to racketeering and income tax 
falsification charges and agreed to work as an informant for federal 
investigators probing corruption in the state Capitol.  
</P>
<P>
 Robbins' guilty pleas ended the career of one of the state capital's most 
colorful and controversial figures. In the aftermath, the senator, who became 
wealthy in a series of real estate deals, was forced to resign from the state 
Senate and the California State Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went from being one of the most powerful," Robbins testified, "to being 
unable to decide which mop to use to mop the floor" in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, a long parade of character witnesses testified that Robbins 
was a man of high ethics in his business dealings and a paragon of government 
service.  
</P>
<P>
 Letters of support for Robbins came from former state Sen. Ed Davis, former 
Assemblymen Tom Bane and Jim Keysor, and former Los Angeles City Councilman Bob 
Ronka. UCLA Chancellor Charles Young also wrote a letter of support as did two 
rabbis, a priest and numerous realtors and developers. 
</P>
<P>
 James Montgomery, a leader in the San Fernando Valley chapter of the NAACP, 
testified that Robbins had a knack for "reaching down to help those who are 
unfortunate." Montgomery urged the judge to let his decision "come from the 
heart, not from the head." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Afriat, a City Hall political consultant and longtime Democratic party 
activist, recalled how Robbins had gone into gay and lesbian clubs to collect 
toys for the needy in his district when others who were homophobic would not. 
Asked if he would trust Robbins in a real estate deal, Afriat quipped that he 
wished Robbins would "sell my house in North Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Fuentes, a former top aide to City Atty. James K. Hahn, told the judge 
of how Robbins had carried difficult anti-gang legislation for Hahn in 
Sacramento.

SHOOTING DEATHS LINKED TO ASIAN GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two San Gabriel Valley youths died in separate incidents after shouting 
matches escalated into shootings outside a Hacienda Heights high school and an 
El Monte video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Barraza, 17, was shot three times in the chest about 3:10 p.m. Jan. 
20 after arguing with a carload of other teen-agers in the parking lot of Los 
Altos High School, said Lt. Leonard Tyko of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Barraza, a cornerback for the school's junior varsity football team, was 
pronounced dead on arrival at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina. No 
arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Donald White called the incident shocking and said nothing like it 
had ever happened at Los Altos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no evidence at all that there were any Los Altos students involved in 
this," he said. About 1,600 attend the high school. 
</P>
<P>
 White added that Los Altos was named a California Distinguished School last 
year, based on test scores and student achievement, by the state Department of 
Education. "We have one of the lowest suspension rates in the state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students and parents said Los Altos is a safe campus, but some students 
said they had friends who had brought guns to school, and they talked about 
tensions between an Asian gang and Latino students at Los Altos. Barraza's 
attackers were Asian, Tyko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barraza was described by teachers and fellow students as "a good kid, quiet 
and shy" and "a cool friend." Family members declined comment, but priests at 
St. John Vianney Church in Hacienda Heights, where Barraza's memorial service 
was held and where he was confirmed last year, said the youth had no known gang 
affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 An Asian gang is being blamed in another death, this time of a Vietnamese 
youth. Linh Bao Vuong, 14, of Alhambra was beaten and fatally shot outside the 
Arroyo Arcade in El Monte, Deputy Gabe Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vuong was approached by a carload of gang members as he and his friends left 
the video arcade and pool hall, at 10755 Lower Azusa Road, to use a pay phone 
about 10 p.m. Jan. 21, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four gang members shouted at Vuong and asked him for his gang affiliation, 
then began beating and kicking him. After Vuong was on the ground, one of the 
four shot him several times in the upper body with a handgun, witnesses said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AIRBORNE COMMUTERS TAKE FLIGHT FROM TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the freeways slowed to a nightmarish crawl and the trains leaving well 
before dawn, it was only a matter of time until some people looked to the skies 
for relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing an earthquake-borne business opportunity when they see one, a 
number of small aviation companies have rushed to offer service connecting the 
Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys with the San Fernando Valley and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest entry in the field is Heli USA, a Santa Monica-based helicopter 
company that began shuttling people between an impromptu helipad at Saugus 
Speedway and Van Nuys and Santa Monica airports Thursday. It has the capacity 
to serve 400 passengers a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was delightful," said first-time chopper commuter John Peterson of the 
10-minute ride, which is accompanied by classical music. "It's smooth as silk; 
you're pampered -- very relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed aside, it's definitely a cool commute," added Peterson, who lives in 
Beverly Hills and is an advertising agency executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Northridge earthquake, a pair of Van Nuys companies -- Key 
West Air and Atlantis Aviation Services -- teamed up to offer on-demand service 
-- virtually an airborne taxicab -- between William J. Fox Airfield in 
Lancaster and Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 A flight school based at Van Nuys Airport also joined the rush, hoping to 
match private pilots with desperate commuters looking for someone to ferry them 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Quan, a masseur who lives in Valencia, took a helicopter from Saugus to 
Van Nuys on Thursday because, he said, it was the only realistic way to reach 
his Westside clients, who footed the bill for his $98 round-trip flight.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get in . . . but the traffic was horrible," he said. "My clients 
were willing to spring for the helicopter because they didn't want me stressed 
working on their stress." He expects to make the client-sponsored trip twice a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding traffic at any cost is what it's all about, say airborne travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopter passenger Peterson had driven from his Beverly Hills office to 
Santa Clarita on Wednesday. Once was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 His problem: He had to get materials to a client by 10 a.m. Thursday, and he 
figured his cellular phone bill alone from sitting four hours on the freeways 
would have exceeded what he paid for the round-trip helicopter ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Flights in Atlantis Aviation's four-seat Cessna 172s take just 25 minutes from 
Lancaster to Van Nuys, hours less than the traffic-jammed road commutes that 
have become part of life on the south end of the Santa Clarita Valley since the 
quake knocked down portions of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-way ticket on Heli USA is $59; round-trip tickets are discounted to $49 
each way. The trip to Santa Monica is $79 each way from Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuting in fixed-wing aircraft isn't much cheaper. Key West/Atlantis 
Aviation is charging $33 each way between Lancaster and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "That probably doesn't appeal to the low-end consumer," said Lance Alsheimer, 
chief pilot at Atlantis. "There are lawyers and actors who do (fly). Their time 
is worth a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Kurasch is neither a lawyer nor an actor, but she said flying between 
Van Nuys and Lancaster is "cheaper than a cab." 
</P>
<P>
 As owner of a Santa Monica video production company making a music video in 
Lancaster, she needed to get there to check on things. Flying was the only 
reasonable way to get around, she said. Since the earthquake crippled the 
Southland freeway system, Kurasch said, her primary mode of transportation has 
been plane or helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 For Philippe Lesourd and his business partner visiting from France there's 
been no alternative but to fly. Lesourd, who lives in Valencia and co-owns an 
auto auction company, found it was faster to drive to Lancaster and hop on a 
plane to Van Nuys than to fight the gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cost is not a concern," Lesourd said. "Thirty-three dollars is nothing. . . . 
We can't spend six hours on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport-based Argosy Airways had hoped to run commuter service from 
the Antelope Valley but was unable to meet federal requirements. To offer 
scheduled air service, approvals are required from the federal Department of 
Transportation as well as the Federal Aviation Administration -- a process that 
can take up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For unscheduled flights -- flights on demand or air taxis -- the lengthy 
review is not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Argosy Airways is an approved air taxi service, it can offer on-demand 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody wants to charter me," said Argosy President Gail Black, "I could 
do it tomorrow." But, she said, to be both affordable to customers and 
profitable for business, she needs to offer scheduled service. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreational pilots are not allowed to haul passengers for hire. The only way 
a private pilot can transport people and take money for it is to equally share 
the costs with the passengers.  
</P>
<P>
 Julianne Feuerhelm's West Winds Aviation is trying to coordinate a fly-share 
program that would match up pilots with wanna-be plane commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 800 pilots in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys," she said. 
"There are 250 private aircraft owned by people in that area. We're trying to 
get the aircraft owners and people who would be interested in flying . . . 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 If the service can be arranged, Feuerhelm said, passengers would pay $15 to 
$70 depending on the number of people on board and the flight distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters may agree that driving is a hassle, but it's unknown whether they'll 
flock to air travel. Heli USA, for an additional $10, will shuttle passengers 
from the airport to their nearby final destinations. Other air passengers must 
fend for themselves once they touch ground -- which could mean costly cab or 
limo rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Business at SkyWest Airlines out of Palmdale Regional Airport was booming the 
first few days after the quake, said Ron Reber, senior vice president of 
marketing. But it has dropped off sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Jan. 17 quake, the company's six daily flights from Palmdale to Los 
Angeles International Airport were about 35% full, well below the 50% needed to 
break even. In the days immediately after the quake, the 19-passenger planes 
were 80% full. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased demand for the $59 one-way seats had officials of the Utah-based 
airline considering reversing their decision to halt service out of Palmdale 
effective March 1. But Reber said Thursday the company would still pull out of 
Palmdale as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the quake, the number of SkyWest passengers had decreased to just 
55% of capacity, he said.

DOGFIGHT AT THE ZOO; KEEPERS AND OTHERS PROTEST SPENDING PRIORITIES OUTLINED IN 
$25-MILLION REMODELING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three chimpanzees wear expressions of extreme boredom on this hazy winter 
morning at the Los Angeles Zoo. Slouching atop an austere, 1960s faux rock 
outcropping, the primates lethargically link arms and stare blankly over the 
heads of their human visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 In their cramped quarters, devoid of dirt, grass or foliage, these highly 
intelligent creatures do not look very happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a wide consensus that the chimps' quarters should be remodeled, a 
coalition of zookeepers, curators and animals rights activists say zoo and city 
administrators are moving too slowly. That is why the zoo employees are loudly 
objecting to a $25-million zoo renovation plan that would do nothing to improve 
the chimp exhibit and many other outdated habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus has to be on the residents of the zoo, the animals," said one zoo 
supervisor who did not want his name used. "We have to sit down and look at the 
direction we are going." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Zoo administrators and city officials drew up the controversial 
spending plan, which would provide a new veterinary hospital, an educational 
center for schoolchildren, an expanded front entrance and a dramatic, 
multilevel habitat for polar bears and penguins. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics complain that the plan leans too heavily toward a few grand projects 
that would do little to enhance the lot of the animals. The dissident employees 
have called for the money, which comes from a 1992 property tax levy approved 
by voters, to be spent almost entirely on the zoo's outdated animal exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers' postcard and telephone campaign has succeeded in persuading Mayor 
Richard Riordan and City Council President John Ferraro to ask for a review of 
spending priorities at the city-owned zoo in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoo Director Mark Goldstein and others who helped draw up the list of 
priorities now say they are willing to re-examine it. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant's report due in the next several weeks is expected to help decide 
how the money will be spent, as well as suggesting ways to repair the 
deteriorating relationship between the employees and Goldstein. These local 
controversies have served to heighten a debate around the world about what a 
modern zoo should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoological directors agree that the "Noah's ark" approach -- collecting the 
largest and most varied menagerie -- is on the way out. But what will replace 
that is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is demanding to see animals in more humane and natural settings. 
Zoologists insist that the preservation and propagation of endangered species 
be preeminent. And government officials require that all this be done more 
efficiently, placing less of a drain on tax resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a dramatic change in philosophy in zoos from just collecting 
(animals) to a more holistic approach," Goldstein said. "At the same time, this 
zoo was built 27 years ago and now all the problems are coming to a head at 
once." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein said that although keepers can focus strictly on the care of 
animals, he must pay attention to overall planning, fund raising and the bottom 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter has not been good for the zoo in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance in 1993 barely broke 1.5 million, the lowest mark in eight years 
and 25% below the number of visitors in 1989, when the last major new exhibit 
opened. Total income for the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., the private, 
nonprofit organization that supports the zoo, has been essentially stagnant for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no wonder that passage of Proposition A, with its $25 million for zoo 
remodeling, was greeted as a seminal event in the zoo's history. 
</P>
<P>
 A general outline for use of the money was provided by a 1992 zoo master plan, 
completed after three years of study and public hearings. But it was a group of 
zoo administrators and city officials, headed by Goldstein, that took the 
outline and drew up the controversial spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memorandum, the group described and justified its choices this way: 
</P>
<P>
 * A new veterinary hospital, to be located about a mile from the zoo, would 
improve treatment and quarantine areas for all animals, particularly larger 
ones that now must be treated in their zoo quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 * An educational center would better accommodate the hundreds of thousands of 
schoolchildren who visit the zoo each year and who now rely on a handful of 
classrooms. An adjoining expanded front entrance would improve wheelchair 
access, offer a more comfortable spot for visitors to get acclimated and 
include an introductory animal exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 * The polar bear and penguin exhibit would become the long-sought attraction 
for the front of the zoo. A series of pools would be connected by running water 
and churned by a wave machine. Special viewing areas would allow visitors to 
see two of the zoo's most popular animals underwater as well as above ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the three projects combined would cost more than $37 million, zoo and 
city Recreation and Parks managers have said they are so confident of their 
popularity that they would be able to raise the balance through private 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 But curators and keepers complain that a veterinary center a mile from the zoo 
would be impractical and that the need for an education center has been 
exaggerated -- that the classrooms and an auditorium often stand empty. They 
note that the zoo's front entrance has been remodeled once. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't come here to see a new front entrance or an educational center," 
said a senior zoo supervisor. "They come to see the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 "You could fix a majority of the zoo with that money," said animal keeper 
Gretchen Schultz, who helped lead the campaign for new priorities. "It should 
go directly to the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 zoo employees have signed a petition calling for an overhaul of 
outdated exhibits, particularly the concrete enclosures that house the 
chimpanzees, several species of bears and many other top attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although these exhibits were considered innovative when the zoo opened in 
1966, with bars removed and space expanded, there is now a consensus that they 
are too sterile and provide no stimulation for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The zookeepers say that in many cases, the remodeling should be done with an 
eye to eliminating some exhibits and moving the animals to other zoos, 
combining the remaining space into more expansive and natural exhibits for the 
animals that remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein said he concurs with such a policy, to a degree. A consultant is 
being sought to devise a plan for expanding the chimp enclosure into an 
adjoining compound once occupied by baboons. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are working on budgets and bringing together different groups of 
people, it's hard to agree what to do first," Goldstein said. "There is going 
to be disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the wide-ranging need for remodeling, outside authorities say that Los 
Angeles' animal collection and the zoo's vast market are reason for hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Los Angeles Zoo should be one of the premier zoos in the country," said 
Michael Hutchins, director of conservation and science for the American Assn. 
of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. "It has a very important collection. It 
should have exhibits the equivalent of New York and Chicago. But the facilities 
there are old." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three years, the zoo has made strides in improving safety and 
sanitation standards for its animals, according to evaluations by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. The zoo now receives just a handful of corrective 
orders, contrasted with dozens of orders in 1990 that threatened to bring stiff 
fines or closure of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo has recently been made more comfortable for people as well with the 
installation of diaper-changing tables in restrooms and the reopening of a tram 
to help visitors traverse the hilly, 118-acre compound. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the cramped and unimaginative exhibits, many animals continue to pace, 
groom themselves obsessively or exhibit other unhealthy behavior common to many 
animals in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 For many zoo employees, three exhibits have come to exemplify the need for 
change: 
</P>
<P>
 * The quarters for the chimp troop, one of the largest and most socially 
compatible in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * The polar bear exhibit, where two bears share a Matterhorn-steep concrete 
slab that is too cramped for much recreation. The small, kidney-shaped pool 
would be paltry even by a suburban homeowner's standards. And a ball and an 
empty beer keg, installed as recreational devices, have long since lost their 
novelty for the bears. 
</P>
<P>
 * Five penguins are kept in a small, scruffy holding area that is easily 
overlooked by the public, particularly when the birds are in their nests. 
Questions have been raised about the safety of the exhibit; 42 penguins have 
died there over the last decade. Despite acquisitions and births, the colony 
has dwindled to five birds. A debate is raging between keepers and curators, 
who want to close the penguin exhibit, and Goldstein, who said it is unclear if 
changes are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Keepers say they are pleased that the remodeling plan provides for better 
polar bear and penguin habitats, but they worry that it does too much for those 
animals and not enough or nothing for antelope, bears, orangutans, chimps and 
other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo has completed some more modest remodeling in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of wood platforms, cargo netting and rope swings have improved an 
orangutan exhibit that zoo officials said is still too small. Palm trees and 
other foliage have given some refuge for jaguars once kept in a bare exhibit. 
Ongoing work on the elephant oval will provide slightly more room for the 
animals and electronic barn gates that will enhance keeper safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The most publicized change recently at the zoo was the addition last summer of 
a waterfall, stream and series of small ponds to the tiger hollow. The 
resulting Tiger Falls also includes a new window that allows visitors to see 
two female tigers from eye level, instead of from the top of a moat. Bright new 
graphics describe the cats and their native habitat -- a striking improvement 
over the faded markers that identify most zoo animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of Tiger Falls boosted attendance for several months last summer. 
And Goldstein and officials at the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. point to it as 
the kind of improvement that makes life better for the animals and viewing more 
fun for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 But some zookeepers object that the improvements were designed more for people 
-- leaving unchanged the size of the exhibit and the cats' nighttime holding 
pens. 
</P>
<P>
 But even critics agree that the $276,000 Tiger Falls exhibit is a curatorial 
wonder compared to a 1989 folly known as Adventure Island. The $7-million 
project was the largest construction effort since the opening of the zoo -- 
designed in part to correct a flaw in the zoo's design that put most animal 
exhibits more than half a mile from the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Adventure Island is easy to find, just inside the main gate, it is 
hard to understand once you enter. Patrons pass a seal pool and waterfalls to 
enter a circle of dark caves before emerging into a plaza with several other 
small animal exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor design has made animal escapes from "the island" routine. Other pens are 
not safe for either the animals or their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
 A rattlesnake terrarium inside the caves had to be closed because of the 
danger to keepers, who could not see the snakes when they entered through a 
single doorway. Several members of a featured prairie dog colony climbed out of 
the low-walled enclosure and others drowned because their dirt pen had 
inadequate drainage. The colony has been closed while curators search for a way 
to keep the rodents in and the water out. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein concedes that Adventure Island is "sterile," but that he hopes 
wildlife videos and other technology can salvage the area as a popular 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking through the dark caves at the cascading water, he tries to find a 
silver lining: "Maybe at least it's a place where kids and parents can cool off 
and blow off a little steam." Life at the Zoo 
</P>
<P>
 Some particulars on the Los Angeles Zoo: 
</P>
<P>
 * Location: Griffith Park * Species: 500 * Animals: 1,600 * Acres: 118 * 
Founded: 1966 * 1993 attendance: 1.5 million * Annual operating budget: $14.5 
million * Admission: General $8; children 2-12, $3; over 65, $5 * Issue: How to

BILL BOYARSKY: FROM A LONG-AGO QUAKE, SOME LESSONS ABOUT TRUE GRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My father, then 6 years old, was asleep in his family's San Francisco home 
when that city was struck by the great earthquake of 1906. 
</P>
<P>
 A china cabinet fell on his bed, but missed him. The family flat in the 
Mission District was damaged, and in a few hours fire began moving toward the 
neighborhood. My grandfather got his wagon and the family horse, Babe, and the 
Boyarskys, with a few possessions, headed toward the refugee encampment in 
Golden Gate Park. 
</P>
<P>
 As it did for many San Franciscans, the earthquake and fire changed the course 
of family history. Suddenly among the 250,000 homeless, the Boyarskys obtained 
a pass from the military authorities, and took the ferry across San Francisco 
Bay to Oakland, where they settled and my father grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 When my father told me about the event, I could see what an adventure it had 
been for him. He used to take me to old San Francisco restaurants that dated 
back to the earthquake and before, such as the Fly Trap and the Ritz Poodle 
Dog. When we drove along broad Van Ness Avenue, he told me how the fire was 
finally stopped there after destroying much of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 I was fascinated by the jaunty attitude reflected in these stories, the way 
San Francisco had defied its geology and rebuilt after a disaster that killed 
more than 450. I knew that the city's symbol was the phoenix rising from the 
ashes. I learned the defiant poem: "From the Ferry to Van Ness, you're a 
God-forsaken mess. But you're the damnedest finest ruins, nothing more or 
nothing less." And I knew another poem written by a newspaperman commenting on 
the symbolism of a famous distillery surviving in the notoriously sinful city: 
"If, as some say, God spanked the town for being over frisky, why did He burned 
the churches down and save Hotaling's Whisky."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, of course, when our big earthquake struck and I saw the refugee 
encampments, just like the Boyarskys' in Golden Gate Park, I thought of San 
Francisco. There were 6-year-olds in the new camps, just like my father, except 
their parents came from Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador rather than 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to refresh my memory about the spirited way San Francisco confronted 
its disaster. I reached up to the bookshelves and pulled out David Lavender's 
"California: Land of New Beginnings," Kevin Starr's "Americans and the 
Californian Dream 1850-1915," and William Bronson's "The Earth Shook, The Sky 
Burned." 
</P>
<P>
 As I looked at the books, I was struck by the parallels, lessons we might 
learn from that long-ago quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson drawn from Lavender's book is to beware of rip-offs in the haste to 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 With San Francisco desperate to get its transit system moving again, the 
supervisors, after accepting bribes, awarded the streetcar franchise to the 
corrupt United Railroads. Meanwhile, wrote Lavender, "companies involved in 
municipal rehabilitation clamored for and received special privileges." 
</P>
<P>
 We're entering a period in Los Angeles where business people will be wheeling 
and dealing with federal, state and local governments under heavy pressure to 
rebuild. Builders, anxious to get moving, will demand that bureaucratic red 
tape be slashed. But, as we have seen with rip-offs after procedures were 
speeded up for distribution of food stamps, red tape for checking credentials 
and bidding for jobs can often be a protection against fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson of Starr's book is that it is useless to make grandiose plans. 
Everyone is too busy rebuilding to follow them. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1906 earthquake, an ambitious proposal for a new San Francisco had 
been prepared by a famous architect and city planner, Daniel Hudson Burnham. It 
envisioned an acropolis atop Twin Peaks, broad boulevards, huge parks, and a 
system of reservoirs, aqueducts and inner-city lakes and fountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnham hurried to the wrecked city and began lobbying civic leaders for 
support of his plan. But real-life needs prevailed. While Burnham lobbied, the 
city began rebuilding along the lines of pre-fire San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important is the lesson from Bronson's book -- that frontier grit brought 
San Francisco back. At the age of 70, Rafael Weill began rebuilding his White 
House department store. "I have enough left to buy an annuity and live like a 
fighting cock for the rest of my days," he said. "But none of that for me. I am 
going into the work of rebuilding with all of my soul." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Through his life, my father viewed earthquakes through the eyes of a 
6-year-old caught in a great adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, he'd pull out the pass that got the family out of San Francisco, 
kept in a metal box along with his World War I discharge papers. When we were 
visiting Los Angeles in 1952, he insisted on stopping in Bakersfield on the 
drive back so he could see the damage caused by a quake that had just hit that 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 I think of that now as we Angelenos, like the old San Franciscans, are 
beginning to rebuild on dangerous land, defying geology and common sense. It is 
a challenge, and an adventure.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; GETTING EVEN; BILLS' 
THURMAN THOMAS TAKES OUT HIS LONG-HELD DISLIKE OF THE MEDIA ON HIS NFL 
OPPONENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They attacked at dawn, armed with notebooks, tape recorders and cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 They invaded a plush hotel in a peaceful suburb of Atlanta, doggedly pursuing 
their prey. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Thursday morning of Super Bowl week. The sun was rising as the media 
army covering Super Bowl XXVIII entered the headquarters of the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 As they passed through the lobby, few noticed the figure stretched out in a 
chair, head down on his chest, a baseball cap pulled low as he appeared to 
doze. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman Thomas was resting up for another battle with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, his biggest battle will come today against the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas often makes those conflicts look easy compared to the ones he has 
off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday in the AFC title game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Thomas 
glided through the defense the way Magic Johnson or Michael Jordan used to 
glide down a court -- ball in one hand, body moving easily but swiftly, eyes 
wide open to any and all possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a day Thomas labeled "the best of my six-year career." He rushed for 
186 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Bills into their fourth consecutive 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 And back into conflict with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' most controversial moments have come in Super Bowl settings. 
</P>
<P>
 But on one thing, there is agreement: The man can run. Always could. 
</P>
<P>
 He was good enough at Willowridge High in Missouri City, Tex., to wind up in 
the Texas High School Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a serious knee injury that severely limited him in his junior year at 
Oklahoma State, Thomas rushed for 4,595 yards and 43 touchdowns in his college 
career, more than 5,000 yards and 48 touchdowns, counting bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1987 game against Iowa State, Thomas ran for 293 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't slow down in the NFL. A second-round draft choice of the Bills, 
Thomas has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in every season but his first. 
</P>
<P>
 He also catches passes, lots of them, for huge chunks of yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas has surpassed the 10,000-yard mark in total yardage in his six years in 
the league. He led the NFL in total yardage four consecutive seasons, ending in 
1992, to surpass the mark of Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 He was voted the league's most vluable player in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's all the controversy about? 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas can shed would-be tacklers who come at him from all angles. But he sees 
himself being tackled when critics come at him from all angles. Or, at least, 
perceived critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1992 Super Bowl, Buffalo offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda 
referred to quarterback Jim Kelly as the "Michael Jordan" of the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't sit right with Thomas, who believed he was the Michael Jordan of 
the team. After all, wasn't he the league MVP that season? 
</P>
<P>
 Angered, Thomas skipped a mandatory pre-Super Bowl media session and failed to 
show up to receive an award as player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Thomas, the controversy was merely warming up. It peaked when he was 
preparing for Super Bowl XXVI against the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, he misplaced his helmet and spent two plays looking for it. 
</P>
<P>
 He needn't have hurried. 
</P>
<P>
 After rushing for 135 yards in the previous year's Super Bowl against the New 
York Giants, Thomas managed only 13 yards in 10 carries in a 37-24 loss to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The helmet became the focal point of off-season criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 If Thomas didn't learn to accept that criticism, he at least began to bear it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before last year's Super Bowl in Pasadena, he handed out little plastic 
helmets to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the controversy was back. With Buffalo struggling offensively in 
early December, Thomas and teammate Andre Reed criticized the game plan. Kelly 
criticized teammates for not giving a full effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers declared the return of the Bickering Bills, the name attached to 
the team in more unsettling times. 
</P>
<P>
 After a loss to the Raiders, Buffalo's third in four games, Thomas was angry, 
claiming there were no bickering Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't like our team, he told reporters, "don't write about it." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Thomas stormed out. He did not speak publicly again until the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 His anger might have had something to do with his fumble that had killed 
Buffalo's chance for a comeback near the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was making enemies, it seemed, everywhere. Not only was he at odds with 
his coaching staff and local reporters, but the opposing locker room as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider defensive tackle Nolan Harrison was incensed that Thomas had strutted 
into the end zone on a touchdown. Harrison derided Thomas for his arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills won their final four regular-season games and the AFC East, then two 
playoff games to reach the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Marty Schottenheimer had made stopping Thomas the Chiefs' top priority 
last Sunday, but failed miserably. With the offensive line blowing open huge 
holes and Kelly correctly countering the Kansas City blitz, Thomas raced down 
the field time and time again, leaving frustrated Chiefs in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
 So finally, Thomas had put all the criticism behind him? 
</P>
<P>
 No way. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest point of contention was that a columnist had advocated starting 
Kenneth Davis ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Thomas brought up the subject of his image again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to write all the negatives about me," he said. "Nobody wants 
to write about me donating money back to Oklahoma State University, giving out 
five scholarships a year in the city of Buffalo, being an honorary coach for 
the Special Olympics for the last three or four years, donating money to the 
United Negro College fund. Nobody wants to write about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to ask, 'Why did you say you're the best running back? Why 
did you lose your helmet?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a winner all my life and nobody really has ever written anything 
positive about me, so why should I care now?" 
</P>
<P>
 But he does care, deeply. That's why it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges that he finds it difficult to picture himself as a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people didn't know me," he said, "they would think I was somebody who 
worked at UPS." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas went to a party in Atlanta the other night and found himself beside 
Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like a little kid next to them," said Thomas, who stands 5 feet 10 and 
weighs 197 pounds. "It was a dream come true just sitting next to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' teammates offer him the respect afforded a superstar. And plenty of 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a two-way relationship. To reward his offensive linemen for their 
blocking, Thomas took them all out to dinner a few weeks ago and presented each 
with a sculpture of a buffalo. Total cost: $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it doesn't bother his teammates to see Thomas upset. They are actually 
happy when he is pouting or surly or downright angry. 
</P>
<P>
 The more angry he gets all week over the upcoming game and the questions and 
the perceived criticism, the more the frustration builds up. 
</P>
<P>
 And the more frustrated Thomas becomes, the more he seems to let it out on 
game day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask him a mean question, and watch him roar down the field. Hurt his feelings, 
and watch him hurt the linebacker who comes up to tackle him. 
</P>
<P>
 So when they saw him surrounded by reporters this week, the Bills were 
thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody was going to get hurt in that battle. 
</P>
<P>
 They were hopeful it will be the Dallas Cowboys.

JIM MURRAY: SUPER BOWL XXVIII / BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; THERE'S NO 
HIDING THIS PAIR OF SMITHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember those old high school annuals where they used to put under the 
pictures of certain students, "Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith"? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, fate failed in a big way in Super Bowl XXVIII. It could well be that the 
game -- and the championship of the universe -- is decided by a Smith. We have 
never had a President named Smith. But we could have a Super Bowl most valuable 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 The game could well degenerate into a contest of Smith vs. Smith.  
</P>
<P>
 First, there is Bruce. Don't call him Smitty.  
</P>
<P>
 Bruce is No. 78 in your programs, but he'll probably be wearing the 
quarterback most of the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Bruce is what they call a pass rusher in this league, a guy who takes off at 
the snap for the quarterback and tries to beat the ball there. But he's also a 
run rusher. Bruce's target is the ball. Carry it at your peril. It is as if he 
is a bear and you have one of his cubs in your hands.  
</P>
<P>
 His is a proud position -- defensive end. Not so long ago, it was a position 
of anonymity, a fitting place for a guy named Smith to be. Nobody noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the game became aerial. The pass rush became an entity, a maneuver all 
its own. It became publicized, glamorized. The "Fearsome Foursome" came into 
existence. The "Gold Rush." The word sack came into existence. Concussions 
crept into the language. Pass rushers were celebrities. Deacon Jones became the 
"Secretary of defense." Even the cheerleading began to concentrate on 
"Dee-fense!" 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Smith is the logical successor to all this. He is a Fearsome Onesome. He 
can almost decide a game all by himself.  
</P>
<P>
 Some years ago, I chanced to be in the Indianapolis Colts' training facility, 
in a room with the coach, Ron Meyer, and most of the team. They were to play 
Buffalo that weekend. Meyer singled me out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who," he wanted to know, "do the Raiders consider the problem playing the 
Bills?" 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't have to think long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," I told him, "the ones I talk to, including Coach Tom Flores, think 
that new guy they have, Bruce Smith, is one hell of a football player, a 
one-man gang." 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts found out that week. Bruce Smith rather completely dismantled their 
game plan.  
</P>
<P>
 And that Bruce Smith was nowhere near as good as the mature version. Bruce 
Smith today is as impassable as a mountain road. He is mastodonic, relentless. 
You should get one call to your priest when you see him coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he is unhappy. Oh, not with life in general. Bruce Smith is the 
current darling of TV commercials, where he comes off as a combination of the 
Abominable Snowman and the Creature That Ate Encino with terrified fans 
sneaking a sniff at one of his game shoes or being forced to don dresses for 
interfering with his pool game. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the field, he is less intimidating, even tries to be ingratiating. He 
smiles a lot -- although one offensive lineman once said, "When No. 78 smiles 
that smile, run!" He speaks in cultured, half-whispered tones. He is a man 
obviously secure with himself, even being the No. 1 bogyman in the roughest 
contact sport in the world -- this side of pugilism.  
</P>
<P>
 What Bruce Smith is unhappy about is, he thinks society -- or at least that 
part of it that runs football -- discriminates against him. Or defensive ends, 
in general. At least, they legislate against them.  
</P>
<P>
 They keep worrying that -- thanks to the Bruce Smiths in the lineups -- 
defense will take over the grid game.  
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Smith harks back to a time when the head slap was in vogue and legal. 
This was a homicidal maneuver by which Deacon Jones could -- and did -- make 
his way to the quarterback by delivering ringing blows to the sides of helmets 
of offensive linemen until they were reeling like a guy in a Joe Louis fight.  
</P>
<P>
 In those days, an offensive lineman had to hold his hands against his chest 
when he blocked. Today, he can stick them straight out in front of him and try 
to jerk the pass-rusher around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not football, it's basketball!" Bruce complains. "Next, they'll want us 
to play in leg chains and handcuffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas might not think it such a bad idea along about 6 o'clock tonight. But 
they have a Smith of their own that fate couldn't conceal.  
</P>
<P>
 That Smith is conceding about 80 pounds in weight and seven inches in height 
to Buffalo's Smith. He probably doesn't care whether you call him Smitty.  
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Smith may go a whole season not getting his hands on the ball. Emmitt 
Smith hardly goes a play. He has carried the ball 1,410 times in his four 
seasons in the league and has caught 212 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 How good is he? Well, the Dallas Cowboys picked him No. 1 in the '90 draft, 
but even then Coach Jimmy Johnson noted they had "underestimated him." They had 
ranked him fourth in the draft behind players -- such as Cortez Kennedy and 
Junior Seau -- who had already been drafted, but Johnson agreed he should have 
been No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
 How good is this Smith? Well, the Cowboys were 0-2 when he finally signed with 
them this year (for $13.6 million). They were 12-2 the rest of the way.  
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith pooh-poohs the dramatic difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first game I was back, the team already had it won when I went in in the 
second half," he says. "Same way in the third game." 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt is not always so self-effacing. He is a Pete Rose of football players. 
He knows his accomplishments and can recite them. He wants to improve on them. 
He hopes to overtake Walter Payton's all-time rushing record, even though it 
would take eight seasons of 1,300 yards apiece to do it.  
</P>
<P>
 The extraordinary fact about Emmitt Smith is, he is not a refugee from an 
all-state -- or an Olympic -- relay team. In terms of football rushers, he is 
not fast. Not one of your 4.3-in-the-40 afterburners.  
</P>
<P>
 "Speed is overrated," Emmitt Smith tells you. "In a game, very seldom does an 
individual run straight ahead. There is football speed and track speed. If you 
want a medal, run straight. If you want a touchdown, run sideways. 
Four-point-three is great for going from Point A to Point B. In football, you 
have to go from Point A to Point Z. You need balance, agility, more than 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 feet 9 and 209 pounds, Emmitt has the balance of a Kewpie doll. Says his 
blocker, Nate Newton: "Some backs run up your back, Emmitt runs around you. " 
</P>
<P>
 You've heard of keeping up with the Joneses. Keeping up with the Smiths may be 
the secret to Super Bowl XXVIII. They're not kinfolks, but it just might be a 
Smith Bros. drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the spreading Georgia Dome, the village Smithies stand. To get to the 
trophy you either have to go through a Smith -- or a Smith has to go through. 
Either way, there'll be more Smiths in the paper on Monday than there are on a 
motel registry.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; WINNER WILL PASS REALITY 
CHECK; OVERVIEW: DALLAS APPEARS READY TO DOMINATE AGAIN. BUT THIS ISN'T THE 
SAME BUFFALO TEAM THAT LOST LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Not that there isn't much mystery to Super Bowl XXVIII, but to understand it, 
all you have do is look up. 
</P>
<P>
 It's right there on Interstate 85, the major highway running past the Georgia 
Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 It's on two billboards featuring the face of Dallas Cowboy quarterback Troy 
Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 He appears to be sneering. 
</P>
<P>
 He is accompanied by two words. 
</P>
<P>
 GET REAL . 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the Cowboys' inspiration, and Buffalo Bills' torment, as they meet 
today at 3:18 p.m. PDT, the first time two teams have played in the Super Bowl 
two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Get real. The Cowboys, with virtually the same team that defeated the Bills by 
35 points in the last Super Bowl, are going to choke? 
</P>
<P>
 Get real. The Bills, losers of a record three consecutive Super Bowls by an 
average of 16 points, are going to suddenly become winners? 
</P>
<P>
 Get real. The Cowboys are going to lose after playing the best single half of 
football in the league this season during last week's rout of the San Francisco 
49ers? 
</P>
<P>
 Get real. The Bills are going to win after barely beating the Raiders in the 
playoffs' first round? 
</P>
<P>
 Get real. Aikman and Emmitt Smith also-rans? 
</P>
<P>
 Get real. Jim Kelly and Thurman Thomas champions? 
</P>
<P>
 The differences between the two teams were evident this week, even in their 
off-field crises: 
</P>
<P>
 For the Cowboys, it was being forced to move to a secret hotel Saturday night 
to avoid the crush of fans. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Bills, it was rescuing special teams star Steve Tasker from a security 
guard who wouldn't let him attend a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard didn't think he was a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what everybody thinks," Bill linebacker Darryl Talley said. "But 
that's everyone else's problem." 
</P>
<P>
 It is with that defiant attitude that the Bills have spent their last few 
days. They have glared. They have cursed reporters. They have rarely smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 For maybe the first time, they have treated the Super Bowl less like an event 
and more like another week of work. 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly what Coach Marv Levy wants. 
</P>
<P>
 As he and his team have matured, they have realized that perhaps the best way 
to win the Super Bowl is to not try to win the Super Bowl . 
</P>
<P>
 Their record nine pressure-induced turnovers last year reminded them of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is not to win the Super Bowl championship," Levy said. "Our goal is 
to prepare in such a way as to beat the Dallas Cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, "If you forget about the Cowboys and just look at the Super 
Bowl, I think you miss the forest for the trees," Levy said. "Or is that the 
tree for the forest? I never could figure that out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys haven't been quite their usual swaggering, quote-toting selves. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as if they know there is no sleeping dog in these United States right now 
as big as the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson has not guaranteed a victory. Michael Irvin has not been crowing 
about his jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Haley has not punched anything . . . or anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get to four consecutive Super Bowls unless you have great talent 
and beat a lot of quality teams," defensive end Jim Jeffcoat said of the Bills. 
"We know what we're in for." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that is what they were saying before last year's Super Bowl in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, shortly after the Bills took a 7-0 lead -- yes, they actually led in 
that game -- the Cowboys scored four touchdowns before halftime after a variety 
of turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 What is so different about this year? What makes the Bills think they even 
have a chance? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everything is different," Levy said, later adding, "as to why, I 
really can't give you answer that isn't groping." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some guesses: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last year Kelly and Thomas had a variety of injuries before the game that 
worsened with each hit. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the rout ended, Kelly had thrown the ball only seven times and 
Thomas had rushed only 11 times. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Cowboys Aikman and Smith have the injuries. Aikman is still 
recovering from a concussion suffered last week; Smith has a separated 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither injury is expected to keep them from beginning the game at full 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 But no such guarantee can made after their first meeting with Bill defensive 
end Bruce Smith, who is having his best season and is playing for his gravely 
ill father. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last year, the Cowboys had two weeks to prepare for the most unusual 
offense they have faced, the Bills' no-huddle attack. They figured out enough 
to be able to get four sacks and cause many of those turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, they had only one week. And Johnson is worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not going to be enough preparation time, I'm afraid," he said. "The 
shortened time does not work in our favor." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like just having one week," Levy said. "This way, we can keep our rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last year, the Bills didn't have the strong, speedy linebackers required to 
handle tight end Jay Novacek, who caught seven passes for 72 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficiency also opened holes for Smith, who rushed for 108 yards and one 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, youngsters Mark Maddox and Marvcus Patton have become inside forces 
on a defense that led the NFL with 47 interceptions and fumble recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we're quicker inside now," Talley said. "And stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last year, Kelly had one target: Andre Reed. This year he also has speedy 
Bill Brooks and improved tight end Pete Metzelaars. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps has a result, Kelly has not thrown an interception in 64 playoff 
passes this year while completing 68.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, who signed last spring as a free agent from the Indianapolis Colts, 
has caught both of Kelly's playoff touchdown passes. He gives them the deep 
threat they have been lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzelaars, who caught only two passes in last year's Super Bowl, led the team 
with 68 catches. The Cowboy front seven can't simply worry only about stopping 
Thomas anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this means the Bills are a better team than the Cowboys. Far from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman has completed 70% of his passes in five postseason games, with 11 
touchdowns and three interceptions. That gives him a 113.3 rating, the highest 
in NFL postseason history with at least five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, despite the shoulder injury, has 260 total yards in two playoff games 
with a touchdown rushing and receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Cowboy defense, it is enough to say that their two playoff 
opponents have averaged 57.5 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 All week, those who have said that these Cowboys could be stopped have been 
told to get real. 
</P>
<P>
 But who knows? On the 25th anniversary of the Joe Namath-led upset of the New 
York Jets over the Baltimore Colts, it might be time for this Super Bowl to 
once again get a little unreal.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; TIMELY TACKLE; THE LAST 
TIME EMMITT SMITH WAS STOPPED WHEN IT COUNTED WAS 1986, AND IT COST HIGH SCHOOL 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Somewhere in America sits Ray Smith, the last man to bring Emmitt Smith down 
when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
 He might be watching TV today, recounting to those nearby the open-field 
tackle that secured victory and proved Emmitt Smith mortal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, Ray," folks will say. "Whatever you say, Ray." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, but it must be something today to be Ray Smith and know that there is a 
moment to last for a lifetime because you were the one to best greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 There are seven Ray or Raymond Smiths in the Pensacola, Fla., telephone 
directory, but five said they were not the "real" Ray Smith. The telephones of 
two others rang repeatedly without answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good God, you know Emmitt hasn't really been stopped since then, now has he?" 
said Leo Carvalis, principal at Pensacola High School and former football 
coach. "Ray Smith? Went to North Dakota State for a while, called once, but he 
kind of dropped out of sight. You say he made that tackle? I forgot." 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper accounts indicate that a little more than seven years ago, the 
Smiths came together as opponents on a football field. Like Emmitt's 
present-day Cowboys, his Escambia High Gators were the team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Cowboys, who won last year's NFL title, the previous year the Gators 
had claimed the Class 4-A Florida state title. 
</P>
<P>
 Escambia had not lost a football game in two years, was ranked No. 1 
nationally and was a sure bet to win the national title once it got past the 
Pensacola High Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Take heart, Buffalo, because with a little more than two minutes to play, the 
underdogs were not only still in the game, but ahead by seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we had to punt and Emmitt took the ball," Carvalis said. "He was on his 
way for a touchdown with only one man to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 One on one in the open field with Emmitt Smith, and Ray Smith, according to 
newspaper accounts, "dropped him in a rolling, tumbling heap at the EHS 25." 
</P>
<P>
 "That was it," Carvalis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pensacola won, 17-10, and Emmitt Smith lost his bid for a national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got people from PHS who come into the store all the time," said 
Marzette Porterfield, an employee at Emmitt, Inc., and Smith's former Escambia 
teammate. "They say, 'Emmitt's got this and Emmitt's got that, but we kicked 
his butt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith started as a freshman at Escambia and averaged 2,201 yards 
rushing a season before moving on to the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 During his four years at Escambia, the team lost a total of four games, three 
to Carvalis' Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Carvalis figured out how to stop Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took our offensive tackles and big guys on offense and put them on 
defense," Carvalis said. "We told them, 'Don't give him a running lane. Just 
don't move. If necessary just fall down and let the linebackers clean up.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We had great speed on the outside, and Emmitt isn't known for his outside 
speed, so he wasn't going to beat us there. He does his damage from tackle to 
tackle, so we weren't going to give him a seam. 
</P>
<P>
 "You watch him today, and it's still the same thing. When teams do a good job 
of plugging the running lanes inside, he's not quite as effective. But let me 
say this, I was very happy when he graduated." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who had scored 101 touchdowns in his prep career, failed to score 
against Pensacola in his final high school game -- the first time all season he 
had been kept out of the end zone. He rushed for 117 yards in 22 carries, but 
it was the first time in four games against Pensacola that he had topped the 
100-yard mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott Hunter, former Alabama quarterback who does broadcasting down here in 
Mobile, was on TV the other day saying, 'Emmitt Smith can't be stopped,' " 
Carvalis said. "Our teachers wanted me to call him and set him straight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo has Bruce Smith and Thomas Smith, but no Ray Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, they were unable to fill the running lanes, and Smith rushed for 
108 yards, helping the Cowboys run over the Bills in Super Bowl XXVII, 52-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo got some revenge with a 13-10 regular-season victory over Dallas 
earlier this season, but the Cowboys at the time were without Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Team owner Jerry Jones tried to hold the line on contract negotiations with 
Smith, and Dallas opened the season with losses to Washington and Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't jeopardizing anything," Smith said. "I wasn't on the football field. 
I couldn't go anywhere. I didn't have a contract. If anybody was jeopardizing 
something, you'd have to talk to the boss." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones relented after the Cowboys' 0-2 start, opened his checkbook and gave 
Smith a four-year, $13.6-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Aikman is one of the finest quarterbacks in the game. Michael Irvin has 
the ability to destroy the secondary. But ask the players who will deliver a 
Super Bowl ring, and the response is almost unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emmitt Smith, Emmitt Smith, Emmitt Smith," safety James Washington said. 
"Just in case you didn't hear me: Emmitt Smith, Emmitt Smith, Emmitt Smith." 
</P>
<P>
 A nationwide media panel voted him the league's most valuable player this 
season -- the first Cowboy to ever receive such an honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the first Cowboy?" he said after being notified. "Damn. History again. 
Now I want to win the Super Bowl MVP." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who rushed for 1,486 yards in the regular season, became the third 
player in NFL history to win three consecutive rushing titles, joining Hall of 
Famers Earl Campbell, Jim Brown and Steve Van Buren. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the MVP is determined by the importance of the player to his team, then 
there is no doubt Emmitt is as important to us as any player in the league to 
his team," Irvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he didn't win, then we'd have thought the voting was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 He's not all that fast, and stands 5 feet 9, 209 pounds. Defenders can't 
explain his effectiveness, although they suggest he must have unusual vision 
and a knack for knowing what hole is going to open before it does. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's better at cutting, he's quick, he's strong and probably the unique thing 
is he sees the holes," said Phil Hansen, Buffalo defensive end. "I mean he sees 
them before they develop. Marcus Allen does that very well, too. He makes you 
commit, and then he goes the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Nose tackle Jeff Wright, who will be at the point of attack when Smith goes 
looking for unoccupied space, said the Bills must not only hit the running 
back, but punish him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to make your hits count on him," Wright said. "You're not going to 
get a lot of hits, but you have to constantly pound him. You can't let him get 
that extra five yards after the first hit because they will start gaining 
momentum as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith rushed for 115 yards in his first high school game. He gained 224 yards 
in his first start for Florida. Four times this season he has gained more than 
150 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such success, Smith appears unaffected. He has embraced the tedious 
task of answering the Super Bowl media's repetitive questions. He will not 
allow any plaques, awards or trophies to be displayed in his parents' home 
until he has received his college degree. This week he was voted NFL man of the 
year in recognition of his community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yards never meant anything in the house," said Marsha Smith, Emmitt's sister. 
"Respect for each other meant everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith III, named for his father and grandfather, was nicknamed "Scoey," 
by his mother, Mary, after her favorite comedian, Scoey Mitchell, to help 
distinguish him from his elders. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's father, who had played fullback and linebacker for Pensacola 
Washington High, was still playing when he was 49 for the Pensacola Wings, a 
semipro team, and told the Dallas Morning News in an interview, "I don't like 
to say this, but I was pretty good. With my son, it was in the genes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Smith family now runs Emmitt, Inc., a sports store in Pensacola that sells 
trading cards, T-shirts and about anything they can slap a No. 22 on. 
</P>
<P>
 "A No. 22 jersey is selling for $80 to $100," said Bobby Washington, a former 
teammate of Smith who works in the store. "A No. 22 jersey with Emmitt's 
autograph goes for $189. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emmitt's here a lot, and when people hear about it, the store is mobbed. 
Emmitt loves it. He wants to meet the people. He told me one day, 'I got a 
9-to-5 job just like everybody else, only on a bigger scale.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Today's task is to lead the Cowboys to their second consecutive Super Bowl 
victory. With only one good arm, he has already given them an NFC East Division 
title and an NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
 He required an overnight stay in a hospital after suffering a separated 
shoulder and rushing for 168 yards in a regular season-ending victory over the 
New York Giants to clinch the division title. The performance was reminiscent 
of Charger Kellen Winslow's playoff effort against Miami while contending with 
dehydration, and Ram Jack Youngblood's courageous play despite a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard of guys playing hurt," Smith said. "I wanted to be a guy who could 
play hurt and be effective." 
</P>
<P>
 He rushed for 60 yards in 13 carries in a playoff victory over Green Bay and 
aggravated his sore shoulder. He returned a week later and ran 23 times for 88 
yards and caught seven passes for 85 yards, scored two touchdowns and sent the 
49ers packing.

 "With him, we always have the opportunity to do something we wouldn't have 
without him," said Joe Brodsky, who coaches the Cowboy running backs. "Every 
time the ball touches his hands, there's a very good opportunity for something 
to happen, and in some cases, miracles happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody in the league, nobody in football, has ever been an Emmitt Smith. He 
has a little piece of Tony Dorsett, a piece of Billy Sims, and some Walter 
Payton. . . . Someday, he'll have Payton's work ethic, and then it will be over 
in this league for a long time." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ray Smith? 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Ray Smith," said Ed Ilano, a fledgling pharmaceutical technician 
at City Drugs in Pensacola. "Ray Smith wasn't even on the field at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I punted the ball and I was the one who tackled Emmitt Smith. I've watched 
that game on tape over and over." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pensacola New Journal, however, reported on the morning of Nov. 15, 1986, 
that Ray Smith had been the hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, gosh," Ilano said. "He didn't tackle anybody -- that was me. I've got the 
tape of the game to prove it. I do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in America sits Ray Smith, the last man to bring Emmitt Smith down 
when it counted, and he undoubtedly has the newspaper clipping to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ed Ilano has his game film. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Bills have neither because they haven't stopped Smith yet.

AUSTRIAN SKIER ULRIKE MAIER DIES AFTER FALL IN DOWNHILL; SKIING: THE ONLY 
MOTHER ON THE WORLD CUP CIRCUIT, TWO-TIME WORLD CHAMPION SUFFERS A BROKEN NECK 
AFTER APPARENTLY LOSING BALANCE IN A DOWNHILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tragedy again struck the powerful Austrian ski team Saturday when the World 
Cup's only skiing mother, Ulrike Maier, was killed in a downhill race after 
crashing two-thirds down the course at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Austrian and German officials said Maier -- a two time world champion in 
super-giant slalom and one of Austria's top medal hopes at the upcoming 
Lillehammer Olympics -- suffered a broken neck when her right ski apparently 
hit a patch of soft snow, causing her to lose balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier's head struck a timing post, at which time she lost her helmet, tumbled 
over several times and appeared to have been hit by one of her skis that 
snapped free. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials tried to revive her with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and heart 
massage, said Karl Flock, a German team doctor who was on the scene. Christoph 
Kruis, another doctor who was on the scene, said Maier also was placed on a 
respirator. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier, 26, was flown by helicopter to an emergency accident hospital at 
Murnau, 15 miles east of the Bavarian resort, but a team of surgeons was unable 
to save her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had no chance," said Guenter Hofmann, a co-director of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Maier was virtually dead upon arrival at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a black day for all of us," said Hubert Ostler, chief of the race 
organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Austria has dominated the World Cup circuit in recent years, running away with 
the Nation's Cup last year while placing 23 skiers on the podium. But the 
country has also known tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier is the fifth member of the Austrian ski team to die in the last three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gernot Reinstadler was killed in practice for a downhill at Wengen, 
Switzerland, in 1991. Rudolf Nierlich died in a car crash in 1991, and Peter 
Wirnsberger died in a skiing accident in 1992. Nierlich won the slalom and 
giant slalom at the World Championships at Vail, Colo., in 1989, when Maier won 
her first world title. Alois Kahr, an Austrian coach, also died in a car crash 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier's crash was televised live in Austria, where Alpine skiing is as popular 
as the NFL is in the United States. After news of Maier's death, reporters who 
chronicled her career stood in silence in the press room. Some hugged each 
other to find comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier, a 10-year veteran known as "Ulli," had been a sentimental favorite 
since 1989, when she won the first of two world titles while she was three 
months pregnant with a daughter, Melanie. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier took a year and a half off after the birth, then returned to Saalbach, 
Austria, in 1991 to win her second world title in super-G. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Maier's daughter, now 4, nor her long-term companion Hubert 
Schweighofer, a police officer, witnessed the crash at Garmisch. Maier and 
Schweighofer had planned to wed next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier earned her fifth World Cup victory last week, a giant slalom at Maribor, 
Slovenia. At the 1992 Albertville Games, she was fourth in giant slalom and 
fifth in super-G, and currently ranked fourth in the World Cup overall 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Maier was traveling at speeds estimated at 60 m.p.h., officials said 
the course was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the safest parts of the course," chief referee Kurt Hoch said. 
</P>
<P>
 An overnight storm had dumped a layer of fresh snow on the track and the race 
was delayed an hour while officials prepared the Kandahar course. 
</P>
<P>
 American Picabo Street was leading the downhill before the long delay after 
the crash, which changed course conditions and allowed Isolde Kostner, an 
18-year-old Italian in her first World Cup, to win in 1 minute 44.04 seconds. 
Street finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of glad I didn't win today," Street said. "I don't think I'd want to 
look back at some point to a day I'd won but someone had died, much less 
someone as great as Uli. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just reminds you how it could just as easily happen to you." 
</P>
<P>
 A downhill scheduled today at Garmisch-Partenkirchen was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 An Austrian television station, in a tribute, aired an excerpt from a recent 
interview with Maier, who discussed risks of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't escape your fate," she said. "But I hope I am able to judge the 
risks of the downhill."

TENNIS / AUSTRALIAN OPEN; STREAKING SAMPRAS WINS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Sampras, blasting aces as fast as 126 m.p.h., won his third consecutive 
Grand Slam title by overpowering Todd Martin in straight sets today in the 
Australian Open final. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, who had 13 aces, overcame an early threat from Martin by winning a 
first-set tiebreaker, and then rolled to a 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 6-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Sampras became the first man in nearly three decades to win 
Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and the Australian Open consecutively. The only others 
were Roy Emerson in 1964-65 and Don Budge in 1937-38. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras raised his arms in triumph after ending the match with a forehand 
winner. Golfing buddies Martin and Sampras then put their arms around each 
other's shoulders, and Sampras momentarily rested his head on Martin's left 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first all-American final at the Australian Open since 1982, when 
Johan Kriek defeated Steve Denton. Sampras won $322,000, Martin $161,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras' powerful serves and groundstrokes often left the ninth-seeded Martin 
flat-footed, or reaching in vain as the ball rifled past. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just too good and he really deserves what he's succeeding at, because 
he's really working his butt off," Martin said of Sampras before thanking the 
crowd by saying, "I just appreciate all the support a little American kid can 
get." 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of excellent shots in the 2-hour 33-minute match, but little 
drama. Sampras and Martin are extremely professional in their approach to 
tennis and show little personality on the court, and Sampras was firmly in 
control after the first set. 
</P>
<P>
 The first set took 63 minutes, longer than the entire women's final on 
Saturday. Martin had his best chance at 3-3 in the first set, when he had four 
break points, but Sampras saved them all and eventually forced the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Steffi Graf had just reasserted her dominance in women's tennis 
with a nearly flawless performance to win her fourth consecutive Grand Slam 
title when the shadow of her only real rival appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you looking forward to Monica's return?" she was asked after her 6-0, 6-2 
defeat of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the women's final. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," she said with a bewildered look on her face before pausing and taking a 
deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Seles has been sidelined since being stabbed in the back last April by 
a spectator.

MIKE DOWNEY: THEY ARE NO LONGER KINGS OF THE TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles was a hockey town for 15 minutes. (OK, 20.) People who thought a 
faceoff was a Beverly Hills plastic surgery procedure were suddenly coming to 
hockey games. People who thought the Blue Line was the name of a commuter train 
were suddenly watching games on TV. People who thought Pavel Bure was a new 
frozen yogurt flavor from Ben and Jerry's were suddenly yakking about hockey in 
the malls.  
</P>
<P>
 How cool it was to play Spot the Movie Stars in the crowds sitting rinkside, 
although I am still not sure why it was OK to have Goldie Hawn inside a hockey 
team's dressing room when Tom Lasorda can no longer get Frank Sinatra inside 
his. What a hoot it was to see Ronald and Nancy Reagan in their seats behind 
the glass, as we sat there and wondered if the former First Lady felt like 
calling out to the goons during a fight, "Knock his teeth out!" 
</P>
<P>
 Our town belonged to the Kings, for a fast shift or two there. They were so 
hot, you thought the ice might melt. Every pass caused a reaction, every shot a 
groan or a cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 We had the greatest player on the globe, Wayne Gretzky, leading the way, 
miraculously recovered from career-endangering back pain at a time when so many 
of our other superstars were leaving us. We had a hot young coach, Barry 
Melrose, who looked like someone who could be as comfortable with Mariah Carey 
as with Jari Kurri, and a sprightly big-bopper of an owner, Bruce McNall, so 
committed to his team's improvement that he hired new management to replace 
himself.  
</P>
<P>
 And because our baseball, football and basketball professionals had all come 
unraveled at once, the Kings were sitting as pretty as pretty can sit.  
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? Where did they go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is not so much a calamity as a predicament, because this season is far 
from over and everybody outside of Ottawa is still a contender to make the NHL 
playoffs. Nevertheless, for reasons unexplained and possibly inexplicable, the 
Kings have gone backpedaling to where they were before and where they have 
usually been -- stuck in the middle of the pack, just another team. And what a 
pity, because here was an organization that had finally gotten itself 
organized.  
</P>
<P>
 You could argue forever whose fault this is, whether Melrose's many 
motivational techniques are now putting the giants right back to sleep after 
having awakened them; or whether General Manager Nick Beverley's disagreements 
with the coach over what -- or whom -- this club needs have been responsible 
for several ruinous transactions; or whether, at the top of the organizational 
ladder, Roy Mlakar has done anything to stop the bleeding or ever will. Who, 
for sure, knows? 
</P>
<P>
 One who often gets caught in the web of intrigue is Gretzky, who already has 
enough to worry about, what with carrying the team, closing in on one of 
hockey's greatest records and sweeping up what's left of his earthquake-ravaged 
house. Gretzky's profile is such that, for someone so quiet, he tends to be 
suspected of kibitzing whenever the Kings do a deal, or stipulating what this 
team must do to keep him happy. These rumors occasionally seem far-fetched, for 
if Gretzky was guilty of having his way all the time, then why in the world are 
Paul Coffey and Marty McSorley playing someplace else? 
</P>
<P>
 In the Dumbest Deals of the Decade competition, these particular doozies could 
be running 1-2. Coffey and McSorley could have been the heart and soul of this 
hockey team. Gretzky is sometimes compared to Magic Johnson in his impact, but 
actually he is the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of this team -- the talent, not the 
spirit. Coffey was the leadership and McSorley was the backbone. Coffey was the 
Magic Johnson and McSorley was the A.C. Green. The Lakers have not prospered 
without these guys and neither have the Kings.  
</P>
<P>
 Spilt milk, though. As are the oversights or misjudgments that allowed Corey 
Millen to slip away, or the absurd tug-of-war over Jimmy Carson, who cost the 
team Coffey, then was benched, then was rewarded with a rich contract, then was 
re-benched, then was traded to a team Los Angeles is trying to catch in its own 
division. And so a man once traded for Wayne Gretzky and for Paul Coffey was 
traded straight-up for Dixon Ward. Shrewd. You can't find marked-down 
merchandise like this at a going-out-of-business sale.  
</P>
<P>
 Where are the Kings going? Hard to say. It is as hard to predict as who's 
going to occupy the coach's doghouse day by day, out back where Barry buries 
the bones. One recent tenant has been Shawn McEachern, the very man acquired 
for McSorley. Everyone's uneasy. Tony Granato wonders where he'll be traded, 
Alex Zhitnik wonders how safe his relatives are back in Russia, Pat Conacher 
makes impassioned appeals in support of the coach and Dave Taylor daydreams of 
playing in a Stanley Cup before the NHL's mandatory retirement at age 65.  
</P>
<P>
 When the Kings were wobbly a year ago, their desperate measure was to call up 
minor league lifer Rick Knickle to tend goal. Today, Knickle isn't worth four 
cents, in the general manager's opinion. The desperate measure du jour is 
Robert Lang, a rookie center promoted just in time to score a game-tying goal 
against the New York Rangers on a rink-long rush that was a joy to behold. The 
game-losing goal, courtesy of Mark Messier, was something less than joyful. 
More than 33,000 fans jammed two area arenas Thursday night to see hockey and 
basketball games. Alas, about 30,000 of them seemed to be pulling for the 
visiting teams from New York.  
</P>
<P>
 There was a month last spring when the Kings could have drawn 33,000, all by 
themselves. Then spring became summer, autumn became winter and the new Kings 
became the old Kings all over again, testing our patience. And we could scream 
at them to get rid of some of their players, but, see, that's the whole 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 They already have.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; RILEY HAS A NEW PROJECT: FIND LOCKER ROOM RATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fugitives: Somewhere, two desperate men cringe, listening for the sound of 
hounds on their trail, to be followed by a blinding searchlight and a voice on 
a bullhorn: "Come on out! We know you're in there!" 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Knicks' Truth Squad. 
</P>
<P>
 These are dark days, what with two cowardly, sniveling anonymous Knick players 
telling the New York Daily News that Coach Pat Riley's 99-point-a-night offense 
lacks imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 This followed losses to the Orlando Magic and Philadelphia 76ers in which 
Riley continued to pound the ball in to Patrick Ewing in crunch time. In 
Orlando, Shaquille O'Neal blocked Ewing's shot. Against the 76ers, Jeff 
Hornacek stole the pass to Ewing, saying later he knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Knick Player A: "We're a much better team than what we've shown. But 
we've got some guys who are worried about their scoring averages first." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Player B: "Patrick's a great player, but he's not the only one who can 
score. We've got an offense that everybody in the world knows where the ball is 
going 90% of the time. We've got to be more versatile." 
</P>
<P>
 Anywhere else, it would barely be news if a couple of guys were grumbling. The 
Chicago Bulls went off on Phil Jackson and each other almost daily while 
winning their three titles. Doug Christie recently spent a couple of weeks 
critiquing Randy Pfund's "stagnant" Laker offense. Christie was undoubtedly 
reminded to tell Pfund in person or zip it up, but Pfund didn't have minicams 
waiting in his driveway and everyone got over it. 
</P>
<P>
 But this isn't New York, where the Daily News ran a headline in type normally 
reserved for events like the bombing of Pearl Harbor that screamed: 
</P>
<P>
 TEAM TURMOIL 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone, the Knicks reacted as if the two critics had sold atomic 
secrets to the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Riley's strenuous efforts to contain them, breaches of solidarity 
occurred, if rarely, in his Laker heyday. But in New York, where he's a demigod 
and his players relative faceless minions, his teams have become impenetrable. 
Any compromise of confidentiality, much less a criticism of Riley, himself, is 
considered a betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Riley became enraged at a mild NBC report that Knick veterans had 
talked him out of sending Greg Anthony home from the West Coast after the 
Phoenix brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley snarled that any player who talked to NBC's Peter Vecsey was "a gutless 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Now personally targeted for the first time as a Knick, Riley circled the 
wagons at a team meeting, co-chaired by personnel director Ernie Grunfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Charles Oakley, laughing: "I just want to know who did the talking. But 
it'll get out. It's like the FBI. You gather the clues and come up with 
suspects." 
</P>
<P>
 Said a coldly angry Riley: "We came into the meeting to try to bring out the 
truth and some honesty within the team. . . . If in fact there's a problem, 
then it will be ferreted out in the locker room. People know how I feel about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Post headline on this story: 
</P>
<P>
 KNICKS: WE'LL FIND LOCKER ROOM RAT 
</P>
<P>
 That night, the Knicks barely beat Phoenix at home, 98-96. The Suns were 
without Charles Barkley, Kevin Johnson and Danny Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Riley afterward: "We have the most boring, unimaginative, predictable 
offense in the history of basketball, but I've got six championship rings 
because of the center position. I had an opportunity to win one as a player 
with Wilt Chamberlain. I had an opportunity to coach Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) and 
I am blessed to coach Patrick Ewing and to pass the ball in to him every single 
time. I will go to my grave being predictable." 
</P>
<P>
 He also didn't play Anthony Mason against the Suns, leading to the suspicion 
that he was punishing him for being one of the rats -- uh, sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason denied it. The Post ran his head shot the next day but without an 
accompanying profile, perhaps because it didn't think of it. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the merits of this case, as Ewing noted, "Who in this league isn't 
predictable?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Suns go to Barkley in crunch time, the Houston Rockets to Hakeem 
Olajuwon, the Magic to O'Neal . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it might still be asked why Riley is so casual about establishing 
Charles Smith, the badly needed third option to Ewing and John Starks. Ewing 
doesn't want to play underneath anyway, so why not put him on the wing and post 
up Smith? Smith had 25 points against the Suns and in the next game, got six 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestion to Smith: If anyone asks about it, take the Fifth Amendment. The 
Truth Squad is watching you, too. MIKE'S COUNTDOWN CONTINUES 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago White Sox brass, which had been politely cool to the idea of letting 
Michael Jordan try out in spring training, has been told, 1. He's coming, and 
2. Shut up about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager of the year Gene Lamont, perhaps reminded that White Sox-Bull owner 
Jerry Reinsdorf fired Doug Collins after he had made the conference finals with 
the Bulls, fired Jeff Torborg after consecutive second-place finishes with the 
White Sox, and axed Tony LaRussa, is no longer saying it isn't in anyone's 
"best interests" for Jordan to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lamont last week: "Every indication I get is that he'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Ron Schueler, the former pitcher, did throw some breaking 
pitches to Jordan, who presumably had trouble with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Schueler diplomatically: "I'm not sure a lot of big league hitters are 
ready to look at a curveball this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: The professionals fear the damage a Jordan circus can do to 
morale, but Reinsdorf is ecstatic. The White Sox, longtime second fiddles to 
the cross-town Cubs, now own the Chicago papers and talk shows. White Sox 
exhibition games in Sarasota, Fla., are almost sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day, they were lined up for half a mile," said Nick Lucas of the 
Sarasota Sports Commission. "The only seats you can find now are way out toward 
right field." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's baseball credentials, such as they are, are being scrutinized. He 
didn't play after his junior year in high school but in three years of Babe 
Ruth ball, according to his coach, who kept the stats, he hit .260. A big 
league prospect at that level normally hits .500. But maybe Mike is a late 
bloomer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jordan's book, "Rare Air," he says he was offered basketball and baseball 
scholarships by Clemson, South Carolina and Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Sun-Times contacted the baseball coaches of all three. None had 
heard of Jordan at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did all the recruiting," said then-Clemson Coach Bill Wilhelm. "I had all 
the contacts. I coached there for 36 years. I would have heard about Michael if 
he had considerable baseball prospects." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfazed, Jordan notes he's still in demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had other offers," he said. "If the situation doesn't work out with the 
White Sox, other people have offered me the opportunity to come and try out." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark this date on your calendar: Feb. 15. Pitchers, catchers and Jordan 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan will wear No. 45. Robin Ventura won't give up 23 (so far). THERE'S A 
PLACE FOR THEM 
</P>
<P>
 If a tree falls in the forest, some of the debris will find a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
 How does one account for Pauley Pavilion and the Forum escaping earthquake 
damage but the Sports Arena having to close for a week? Call it Clipper karma. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nice to report they took it graciously. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Clipper world tour, man," said Tom Tolbert. "We're going down to 
the San Diego Convention center after this. We're going to see how many arenas 
we can play in. Set an NBA record or something. 
</P>
<P>
 "Figure we hit the Anaheim Convention Center. We got the Forum and the 
(Anaheim Arena) Pond. What else can we get? We can get Pauley maybe. (UC 
Irvine's) Bren Center. We'll try to work 'em all in. We'll try 'em all for the 
heck of it, see how many fans we get there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers didn't like the Forum, where they weren't allowed to display 
their team logo, dressed in the visitors' room, drew the hall's smallest crowd 
this season and lost soundly to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they were treated royally at the Anaheim Arena, where they sold 
17,507 tickets in two days and were cheered wildly, for a change, in a 
thrilling loss to the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper officials still insist that someone will build them an arena downtown 
or in the San Fernando Valley, but they're in the process of blowing their 
chance to take over Los Angeles while the Lakers are down. In a couple of years 
when they're rebuilding, a beautiful building in a demographic- rich area will 
look good, even if Donald Sterling's chi-chi comp list has to deal with 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 If they're fans, they'll come. Billy Crystal was at Anaheim. So was Pia 
Zadora. Clipper basketball! It can happen somewhere! FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 The all-star voters' selection of B.J. Armstrong to the East team, not to 
mention the starting lineup, is -- how shall we put it? -- wrong. So was the 
selection of slowed-down, oft-injured Clyde Drexler in the West. The other 
choices were OK, even if Karl Malone deserved better than a sixth-place finish 
behind Antoine Carr and four other West forwards. The other East starters are 
Shaquille O'Neal, Derrick Coleman, Scottie Pippen and Kenny Anderson. The other 
West starters: Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Shawn Kemp and Mitch Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
 The East coaches should add Patrick Ewing, Horace Grant, Charles Oakley, 
Dominique Wilkins, Mark Price, Mookie Blaylock and Reggie Miller. In the West: 
David Robinson, Malone, Cliff Robinson, Christian Laettner, John Stockton, Rod 
Strickland and Latrell Sprewell. . . . Sorry to Kevin Johnson (missed too many 
games), Alonzo Mourning (third-best center on a two-center squad), Chris Webber 
(a fixture starting next year), Joe Dumars (it was close with Miller), Isiah 
Thomas (sayonara after 14 straight), Gary Payton (it was close with Strickland 
and K.J.).

3 COWBOYS, GRANT HONORED; PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER VIKING COACH, DORSETT AND FOUR 
OTHER PLAYERS ARE VOTED INTO HALL OF FAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bud Grant, the former coach who led the Minnesota Vikings to four Super Bowl 
defeats, was voted to pro football's Hall of Fame along with five former 
players Saturday as the 33 selectors turned their backs on several qualified 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Voted down in the lengthy election process were two Rams, Tom Mack and Jack 
Youngblood; and, among others, the quarterback who took the Raiders to two 
Super Bowl triumphs, Jim Plunkett. 
</P>
<P>
 Voted in were two running backs -- Tony Dorsett of the Dallas Cowboys and 
Leroy Kelly, who succeeded Jim Brown in the Cleveland Browns' backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Two defensive players also made it -- tackle Randy White of the Cowboys and 
cornerback Jimmy Johnson of the San Francisco 49ers -- along with tight end 
Jackie Smith, who played for the St. Louis Cardinals and, later, the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Cowboys set a modern one-team, one-year record for the Hall of Fame, 
which will induct the six inductees next summer in Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way out of the crowded post-election news conference, an Eastern writer 
turned to a West Coast writer and asked: "Who was Jackie Smith?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another asked: "Who was Jimmy Johnson?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that both were players who got nationwide support in the voting 
process, which began several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who got less support were Carl Eller and Paul Krause of Grant's 
Viking defense; Lynn Swann and John Stallworth, wide receivers of the 
Pittsburgh Steeler team that won four Super Bowls, and Charlie Joiner and 
Kellen Winslow, whose catches helped make San Diego Charger teams of the 1980s 
famous. 
</P>
<P>
 The electors also leaned heavily on the glamour side, refusing to name any 
offensive linemen, although Mack and Dan Dierdorf of the Cardinals lasted into 
the final rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the voting board are sportswriters and broadcasters from all NFL 
cities, plus five at-large media people. 
</P>
<P>
 They are required each year to name at least four Hall of Famers, regardless 
of final votes received, but may choose no more than seven. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's chosen six were described by several selectors privately as 
members of one of the weakest Hall of Fame classes in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but the Dorsett vote came easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the Hall, y'all," he exclaimed after being voted in. "Here I come! It's 
quite an honor to be elected the first time around. In my mind, this is the 
best fraternity there is." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsett said he hoped longtime Cowboy coach Tom Landry would give his 
induction speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the reason I had the career I had," he said. "At times, I criticized him 
because he didn't use me more. It did prolong my career and I made the Hall of 
Fame. This is the way I'd like to thank him." 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's first ballot each November -- reducing a large number of nominees to 
14 candidates -- is similar to baseball's only ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the NFL way, Don Smith, NFL Hall of Fame vice president, said: "If 
we used baseball's system and stopped with that first (ballot), our records 
show that we'd elect an average of 1.2 candidates a year." 
</P>
<P>
 That is about baseball's average. 
</P>
<P>
 On successive ballots, NFL voters keep shrinking the list. 
</P>
<P>
 When they trimmed from 14 to 10 on Saturday, those eliminated were Krause, 
Stallworth, Swann and Winslow. When they reduced to six, Eller, Joiner, Mack 
and Mel Renfro were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Dierdorf was voted into six Pro Bowls -- compared to Mack's 11 -- but reached 
the final cut. 
</P>
<P>
 As one selector said: "Our ways are mysterious."

HARDING'S HOPES SHRINKING; FIGURE SKATING: HER FORMER HUSBAND IS SAID TO BE 
NEAR A PLEA BARGAIN THAT WOULD IMPLICATE HER IN THE ATTACK ON KERRIGAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks before the Winter Games are to begin, Tonya Harding's chances of 
skating for the U.S. team and avoiding criminal charges appeared bleak as 
investigators gathered new evidence in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's former husband, Jeff Gillooly, spent about two hours in the 
Multnomah County Courthouse on Saturday, after reportedly working out a deal 
that will reduce his jail time and implicate his former wife. 
</P>
<P>
 And as investigators in Detroit, the site of the Jan. 6 attack that kept 
Kerrigan out of the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, reportedly looked at 
phone records damaging to Harding, Olympic officials were considering an 
alternate skater for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly's attorney, Ron Hoevet, would not say if Gillooly was there to 
testify before the grand jury investigating the case. There were indications, 
however, that the grand jury was in session Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoevet said he and Gillooly would make a public statement on Monday or 
Tuesday, a strong indication that Gillooly planned to enter a plea then. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators in Detroit reportedly have information that Harding asked for 
Kerrigan's hotel room number before the attack and made several calls to 
Harding's bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt, the day of the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence is being gathered in an apparent attempt to corroborate 
statements made by Eckardt, who publicly has implicated Harding, and Gillooly, 
who reportedly has said she was in on the alleged plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly, Eckardt, confessed hit-man Shane Stant and Derrick Smith, who is 
accused of driving the getaway car, all are free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. is strongly considering sending 
13-year-old Michelle Kwan to the Lillehammer Games as an alternate, an unusual 
step. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not completely confirmed," association spokeswoman Kristin Matta said. 
"Given the circumstances, it's definitely a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwan's representative issued a statement Saturday saying she continues to 
train but has not been notified she is going to Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 If she was in Lillehammer, Kwan would be available if Harding was removed from 
the team at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Winter Games will begin Feb. 12, but women's figure skating doesn't start 
until Feb. 23 and the roster can be changed until Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding acknowledged Thursday that she learned shortly after she returned from 
the national championships that those around her were involved in the attack. 
But she denied knowing about the attack beforehand. Harding, who has held 
workouts before large, supportive audiences at a suburban mall during the past 
week, does not practice on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Several news organizations have quoted sources as saying Gillooly has agreed 
to plead guilty to one count of racketeering and would get a two-year sentence, 
rather than the maximum penalty of three years under the current conspiracy 
charge against him.

BO COMING BACK AS AN ANGEL?; BASEBALL: TENTATIVE ONE-YEAR DEAL REPORTEDLY 
REACHED WITH FORMER TWO-SPORT STAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bo Jackson is coming back to California again, this time, to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have reached a tentative agreement to sign Jackson to a one-year 
contract, according to highly placed sources, and are planning to schedule a 
news conference early this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who returned to baseball last season after undergoing surgery for an 
artificial hip -- an injury sustained while playing for the Raiders -- will be 
guaranteed less than $500,000, according to sources, but can earn more than $1 
million if he reaches incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Angels already have Chili Davis as their designated hitter, and 
are planning to start Eduardo Perez in left field, they have promised Jackson a 
shot at the starting left-field job. The Angels privately are concerned about 
Perez's right elbow, which became inflamed again while playing winter ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who won the comeback-player-of-the-year award, became a free agent 
three weeks ago when he rejected the Chicago White Sox's offer of arbitration. 
In 85 games last season, he batted .232 with 16 homers and 45 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a guy we think can help us," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said. "I 
think we have a nice club on the field, but we're not in position to absorb 
injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Jackson returns to the Angels nine years after they originally 
wanted him. Jackson was drafted in the 20th round by California in 1985, and 
visited again with the Angels before the 1986 draft. The Angels, however, felt 
that the Heisman Trophy winner would play in the NFL, and passed on him in the 
draft. He wound up being drafted by the Kansas City Royals, and in 1987, began 
a two-sport career by signing with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who was selected to the All-Star team as a baseball player and the 
Pro Bowl as a football player, nurtured his legendary status by hitting a 
leadoff homer in the 1989 All-Star game at Anaheim Stadium.

DEHERE HAS COLIC, WON'T RUN IN HUTCHESON STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dehere, 1993's 2-year-old champion, was scratched from today's Hutcheson 
Stakes at Gulfstream Park because of colic. 
</P>
<P>
 The withdrawal Saturday postponed both Dehere's debut as a 3-year-old and a 
much-anticipated rematch with unbeaten Holy Bull, another Kentucky Derby 
prospect who beat Dehere in their only meeting last year in the Belmont 
Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret causing so much disappointment for so many people," owner Bob 
Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere is expected to recover in time to run in the $200,000 Fountain of Youth 
on Feb. 19. He also is expected to run in the $500,000 Florida Derby on March 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutcheson had shaped up as an attractive early-season showdown of 
3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best horse race in South Florida in years," trainer Nick Zito said. His 
entry, Crary, and four others remain in the field for the $75,000, 
seven-furlong race. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten You And I probably will provide Holy Bull's main competition, along 
with Patton, an 11-length winner at Gulfstream on Jan. 8. Patton recently 
worked five furlongs in 57 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere had been the 7-5 morning-line favorite. Now, Holy Bull will be the 6-5 
morning-line choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the one we had to go after anyway," Sonny Hine, trainer of Patton, said 
of Holy Bull. "He has a lot of speed. . . . Dehere being out isn't going to 
change our strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull, to be ridden by Mike Smith, was third in the balloting for 
2-year-old of the year, behind Dehere and Southland-based Brocco.

STATE LAGS IN SEISMIC TESTING OF SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGE; DAVID FERRELL, s, isiting s; PAUL JACOBS, JEFFREY L. RABIN, 
RICHARD SIMON, This story was reported and written by Times staff writers 
Leslie Berger, David Ferrell, Paul Jacobs, Jeffrey L. Rabin and Richard Simon.

<P>
 Nearly four years after the Loma Prieta earthquake created a new sense of 
urgency to upgrade school safety, state officials have barely begun a survey to 
determine whether older public school buildings, including many damaged in the 
Northridge quake, should be brought up to more modern seismic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The state also has not inspected California's 55,000 public school buildings 
although officials had warned that a majority of them had "a potential for 
injury to students and teachers and for major property damage . . . if a 
moderate or greater earthquake occurs in a heavily populated urban area." 
</P>
<P>
 No buildings in the Los Angeles Unified School District collapsed when the 6.6 
temblor struck before dawn Jan. 17. But damage is estimated at $500 million to 
$700 million -- much of it in older structures. And officials say 
non-structural seismic hazards, such as unsecured cabinets, would have injured 
many students and teachers if the quake had hit during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the quake caused only minimal damage in Orange County, local 
educators realize that a disaster like Northridge or worse could occur here, 
especially along the coast where the cities of Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, 
Costa Mesa and Newport Beach sit directly over the Newport-Inglewood Fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of our (schools') proximity to the (fault), we have to take 
precautionary measures to make sure that our students are safe," said Jerry 
Buchanan, an assistant superintendent at Huntington Beach City School District. 
He said the district conducted several earthquake stress tests after the 1989 
Loma Prieta temblor to assure the stability of school foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tests show that the walls are strong and the foundations are stable, so 
for now, we feel that our schools are very safe -- knock on wood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, state officials say many school structures may be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though public schools are very good buildings, we need to sift through 
the good older buildings and find a few that are bad," said Tom Tobin, 
executive director of the state Seismic Safety Commission. "Some out there need 
to be identified and retrofitted" with seismic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that the eight most seriously damaged Los Angeles schools were 
built in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s -- before seismic safety standards 
were strengthened after the 1971 Sylmar quake.

 Four San Fernando Valley schools that have been closed indefinitely also were 
damaged in the Sylmar quake. The most severely damaged were two Granada Hills 
campuses -- Kennedy High School, which was in the final phase of construction 
when the Sylmar quake hit, and Van Gogh Elementary, which underwent extensive 
repairs after the 1971 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the financially troubled school district questioned whether 
seismic surveys or costly retrofitting were necessary at its 855 schools and 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me the buildings have been tested under fire," said Douglas 
Brown, director of facilities services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Field Act, the school earthquake safety law passed after the Long Beach 
quake of 1933, "doesn't guarantee that the building is not going to be 
damaged," Brown said. "It guarantees that the building is going to retain its 
integrity and generally not collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified school board member Julie Korenstein, whose San Fernando 
Valley district includes portions of Northridge, said: "Under the circumstances 
-- under the worst earthquake in Los Angeles history -- our schools fared very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 An examination of state and school district records, interviews with seismic 
safety experts and visits to damaged schools found: 
</P>
<P>
 * Thousands of schools in Orange and Los Angeles counties and throughout 
California were built before 1976, when earthquake safety standards for schools 
were strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 * Districts are required by law to upgrade buildings for seismic safety only 
during major remodeling or expansions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Neither the state architect's office, which oversees school construction, 
nor the school district is required to regularly inspect schools for seismic 
safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Much of the damage from the quake was caused by non-structural hazards such 
as unsecured cabinets, bookcases and light fixtures, but the school district 
does not have a state-recommended program to anchor objects that could fall or 
fly in an earthquake. Officials say they secure light fixtures and objects 
whenever they make renovations at schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown acknowledged that jammed doors and falling objects posed a potential 
hazard. "I think people would have been hurt in this quake, had (schools) been 
occupied, because of falling equipment . . . ," he said. "But people could have 
gotten out or could have been removed from those structures, without 
significant or perhaps any loss of life, except through trauma." 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Gary McGavin, a member of the Seismic Safety Commission, said some 
life-threatening hazards could be easily and inexpensively corrected. "We spend 
all this money on structures and essentially ignore the non-structural things," 
he said. "A falling bookcase can kill a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 For six decades, the state of California has recognized the importance of 
providing special seismic protection for schools. The codes for school 
construction have been more stringent than for most other structures since 
1933, when the Field Act was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, 1976 and 1988, there were major revisions in earthquake-resistance 
standards for construction of public elementary and secondary schools, based on 
new information from damage and collapse observed during earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although legislation passed 25 years ago required older unreinforced masonry 
buildings to be retrofitted, there is no requirement for schools to be brought 
up to the latest seismic safety standards unless they undergo major renovation. 
Nor is there a requirement for schools built before 1976 to tie down movable 
objects so they cannot fall or fly during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a month of Northern California's Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, 
then-Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) introduced a bill to provide 
$2.75 million to the Office of the State Architect for a review of older school 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, sponsored by the state Seismic Safety Commission, required the state 
architect to complete a survey of schools by Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "A major earthquake will still cause a significant loss of school functions 
and property damage and may cause injuries to students and teachers in these 
older schools," the commission reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill passed the Assembly but died in the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 During this same period, the state architect's office was urging then-Gov. 
George Deukmejian to add $3.5 million to the state budget for the first year of 
a comprehensive seismic review of schools, state colleges and universities, and 
state offices, according to a budget document submitted two months after Loma 
Prieta. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 55,000 projects involving elementary schools, middle schools, high 
schools and community colleges, state officials said 19,500 were constructed 
from 1933 to 1959, and another 20,500 were built between 1960 and 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing hazardous public schools up to current earthquake standards, 
officials estimated, could cost $2 billion to $5 billion statewide -- more than 
the $1.5-billion program to retrofit the state's freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 In requesting funds for a survey, the state architect's office pointed out, 
"Over half of our public school buildings were designed, constructed or 
structurally improved between enactment of the Field Act in 1933 and 1959, 
after which time significant revisions to the building codes were made. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Building elements designed using early practices and procedures have proven 
inadequate when subjected to actual earthquake forces." 
</P>
<P>
 The state architect began work on the survey, spending about $85,000 of 
$174,000 included in the state budget for the project. But work was halted 
after the Waters bill died. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, State Architect Harry C. Hallenbeck said he has no 
plans to resume the survey unless the Legislature orders it or his staff 
members who have examined some quake-damaged Los Angeles schools find problems 
in older facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are priorities," Hallenbeck said. "Since the Field Act in general is 
performing pretty well, it's hard for us to put this to the highest priority. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether this earthquake will demonstrate that the older buildings suffered 
versus the newer ones, it's just too early to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, now a congresswoman, said she still believes the statewide survey is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had a fear we would experience an earthquake and schoolchildren 
would be sitting in unsafe buildings," she said last week. "I thought it was 
important to do some advance planning and use some resources to ensure the 
schools' safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the major earthquakes in Southern California this century -- Long 
Beach in 1933, Sylmar in 1971, Whittier in 1987 and Northridge this year -- 
struck either before or after school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that there are 10,877 buildings in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District -- and that 9,457 were built before 1970, and 424 before 1930. But the 
heaviest period of construction was the 1950s and 1960s, when 6,161 buildings 
were erected. Only 1,400 buildings have been built since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of several Orange County districts showed that most schools were 
built before the 1971 Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Fullerton High, one of the county's oldest schools, has buildings 
dating from the late 1930s. Additions built onto the original structure were 
constructed from the 1940s through the '60s and adhered to the codes at those 
times. Those building codes, however, lag behind today's stricter standards. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Huntington Beach Union High School District, five of seven schools were 
built before 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, the most seriously damaged schools in the Northridge 
quake are likely to be closed at least several weeks, according to school 
officials. And officials said part of Kennedy High School in Granada Hills may 
need to be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 State inspectors found a three-inch fissure in the earth snaking its way 200 
yards from the baseball field through the girls' locker room, across a concrete 
patio and through the boys' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit at the school was the three-story administration building, with 
two floors of classrooms. Large cracks were visible all over the building. 
Ceiling tiles had come down. Windows broke. And outside, one overhead panel in 
a concrete arcade had slipped down several inches. 
</P>
<P>
 McGavin of the Seismic Safety Commission said the administration building 
could have collapsed "if the strong shaking had lasted a few seconds longer." 
</P>
<P>
 At Van Gogh Elementary School, which was heavily damaged in the Sylmar quake, 
much of the recent destruction was similar to that in 1971, said Donald 
Jepcott, a structural engineer examining schools for the National Science 
Foundation. But he said some of the damage did not appear as severe this time. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the columns supporting an outdoor eating pavilion were displaced 
more than a foot in 1971, but reinforced columns held up well in this month's 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials said the ground beneath the school is so unstable that 
the site may need to be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of a covered walkway between the eating pavilion and the auditorium 
struck the auditorium wall, creating a large crack at a side entrance. Many 
other cracks crisscrossed the floors of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 At Frost Middle School in Granada Hills, Principal Jay Peterman said: "It 
looks beautiful from the outside but it got hit pretty hard on the inside." The 
school opened in 1969 and is a split level. 
</P>
<P>
 Where a wooden column buckled beneath its canopy, an entrance to the building 
was rendered unusable. Elsewhere, metal screws were pulled from the bottoms of 
the columns supporting a covered walkway that was raised several inches at one 
end by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate danger to students, had they been in school during the 
quake, would have been items falling off shelves, from ceilings and out of 
cabinets, Peterman said. In a storage room for the chemistry labs, bottles of 
chemicals fell and broke. 
</P>
<P>
 The textbook storage room was thigh-deep in books. "If someone had been in 
there, they would've been severely injured," he said, adding that 
administrators are considering ways to restrain items on shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern, the principal said, was that heavy air conditioning units and 
water heaters mounted above classrooms were thrown around in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the capricious nature of the quake was the strikingly different 
impact it had on two identical two-story buildings erected in the 1920s at San 
Fernando Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "One we can't use," said Assistant Principal Ted Johnson. "It has major 
structural damage. . . . And the other one, 20 feet to the east of it and its 
exact twin, has got some plaster cracks. That's the extent of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, two bungalows -- in use at the school for about 30 years -- fell 
off their 18-inch-high wooden foundations and two more partially fell off, but 
officials said they remained structurally intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The building that officials said fared the best was the newest on campus, the 
cafeteria, built in the late 1970s. It had only minor cosmetic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the San Fernando Valley, one of the most severely damaged campuses was 
Marvin Avenue Elementary School, just a few hundred yards south of the buckled 
lanes of the Santa Monica Freeway at Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Two large, two-story classroom buildings are uninhabitable because of 
structural damage, said Principal Anna McLine. The worst-hit building, which 
looks out on the freeway, is webbed with cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of classrooms, including a computer lab, remain sealed because their 
doors were jammed shut by the quake. The door to the storage area where 
administrators had stashed 400 gallons of bottled water for use in emergencies 
also was jammed shut. 
</P>
<P>
 McLine, who said she believes Marvin was built in the early- to mid-1960s, 
speculated that the school's location might have played an important part in 
the damage. She cited the proximity of the crippled freeway and a collapsed 
parking structure on the grounds of Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center. "They're 
all in a straight line," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school officials said they cannot eliminate a $600-million backlog 
of deferred maintenance, such as leaky roofs, let alone commission a seismic 
survey or retrofitting of older school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in a triage mode, patching the holes year to year . . . ," said 
school board member Mark Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Public support for increased school funding has been hard to secure, Slavkin 
said, noting last year's defeat of a measure to lower the passage requirement 
for school bonds from a two-thirds to a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Sylmar quake, the Los Angeles school board sought approval of 
earthquake safety bonds. The measures were defeated twice. But Los Angeles city 
voters in 1990 approved a $376-million bond measure for seismic safety 
improvements to bridges and municipal buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin, whose west San Fernando Valley district was hard hit by the quake, 
said: "There is no way that this disaster can be looked at as an indictment of 
current school safety rules." But, he added, "every effort should be made to 
ensure that these facilities are at the highest level of safety and security 
for kids." 
</P>
<P>
 While the state architect's office and Los Angeles city school officials say 
they lack the money to survey older schools, at least one school district -- 
Berkeley -- undertook an evaluation of its schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all of the schools met Field Act requirements, five of the district's 
17 schools were found to be potentially unsafe. One had to be permanently 
closed, two are closed temporarily while undergoing retrofitting, and two 
others are scheduled for retrofit work. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkeley voters passed a $158-million school bond issue in June, 1992, to pay 
the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 "School buildings built before 1976 should be examined," said Arrieta Chakos, 
legislative liaison for Berkeley schools. "For us, the Loma Prieta earthquake 
was a wake-up call."

TV BRINGS CITY COUNCILS TO O.C. HOMES -- WARTS AND ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes, it's more like watching "America's Funniest Home Videos" than the 
dignified proceedings of representative democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tustin, a speaker brandishing a stuffed rooster urged the City Council to 
lift a longstanding ban on live farm animals. In Newport Beach, a city official 
-- who had tuned in at home -- phoned in during a meeting to talk a colleague 
through technical difficulties he was experiencing with a council video 
presentation. In Laguna Niguel, a tape-delayed broadcast of a council meeting 
was yanked from the airwaves after technicians realized that the entire session 
was recorded without sound. 
</P>
<P>
 And nearly every one of the 22 cities in the county that broadcast council 
meetings can roll tape of residents whose desire to vent their outrage 
obviously outweighed concerns about personal appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had people coming into the council in whatever they were wearing when they 
were watching -- jogging suits, whatever," recalled former Irvine Mayor Sally 
Anne Sheridan. "They just were so angry over what they saw, they came down 
disheveled." 
</P>
<P>
 But in addition to supplying amusing footage for future documentaries, the 
camera's gradual introduction into council chambers over the past 10 years has 
also had a discernible influence on the workings of local democracies, 
political observers say. Not only have cable broadcasts heightened public 
knowledge about council machinations as never before, but they also may be 
affecting the decision-making process itself, some observers contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the most dramatic effect of public access coverage has been to better 
inform the public about local government. People who would never sit through 
the tedium of an entire city council meeting can now sit on their sofas while 
viewing items which most affect them. Repeat broadcasts and videocassette 
recorders allow even more residents to watch the meetings at their leisure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people out there who won't come to City Council meetings, 
but watch it religiously on cable," said Costa Mesa resident John Feeney, who 
has more than three years of videotaped council meetings filed away to settle 
any potential disputes about who said what and when. 
</P>
<P>
 Although ratings of council coverage aren't kept, many elected officials can 
attest to the broadcasts' popularity. They say they have been stopped in 
supermarkets, in restaurants, at parks, and even while walking down the street 
by strangers who have seen them on the small screen. For council members, the 
medium carries a message -- they are being watched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you're on the council and you look out in the audience and there's 
nobody there," said Newport Beach Mayor Clarence J. Turner. "You think you are 
talking into a vacuum, and you aren't. People are watching." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheridan humorously learned about the far reach of Irvine's public access 
Channel 3 a few years ago when she returned from Los Angeles late one night 
with her mother. The former mayor nervously noticed a tough-looking biker 
shadowing her car on the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man started waving frantically," Sheridan said. "I rolled down my window 
with my mother in tears, and he said, 'Are you Sally Anne Sheridan?' And I 
said, 'Yes, I am.' And he said, 'I voted for you. You look just like you do on 
TV.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, some of whom could qualify for guest spots on the loudly 
fractious "The McLaughlin Group," concede that the television camera has had a 
civilizing effect on their public personas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say there has been noticeable improvement in behavior" since cable, 
said Mission Viejo Councilman Robert D. Breton. "We used to have antics like 
walking off the dais and refusing to come back, refusing to vote in order to 
see how others would vote, name-calling, calling each other out of order and 
other belligerent behavior. . . . That kind of thing (they) would never have 
been engaged in if those meetings had been televised." 
</P>
<P>
 Home viewers haven't been shy about demonstrating their displeasure over 
council missteps either. Time and again residents -- in shorts, thongs and all 
manner of dress -- have gotten up from their couches and marched down to the 
council chambers to inject their opinions into an ongoing debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the cable watchdogs actually change council decisions. In 
Huntington Beach in 1990, a developer who was outraged over a vote he saw on 
television raced down to the Civic Center and, after a brief recess, persuaded 
the council to reverse its original vote on a controversial residential 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 But if elected officials feel pressure to behave better for viewers -- aka 
voters -- council members also are aware of the tube's upside -- exposure. Most 
city officials report there has been grandstanding by many council members, 
especially when cable coverage first began in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 When the camera clicked on, council meetings mysteriously started to lengthen 
as council members demonstrated a new fondness for extended speeches, city 
officials said. Some council members seemed overly attentive to their 
small-screen image, observers noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's conscious or unconscious, they look into the monitor to see how 
they or their colleagues are coming across," said Mark Petracca, a professor of 
political science at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, council members aren't the only ones using the camera to their 
advantage. Gadflies and community activists also try to capitalize on the 
medium's large audience. In Newport Beach recently, as placards were waved in 
front of cameras, National Organization for Women supporters handed out yellow 
plastic pigs to male council members at one council meeting. The city was 
investigating sexual harassment allegations against police officers at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly creates the opportunity for a lot of theater," added Petracca, 
who studies cable television and local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members contend that after a few months of adjusting to the glare of 
television coverage, they ignore the cameras and concentrate on their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody sooner or later may play to the cameras," said Cypress Councilwoman 
Gail H. Kerry. "But I think we've grown beyond that. After a while you forget 
the TV is there." 
</P>
<P>
 While he backs cable coverage of local government, Petracca argues its use 
contains two possible downsides. First, with more people watching meetings at 
home, fewer people are showing up at council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching isn't participating," Petracca said. "And if you think it is, that 
could be dangerous since it could create a false sense of involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Petracca contends, councils may be making important decisions behind the 
scenes in an effort to avoid appearing overly disagreeable on television. While 
not technically illegal as long as they aren't meeting as a group outside of 
council chambers, the practice deprives the public of the give and take of a 
healthy debate, Petracca says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are those of us who enjoy the entertainment of a good tiff," Petracca 
said. "But most people don't like conflict and don't like to see it among their 
elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always rather amazed at the lack of substantive justification for why 
they voted the way they did, from watching television," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 As widespread as cable coverage is, nine cities in the county still have not 
adopted the format. Most cities say they want it, but lack the funds to install 
the technology. In Fullerton, one of the largest communities without council 
broadcasts, community activist Alan Morton is leading a drive to plug his city 
into cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find the council has a split personality," Morton said. "When there's a 
full house, they are courteous, cheerful, kind; they're like Boy Scouts. But 
when no one is at a council meeting, it's entirely different. It's the mice 
will play when the cat's away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to level the playing field, and cable television will do that," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities without television coverage of council meetings are Orange, 
Fountain Valley, La Habra, La Palma, Laguna Hills, Lake Forest, San Juan 
Capistrano and Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, political observers predict, every city in Orange County will 
televise its city council meetings. And as technology improves in the years to 
come, residents will be able to interact directly with council members from 
home, via cable boxes that supply officials immediate feedback about their 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearer future, however, voters might soon see council broadcasts play a 
role in local elections. Snippets from council tapes may soon be used to paint 
complimentary or unflattering portraits of office seekers, Dana Point 
Councilman Mike Eggers, a political consultant, predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you sit up there for seven hours, it's hard not to say the wrong word or 
have a dazed look on your face every once in a while," Eggers said. "It's still 
a relatively new phenomenon, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it used that 
way."

AFTERSHOCK OF 5.0 RATTLES L.A.; U.S. ALLOTS MORE AID; AFTERMATH: BARRAGE OF 
STRONG TEMBLORS SENDS SOME RESIDENTS BACK INTO SHELTERS. ADMINISTRATION'S DONNA 
SHALALA ANNOUNCES $28 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL RELIEF.

<P>
 A string of powerful pre-dawn aftershocks -- including a magnitude 5.0 temblor 
-- rattled a sleeping Los Angeles on Saturday, putting police on temporary 
alert, buckling already weakened structures and sending some nervous residents 
scrambling back to shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the strongest aftershock to hit the city in 10 days was not enough to 
impede recovery efforts, as detours were opened around collapsed freeways and 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala announced 
that she was making available an additional $28 million in federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Touring the quake damage at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, Shalala 
also said she had persuaded the Treasury Department to issue thousands of 
Social Security checks a week earlier than usual to ensure that the elderly 
receive their benefits on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking very rigid federal programs and we are making them flexible," 
she said. "We can't do everything by the book in a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 The day's other developments included: 
</P>
<P>
 * The barrage of aftershocks -- nine greater than magnitude 3.0 were recorded 
in the five hours between 2:03 a.m. and 7 a.m. -- knocked out street lights in 
Santa Monica, snapped a water main in Northridge and crumbled what was left of 
a four-story parking structure at Cal State Northridge that was slated for 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seeking to crack down on fraud, county welfare officials began imposing a 
three-day waiting period for emergency food stamps and said all offices will be 
closed today while they set up a computer system to help weed out bogus claims. 
On Saturday, about 10 people were arrested for allegedly "ripping the system 
off" by buying -- and reselling -- the food stamps outside a South-Central Los 
Angeles check-cashing store, Agriculture Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amid growing complaints that landlords have been using the quake to oust 
tenants and raise rents, city officials urged apartment dwellers to be aware of 
their rights and not be pressured into relinquishing undamaged units. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caltrans opened a detour around the Golden State Freeway in the Santa 
Clarita Valley, restoring California's primary north-south route to 40% of 
capacity. A bridge near the interchange of the Golden State and Antelope Valley 
freeways was dynamited in preparation for emergency reconstruction of 
earthquake-damaged spans. Meanwhile, engineers closed two lanes on the bridge 
connecting the Ventura Freeway to the Hollywood Freeway to shore up a weakened 
column. 
</P>
<P>
 * The state Department of Health Services and the Department of Water and 
Power announced that all water in Los Angeles is safe. Residents no longer need 
to boil or disinfect water if they had been living under those restrictions, 
but they are urged to run their bath or shower for several minutes to flush out 
the pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although more than 5,000 people remained at 31 Red Cross shelters, the 
population at five Salvation Army tent cities had dwindled to less than 600 and 
National Guard troops began dismantling the encampments at Lanark Park and West 
Valley Park. Still, the aftershocks sent some recent campers, who finally had 
worked up the courage to return home, scurrying back to shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my apartment, there is always something moving," said Rosa Ana Moreira, 
38, who sought refuge with her 10-year-old daughter Saturday morning at the 
Winnetka Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 quake, Moreira's family had been sleeping in a car outside 
their Northridge apartment building, which was deemed safe by inspectors but 
seemed too precarious to her. On Friday, for the first time since the quake, 
she spent the night inside. But the early morning aftershocks only confirmed 
her doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to stay here until I feel safe," she said at the tent city, "until 
there is no more trembling." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucile M. Jones said the aftershocks were 
within "a normal range," even though they have been more numerous and more 
powerful than normally expected after a magnitude 6.6 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, in a briefing at the Caltech Seismological Laboratory, said the chances 
of another magnitude 5.0 aftershock in the next week are about one in seven, 
and the chances of another one in the next year are about 50-50. She added that 
there is little immediate concern that an earthquake larger than 6.6 will 
result directly from the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the earth settling into its new position," she said. "Large 
blocks have moved, and the earth is still readjusting." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5.0 aftershock at 3:20 a.m. was strongest since President Clinton was 
jolted by a 5.1 quake while visiting Los Angeles on Jan. 19, two days after the 
6.6 temblor. But Shalala, who has been surveying earthquake damage with other 
top federal officials, said she slept right through it. 
</P>
<P>
 Joking with aides at a Burbank hotel, she said she hoped nobody would think 
that was "an indication of my responsiveness to this disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala was accompanied by Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James 
Lee Witt, Social Security Commissioner Shirley Chater and Assistant Secretary 
for Aging Fernando Torres-Gil, who joined the secretary to make certain that 
senior citizens are not overlooked in the federal response to the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Touring County-USC Medical Center, Shalala shuffled through a maze of cracked 
walls and buckling support columns, passing patients on gurneys in hallways. 
She said federal funds should be used to help the hospital's long-range 
development, rather than patching up outdated structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to see this as an opportunity to plan for health care in the 21st 
Century, not rebuild what we have," she told Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 At the next stop, the Mid-Valley Comprehensive Health Center in Van Nuys, 
Shalala visited a 6-year-old boy whose face had been cut by flying glass during 
the quake. She asked: "Were you in your bed during the earthquake? Was it 
scary?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sleeping in the truck still," Michael Miller responded. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy then asked why the President had not come personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sent me because he didn't have a voice," said Shalala, apparently 
referring to Clinton's hoarseness after his State of the Union address. "But 
he's worried about you guys." Making a Financial Killing 
</P>
<P>
 Even as relief poured in, officials expressed concerns about abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Wary of fraudulent claims, authorities began instituting a 72-hour waiting 
period for earthquake victims seeking emergency food stamps. Moreover, 
officials said all food stamp centers will be closed today to set up computer 
equipment designed to ferret out those who do not qualify for the program. 
Offices will reopen at 7 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows a lot more time, not only to complete checks, but to look at 
information on the application a lot more closely, to see if there are any 
inconsistencies," said Dick Montoya, spokesman for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, which runs the food stamp program. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, officials reduced the number of sites from 29 to 16 in an effort 
to assist law enforcement authorities concerned about controlling crowds of 
1,000 or more who have waited in line for hours, hopeful of getting coupons 
that can be used to purchase food. Scuffles have broken out at several sites. 
</P>
<P>
 To compensate for the closures, four large centers will be opened at Dodger 
Stadium, Whittier Narrows Recreation Area, Victoria Park in Carson and the 
County Building on the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, amid increasing reports that landlords were using the earthquake to 
oust longtime tenants, city officials urged apartment dwellers not succumb to 
owners' pressure tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some unscrupulous landlords who have found an opportunity for a 
financial killing," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who was among those 
participating in a news conference designed to put tenants on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling cheated by price-gouging merchants after the quake, some Valley 
residents took matters into their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, they returned to stores where they said they had paid inflated 
prices for water and batteries, confronted the shopkeepers and demanded that 
they sign an agreement pledging to treat customers fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Two merchants said they knew of no such abuse, but signed the agreement 
anyway. However, at a Pacoima gas station, the clerk refused, saying she wanted 
to consult her attorney. Mother Nature Helps Out 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's aftershocks, centered near Chatsworth, sent engineers scrambling to 
assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The CSUN parking structure, which partially collapsed in the initial quake and 
had been crumbling slowly ever since, was finished off by the powerful 
aftershocks. The four-story structure was reduced to one story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Demolition will be just a little bit easier now," said Kaine Thompson, a 
campus spokeswoman. "Mother Nature is helping us out." 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershocks also forced Los Angeles Unified School District officials to 
reinspect 14 San Fernando Valley campuses set to reopen Monday. Although 
surface cracks in walls grew slightly at some schools, the aftershocks had no 
effect on the reopenings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may look a little worse, but it will not adversely affect the health and 
safety of the children," said Doug Brown, director of school facilities for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineers, concerned that some support columns may have been weakened 
by the aftershocks, began shoring up the connector bridge between the Ventura 
and Hollywood freeways. The Glendale Boulevard bridge over the Golden State 
Freeway also was closed for a few hours after inspectors noticed that a joint 
had slipped, but later determined that it posed no threat. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that dampened the excitement of officials who gathered Saturday to 
open a three-mile stretch of The Old Road, which now serves as a detour around 
the damaged Golden State Freeway in the Newhall Pass area. On Friday, Caltrans 
also reopened the southbound truck route from the Antelope Valley Freeway to 
the Golden State Freeway, allowing traffic to bypass congested Sierra Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want everybody to know that California is open and ready for business," 
Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Red Cross officials opened what one called the "Wal-Mart" of 
disaster centers, which can handle up to 1,000 people a day. The center is in 
the parking lot of the severely damaged Northridge Fashion Center.

GARAMENDI OPENS RACE FOR GOVERNOR, VOWS RENEWAL; DEMOCRATS: INSURANCE 
COMMISSIONER STRESSES HARD WORK, RISK-TAKING IN WHAT EXPERTS SEE AS AN UPHILL 
BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Surrounded by scores of friends and family in his Mother Lode hometown, 
Democrat John Garamendi launched his campaign for governor Saturday with a 
pledge to revive California's spirit, bring back its economic luster and make 
the state work again. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, 49, a fourth-generation descendant of Gold Rush-era miners and 
ranchers, offered a new style Democratic agenda that is tough on criminals and 
puts welfare recipients to work, but he also emphasized his qualities of 
leadership based on listening to people rather than preaching at them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a governor who will lift a shovel or a hammer to get things fixed and 
doesn't mind the dirt under his fingernails," said Garamendi, a 19-year veteran 
of state government, first as a legislator and now as California's first 
elected insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 30-minute speech from a stage erected on Main Street, the 6-foot-2 
former UC football star said: "We need a governor with the experience and good 
sense to figure out what's not working and the courage to change government so 
that it will work." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi began what many political experts view to be an uphill campaign to 
win the Democratic nomination for governor over state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, 
48, in the June 7 primary. The winner will battle Republican Gov. Pete Wilson 
for the right to serve a four-year term beginning in January, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent Field Poll, Brown led Garamendi 45% to 30% among Democrats. 
But the poll also indicated that both Democrats were running ahead of Wilson, 
who has suffered the worst public approval ratings of any modern California 
governor during the last two recession-plagued years. Wilson's stock in the 
polls has revived in recent months, and political experts expect a tough, close 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 As an underdog challenger, Garamendi said he is willing to take risks and do 
the unusual to win the election. He said he is prepared to do whatever is 
needed to revitalize a California that has been battered by economic reversals, 
natural disasters, declining public services and a sense that things do not 
work very well anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard work is the keynote of his campaign and his promises. Garamendi is 
working side by side with people in various occupations as he campaigns 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Garamendi, the sleeves of his white oxford shirt rolled up to the 
elbows, declared: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not just running for governor. I am working for governor. And I will 
make the government work as hard as Californians work when I become governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi delivered his address to about 1,000 people in this small town 50 
miles southeast of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting was full of symbolism as Garamendi -- wearing jeans, cowboy boots 
and a big brass belt buckle embossed with the seal of the state of California 
-- gestured to the red schoolhouse he attended and the Town Hall where he won 
his badges as an Eagle Scout. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked of a "sense of community" and the residents who are working to 
create a park and finding a way to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 On a far broader scale, he said, California can solve its massive problems 
only by devising such teamwork-oriented solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced we can renew the California community and our spirit," he 
said. "The responsibility begins at the very top, with the governor. It is 
here, within us. We just need to bring it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi sought to make the connection between disparate parts of the state 
by noting that lumber harvested from the nearby Sierra slopes must get to 
market in Los Angeles via Interstate 5, sections of which was shut down by the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't get (the lumber) there, we don't have a job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In broad strokes, his program included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Revitalization of the economy by encouraging those industries that are doing 
well and adapting to changing conditions, and by helping the emerging 
businesses of the high-tech era, in biomedicine, communications and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investment to rebuild California's public education system so that, he said, 
it again is the best in the world. As governor, Garamendi would work at least 
five days a year as a teacher in a public classroom, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * A crackdown on crime that would include tough enforcement of California's 
death penalty, and passage of legislation that would put career violent 
criminals in prison for life and first-time offenders in no-nonsense boot 
camps. He also advocated higher spending on drug prevention and treatment 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reconstruction of California's public works as a foundation to economic 
growth, particularly in the wake of the Northridge earthquake, a disaster that 
he said will require increases in state gasoline and sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * A re-evaluation of how government works to make it smarter and to take 
advantage of new technology and communications, computers and databases. "If 
American Express and Visa can do it, our government can do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday marked the start of John Raymond Garamendi's second run for the 
governorship and fourth run for statewide office. The first, in 1982, was 
ill-timed and premature, most experts agree, and he was trounced in the 
Democratic primary by then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi weighed running again in 1986 but decided to try for state 
controller instead. He lost that primary too. In 1990 he won election to 
statewide office for the first time by running for the new office of insurance 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been viewed by California political insiders as a somewhat quixotic, 
go-it-alone politician, with a large dose of ambition and self-esteem. But they 
also acknowledge that he is one of the brightest people in California politics 
and that after four years in the state Assembly and 14 years in the state 
Senate, Garamendi has few peers in his grasp of the intricacies of California 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi also has been a pioneer in the effort to reform health care. A plan 
he developed for California, which has never been approved, became the basis 
for President Clinton's reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 During his three years as insurance commissioner, Garamendi has sought to 
force companies to cough up rebates promised in the same 1988 ballot 
proposition that created the elected commissionership, to curb rate increases 
and to rehabilitate failed insurance companies. The results have been mixed, 
but Garamendi generally has received high marks for energy and effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi acknowledges the maverick label. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not one to sit and let the world go by," he said recently. "I take an 
active role in what I do and sometimes that rubs people the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 Few gave Garamendi much chance of denying Brown the Democratic nomination for 
governor when he first talked about running again. But he has doggedly pursued 
the effort even in the face of Brown's huge fund-raising advantage, and polling 
continues to show that he is better known among likely voters than is Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has been viewed by many Democrats as the natural successor to the 
governorship in the footsteps of her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. 1959-67, 
and her brother, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 1975-83. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown does not have Garamendi's or Wilson's experience in the nuts and bolts 
of government but has the television star quality that has been touted as a key 
to winning the top office in a state with a population of 32 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The requirement for an effective television campaign in California is money -- 
millions of dollars of it. When campaign finance reports are filed Monday, 
Brown is expected to show about $5 million in the bank compared to Garamendi's 
$1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garamendi's willingness to take risks -- by calling for tax increases to 
fix earthquake damage, for example, while Brown said it was premature -- and 
his energy and knowledge of government, have given his campaign legitimacy, 
political experts said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi aides believe he can score a breakthrough in face-to-face debates 
with Brown. Garamendi has challenged her to a series of 10. Brown says she will 
debate, but there has been no agreement yet on how many or what format they 
will take. 
</P>
<P>
 Field Poll official Mark DiCamillo said Garamendi must find a way to appeal to 
Democratic women, who favored Brown by 21 percentage points in the latest 
survey. But experts said Garamendi is strong on issues seen as important to 
women, including crime, the economy and health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, however, is considered by the California political Establishment as a 
likable candidate, an assessment not shared by Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a forum of political consultants last week, Wilson campaign manager 
George Gorton said: "This is not a year to be likable. This is a tough year. 
The mood is tough, tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional California announcement for governor is a daylong or two-day 
tour of major California media markets, the sort of script Brown is expected to 
follow when she announces her candidacy in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's announcement Saturday was symbolic of an unconventional campaign 
in an election year in which Garamendi strategists believe voters will not be 
satisfied with conventional politics. 
</P>
<P>
 For two weeks, Brown aides had mocked the idea of announcing in a town -- as 
Garamendi emcee Ophelia McFadden put it Saturday "that few have heard about and 
most of us cannot pronounce." McFadden then called the town of 1,274 residents 
what most locals do, "Moke Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 By coming back to Mokelumne Hill -- the family ranch in Chile Gulch is a few 
miles away -- Garamendi also was able to talk about his deep roots in 
California history, matching those of Brown, whose family also goes back 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the crowd behind him included his wife, Patti, associate director of 
the Peace Corps, his mother, Mary Jane, his six children and many other 
offspring of the family of Basque and Italian pioneers. Profile: John Garamendi 
</P>
<P>
 John Garamendi formally announced his candidacy for governor of California on 
Saturday. He will compete with state Treasurer Kathleen Brown for the 
Democratic nomination in the June 7 primary. The winner will run in the fall 
campaign against Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who is seeking a second term.

NEWS ANALYSIS; NEW TACTICS SEEN IN ROUND 2 OF MENENDEZ CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before the last Menendez jury passed one final note reporting deadlock, 
the prosecution and defense were plotting strategies for the expected retrial 
-- guaranteeing that it will not be a simple replay of the grueling six-month 
trial that ended in a complete no-decision Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, defense attorney Leslie Abramson was meeting with members of the 
first jury to give up, the one judging Erik Menendez, and gaining strength by 
learning how her bold strategy had struck a deep emotional chord in some of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, several women on the jury had become so enamored with Abramson and her 
argument -- that the Menendez brothers were the real victims in their Beverly 
Hills household -- that she was talking Saturday of having them join her as 
public advocates for the younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution, meanwhile, was digging up new evidence -- and weighing 
provocative tactics -- in an effort to win convictions the next time, again 
trying for first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The first go-around ended Friday with a pair of hung juries for Lyle Menendez, 
26, and Erik Menendez, 23, in the 1989 shotgun slayings of their parents, Jose 
and Kitty Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments from jurors since then have made plain that prosecutors did not 
adequately counteract the aggressive, no-holds-barred defense typified by 
Abramson's comment early in the trial: "Let the sleaze fly!" 
</P>
<P>
 So when a retrial is staged, probably in six months to a year, prosecutors are 
expected to be not so prim themselves. They have already given signs that they 
will hammer from the start at one theory -- barely explored this time -- that 
might better explain the family rift that led the Menendez brothers to blast 
away at their parents: homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 That is only one way prosecutors will change course in the wake of the hung 
juries, seen by legal experts and by defense attorney Jill Lansing as a clear 
defense victory. The lineup of witnesses, the presentation of critical 
evidence, jury selection -- all may be different in the next go-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, three sets of juries -- a grand jury and two trial juries -- have 
refused to buy the notion that the brothers killed merely for greed. "Nobody on 
our jury believed they did it for money," said Sharyn Bishop, 43, who was on 
the Lyle Menendez jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Rage and hatred were more believable motivations, jurors said. And the defense 
apparently gave the better explanation for those -- that the "boys," as defense 
lawyers constantly called them, had been molested by their father. 
</P>
<P>
 Only at the very end of the trial did the prosecution suggest that the 
conflict may have involved sex, but hardly the way the defense portrayed it. In 
his closing argument, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lester Kuriyama suggested that Erik 
Menendez was gay, and that his sexual orientation -- not abuse by his parents 
-- fed a family friction that led to the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuriyama conceded that the evidence backing his claim was thin. But what 
jurors did not know was that Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg 
-- for unexplained reasons -- had largely blocked the prosecution from 
exploring the sensitive issue with witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the mentions were not lost on jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews Saturday at Abramson's office with selected reporters, female 
members of the Erik Menendez jury said they spent weeks arguing over his sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 The men on the panel, the female jurors said, were fascinated by the issue. 
One suggested the brothers were homosexual lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one account, one of the female jurors called the allegations of 
homosexuality "the last straw for the prosecution. They couldn't prove hatred 
or greed. So they played this dirty little trick at the end and the guys fell 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said comments like that underscore the risk in presenting such 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would, and should rightfully turn off jury members who feel this boy is 
being lambasted because he's gay or the personal details of his life are being 
thrown in gratuitously," said Robert Pugsley, a Southwestern University law 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors insisted that there is nothing gratuitous about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason the murders occurred is because the parents had had it with their 
children and were no longer going to support them as in the past," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Pamela Bozanich said. "We are convinced the father was very upset about 
Erik's possible homosexuality . . . as well as Lyle's spending and failures at 
(Princeton). 
</P>
<P>
 "The brothers simply couldn't stand the idea of not continuing to live the way 
they had before and also harbored a great deal of resentment and hatred toward 
their parents," Bozanich said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "There will be efforts made to admit evidence of Erik's 
homosexuality. We will continue, with vigor, those efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors, however, remain uncertain: First, persuading a judge to let 
them introduce such evidence. Then, critically, what evidence? 
</P>
<P>
 The past few weeks it became common knowledge around the courthouse that 
Vanity Fair magazine is about to publish a suggestive photo of Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best indicator that this will be a serious issue at the retrial 
has been the reaction of the emotional leader of the defense, Abramson. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, she belittled the prosecution's scattered suggestions that 
Erik Menendez was gay as "disgusting." But, after the trial was over, she was 
ready with a more substantive response, telling a TV interviewer -- without 
agreeing that Erik Menendez is gay -- that it is just as bad to rape a 
homosexual as anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the issue of homosexuality, legal experts said, the second trial 
likely will feature a series of new battlegrounds: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jury selection will become a war. Having had the advantage of seeing how 
different jurors reacted this time, both sides know just who they would like to 
hear the next case. And it's hardly a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution, noted UCLA law professor Peter Arenella, wants "working-class 
white males." The defense will want women, and "preferably women who in some 
sense have some direct experience, either themselves or with others, with 
people hurt or abused -- which, in this society, is a lot of women." 
</P>
<P>
 * The prosecution will fight not to be outflanked by the defense. In the first 
trial, that happened with several key pieces of evidence, as when the defense 
got to play first for jurors the tape of a counseling session the brothers had 
with their psychologist, L. Jerome Oziel -- in which Lyle Menendez compared 
missing his dead parents to missing the family dog. 
</P>
<P>
 By playing the tape first -- after trying to keep it secret -- the defense was 
able to put its own spin on it. They had an expert tell jurors that when Lyle 
and Erik Menendez used the word "mother," for instance, they really meant 
"brother," as when Lyle said: "My father should be killed. There's no question 
. . . he's impossible to live with for myself . . . based on what he's doing to 
my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 * Some witnesses who played starring roles the first time may have cameos, at 
best. That means Oziel, according to legal experts. He was a key prosecution 
witness at the first trial, but became a punching bag for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * The prosecution is almost guaranteed to use its own expert witnesses on the 
mental state of the brothers, something it did not do at the first trial. The 
defense presented half a dozen such experts, who said the brothers' tearful 
tales of abuse were believable. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozanich belittled such testimony as "psychobabble" not worthy of a response. 
But only half the jurors saw it her way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you think that opposing experts are providing ludicrous testimony, 
it's necessary to provide your own experts, to give the jury an alternate 
theory," said Ronald Markman, a lawyer and psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the jurors are like those about to hit the TV talk shows, some will be 
hard to sway. Take Betty Burke, an alternate on the Erik Menendez jury who came 
to Abramson's office to meet with a few reporters. An account quoted her as 
saying, "I went home thinking, 'I could kill Jose myself.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For the defense, the challenge of a second trial is clear: in recounting their 
tales of abuse, the brothers must once again summon the emotional pain that 
proved so compelling to many jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said he was confident that would not happen. "I do 
not believe the emotional pull will be there," he said. If it is, he added, the 
brothers are "better actors than even I thought they were, if they can pull it 
off a second time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing, Lyle Menendez's attorney, promised his testimony would be just as 
riveting: "He has quite a wellspring of pain to draw on."

LEGAL AFTERSHOCKS WILL KEEP LOTS OF LAWYERS BUSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER

<P>
 Within a day of the Northridge earthquake, Santa Monica attorney Joel B. 
Castro's phone was ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that Castro, a "construction defects litigation specialist" who has 
won major verdicts for disgruntled homeowners, is going to be very busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, so will a lot of other attorneys. They range from Legal Aid 
lawyers advising poor people on their rights to corporate lawyers counseling 
insurance companies on which claims to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last week, at least two law firms ran advertisements in local 
newspapers soliciting clients with earthquake damage. "In the wake of every 
disaster, lawyers appear; that's why they're not very popular," Loyola 
University law professor Gideon Kanner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, there may be hundreds, perhaps thousands of lawsuits stemming from 
the quake that took at least 57 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one has been filed yet. But insurance experts say the volume of damage 
claims filed here is running three to five times higher than in Northern 
California after the 1989 Loma Prieta temblor -- a strong indication that there 
will be more litigation. Still, legal experts say it is likely to be months 
before the full legal ramifications of the quake emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time it takes a couple months before people realize they're not 
going to get what they think they're going to get, and then they come to us," 
said William Shernoff, a Claremont lawyer who specializes in lawsuits against 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, one former tenant of the Northridge Meadows complex, where 16 
people were crushed, said he has talked to three attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 And Herb Katz, a forensic architect who has examined a lot of quake damage, 
said he expects to see a lawsuit filed on behalf of the heirs of a woman who 
died when a 3-year-old house slid off a hill. "That shouldn't have happened," 
Katz said. "That kind of thing will start raising its ugly little head." 
</P>
<P>
 As a sign of the range of legal issues stemming from the quake, more than half 
a dozen attorneys, led by Century City real estate lawyer Ronald I. Silverman, 
are preparing a quake audiotape for members of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. 
He expects it to be completed by midweek and the Bar will sell it for about 
$65, Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the questions: Does the heir of a person who died in an apartment 
building that collapsed have a viable wrongful death suit? (Perhaps.) Can a 
tenant whose building has been damaged get out of his lease? (Probably.) If a 
home buyer was in escrow at the time the quake struck, can he walk away from 
the deal? (Maybe.) 
</P>
<P>
 One issue does appear clear at this point: The state of California seems far 
less vulnerable than it did after the Loma Prieta quake, when more than 40 
people died on collapsed freeways in the Bay Area -- spawning millions of 
dollars in settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 In this quake, only one person -- a police officer -- died on a damaged 
freeway and state officials say they have no idea whether his family will file 
a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro is not sure he is going to file any lawsuits. But he has been 
vigorously examining one possible case since Jan. 18, when he got his first 
quake-related call. 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon, he made his first trip to a damaged San Fernando Valley 
apartment complex. As he stood on a balcony taking his first look, the building 
"was still rocking and rolling," Castro said. Since then he has been back 
several times with structural engineers, architects, insurance adjusters and a 
lawyer representing the builder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been opening walls, taking out plywood, examining the nails. This will 
go on for another two weeks or so. We have our consultants. They have theirs. 
We have all the blueprints. In the next month, we'll sit down and piece 
together what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes amicably, the two sides will agree on the extent of damage, what 
the repairs will cost and who has to pay. If not, Castro will sue and extensive 
preparation for trial will begin. Scale models will be built, along with 
animated presentations of how sections of the building collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Castro likes his chances: The building was erected only three 
years ago and therefore is subject to the most stringent codes, making a case 
easier to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at a case legally, you always want to have a structure built 
after 1976," Castro said. "The city of Los Angeles instituted broad-based code 
changes after the 1971 Sylmar quake." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro and other lawyers point out one potential impediment to lawsuits: 
California has a 10-year statute of limitations on construction defects. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is a way around the statute if a defect has been fraudulently 
concealed -- for example, if plasterboard was covertly used when a set of 
blueprints called for plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential problem for those thinking of suing is the so-called act of 
God doctrine. Some defense lawyers may argue that as long as a structure 
complied with codes in effect when it was built, the owner is not liable for 
damage caused by a disaster such as an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But a long line of California cases have held that "an act of God is not a 
separate defense," said UCLA law school professor Gary Schwartz, a specialist 
in tort law. Rather, an act of God is simply one factor that could be 
considered by a jury, he said. Another is whether reasonable precautions had 
been taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 6.6 earthquake in California in 1994 is by no means unforeseeable," meaning 
that the possibility of such a quake should have been taken into consideration 
by a builder, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro got his client through a referral; other lawyers took out ads. One is 
David G. Epstein of Irvine, who said his firm is "one of the most aggressive 
and one of the most successful" in the field. His firm has been running an ad 
that proclaims: 
</P>
<P>
 "If your building was constructed within the last 10 years, you may be able to 
recover for damages even if your property was not insured for earthquake 
damage. As a prominent construction defect law firm, we've helped our clients 
recover millions of dollars in damages for faulty construction." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the ad appeared, Epstein said in an interview, he has responded to calls 
about damaged buildings in the San Fernando Valley, on the Westside and in 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 As quake suits make their way through the courts, some dirty little secrets 
will emerge, said Kelly G. Richardson, a Pasadena attorney who also specializes 
in construction defects. Richardson said his firm, too, has received numerous 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are now seeing in very graphic terms the terrible damage that occurs when 
buildings do not have the proper plywood backing or structural nailing," 
Richardson said. "We have been telling homeowners for years" that there has 
been insufficient enforcement of construction standards aimed at preventing 
seismic damage. He said that inspections had declined since the passage of 
Proposition 13 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks lawyer Howard S. Levine, whose firm ran an ad promising free 
initial consultation and that no fees would be charged unless the client won, 
said he has received about a dozen calls. That's fewer than he expected -- and 
some of the questions surprised him. "Most of the calls are from people wanting 
a referral to a contractor who might fix up their place," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran the ad to be of service primarily. . . . We haven't charged anyone a 
penny," Levine said, acknowledging that some members of his profession take a 
dim view of such advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some attorneys said they thought ads under the circumstances were 
distasteful. But New York University law professor Stephen Gillers said that 
targeted advertising of this type was approved by the Supreme Court in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said he planned to run the ad again, about a month from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawyers said they anticipate that a significant percentage of lawsuits 
filed will stem from clashes over insurance coverage, as they did after the 
Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 One cause of the insurance disputes is that it is not always easy to determine 
how much of the damage to a house or other structure was caused by an 
earthquake. "When a house is burned to its foundation you know what happened," 
Los Gatos lawyer Gary Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, because some damage done by a quake is subtle, insurance 
companies may contend that there should be no coverage because of a 
pre-existing condition, such as an uneven floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he is in Northern California, Rose said he has received calls for 
help. "One man called and said some of his custom-cast, 50-year-old ceramic 
tile was damaged," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 "An insurance adjuster is telling him without seeing the damage that they are 
only going to repair the individual cracked pieces rather than replace the 
whole field of tile in the bathroom. There is no way you can match the 
50-year-old tile, so the new pieces would stick out." Rose said he informed his 
client that "there is a brand-new, obscure but important state administrative 
code section that says if you can't achieve a consistent finish, the insurer 
has to replace the whole field." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco attorney Clarke B. Holland, one of the leading lawyers for 
insurance companies, said most of the coverage cases will turn on the language 
of a particular contract. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it is much too early to tell how many cases the quake will generate. 
"We were surprised by how few cases were filed" after the Loma Prieta quake and 
most of those were settled out of court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Southern California lawyers who have been pressed into service since the 
quake are not even thinking about lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Daniel M. Crowley, 33, who heads the disaster relief committee 
of the Barristers, the young lawyers' wing of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. 
The Barristers provide free legal assistance to victims who come to the 
disaster assistance centers set up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I see our role, we do legal triage," Crowley said. "People come up to 
the legal assistance table with a problem." If the volunteers know the answer, 
they give advice; if not, they refer people to other lawyers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, Crowley said more than 225 lawyers have attended post-earthquake 
training centers so they can volunteer at the disaster centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the busiest group of attorneys are the cadre of public interest 
lawyers who have been working on a variety of fronts since the quake. Prime 
among them are the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, Bet Tzedek Legal 
Services, Public Counsel, the Western Center on Law and Poverty and San 
Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services, whose Pacoima offices were damaged 
in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our staff dropped everything to get programs in place for earthquake 
victims," said Neil Dudovitz, executive director of San Fernando Valley 
Neighborhood Legal Services. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that rather than waiting for clients to come in, the firm's 13 lawyers 
and 10 paralegals fanned out to parks, housing projects, apartment complexes 
and other places to assess needs, answer questions and disseminate information, 
including flyers in English and Spanish explaining quake victims' rights to 
emergency housing assistance and food stamps. Another flyer, headlined 
"Homeowner Alert," provides a list of dos and don'ts in dealing with 
contractors offering home repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudovitz and Melinda Bird of the Western Center also have held numerous 
meetings with FEMA officials in an attempt to ensure that that agency's 
operations were more efficient and more "user-friendly" than they were in the 
wake of the 1992 riots. In June, a coalition of public interest lawyers sued 
FEMA, contending that the agency exacerbated the problems of riot victims by 
illegally denying them relief after the disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 That case is pending, but Dudovitz said poverty law groups are enjoying a 
better relationship with FEMA this time. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, lawyers for the Los Angeles city attorney's office do not seem overly 
concerned about legal ramifications of the quake. "Public entities are not 
going to be held liable in a disaster unless we did something wrong," said 
Thomas Hokinson, who heads the city attorney's liability section. "We don't see 
any potential liability to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one from the California attorney general's office is prepared to 
make a statement that sweeping, the state's exposure seems to be considerably 
less than it was after the 1989 Northern California quake, when there were 42 
deaths stemming from the collapse of the Cypress section of Interstate 880 and 
one person died when a section of the upper deck of the San Francisco-Oakland 
Bay Bridge fell to the lower deck. About 150 people were injured in the 
collapse of the two structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 20 days, emergency legislation was enacted to compensate victims. Thus 
far, the state has paid $69 million and all but one of the cases has been 
settled. The suit of Ethel Lira, who was seriously injured while she was a 
passenger in a car that was crushed by the Cypress collapse, is scheduled for 
trial in May. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the only person who died on a freeway during the recent quake was 
LAPD Officer Clarence W. Dean, whose motorcycle plunged 30 feet off a destroyed 
Antelope Valley Freeway bridge, shortly after the quake struck.

STATE LAGS IN SEISMIC TESTING OF SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGE; DAVID FERRELL, s, isiting s; PAUL JACOBS, JEFFREY L. RABIN,

<P>
 Nearly four years after the Loma Prieta earthquake created a new sense of 
urgency to upgrade school safety, state officials have barely begun a survey to 
determine whether older public school buildings, including many damaged in the 
Northridge quake, should be brought up to more modern seismic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The state also has not inspected California's 55,000 public school buildings 
although officials had warned that a majority of them had "a potential for 
injury to students and teachers and for major property damage . . . if a 
moderate or greater earthquake occurs in a heavily populated urban area." 
</P>
<P>
 No buildings in the Los Angeles Unified School District collapsed when the 6.6 
temblor struck before dawn Jan. 17. But damage is estimated at $500 million to 
$700 million -- much of it in older structures. And officials say 
non-structural seismic hazards, such as unsecured cabinets, would have injured 
many students and teachers if the quake had hit during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though public schools are very good buildings, we need to sift through 
the good older buildings and find a few that are bad," said Tom Tobin, 
executive director of the state Seismic Safety Commission. "Some out there need 
to be identified and retrofitted" with seismic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that the eight most seriously damaged Los Angeles schools were 
built in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s -- before seismic safety standards 
were strengthened after the 1971 Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Four San Fernando Valley schools that have been closed indefinitely also were 
damaged in the Sylmar quake. The most severely damaged were two Granada Hills 
campuses -- Kennedy High School, which was in the final phase of construction 
when the Sylmar quake hit, and Van Gogh Elementary, which underwent extensive 
repairs after the 1971 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the financially troubled school district questioned whether 
seismic surveys or costly retrofitting were necessary at the district's 855 
schools and centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me the buildings have been tested under fire," said Douglas 
Brown, director of facilities services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Field Act, the school earthquake safety law passed after the Long Beach 
quake of 1933, "doesn't guarantee that the building is not going to be 
damaged," Brown said. "It guarantees that the building is going to retain its 
integrity and generally not collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Julie Korenstein, whose San Fernando Valley district 
includes portions of Northridge, said: "Under the circumstances -- under the 
worst earthquake in Los Angeles history -- our schools fared very well." 
</P>
<P>
 An examination of state and school district records, interviews with seismic 
safety experts and visits to damaged schools found: 
</P>
<P>
 * Thousands of schools in Los Angeles and throughout California were built 
before 1976, when earthquake safety standards for schools were strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 * Like other districts, LAUSD is required by law to upgrade buildings for 
seismic safety only during major remodeling or expansions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Neither the state architect's office, which oversees school construction, 
nor the school district is required to regularly inspect schools for seismic 
safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Much of the damage from the quake was caused by non-structural hazards such 
as unsecured cabinets, bookcases and light fixtures, but the school district 
does not have a state-recommended program to anchor objects that could fall or 
fly in an earthquake. Officials say they secure light fixtures and objects 
whenever they make renovations at schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown acknowledged that jammed doors and falling objects posed a potential 
hazard. "I think people would have been hurt in this quake, had (schools) been 
occupied, because of falling equipment . . . ," he said. "But people could have 
gotten out or could have been removed from those structures, without 
significant or perhaps any loss of life, except through trauma." 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Gary McGavin, a member of the Seismic Safety Commission, said some 
life-threatening hazards could be easily and inexpensively corrected. "We spend 
all this money on structures and essentially ignore the non-structural things," 
he said. "A falling bookcase can kill a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 For six decades, the state has recognized the importance of providing special 
seismic protection for schools. The codes for new school construction have been 
more stringent than for most other structures since 1933, when the Field Act 
was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, 1976 and 1988, there were major revisions in earthquake-resistance 
standards for construction of public elementary and secondary schools, based on 
new information from damage and collapse observed during earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although legislation passed 25 years ago required older unreinforced masonry 
buildings to be retrofitted, there is no requirement for schools to be brought 
up to the latest seismic safety standards unless they undergo major renovation. 
Nor is there a requirement for schools built before 1976 to tie down movable 
objects so they cannot fall or fly during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a month of Northern California's Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, 
then-Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) introduced a bill to provide 
$2.75 million to the Office of the State Architect for a review of older school 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, sponsored by the state Seismic Safety Commission, required the state 
architect to complete a survey of schools by Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "A major earthquake will still cause a significant loss of school functions 
and property damage and may cause injuries to students and teachers in these 
older schools," the commission reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill passed the Assembly but died in the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 During this same period, the state architect's office was urging then-Gov. 
George Deukmejian to add $3.5 million to the budget for the first year of a 
comprehensive seismic review of schools, state colleges and universities, and 
state offices, according to a budget document submitted two months after Loma 
Prieta. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 55,000 projects involving elementary schools, middle schools, high 
schools and community colleges, state officials said 19,500 were constructed 
from 1933 to 1959, and another 20,500 were built between 1960 and 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing hazardous public schools up to current earthquake standards, 
officials estimated, could cost $2 billion to $5 billion statewide -- more than 
the $1.5-billion program to retrofit the state's freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 In requesting funds for a survey, the state architect's office pointed out, 
"Over half of our public school buildings were designed, constructed or 
structurally improved between enactment of the Field Act in 1933 and 1959, 
after which time significant revisions to the building codes were made. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Building elements designed using early practices and procedures have proven 
inadequate when subjected to actual earthquake forces." 
</P>
<P>
 The state architect began work on the survey, spending about $85,000 of 
$174,000 included in the state budget for the project. But work was halted 
after the Waters bill died. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, State Architect Harry C. Hallenbeck said he has no 
plans to resume the survey unless the Legislature orders it or his staff 
members who have examined some quake-damaged Los Angeles schools find problems 
in older facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are priorities," Hallenbeck said. "Since the Field Act in general is 
performing pretty well, it's hard for us to put this to the highest priority. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether this earthquake will demonstrate that the older buildings suffered 
versus the newer ones, it's just too early to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, now a congresswoman, said she still believes the statewide survey is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had a fear we would experience an earthquake and schoolchildren 
would be sitting in unsafe buildings," she said last week. "I thought it was 
important to do some advance planning and use some resources to ensure the 
schools' safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the major earthquakes in Southern California this century -- Long 
Beach in 1933, Sylmar in 1971, Whittier in 1987 and Northridge this year -- 
struck either before or after school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that there are 10,877 buildings in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District -- and that 9,457 were built before 1970, and 424 before 1930. But the 
heaviest period of construction was the 1950s and 1960s, when 6,161 buildings 
were erected. Only 1,400 buildings were put up since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The most seriously damaged schools in the Northridge quake are likely to be 
closed at least several weeks, according to school officials. And officials 
said part of Kennedy High School in Granada Hills may need to be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 State inspectors found a three-inch fissure in the earth snaking its way 200 
yards from the baseball field through the girls' locker room, across a concrete 
patio and through the boys' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the few sites I've seen that have so many deep ground 
ruptures," said Jack Starlin, a senior structural engineer with the state 
architect's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit at the school was the three-story administration building, with 
two floors of classrooms. Large cracks were visible all over the building. 
Ceiling tiles had come down. Windows broke. And outside, one overhead panel in 
a concrete arcade had slipped down several inches. 
</P>
<P>
 McGavin of the Seismic Safety Commission said the administration building 
could have collapsed "if the strong shaking had lasted a few seconds longer." 
</P>
<P>
 In the concession office where the school's 2,300 students can buy confections 
and T-shirts, everything had fallen off storage and display shelves, including 
flats of canned soda and cardboard boxes containing yearbooks. A 3,000-pound 
safe shifted on its concrete platform. 
</P>
<P>
 "This room was about this deep in rubble," school financial manager June 
Anderson said, indicating chest height. 
</P>
<P>
 At Van Gogh Elementary School, which was heavily damaged in the Sylmar quake, 
much of the recent destruction was similar to that in 1971, said Donald 
Jepcott, a structural engineer examining schools for the National Science 
Foundation. But he said some of the damage did not appear as severe this time. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the columns supporting the outdoor eating pavilion for students 
were displaced more than a foot in 1971, but reinforced columns held up well in 
this month's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials said the ground beneath the school is so unstable that 
the site may need to be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of a covered walkway between the eating pavilion and the auditorium 
struck the auditorium wall, creating a large crack at a side entrance. Many 
other cracks crisscrossed the floors of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In one classroom, a big crack stretched across the width of the room and, as 
in all classrooms, books and supplies had fallen out of built-in cabinets 
against the walls. But nothing had fallen from overhead, said Principal Maureen 
Diekmann. 
</P>
<P>
 At Frost Middle School in Granada Hills, Principal Jay Peterman said: "It 
looks beautiful from the outside but it got hit pretty hard on the inside." The 
school opened in 1969 and is a split level. 
</P>
<P>
 Where a wooden column buckled beneath its canopy, an entrance to the building 
was rendered unusable. Elsewhere, metal screws were pulled from the bottoms of 
the columns supporting a covered walkway that was raised several inches at one 
end by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate danger to students, had they been in school during the 
quake, would have been items falling off shelves, from ceilings and out of 
cabinets, Peterman said. In a storage room for the chemistry labs, bottles of 
chemicals fell and broke. 
</P>
<P>
 The textbook storage room was thigh-deep in books. "If someone had been in 
there, they would've been severely injured," he said, adding that 
administrators are considering installation of bars or bungee cords to restrain 
items on shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern, the principal said, was that heavy air-conditioning units and 
water heaters mounted above classrooms were thrown around in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At Danube Avenue Elementary School in Granada Hills, a concrete canopy over an 
outdoor eating pavilion for students was leaning on metal supports that had 
tilted about 15 to 20 degrees. A large metal heating vent fell onto desks. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Rosemary Enzer and the plant manager, Joe Perkins, said they knew of 
no inspections for seismic safety before the quake. Perkins, who as plant 
manager supervises the school's custodians, also said he had never received any 
training in seismic safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the capricious nature of the quake was the strikingly different 
impact it had on two identical two-story buildings erected in the 1920s at San 
Fernando Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "One we can't use," said Assistant Principal Ted Johnson. "It has major 
structural damage. . . . And the other one, 20 feet to the east of it and its 
exact twin, has got some plaster cracks. That's the extent of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, two bungalows -- in use at the school for about 30 years -- fell 
off their 18-inch-high wooden foundations and two more partially fell off, but 
officials said they remained structurally intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The building that officials said fared the best was the newest on campus, the 
cafeteria, built in the late 1970s. It had only minor cosmetic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the San Fernando Valley, one of the most severely damaged campuses was 
Marvin Avenue Elementary School, just a few hundred yards south of the buckled 
lanes of the Santa Monica Freeway at Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Two large, two-story classroom buildings are unusable because of structural 
damage, said Principal Anna McLine. The worst-hit building, which looks out on 
the freeway, is webbed with cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of classrooms, including a computer lab, remain sealed because their 
doors were jammed shut by the quake. The door to the storage area where 
administrators had stashed 400 gallons of bottled water for use in emergencies 
also was jammed shut. 
</P>
<P>
 McLine, who said she believes Marvin was built in the early- to mid-1960s, 
speculated that the school's location might have played an important part in 
the damage. She cited the proximity of the crippled freeway and a collapsed 
parking structure on the grounds of Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center. "They're 
all in a straight line," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school officials said they cannot eliminate a $600-million backlog 
of deferred maintenance, such as leaky roofs, let alone commission a seismic 
survey or retrofitting of older school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in a triage mode, patching the holes year to year . . . ," said 
school board member Mark Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Public support for increased school funding has been hard to secure, Slavkin 
said, noting last year's defeat of a measure to lower the passage requirement 
for school bonds from a two-thirds to a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Sylmar quake, the Los Angeles school board sought approval of 
earthquake safety bonds. The measures were defeated twice. But Los Angeles city 
voters in 1990 approved a $376-million bond measure for seismic safety 
improvements to bridges and municipal buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin, whose west San Fernando Valley district was hard hit by the quake, 
said: "There is no way that this disaster can be looked at as an indictment of 
current school safety rules." But, he added, "every effort should be made to 
ensure that these facilities are at the highest level of safety and security 
for kids." 
</P>
<P>
 While the state architect's office and Los Angeles city school officials say 
they lack the money to survey older schools, at least one school district -- 
Berkeley -- undertook an evaluation of its schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all of the schools met Field Act requirements, five of the district's 
17 schools were found to be potentially unsafe. One had to be permanently 
closed, two are closed temporarily while undergoing retrofitting, and two 
others are scheduled for retrofit work. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkeley voters passed a $158-million school bond issue in June, 1992, to pay 
the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 "School buildings built before 1976 should be examined," said Arrieta Chakos, 
legislative liaison for Berkeley schools. "For us, the Loma Prieta earthquake 
was a wake-up call." Long-Term Danage 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 public schools in Los Angeles reported earthquake damage earlier 
this month. Officials were able to open all but 76 of them Tuesday, and they 
are reopening more as cleanup and repair are completed. Officials said the 
following schools shown below sustained the most serious damage.

 For more than 60 years, California public school buildings have been held to 
higher earthquake standards than most other structures. A landmark piece of 
legislation known as the Field Act was enacted after the devastating Long Beach 
earthquake in 1933. The codes for new schools have been revised a number of 
times, but the revisions are not retroactive unless schools are undergoing 
expansion or major renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1933: The magnitude 6.3 Long Beach quake hits after school hours, destroying 
several school buildings and damaging others. One month later, the Field Act 
becomes law, named for Assemblyman C. Don Field of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1941: The state architect wins approval for major changes to the schoolhouse 
construction code, toughening earthquake standards further. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1968: For the first time, the Legislature requires upgrading of pre-1933 
buildings for earthquake safety. An initial deadline of 1975 for compliance is 
later extended to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1971: The magnitude 6.5 Sylmar quake causes heavy damage to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1976: A major revision of the school building code is adopted, but it 
applies only to new construction and remodeling projects with no retrofit 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1987: The magnitude 5.9 Whittier quake causes additional damage to schools 
and other structures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1988: The state Building Standards Commission adopts another round of major 
changes in the school construction code. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1989: In July, a state earthquake task force asks that Field Act 
requirements be extended to non-structural hazards and recommends that schools 
anchor file cabinets and other large objects. But these and other suggested 
changes are not required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1989: In October, the magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake hits Northern 
California, causing damage to schools near the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1989: Within a month of the Loma Prieta quake, then-Assemblywoman Maxine 
Waters (D-Los Angeles) introduces a bill to survey "early Field Act" school 
buildings. The state architect asks for $3.5 million to determine whether 
schools and state-owned buildings should be retrofitted to meet updated 
earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990: The Legislature approves $174,000 -- a fraction of what the state 
architect asked for -- to begin a survey of school buildings constructed before 
the Sylmar quake. Only $85,000 is spent. The Waters bill dies in the Senate 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994: The magnitude 6.6 Northridge quake hits, causing major damage to a 
number of schools, primarily in the San Fernando Valley.

'FREEDOM TRAIN' KICKS OFF S. AFRICA CAMPAIGN; ELECTIONS: ANC LEADER MANDELA 
PRESENTS PARTY PLATFORM AFTER RAIL TRIP. PRESIDENT DE KLERK COURTS BLACK 
SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Black leader Nelson Mandela laid out his party's ambitious plans for social 
justice and economic reform Saturday on a day that essentially kicked off the 
political campaign for this nation's first multiracial democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a dashiki and sporting a broad grin, Mandela rode a 14-car "freedom 
train" filled with flag-waving supporters to present the platform of his 
African National Congress to nearly 1,000 diplomats and business, ethnic and 
religious leaders in a convention center at the edge of this sprawling black 
township. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ANC is ready to govern," said the 75-year-old Mandela on a stage framed 
by arches of green, black and gold balloons -- the ANC's colors -- and a huge 
banner with the party's new slogan: "A Better Life for All." 
</P>
<P>
 President Frederik W. de Klerk, Mandela's chief opponent in the voting 
scheduled to take place in three months, will present his party's platform 
Wednesday at the National Party convention in Kempton Park, across Johannesburg 
from Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk finished a three-day campaign swing Saturday seeking support from 
blacks in rural townships east of Johannesburg. But his rallies and speeches 
were repeatedly marred when hecklers either shouted him down or threatened 
supporters of the National Party, which created and enforced apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The National Party is the real party of peace," De Klerk shouted into a 
microphone Saturday as several hundred ANC supporters blocked a road, chanted 
and sang to drown him out when he opened a party office in the township of 
Mzinoni. "The ANC is the party of conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk has increasingly hammered that theme in hopes of painting the ANC as 
an organization that sponsors intimidation and terrorism in the townships. 
Mandela, in turn, has lashed out at De Klerk for not controlling the mostly 
black-on-black violence that has left more than 13,000 people dead since the 
dismantling of apartheid began in February, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela also accuses De Klerk of trying to bury the past. "There are those who 
would like us to believe that the past doesn't exist, that decades of apartheid 
rule have suddenly disappeared," he said Saturday. "But the economic and social 
devastation of apartheid remains. Our country is in a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 While the two leading candidates prepared for a busy week of campaign 
appearances, conservative black and white militants gathered separately to 
prepare plans to boycott the April elections and use force, if necessary, to 
resist an ANC-led government. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ulundi, capital of the Zulu homeland, Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi 
told a special congress of his Inkatha Freedom Party that his followers should 
avoid the voting booth and instead use what he called "the politics of 
resistance" in the face of what polls suggest will be an ANC landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the interim constitution passed by Parliament last month, which will 
serve as the basis of the new democratic government, was "specifically designed 
to promote ANC power and is an instrument for the Inkatha's destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 "I say no to the present constitution, and I say as this constitution stands, 
I do not see how we can enter elections," Buthelezi said in a rambling, 
three-hour speech. 
</P>
<P>
 With his party in growing disarray, the mercurial Zulu leader who was once 
Mandela's chief black rival had been widely expected to tell his party whether 
or not he was going to join the election. His continuing equivocation passes 
the ball back to the Freedom Alliance, the unlikely coalition of Inkatha, 
several black homeland leaders and the Afrikaner Volksfront, an umbrella 
organization of 60 right-wing white groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The government and the ANC have a negotiating session scheduled Monday with 
the alliance to address the coalition's demands the constitution be amended to 
provide for greater regional powers. The closed-door talks have been deadlocked 
for weeks after the alliance turned down an offer of concessions on the 
constitution in return for a commitment to participate in the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, some members of the alliance see little room for compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-apartheid whites, in particular, demand the right to create their own 
white state within South Africa rather than submit to black majority rule. 
Several thousand right-wingers, meeting Saturday at a fairground in Pretoria, 
declared independence for the would-be white homeland and approved the creation 
of a symbolic transitional government to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferdi Hartzenberg, the fiery leader of the white separatist Conservative 
Party, was sworn in as shadow president. The crowd shouted down a more moderate 
Afrikaner leader, retired Gen. Constand Viljoen, who suggested continued talks 
with the ANC and government to forestall bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, bellicose threats from the right have proved all bluster. For 
one thing, the dozens of defiant white parties involved can't agree on the 
proposed borders of the homeland they demand, nor even what self-determination 
would entail. Some want to ban blacks entirely, others to allow them as 
servants and laborers, while some want the entire country to simply revert to 
the racist policies of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mandela and De Klerk oppose creating autonomous territories along racial, 
tribal or ethnic lines. But negotiators from both parties have indicated they 
would consider provincial boundaries within a federal system so that particular 
groups, such as Zulus or whites, would be in the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such conflicting signals from the fringes, one key part of the April 
27-29 election -- the winner -- remains a near certainty. Polls consistently 
show the ANC will win a clear majority of the popular vote, meaning Mandela 
would become the first black president. The National Party is favored in only 
one of the nine new provinces, the Western Cape, where there is a large 
population of mixed-race voters who are nervous about ANC control. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC leaders have said their goal is to win 67% of the seats in the new 
Parliament, a big enough majority so the ANC can rewrite the interim 
constitution without cutting compromises or deals. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, the ANC platform is long on promises and short on specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Mandela said the party would focus on improving the quality of 
life by focusing on job creation. He pledged a massive public works program to 
provide jobs for some 2.5 million people over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 For the poor, he said the new government can build 1 million homes in five 
years, provide running water and toilets to over 1 million families and bring 
electricity to 2.5 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the government would introduce a single education system to provide 10 
years of free and compulsory schooling, rather than the multiple and unequal 
systems set up under apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo Sexwale, a senior ANC leader, earlier had warned that the platform may 
raise expectations that will be impossible to fulfill and dangerous to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to turn the country around it will take decades and decades," he said 
as the "freedom train" rumbled from Johannesburg to Soweto. "We know that. That 
is the tragedy of apartheid."

NEWS ANALYSIS; FIRST INDICATIONS OF 'NEW POLITICS' APPEAR IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, politicians and scholars have been talking about the need for "new 
politics" in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the first signs of its arrival took shape as both houses of 
Parliament committed themselves to launching an overhaul of Japan's electoral 
system and implementing new controls on political funds to eradicate 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Japanese themselves had become convinced that their scandal-ridden 
political system was incapable of cleansing itself, each chamber of Parliament 
approved a last-minute compromise designed to uproot the causes of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 And they did it without tactics used so many times in the past: shouting, 
brawling, pushing or resorting to the now famous "cow walk," a slow shuffle 
that prolongs by hours the trip to the parliamentary ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 Just nine days ago, when the upper house defeated an initial reform package, 
Tetsundo Iwakuni, mayor of the city of Izumo and a former Merrill Lynch 
executive, declared that Japan had proved it could not reform itself. And just 
two days ago, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, hinting that he might resign, 
warned that the country was about to lose its last chance for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 A penchant for finding legal loopholes may yet turn the grand experiment to 
eradicate corruption into a failure. And the effect of a new electoral system 
of single-seat (instead of multiple-seat) lower-house districts, which Japan 
has not experienced in the last 75 years, remains to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the outcome, at least the attempt at reform is now an established 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was carried out by a breed of politicians never before seen in the 
post-World War II era, in which factional powerbrokers have nearly always made 
the deals. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side was Hosokawa, 56, a son of aristocrats. He began his career in the 
Liberal Democratic Party that dominated politics until a mass of defectors 
walked out last summer and deprived it of its majority in the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not as a factional kingpin that he rose to power. Rather, it was as 
head of a still-fragile grass-roots political party dedicated solely to change, 
which he founded just two years ago. When the Liberal Democrats fell, seven 
parties patched together a coalition and offered him the mantle. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side was Yohei Kono, 57, the Liberal Democrats' leader. Although 
the son of a deceased Liberal Democratic powerbroker himself, Kono lost 
patience with the party's inability to uproot corruption nearly two decades 
ago. He walked out to establish his own reform party in 1976, in the aftermath 
of the Lockheed bribery scandal. Ten years later, however, he admitted failure 
and rejoined the conservative Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, the Liberal Democrats picked Kono over a traditional powerbroker 
as their leader. And early Saturday, memories of his reform-minded youth came 
back as he and Hosokawa averted a political crisis by hammering out a 10-point 
agreement on reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Parliament sealed the agreement by acting to keep the 
political reform bills alive as its extraordinary session ended. Final 
revisions -- possibly in February -- may be enacted in a new session that 
starts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kono acted despite the fact that an estimated 70% of his party's Parliament 
representatives remained unenthusiastic about reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the opposition usually opposed by rote, without offering 
realistic alternatives, but this time the Liberal Democrats had presented 
detailed proposals of their own -- a turn of events that made the compromise 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Parliament failed to break the stalemate -- once again leaving the 
real decision-making to an arena outside its chambers -- four months of 
deliberations on the reform package gave air to the opinions of its members as 
seldom before. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming after more than five years of haggling over reform that brought about 
the resignations of two prime ministers, the debate precipitated a new 
phenomenon in Japanese politics: the intraparty rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer can Japan's leaders count on party discipline or powerbrokers' 
orders to whip supporters into line. Dozens of representatives on both sides of 
the aisle served notice that from now on, they will act on their own 
convictions -- a dramatic turnabout from the days when individual politicians 
dared not speak out against the opinions of the powerbroker bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, 21 Liberal Democrats and 28 Socialists in both houses again rebelled 
against party orders in the vote Saturday. Earlier, a Liberal Democratic 
uprising helped pass the original package in the lower house, while a Socialist 
protest brought about its defeat in the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
 More changes appeared virtually certain. With the multi-seat districts that 
nurtured a plethora of small parties about to disappear, a political structure 
dominated by two parties, both capable of assuming control of the government, 
is expected to emerge. NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 Following its eleventh-hour passage of a package of political reforms, Japan's 
Parliament will recess for just one day before beginning a new session Monday. 
Final revisions to the package could come as early as February. But legislators 
are expected to move beyond reform issues and concentrate on both short-term 
economic stimulus measures and the state budget bill for the 1994 fiscal year 
beginning April 1. An economic stimulus package could be unveiled as early as 
this week. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, meanwhile, has cleared the decks 
at home before a scheduled trip to Washington, where he will hold trade talks 
on Feb. 11 with President Clinton.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING HURTING THE POOR, ELDERLY; HEALTH: THE STRUCTURE IS 
ALSO DRIVING PHARMACIES OUT OF BUSINESS. SYSTEM WILL BE AN ISSUE AS REFORM IS 
DEBATED.

<P>
 From his office in the rear of Pelton's Pharmacy, one of the nation's oldest 
drugstores, owner Gerard H. Weitzman has a clear view of the pharmaceutical 
industry's current pricing scheme. What he sees is a system that discriminates 
against his customers, particularly the elderly and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pelton's Pharmacy purchases prescription medicine from drug 
manufacturers, Weitzman pays a standard wholesale price. But when he buys the 
very same drugs in his role as purchasing agent for a nearby hospital, he can 
negotiate deep discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The price differential can be gigantic. For an inhaler used to treat asthma 
patients, for example, Pelton's pays $18.84 while the hospital pays only $1.55.

 "It's simply not fair," Weitzman said. His customers, he said, must pay higher 
prices for most of their prescriptions so that the pharmaceutical industry can 
afford to compete for high-volume business at hospitals, nursing homes, mail 
order houses and health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman's lament, shared by most pharmacists around the country, recently has 
become the central issue in a series of lawsuits filed by drugstore chains 
against the pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, it is certain to be a major 
point of contention in the coming congressional debate over President Clinton's 
proposal for health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 While customers at Pelton's and other pharmacies across the country frequently 
complain about the high cost of prescription drugs, few realize that they are 
not all paying the same price. The highest prices are charged to those who have 
no insurance coverage for drugs, including most low-wage workers and the 
majority of elderly people on Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles M. West, executive vice president of the National Assn. of Retail 
Druggists, contended that the higher pharmacy prices are "causing alarming 
numbers of seniors and others to go without much-needed prescription medication 
simply because they cannot afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are patients at hospitals and HMOs getting much -- if any -- advantage 
from lower wholesale prices. While pharmacies normally mark up drug prices 
about 30%, hospitals and HMOs routinely add at least 70%, and some hospitals 
have been known to charge Medicare or the insurance companies as much as two or 
three times the retail price paid by customers at a drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
 This system hurts community druggists almost as much as consumers. Although 
90% of Americans get their prescriptions filled at drugstores, the retail 
druggists' group estimates that pricing problems have forced about 1,000 stores 
out of business in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Net drugstore profits have fallen 32% in the last two decades, according to a 
survey in the Lilly Digest, published by the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical company. 
Pharmacies now earn an estimated 50 cents on the average $26 prescription 
price, which West called "barely enough to stay in business." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't continue like this," said Rick Carbray, an executive of Pelton's. 
"It's so outrageous and so threatening to our industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Assn., which represents the nation's leading 
drug manufacturers, has declined to discuss the issue because of pending 
lawsuits. The association is known to strongly oppose efforts by the Clinton 
Administration to level the price differential for pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1800, Pelton's Pharmacy has survived many adverse economic 
developments in its history. In recent decades it has endured competition from 
giant chain drugstores, losses of over-the-counter medicine sales to 
supermarkets, local redevelopment, the advent of the computer age and the 
scramble by pharmacies to join managed-care networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a social center for residents who gathered around Charles Abner Pelton's 
pot-bellied stove on cold days, the pharmacy has been transformed into a 
thoroughly modern business with three retail outlets and a wide array of 
ancillary services, including contracts to act as drug-purchasing agent for 
three health care institutions in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 While the pharmacy is still a thriving endeavor, Weitzman, whose pharmacist 
father inherited the business from Pelton, said prescription drug sales are one 
of his least profitable activities -- far less lucrative than sales of greeting 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The current wholesale price differential began many years ago when 
pharmaceutical companies decided to sell infant formula to hospitals at a loss, 
presuming that mothers would keep buying the same brand after they took the 
baby home. Under federal law, drug companies have long been permitted to offer 
lower prices to nonprofit institutions such as charitable hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, the discounts spread to most brand names purchased by hospitals and 
then to a variety of other institutions, including health maintenance 
organizations. Because these institutions buy large volumes of drugs, they have 
more leverage than the corner drugstore to negotiate lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 High volume is not the only advantage enjoyed by the institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike community pharmacies, which must stock many brands to satisfy a wide 
variety of customers, hospitals and other institutions -- including mail-order 
houses -- have what is known as a "formulary," a list of authorized brand names 
that they buy exclusively. Offering discounts, drug companies compete fiercely 
to get their products on the formulary. 
</P>
<P>
 While manufacturers insist that such discounts are entirely legal, the 
community pharmacists argue that this system has perverted the intention of the 
1936 Robinson-Patman Act, which requires companies to sell products at the same 
price to competing retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when pharmacies have banded together in an effort to obtain volume 
discounts, the drug companies have declined to cooperate. In fact, the biggest 
chain drugstores get no real price advantage over small, independent stores. 
</P>
<P>
 In lawsuits against the manufacturers, attorneys for community pharmacies have 
documented stunning disparities between the average wholesale price paid by 
retail drugstores and discounts to institutions: for example, $43.50 compared 
to $1.65 for Dupont-Merck's Coumadin, an anticoagulant for heart attack 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph L. Alioto, the former San Francisco mayor who is now a lawyer 
representing the California Pharmacy Defense Fund in one of several antitrust 
suits pending in the courts, called the manufacturers' pricing practices "a 
Persian bazaar." 
</P>
<P>
 As Alioto explained it, the same product can be shipped on the same day from 
the same manufacturer with "16 different prices," the highest of which goes to 
the community pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 While Weitzman and his fellow druggists recognize that they are at a 
competitive disadvantage because they cannot promise to sell one brand 
exclusively, they see the huge disparities in wholesale prices as proof that 
manufactures are unfairly shifting costs onto retail drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the discounts, the druggists contend, hospitals, HMOs and other 
institutions can make big profits even when they charge their customers 
slightly less for medicine than the retail drugstore price. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I compete with the AARP (American Assn. of Retired Persons) pharmacy 
if they are starting out with a much lower cost base?" asked Peter J. 
Tyczkowski, Pelton's chief pharmacist. "They can charge 10% less right off the 
bat and put other pharmacies out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, even though some hospitals are paying only a fraction of the 
average wholesale price, some charge more than retail prices to Medicare and 
insurers. The National Assn. of Retail Druggists estimates that hospitals 
paying only $3.50 for the painkiller Tylenol 3 with codeine often bill as much 
as $50 to $75 for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Brooks, Pelton's chief financial officer, said institutional pharmacies 
and mail-order houses are slowly robbing community drugstores of prescription 
business. "It is a vicious cycle, and we could be left out of the loop," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is that the only pricing problem the drugstores face. They are also being 
squeezed by insurance companies that provide consumers with guaranteed drug 
benefits. To win the business of customers with paid prescription drug cards, 
druggists say they must often agree to accept smaller-than-normal markups on 
prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 John B. Rector, the druggist group's chief lobbyist in Washington, said 
druggists have no option but to accept rates set by insurers, which vary 
widely. While some insurers will pay the druggist a few dollars more than the 
wholesale price, he said, many set reimbursements so low that community 
pharmacies actually lose money on each prescription they fill. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman estimated that his profit margin on drugs purchased with insurance 
cards often falls to nearly 10%. While he can make up some of the difference by 
charging a full price to uninsured customers, he noted, "you cannot bill all 
the differential to the cash customer or you will not be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot is that out-of-pocket customers -- often those who can least afford 
it -- are paying the most for their prescriptions. "The walk-in customer is 
paying the top price," Carbray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Older people are a substantial part of the walk-in trade. While people over 
age 65 make up 12% of the U.S. population, according to the Consumers Union, 
they purchase 34% of all retail prescription drugs. In addition, it is 
estimated that 50% of all elderly people have no drug coverage because Medicare 
does not pay for prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 With their future threatened, pharmacists have begun to rethink their way of 
doing business. By incorporating their own fee into retail drug prices, 
pharmacists now reason, they have minimized the value of their professional 
services -- including computer billing, expert advice and monitoring against 
potentially lethal combinations of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can count, pour, lick and stick -- you don't need five years of 
pharmacy school for that," Carbray said, adding that most pharmacy customers 
are under the false impression that they are buying only pills, not a service. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, some industry leaders recommend that pharmacists simply pass along 
their wholesale drug prices to the customers and then add a fee for their 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last few years, lobbyists for the retail druggists' group and the 
National Assn. of Chain Drug Stores have tried without success to persuade 
Congress and the Federal Trade Commission to impose changes on the drug 
industry that would eliminate these pricing problems. But not until Clinton 
entered the White House did the druggists begin to get any satisfaction in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Clinton's health care reform bill would prohibit drug 
companies from offering discounts except for high volume and prompt payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that scheme, community pharmacies expect to join together in purchasing 
cooperatives to obtain lower wholesale prices, a practice that the drug makers 
could no longer legally resist. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Clinton proposal would help pharmacists by providing a drug 
benefit for all Americans, including Medicare recipients, and paying 
pharmacists a $5 fee for dispensing each prescription under Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the President's health care reform package," First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton promised a national meeting of pharmacists last September, "we will 
level the playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 Pharmacists are well aware that drug company executives have influence at the 
White House too. But Rector said his group expects Congress to satisfy its 
complaints, if for no other reason than because polls show druggists are more 
popular than drug manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the right opponents," Rector said. Drug Price Disparities 
</P>
<P>
 The highest drug prices are charged to those who have no insurance coverage 
for drugs, including most low-wage workers and the majority of elderly persons 
on Medicare. For example, here are the prices for Pelton's Pharmacy in

AFTERSHOCKS ROCK VALLEY; DETOURS TO FREEWAYS OPEN; AFTERMATH: ONE TEMBLOR 
MEASURES 5.0, SENDING SOME RESIDENTS BACK INTO SHELTERS. BUT RECOVERY GAINS 
STEAM AND SHALALA ANNOUNCES $28 MILLION MORE IN ASSISTANCE.

<P>
 A powerful string of pre-dawn aftershocks -- including a magnitude 5.0 temblor 
-- rattled a sleeping Los Angeles on Saturday, putting police on temporary 
alert, buckling already weakened structures and sending some nervous residents 
scrambling back to shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the strongest aftershock to hit the San Fernando Valley in 10 days was not 
enough to impede recovery efforts, as detours were opened around collapsed 
freeways and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E . 
Shalala announced she was making available an additional $28 million in federal 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Touring the quake damage at Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center, Shalala 
also said she had persuaded the Treasury Department to issue thousands of 
Social Security checks a week earlier than usual to ensure that the elderly 
receive their benefits on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking very rigid federal programs and we are making them flexible," 
she said. "We can't do everything by the book in a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 The day's other developments included: 
</P>
<P>
 * The barrage of aftershocks -- nine greater than 3.0 were recorded in a 
seven-hour period Saturday morning -- snapped a water main in Northridge, 
knocked out street lights in Santa Monica and, crumbled what was left of a 
four-story parking structure at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although more than 5,000 people remained at 31 Red Cross shelters, the 
population at five Salvation Army tent cities had dwindled to less than 600 and 
National Guard troops began dismantling the encampments at Lanark, West Valley 
and Valley Plaza parks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caltrans opened a detour around the damaged Golden State Freeway to the 
Santa Clarita Valley, restoring California's primary north-south route to 40% 
of its capacity. Meanwhile, engineers closed two lanes on the bridge connecting 
the westbound 134 Freeway to the northbound Ventura Freeway to shore up a 
weakened column. 
</P>
<P>
 * Red Cross officials in Northridge opened what one worker called the 
"Wal-Mart" of disaster centers: a circus-sized tent full of case workers who 
can process up to 1,000 people a day -- 10 times that of a normal Red Cross 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 * The state Department of Health Services and the Department of Water and 
Power announced that all water in the city of Los Angeles is safe to drink. 
Residents no longer need to boil or disinfect water, but they are urged to run 
their faucets for several minutes to flush out the pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Santa Clarita Valley, the Newhall County Water District also lifted 
its boil-water order, but customers of the Santa Clarita and Valencia water 
companies were advised to continue doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seeking to crack down on fraud, county welfare officials began imposing a 
three-day waiting period for emergency food stamps and said all offices would 
be closed today while they set up a computer system to help weed out bogus 
claims. On Friday, police arrested a man for allegedly selling several hundred 
dollars worth of food stamps near a downtown relief center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amid growing complaints that landlords have been using the earthquake to 
oust tenants and raise rents, city officials urged apartment-dwellers to be 
aware of their rights and not be pressured into relinquishing undamaged units. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of quake refugees in tent cities dropped to 587 Friday night, and 
National Guard officials were making plans to close one or more of the five 
tent encampments during the weekend and to send quake victims to other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Saturday, at Lanark Park in Canoga Park, West Valley Park in Reseda 
and Valley Plaza Park in North Hollywood had been taken down. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Brian Anderson, a public affairs officer with the California Army National 
Guard, said more than 400 people stayed in the tent camps at Reseda Park and 
Winnetka Recreation Center, while the encampments at Lanark, West Valley and 
Valley Plaza each housed fewer than 100 people Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The order is start consolidating down and let Winnetka be the last tent 
site," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 At their peak, the tent camps sheltered 4,780 people. Meanwhile, 31 Red Cross 
shelters throughout the quake zone housed 5,244 people Friday night -- less 
than half the number at the height of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 At the tent cities, the flurry of aftershocks sent some recent campers, who 
finally had worked up the courage to return home, scurrying back to the 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my apartment, there is always something moving," said Rosa Ana Moreira, 
38, who sought refuge with her 10-year-old daughter Saturday morning at the 
Winnetka Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 quake, Moreira's family had been sleeping in a car outside 
their Northridge apartment building, which was deemed safe by inspectors but 
seemed too precarious to her. On Friday, for the first time since the quake, 
she summoned the courage to spend the night inside. But the early morning 
aftershocks only confirmed her doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to stay here until I feel safe," she said at the tent city, "until 
there is no more trembling." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucile M. Jones said the aftershocks were 
within "a normal range," even though they have been both a little more numerous 
and more powerful than is normally expected from a 6.6 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, in a briefing at the Caltech Seismological Laboratory, said the chances 
of another magnitude 5.0 aftershock in the next week are about one in seven, 
and the chances of another one in the next year are about 50-50. She added 
there is little immediate concern that an earthquake larger than 6.6 will grow 
directly out of the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the earth settling into its new position," she said. "Large 
blocks have moved, and the earth is still readjusting." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5.0 aftershock at 3:20 a.m. was the strongest since President Clinton was 
jolted by a 5.1 quake while visiting Los Angeles on Jan. 19. But Shalala, who 
has been surveying earthquake damage with other top federal officials, said she 
slept right through it. 
</P>
<P>
 Joking with her aides at a Burbank hotel, she said she hoped nobody would 
think that was "an indication of my responsiveness to this disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala was accompanied by Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James 
Lee Witt, Social Security Commissioner Shirley Chater and Assistant Secretary 
for Aging Fernando Torres-Gil, who joined the secretary to make certain that 
senior citizens are not overlooked in the federal response to the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mid-Valley Comprehensive Health Center in Van Nuys, Shalala watched as 
workers tried to dry out medical records with portable fans. In a soothing 
exchange with a 6-year-old boy whose face had been cut by falling glass during 
the quake, she asked: "Were you in your bed during the earthquake? Was it 
scary?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sleeping in the truck still," Michael Miller responded. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy then turned the tables, poking Shalala in the chest with an orange 
Popsicle so that she would look at the scar on his nose. Then he asked why the 
President hadn't come instead of her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sent me because he didn't have a voice," said Shalala, apparently 
referring to Clinton's hoarseness after his State of the Union address. "But 
he's worried about you guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Touring County-USC Medical Center, Shalala shuffled through a maze of cracked 
walls and buckling support columns, passing patients on gurneys in hallways. 
She said federal funds should be used to foster the hospital's long-range 
development, rather than patching up outdated structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to see this as an opportunity to plan for health care in the 21st 
Century, not rebuild what we have," she told Witt. Making a Financial Killing 
</P>
<P>
 Even as relief poured in, officials expressed concerns about abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Wary of fraudulent claims, authorities began instituting a 72-hour waiting 
period for earthquake victims seeking emergency food stamp assistance. 
Moreover, officials said all food stamp centers will be closed today to set up 
computer equipment designed to ferret out those who do not qualify for the 
program. Offices will reopen Monday at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows a lot more time, not only to complete checks, but to look at 
information on the application a lot more closely, to see if there are any 
inconsistencies," said Dick Montoya, spokesman for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, which runs the food stamp program. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, officials reduced the number of sites from 29 to 16 in an effort 
to assist law enforcement authorities concerned about controlling crowds of 
1,000 or more who have waited in line for hours, hopeful of getting coupons 
that can purchase food at grocery stores and markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross "Supercenter" that opened in the parking lot of the severely 
damaged Northridge Fashion Center is being tested for the first time, said 
Roberta King, a Red Cross spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Shabani, 22, who has been living in a U-Haul truck with her parents 
since their Northridge apartment was condemned Jan. 17, said she was thankful 
to be out of the long lines and off of the phone. "We went to the Winnetka Park 
and the lines were so long, they told us to call," Shabani said. "So we started 
calling and we got through but they said to wait until we heard from them -- 
that was 10 days ago and in the meantime we have nothing anymore." Mother 
Nature Helps Out 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's aftershocks, centered near Chatsworth, sent engineers scrambling to 
assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking structure at Cal State Northridge was finished off by the powerful 
series of temblors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Demolition will be just a little bit easier now," said Kaine Thompson, a 
spokeswoman for the university. "Mother nature is helping us out." 
</P>
<P>
 After a preliminary overview of the campus, officials found that considerable 
debris from the battered overhang of the Delmar T. Oviatt Library had also 
tumbled to the ground. Crews began removing it Saturday with cranes. The South 
Library, which was already severely damaged in the initial quake, shifted 
laterally during the aftershocks. Inspectors planned to survey the campus again 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershocks also forced Los Angeles Unified School District officials to 
reinspect the 14 Valley campuses set to reopen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although surface cracks in walls grew slightly at some schools, the 
aftershocks had no effect on the scheduled reopenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineers, concerned that some support columns may have been weakened 
by the aftershocks, began shoring up the connector bridge between the 134 and 
101 freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Boulevard bridge over the Golden State Freeway also was closed 
for a few hours after inspectors noticed that a joint had slipped, but later 
determined that it posed no threat. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that dampened the excitement of officials who gathered Saturday to 
open a three-mile stretch of The Old Road, which now serves as a detour around 
the damaged Golden State Freeway in the Newhall Pass area. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Caltrans also reopened the southbound truck route from the Antelope 
Valley Freeway to the Golden State Freeway, allowing traffic to bypass 
congested Sierra Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Abigail Goldman, Nancy Hill-Holtzman, Jesse Katz, Myron 
Levin, Patrick J. McDonnell and special correspondent Susan Byrnes contributed

 FREE REPAIRS: Can't fix that broken wall clock? Can't keep that stubborn door 
shut? Be patient, wait for another quake and Mother Nature might act as your 
free handyman. . . . Believe it or not, the temblor, besides all the 
devastation it caused, actually did some good. People have reported items that 
were hopelessly beyond repair were somehow mended after the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 UNLUCKY LANDMARKS: Father Time has been very kind to some of the San Fernando 
Valley's oldest buildings, but Mother Nature has not. . . . Several -- 
including the Andres Pico Adobe (1834) in Mission Hills, the Leonis Adobe 
(1844) in Calabasas and the Lopez Adobe (1882) in San Fernando -- are closed 
indefinitely for repairs because of earthquake damage. . . . Rancho Cordilero 
del Norte (Ranch of the North Ridge), once a sheep farm, lost three of its six 
buildings. B3 
</P>
<P>
 SHAKES MONTH: You've heard of TV's November sweeps; how about radio's January 
shakes? Before the quake, Santa Clarita Valley's KBET-AM (1220) was just 
another outlet for oldies. No more. . . . It has become the valley's most 
reliable on-air source of quake-related information. Ratings, excuse us, are 
believed to have gone through the roof. B22

CAMPUSES IN VALLEYS PREDATE QUAKE STANDARDS

<P>
 Dozens of schools in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys were 
built before the state tightened seismic safety standards in 1976, and few have 
been upgraded, a Los Angeles Times survey has found. 
</P>
<P>
 And while independent districts inspect their schools for hazards and attempt 
to secure objects that could injure children during a temblor, their safety 
checks can range from cursory looks by janitors to full-fledged examinations by 
private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools surveyed suffered no serious physical damage, but widespread 
damage was reported even in districts that have active seismic safety 
inspection programs. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials reported that during the Jan. 17 earthquake, bolted objects 
toppled, secured light fixtures fell, and athletic-field bleachers built to 
modern standards nonetheless sagged. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Burbank reviewed and upgraded its 19 public schools for seismic 
safety was in the 1950s, according to David Gott, director of facilities 
planning for the Burbank Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank voters will decide a $100-million bond proposal for school renovation, 
including seismic upgrading, in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has no regularly scheduled inspections for seismic safety, and 
relies on reports from custodians or other personnel, said Gott. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will reinforce walls damaged by the quake at Roosevelt Elementary 
School and Luther Burbank Middle School, and replace metal trusses at John 
Burroughs High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank regularly secures cabinets, lights and heavy objects, and all of its 
smaller contract work is done to current seismic standards, Supt. Arthur Pierce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Glendale, all 27 of the district's campuses -- 19 elementary schools, four 
middle schools, three high schools and a continuation high school -- were built 
before 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismic upgrades came in a patchwork during the 1960s and 1970s, according to 
district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, bleachers were replaced at Glendale High School after the 1976 
standards were changed. Nonetheless, they shifted after the Jan. 17 earthquake 
and have been deemed unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspections take place only as needed, said district spokesman Vic Pallos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a wonderful idea to be able to go through all your structures . . 
. and see that it met the current seismic codes, but obviously that has a lot 
to do with economics," said Chuck Walton, an architect who has worked on most 
Glendale school projects over the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the smallest districts show a stark contrast in approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the two pre-1976 schools in the three-school Eastside Union School 
District, east of Lancaster, has been inspected by an architect or a structural 
engineer for seismic safety, said Virginia Coleal, assistant superintendent for 
business services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought about it once -- does that count?" Coleal said. "As far as we're 
concerned, it looks good." 
</P>
<P>
 The district plans to begin securing bookshelves and cabinets in March, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilsona School District, in the Antelope Valley, which also operates three 
schools, has just six classrooms constructed before 1976, said Richard Sanders, 
supervisor of facilities and transportation for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said on-site staff regularly inspect the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very aggressive when it comes to emergency preparedness," Sanders said. 
"All schools have their own portable generators. We have stored water at each 
site. We have stored food at each site. We're in a very rural area. We know if 
there's a natural disaster, we're not going to get help for a minimum of three 
or four days." 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools that were less aggressive have become more so. Before the 
earthquake, 60% of the bookcases and cabinets in the Newhall School District 
were secured to the walls. Within the next two weeks, all of them will be 
secured, said Bill Morton, director of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the William S. Hart Union High School District in the Santa Clarita Valley, 
with just one continuation high school and its headquarters predating the 1976 
standards, gaps were exposed by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that a lot of things we attached to the wall weren't fastened 
securely enough to withstand this powerful an earthquake," said Michael 
Bahnmaier, director of maintenance and operations. 
</P>
<P>

Ed Bond, Kurt Pitzer and Sharon Moeser, and staff writer Phil Sneiderman.

GANGBANGER TO GANGBUSTER; MONA RUIZ BROKE WITH HER PAST AND FRIENDS WHILE 
OVERCOMING POLICE DEPARTMENT SKEPTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mona Ruiz carries the weight of two badges. 
</P>
<P>
 One, Santa Ana police shield No. 1725, she has worn proudly while arresting 
hundreds of gangbangers from the city's toughest turfs. The other, a faded red 
tattoo that coils around the wrist of her shooting hand, marks her as a former 
gang member, a past predator on the same streets she now protects. 
</P>
<P>
 The two symbols clash, as do Ruiz's troubled past and her exemplary present. 
"I lived in two separate worlds," said the 34-year-old divorced mother of 
three. "Two different lives, one life on the gang side, and now a life on the 
other side of the fence." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting over the fence was the hardest thing she has ever done. Becoming a 
police officer meant turning her back on much of her former life. To many 
childhood friends, even relatives, that made Ruiz a traitor and a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Her welcome to the police station was not exactly a warm one, either. From the 
time Ruiz joined the department as a part-time clerk in 1975, her appearance 
and background made her a suspicious figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to prove myself over and over," said Ruiz, now a four-year veteran 
street officer assigned to the department's gang unit. "It's never been easy. 
It's always been a struggle to get where I wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz walks and speaks slowly and precisely. Her 5-foot, 3-inch frame may not 
cut an imposing figure, but she is wiry and street-smart, an accomplished kick 
boxer. Fellow officers grin when they talk about the times Ruiz has cowed 
hulking male suspects who doubted her strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, she holds her own," said Officer Dave Marshall, her partner. 
</P>
<P>
 One of eight children, Ruiz grew up among aunts, uncles and neighbors caught 
up in gangs and their violence. She remembers as a preschooler watching her 
parents help a wounded cousin who came banging at their door seeking refuge 
from the police. 
</P>
<P>
 She had seen a dozen people killed before she was old enough to drive, and 
half a dozen times as a teen-ager she cradled dying friends who been shot 
during street skirmishes. She saw others die from drug overdoses, their glazed 
and wild eyes dimming before closing forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't forget things like that," she said quietly. "Ever." 
</P>
<P>
 While Ruiz fought for her gang, and even married another member, she said she 
always distanced herself from the group's hard-core activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got in a lot of fights because I wouldn't do drugs," Ruiz said. "I had seen 
too many girls get raped by guys, guys in the same gang, because they got too 
wasted. And the people I knew who did drugs -- their lives just fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Some friends laughed while others became wary when she got a clerical job at 
the Santa Ana Police Department through a high school jobs program. At the 
police station, authorities were equally wary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was obvious that she was a gang member," said Lt. Felix Osuna, now 
commander of the department's traffic division. "She was a real concern to us. 
We wondered if we could trust her with reports; we wondered why she was working 
here, all sorts of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of his suspicions, Osuna decided to get to know Ruiz and the 
two became unlikely friends. The veteran cop learned about the violence, drugs 
and desperation that surrounded Ruiz when she left work every night. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would tell my partner and I horror stories about what she had seen, 
shootings and stabbings and drive-bys,' Osuna said. "And she would talk about 
wanting to get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The two chatted almost daily during the next few years, with Osuna offering 
Ruiz advice, a small loan or a friendly ear -- whichever she needed most. He 
said he worried about her, especially when she quit the department for four 
years during her marriage to an abusive gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two saw each other during that period, Osuna would urge Ruiz to come 
back. He would tell her to get away from the gang scene, to think about her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in 1985, Ruiz made the break with her husband and the gang, returning 
to the station as part of the parking enforcement unit. For four years she was 
busy writing parking tickets and raising her children alone, but she knew she 
wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he knew her well, Osuna said he was floored in 1989 when Ruiz walked 
into his office and announced her new aspiration, an old dream. "I want to be a 
police officer," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Osuna warned her that it would be a difficult road, and he was right. The 
department turned down her initial application, telling Ruiz she "was not Santa 
Ana material." 
</P>
<P>
 "But what they meant was I didn't look like a cop is supposed to look," Ruiz 
said. Even now, she stands out among the department's predominantly white male 
ranks. Among 380 officers, only 15 are women. Among the 15, only three are 
Latinas. 
</P>
<P>
 After the department refused to send Ruiz through its academy, she increased 
her resolve to prove herself. She went to a nighttime reserve academy while 
holding down her day job and raising her children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would look at my kids sleeping at night and think about them being shot 
like all the kids I had seen get killed," Ruiz said. "That helped me decide." 
</P>
<P>
 Beaming with pride, Osuna pinned the silver badge on his protege's lapel when 
Ruiz graduated from the Police Academy in December, 1989. The only woman in her 
class, she finished among the top five, graduating with honors. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did it, despite all the odds," Osuna said. "She's a survivor. How could 
you not respect her?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was no secret that more than a few people in the department hoped that 
background checks would provide grounds to deny her application. During her 
rookie months, she said, she was confronted by officers who accused her of 
being unworthy of the uniform, or suggested she was a spy. Others went further. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one sergeant tell me: 'You don't belong here. If it takes the rest of 
my career, I'm going to make sure you don't make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz, weary of the confrontations, says: "When I meet other cops, they see 
(the tattoo) and ask about it. Some get real tense about it. I had one tell me, 
'You look like you should be in the back of the patrol car, not the front.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her associations, Ruiz said she never ended up in the back of a squad 
car during her teen-age years, an assertion that the department's exhaustive 
investigations confirmed. She admits to being in scores of fights, but said she 
was always careful not to cross the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters said although Ruiz's background may 
have been a stumbling block earlier in her career, it now gives her a special 
affinity for her work with the department's gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her background certainly enables her to better understand the mind-set of the 
people she deals with," Walters said. "Officers that come from the middle class 
or other types of areas sometimes find it frustrating and troubling when they 
deal with people that seem lost or caught up in gang lifestyles." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory C. Brown knows about the odds Ruiz beat to make it. He escaped the 
gang scene in his childhood home, Watts, and is an assistant professor of 
criminal justice at Chapman University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people who use education, religion or hard work to rise above the 
dangerous allure of gangs usually have to leave their neighborhood to do it, 
Brown said. "That's what I did. But she's there every day, dealing with the 
place that could have killed her." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz joined a gang in her freshman year at Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of peer pressure to join a gang, and that day I knew I had 
better find some friends if I wanted to survive," Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the chaos of her teen-age years a piece of advice from her father 
lingered in her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 He had told her to become a police officer. That job, he said, would bring her 
respect and give her life a direction. That was the way to a better world. 
Become a police officer. "In my father's eyes, police were like soldiers of 
Christ," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She filed the advice away, and nearly abandoned it when she ran with her gang 
during high school. Then something happened that made Ruiz stop and take stock. 
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's Eve, 1978, Ruiz was at a party in a neighboring area, a place 
she had never been before. She was visiting the home of her sister's fiance, 
and the mood was festive as people danced on the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The music was interrupted by a series of loud pops, like someone had ignited a 
string of firecrackers. Ruiz felt a burning slash across her neck, and 
something passed through her long, dark hair. She turned just in time to see 
the slug tear a hole in the chest of a young man standing a few feet away. 
Screaming, she dropped to the ground and crawled on her stomach toward the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shooting kept going, and we all scrambled to get inside," she said. "I 
said to myself right then: 'Do I want to live like this?' That could have been 
me out there, dead. I'm only 17, do I want to die?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was just one of many killings she had witnessed, but the heat from the 
bullet and her fear affected her like never before. An inch away from death, 
she thought to herself, just an inch. It was then that she vowed to escape the 
chaos of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz has come a long way since that night, but sometimes the memory seems too 
close. Last Halloween, she and her partner were sitting across from a teen-age 
hangout when gunfire erupted from a passing car. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was this girl dancing on the step in front of this restaurant, I 
remember her moving up and down," Ruiz said. "Then she was shot. Her head just 
exploded. It seemed to happen in slow motion, like a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 The two officers sped after the car, and caught up to the occupants as they 
gathered a few blocks away to celebrate their deed. "They never saw us until we 
busted them." 
</P>
<P>
 As she talked about the arrest, Ruiz cast her eyes downward, the memory of the 
girl's gruesome death still jarring loose a jumble of violent memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost friends, lost lives, and the night she felt the touch of the bullet. "At 
least we caught them this time. At least now I'm on the side that's trying to 
make a difference."

LASERS OFFER HOPE FOR WORST HEART AILMENTS; HEALTH: IN EXPERIMENTAL SURGERY, 
HOLES ARE BURNED THROUGH MUSCLE WALLS TO PROVIDE OXYGEN. TREATMENT MAY BE AN 
ALTERNATIVE WHEN ANGIOPLASTY AND BYPASSES FAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An unusual new procedure using a high-powered laser to literally blast holes 
in the heart is providing hope for patients with severe coronary artery disease 
who have had bypass surgery and have no other treatment options, researchers 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneered by surgeons at the San Francisco Heart Institute, the technique 
punctures holes in the heart wall that allow blood to enter capillaries in the 
muscle, providing oxygen and nutrients to tissues that have been starved by 
blocked arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure has reduced pain in 91% of the 46 patients who have received it 
in a clinical trial and has increased mobility in 76%, surgeons reported at a 
meeting of the Society for Thoracic Surgery in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The laser procedure represents a radical departure from the conventional 
methods of treating coronary artery disease. "This is a totally revolutionary 
way to get blood supply to heart muscle," said Dr. Lawrence H. Cohn of Harvard 
Medical School, chairman of the department of thoracic surgery at Brigham and 
Women's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents are not yet touting the procedure, called transmyocardial 
revascularization, as an alternative to bypasses or angioplasty. Rather -- at 
least until enough data is accumulated to assess the procedure's long-term 
effectiveness -- they say it is a last resort for patients for whom all other 
treatments have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, proponents say the procedure is significantly cheaper and easier 
to perform than bypass surgery, and preliminary evidence suggests that its 
beneficial effects may persist longer because -- unlike grafted arteries -- the 
laser holes do not seem to plug up again. But surgeons note that it has not 
worked for everybody who has received the procedure, and they are not sure why. 
Four patients died of complications from the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. 
More than 400,000 coronary artery bypasses are performed in this country each 
year, in which a vein, typically from the leg, reroutes blood around the 
blockage. Surgeons also perform almost that many angioplasties, in which a 
balloon is inflated inside an artery to compress blockages and restore blood 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
 But tens of thousands of patients who have undergone such therapies and 
suffered relapses have arteries that are too fragile for further treatment. The 
new approach could be their only salvation, some surgeons said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to be very conservative and assess the results from this 
technique objectively, but we are really quite encouraged," said noted heart 
surgeon Dr. Denton Cooley of the Texas Heart Institute, who has treated 12 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sounded far-fetched when we were first approached to participate in 
trials," Cohn said. "But now that we have done eight patients, it's proved 
extremely interesting and makes us somewhat optimistic that this will have a 
place for treatment of patients who have no other recourse." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to see confirmation of their results, but this is really the cutting 
edge of heart surgery," said Dr. George Sopko of the National Heart, Lung and 
Blood Institute. "I would like to see a little more animal research, however, 
to explain how it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Erroll Taylor, an 86-year-old retired butcher, was the first person to undergo 
the procedure, in San Francisco in January, 1990. Taylor had had two bypass 
operations, the first at age 67, as well as angioplasty. But since 1977, he had 
been in virtually constant pain as his heart muscles screamed for oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pains were terrible. There is no way I can describe what those pains were 
like," Taylor said in an interview. "When they hit me, I was virtually 
helpless." 
</P>
<P>
 He was housebound for 13 years, checking into the hospital frequently to 
receive injections of a blood thinner that reduced the pain somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a month of his operation, Taylor said, "my life was back to normal." He 
is able to walk comfortably around the neighborhood, go fishing and enter 
fly-casting contests, his favorite pastime. "I've even won a couple of medals 
since the operation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the technique may appear to be a radical departure, its developers 
note that its roots lie in a natural phenomenon observed in reptiles. 
Researchers have long known that reptile hearts receive a substantial 
proportion of their nourishment through similar, naturally occurring channels 
into the heart muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have been attempting to reproduce the channels since the 1930s, 
using needles, catheters and other devices to puncture the tissues, but the 
trauma always made the holes heal closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The groundwork for the current studies was laid by Dr. Mahmood Mihroseini of 
St. Luke's Medical Center in Milwaukee, who spent more than 20 years studying 
the use of lasers in animals. The high-powered lasers vaporize cells in their 
path, creating a clean hole without any trauma to adjacent cells. The animal 
studies show that the channels remain open indefinitely -- which leads surgeons 
to hope that they will also remain unplugged in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John R. Crew of the San Francisco Heart Institute performed the first 15 
procedures in humans with a laser developed by PLC Systems Inc., the 
Massachusetts company that manufactures the $350,000 laser system. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a bypass operation, in which the heart must be stopped, the new 
procedure is performed while it is beating. A computer attached to the heart by 
electrodes fires the laser's 0.05-second pulses between heartbeats so that the 
laser does not interfere with the electrical currents that control heart 
function. 
</P>
<P>
 The pulse must also be fired while the heart is full of blood. After the beam 
burns through the tissue, the rest of its energy is absorbed by blood, 
preventing further damage to surrounding heart tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgeons punch 20 to 35 holes, each a fraction of an inch in diameter, in the 
area of the heart that needs nourishment. Although blood immediately begins 
leaking from the holes, clots quickly form on the surface, blocking further 
blood loss. The rest of the channel remains open, allowing blood to be forced 
into capillaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the entire procedure is performed through a four-inch incision in the 
lower chest, it is much less invasive than a bypass operation. It costs about 
$15,000 to $16,000, compared to an average of $43,000 for a bypass, and the 
average hospital stay is about a week.

 There was the yoga instructor in North Hollywood. As the National Guardsman 
told it last week, this "yoga guy" would sit cross-legged and, working both 
hands in slow, rhythmic swipes, polish the troops' black combat boots for free. 
He did this all day long. "Wax and shine, wax and shine," the soldier recalled, 
repeating the mantra as he mimicked the hand movements.

 At one of the tent cities -- Shakervilles? -- two Guardsmen stood guard over a 
food cache. Actually, they were sitting guard. M-16s balanced on their knees, 
they perched on either end of a plastic chaise, catching a bit of sun, 
citizen-soldiers ruminating on their latest Los Angeles adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were out last night at a gym on guard duty," one said. "Some company was 
giving away shoes. It was pretty nice, I thought, to give away all those 
shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission," the other sentry broke in, "basically was to maintain order and 
make sure nobody went through the line twice. Some of these people are just 
after freebies. You can tell the ones who are really in need. They stand 
quietly in line, take whatever they are given, and then they thank you for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another soldier. Another park. Another story: "We had a mother loan her kid to 
a stranger the other day. She just left him. This cute little 4-year-old boy. 
She and her friends wanted to go out looking for some crack. So they just 
looked around and saw this guy and figured he was the best guy around for the 
job. So she handed him the kid and left, and she didn't come back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What a strange way to see a city. In shifts of 2,000 or more, the weekend 
warriors of the National Guard have been called away from regular jobs and 
lives and, dressed for combat, thrown into duty in Los Angeles -- just as they 
were last year for the Rodney G. King verdicts, as they were in the riots, and 
as some were last winter during the San Diego floods, and the big fires up 
north in 1990, and the Loma Prieta earthquake the year before, and Coalinga 
before that, and. . . . The California Guard's top general, an aide said, likes 
to joke "there are four seasons in California: fire, flood, earthquake and, um, 
I can't remember the fourth, but you get the idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Guard members activated this time belong to units based in Southern 
California. So they come not as total strangers. Still, even among natives, 
their rounds take them to new neighborhoods and new situations. The extent of 
the damage, and its capriciousness, amazes them. "The city is hurting," one 
said softly. "It hurts to see it hurting this bad." For those who traveled from 
farther away, Los Angeles tends to surprise, both in scale and demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sgt. David Ardilla, a 38-year-old San Diegan: 'The good thing about the 
riots is that they helped me learn my way around the streets. After the riot I 
came back and saw 'Phantom of the Opera.' I took my wife all over town. Every 
time I come up here I run into a lot of friendly people. It has changed my San 
Diego versus L.A. attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 The riots, said one officer who had seen sniper duty, was "interesting." And 
that first night before the ammunition arrived, said another, equally laconic 
soldier, was "very interesting." "We had a couple of drive-bys," said Sgt. 
Carlos Cleland, a former Marine from the High Desert country, "but those guys 
can't shoot very well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the earthquake, Guard members have pitched canvas tents, 
patrolled the camps and tried to keep peace at relief centers. "The first day," 
one soldier recalled, "we broke up two fights, had two heart attacks and 
generally had a melee." Almost every soldier has logged time on a soccer field 
with kids. A few have read bedtime stories. Early on there was some looting in 
the camps. "One lady was asleep on this cot," Cleland said, "and they just 
picked her up and moved her and took the cot." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the burning, breaking and bleeding they have seen, the soldiers 
interviewed remain ardent California boosters. "My brother is in Indiana now, 
freezing," one cackled. "He never should have left California." They roll with 
it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's our joke," offered a young soldier named Jon Dixon. "Ninety-two was 
the year of the riot. Nine-three was the year of the trial. Ninety-four was the 
earthquake. Ninety-five will be the flood. And by '99 it will be Armageddon." 
</P>
<P>
 Now one of his mates ran up. "You about done, Dixon?" he asked. The convoy 
trucks were loaded and rumbling. This unit's tour was done. 
</P>
<P>
 "See you," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but on reflection, maybe not too soon, OK?

CALIFORNIA LOOKS GOLDEN TO CONSULTANTS; POLITICS: THE PEOPLE WHO RUN CAMPAIGNS 
SEE A BUSY AND PROFITABLE YEAR FOR THEIR PROFESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gathered together in this neon-gilded gambling mecca, the nation's top 
political consultants considered California's fortunes last week and concluded 
that, for their profession at least, things are looking up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the quake-shaken, recession-weary Golden State is filled with despair, 
said George Gorton, Gov. Pete Wilson's campaign manager. Its voters are 
"hard-core disgruntled," said Roy Behr, policy director for state Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown, who wants Wilson's job. "California," said Darry Sragow, who is 
managing Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's campaign for governor, "is in 
a hell of a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 But to many of the 200 men and women who attended the American Assn. of 
Political Consultants' two-day winter conference at Bally's Casino Resort, all 
that sounded potentially heavenly. Forget Keno or craps, said the expert 
handlers and advertising gurus whose livelihoods depend on hard-fought 
elections. When it comes to making money in 1994, they said, California offers 
their profession better odds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will probably become the most expensive political year in the history of 
the state -- easily in excess of $100 million will be spent," said Joe Cerrell, 
a Los Angeles-based consultant who is the association's chairman emeritus. It 
is "a full-employment year for political consultants." 
</P>
<P>
 The gubernatorial race is only the beginning. So far, in addition to its three 
contenders, 29 candidates are running for eight other statewide offices, 
including the U.S. Senate seat now occupied by Dianne Feinstein. There will be 
battles for 80 Assembly offices, 52 congressional seats, 20 state Senate 
positions and four Board of Equalization posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Things could get ugly and, for those who deal in spin and strategy, that will 
mean a pretty profit. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, said Hank Sheinkopf, a New York consultant who has worked on 40 
California campaigns in the last decade, "15 to 20 cents of every dollar spent 
in the U.S. for political races will be spent in California." To put it another 
way: if California were a country, its slice of the political money pie would 
be bigger than that of any other nation except the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder so many conference participants showed up for a special California 
election preview panel on Thursday afternoon. There, campaign strategists for 
the Republican governor and his two Democratic challengers swapped barbs, often 
doubling up two against one. Predictably, the Brown and Garamendi camps joined 
to zing Wilson. More telling, however, were the moments when Garamendi's and 
Wilson's front men ganged up on Brown -- an alliance that added credence to the 
buzz that Brown could be the one to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton, Wilson's campaign manager, professed to love a recent "60 Minutes" 
television piece, a glowing profile of Brown that Gorton conceded made the 
daughter and sister of two former governors appear likable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a year when (voters) are going to walk in the booth and say, 
'Who's likable?' " he said, artfully trying to turn his boss' sometimes 
stone-faced demeanor into an attribute. "This is a tough year. It's not a 
Kathleen Brown year." 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, was quick to pile on, casting Brown as a 
waffler on important issues and laying down a challenge: "John is prepared to 
debate Kathleen Brown any time, any place" -- before the June 7 primary, that 
is. Garamendi didn't even need to know the topic in advance, Sragow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Behr, Brown's policy director, shot back: "I guarantee there'll be more 
debates than when Garamendi ran for insurance commissioner." (In that campaign, 
Garamendi was accused of avoiding public encounters with his three rivals.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cerrell, who moderated this panel, had seen enough. "This," he proclaimed, "is 
going to be a good campaign!" 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the conference was devoted to campaigns that revolve around 
issues, not candidates. Especially in odd-numbered years, when candidates are 
usually not on the ballot, these referendums, initiatives and corporate public 
relations campaigns are consultants' bread and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants argued over such things as whether it pays to use celebrities in 
issue-related commercials. They reviewed new lobbying regulations, pondered how 
to use polls and speculated about the future interactive capabilities of the 
so-called information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Direct mail video got a fair bit of attention as well. Republican media 
consultant Tom Edmonds, who has produced several targeted videotapes for 
clients, said video is an increasingly popular weapon in the battle to win over 
voters. The reason: Americans have trouble throwing videotapes away. Maybe it's 
because rental shops charge such high fees, Edmonds suggested. When the mail 
carrier delivers an unsolicited cassette, even people who routinely jettison 
junk mail will often stop and take a look. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conference, several vendors promoted video campaigning technology, 
including one Los Angeles company, West Coast Video Duplicating, which lured 
customers with the promise that their product allows campaigns to "drop by 
30,000 homes for a five-minute chat without having to drink 60,000 cups of 
coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 One conference event, confirming that there are few limits to conduct in a 
political contest, was a luncheon that focused on Nevada's favorite industry 
(what political consultants politely call "gaming"). The luncheon, which 
addressed how to "sell" propositions to legalize gambling to voters, featured a 
slide show narrated by George Hardie, general manager of the Bicycle Club card 
casino in Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardie thinks gambling is good, clean fun. But he has orchestrated 18 
anti-gambling campaigns to keep competitors from siphoning off his customers. 
Color slides of his advertisements shed light on why Hardie often wins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Card Rooms Bring Strangers," says one ad, which shows a man in a ski mask 
pointing a handgun straight at the camera. "This is mild," Hardie said, moving 
on to more images that linked gambling to drugs, pornography, perversion and 
pandering. 
</P>
<P>
 One ad featured what Hardie called his "standard prostitution shot": a woman 
in hot pants leaning suggestively into a car parked outside a casino. Another 
ad, printed on yellow paper and sent to voters in West Hollywood to combat a 
proposition seeking to legalize some forms of gambling, said: "Prop. D means 
Asian gambling in West Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business is 60% Asian, and we love the Asian community," he said. "We did 
this piece, though, and we were accused of racism." 
</P>
<P>
 After Hardie spoke, one prominent political consultant muttered under his 
breath, "I want to go take a shower."

RAIN-SWOLLEN RIVERS JUMP BANKS IN EAST AND MIDWEST; FLOODING: IN WEST VIRGINIA, 
WATER LAPS AT ROOFS AND SINKS ROADS, FIELDS AND A PADDLE BOAT. ICY STREETS 
CAUSE DEATHS IN NEW YORK, PENNSYLVANIA.

<P>
 An Ohio River swollen with rain and melted snow surged beyond its banks 
Saturday, unleashing floods that covered some homes up to their roofs and sank 
a 50-foot boat as it rested in a back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Floods also battered Pennsylvania, where the Monongahela River threatened 100 
homes, and Indiana, where one river fork rose more than five feet above flood 
stage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Parkersburg, the Ohio River was 2 1/2 feet above flood stage and was 
expected to crest today at five feet above flood stage. About 200 homes were 
flooded along the Little Kanawha River, which flows into the Ohio. No injuries 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The water closed roads, swallowed a baseball field and a volleyball court and 
forced about 200 families to leave their homes, said Ken Riffle, a spokesman 
for the Wood County Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 April Pearson had to enter her flooded split-level home through a third-floor 
window. She said her family's 50-foot stern-wheeler sank in the back yard, even 
though it was docked on land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water came up so fast it just sank her," Pearson said. "She couldn't get 
her buoyancy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamstown Bridge, which connects Williamstown and Marietta, Ohio, was 
closed because water had covered the Ohio side. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hocking River flooded the southern Ohio town of Chauncey, forcing the 
evacuation of about 55 people and washing out the two state routes that lead 
into the town, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges in Indiana, including a few that date back to the early 1900s, were 
threatened by ice chunks from last week's cold snap that jammed against pilings 
along the surging White River. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ice jam was solid, bank to bank, and I could feel movement on the bridge 
as the ice chunks hit the piers and the ice breakers," said Jackson County 
Commissioner Steve Gill, who monitored ice flow near the Rockford Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 In south-central Indiana, the east fork of the White River crested 5 1/2 feet 
over flood stage but did not threaten the nearby town of Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pennsylvania, the Monongahela rose 2 1/2 feet above flood stage Saturday 
near Carol Bowers' mobile home in the Pittsburgh suburb of West Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The home was not damaged, but the timing couldn't have been worse -- Bowers 
had put the home up for sale that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I could give it away," she said. "I could advertise it as a 
mobile home-slash-houseboat that you can fish out of from your door." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, the problem was ice that clogged waterways 
throughout the state and contributed to one death. A woman died when her car 
skidded on an icy bridge, ran up over a snowbank and plunged into the Conestoga 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 In Upstate New York, one of three motorists who rushed to assist a woman whose 
car had spun into a snowbank was struck and killed by another spinning car. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one place that did not have enough ice: Saranac Lake, N.Y., which 
was short of materials to build the traditional ice palace for its annual 
carnival. Officials blamed the weather, which layered Lake Flower with snow and 
produced slush instead of ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't fight Mother Nature," said carnival chairman Don Duso.

HORSEPOWER PUTS MOTHER ON ROAD TO DELIVERY

<P>
 When horseless carriages failed her, expectant mother Josie Williams got a 
helping hand from an Amish neighbor and his trusty buggy. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambulance that picked her up Friday morning slid off an icy road. Along 
came Elmer Eichler and his two-horse team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had the shoes sharpened up so they would bite into the ice," said 
Walt Zinser, director of Reading's ambulance service. "Once we got them hooked 
up, they walked it right out." 
</P>
<P>
 The ambulance made it the rest of the way to the hospital, where Williams 
delivered a healthy son, Matthew. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother and child were in good condition Saturday, a nursing supervisor said.

ISRAEL, PLO TRY TO PATCH UP PEACE PACT; MIDEAST: BOTH SIDES SAY THEY ARE READY 
TO COMPROMISE AS THEY MEET AT SWISS RESORT. BUT NO ONE IS MAKING ANY PROMISES.

 Faced with a prolonged impasse in their negotiations on a program to implement 
Palestinian self-government, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization 
are attempting again this weekend to resolve the issues that stand in the way 
of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met for 
more than four hours late Saturday and planned further talks today, with both 
sides declaring their readiness for compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides "are making an effort, both have taken a couple of steps forward," 
Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said. "We are not yet at an agreement, 
but there is a very good atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 The two delegations appointed a small drafting committee to work through the 
night in an effort to strike a deal that would satisfy each side's political 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not say we have an agreement, but there is an atmosphere of 
compromise and an atmosphere of trying to work things out," said Yasser 
Abed-Rabbo, a member of the PLO Executive Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arafat and Peres had reached some broad understandings a week ago in 
Oslo, negotiators found themselves unable to put these into writing during 
further talks in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shall try to sign an agreement, but nobody can promise ahead of time," 
Peres said before the meeting with Arafat. "We have a lot of hard work ahead. I 
just hope for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his arrival at this ski resort high in the Swiss Alps, Arafat was equally 
downbeat. Asked if he thought agreement could be reached, Arafat said simply: 
"I hope so. We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and Peres were meeting in advance of a joint appearance today before 
the World Economic Forum, a privately organized annual gathering of government 
and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two basic issues before the men: 
</P>
<P>
 * Control of the border crossings from Jordan and Egypt into the regions that 
will become autonomous under the basic agreement between Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel insists for security reasons that it be able to inspect all travelers 
and their baggage. The PLO argues that it should control entry into the Gaza 
Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho and that Israel should limit its 
security checks. Israel counters that the PLO wants trappings of statehood -- 
and that this is more than it can accept. 
</P>
<P>
 * The size of the autonomous Jericho District on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel is offering 22 square miles and insisting there will be no more. The 
PLO wants 85 square miles, and it is asking for access to the Dead Sea and 
control over areas where there are Jewish settlements -- though not control of 
the settlements themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the table, however, are security arrangements for the 5,000 settlers 
living in the Gaza Strip and half a dozen other issues with political 
implications, according to Israeli and Arab diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to reach agreement on these questions has held up completion of 
the detailed program to implement the autonomy accord signed in September. As a 
result, Israel's troop withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho has been delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli sources indicated Saturday night that Israel might agree to some of 
the border arrangements desired by the PLO in return for greater security 
measures to protect the Gaza settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Arab diplomats familiar with the negotiations in Cairo last week said 
the gaps are wide, and Palestinians added that outside mediators such as 
Norway, which helped Israel and the PLO reach their basic accord, might have to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat met before dawn Saturday with the PLO Executive Committee before 
leaving his headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, according to Palestinian sources, 
and then saw the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia to request American assistance in 
breaking the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials with Peres were even less encouraging, predicting that 
several more meetings could be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of baskets of differences," Peres said Saturday as he trudged 
through the snow back to his hotel from the Davos conference center. 
</P>
<P>
 He had told Israeli television on Friday that he had come "with a will to 
sign" an agreement with Arafat on the outstanding issues, but he warned: "There 
is a possibility that we will only discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like the progress to be significant, but I also am aware of the 
difficulties," Peres said. "We are handling negotiations with emotional 
significance between people, negotiations that touch on difficult 
sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every word has a different repercussion. All this means crossing oceans, 
doubts, fears and difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to join Arafat and Peres in addressing the World Economic Forum on 
"Cementing Peace in the Middle East" are Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan, Foreign 
Minister Amir Moussa of Egypt and Joan Spero, U.S. undersecretary of state for 
economic affairs.

CHIAPAS REBELS OVERRUN MEXICO LEADER'S AGENDA; REVOLT: BUREAUCRATIC GAFFES, 
RURAL AREA'S SPECIAL PROBLEMS FRUSTRATE EFFORTS TO SETTLE THE DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A month after rebels from the Zapatista National Liberation Army took control 
of four county seats in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, their cause 
continues to dominate the national agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The uprising in the impoverished Mexican state near the Guatemalan border has 
overshadowed President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's weekend trip to the World 
Economic Forum in Switzerland. It has become an issue in the national 
presidential campaign, provoking speculation that the party that has dominated 
Mexico for more than six decades may be forced to change candidates in 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a disturbing sign for Salinas himself, the rebellion has shown itself 
to be immune to the stunning, snap solutions that have served him so well for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The president -- who proved his strength days after taking office by arresting 
the powerful head of the oil workers' union in a shootout -- has gotten bogged 
down in efforts to settle the Chiapas dispute because of bureaucratic gaffes 
and for reasons that can only be seen and understood here, far from the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for example, the experiences of peasant farmer Valentin Gomez and 
his neighbors. He says the guerrilla occupation is the closest that his 
edge-of-the-jungle village of adobe huts has come to peace in his 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant disputes with private ranchers over land and cattle have kept the 
semi-communal farm, called an ejido , in an uproar for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said the army always seemed to take the side of the ranchers. When the 
rebels swept into this area, they installed a roadblock just outside of town -- 
a blockade that Gomez and his neighbors now see as protection from the army. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our communities, we can say that peace has not existed," Gomez said. "We 
have been quiet because the army has kept us that way. We cannot sue a rancher 
because his cattle trample our corn. We cannot organize a demonstration because 
people are afraid of being beaten up. This is not peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez and his guerrilla-sympathizing neighbors are not eager for normalcy to 
return if that means the army and government will regain control. Their 
resistance has contributed to the deadlock that has plagued Salinas and his 
government negotiators, who have come under increasing pressure from refugees, 
ranchers and international public opinion to settle the Chiapas crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Salinas appeared to move decisively, firing his Interior minister and 
naming Manuel Camacho Solis, the former Mexico City mayor and his government's 
top conciliator, as his peacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas and Camacho agreed to accept help from Samuel Ruiz, an Indian rights 
activist and bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas who has often clashed with 
the government over its treatment of descendants of the Maya Empire who make up 
one-third of Chiapas' population. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz opened a line to the Zapatistas. And there has been some progress toward 
a settlement. On Friday, for example, the government freed 38 of 70 prisoners 
suspected of participating in the rebellion, and it ordered an investigation 
into the deaths of five guerrillas the army denies having executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a promised government announcement of a peace proposal was canceled 
last week. And while Camacho said Saturday that both sides have agreed to an 
agenda for face-to-face talks, no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, other government initiatives have produced embarrassments as they 
have played into longstanding feuds in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, for instance, the radio campaign to get Chiapans to turn in 
suspected guerrillas. Such efforts instead have turned into witch hunts in 
which neighbors have sought to settle old scores with neighbors, said Ellen 
Lutz, a representative of Americas Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what apparently happened in Oxchuc, 12 miles east of San Cristobal. 
Army troops arrived there on Jan. 15, allegedly to protect residents who had 
been clamoring for aid since Jan. 2, when Zapatistas retreating from San 
Cristobal entered their county seat, also called Oxchuc, burning government 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the chagrin of many in the area, by the afternoon after the army 
arrived, local officials were combing villages and arresting people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the village of Tuxaquilja, they reportedly pulled one man from his house, 
boxed his ears and threw him in the back of a pickup, without explanation. On 
the ride nine miles down a mountain to the county seat, the man said he was 
kicked and beaten. He was turned over to soldiers, who tied his hands behind 
his back and took him in a troop truck to a nearby army base, along with 16 
other men from the township. 
</P>
<P>
 At the army base, the man said he was beaten and threatened with execution 
unless he confessed to being a Zapatista. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I confessed, even though I had never heard of the Zapatistas until 
they entered Oxchuc," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Ministry has denied that the army has tortured prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17 Oxchuc prisoners eventually were taken to Cerro Hueco prison in the 
state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez; there they received food for the first time 
since their arrest, the man said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 20, the men were released. 
</P>
<P>
 All were members of the civic group Tres Nudos, "Three Knots," the Spanish 
translation of Oxchuc and a reference to the Mayan belief that a rope tied in 
three places is strong and well-balanced. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, the 24 Oxchuc villages that formed Tres Nudos have received 
direct government loans and aid to start a corn mill and tortilla factory, as 
well as to finance corn, bean and potato crops. Group members argue that 
municipal authorities were angry at them because they had bypassed the usual 
aid channels -- meaning some officials lost a chance to get at the government 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials refused to talk with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar incidents have been reported in communities where Zapatistas invaded, 
then left. The government's National Human Rights Commission reported last week 
that charges have been dropped against 58 of the 131 people arrested in 
connection with the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 As the guerrillas have fled to the jungle, they have sent out a steady stream 
of refugees, worsening the chaos confronting Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel de la Cruz was returning to Agua Dulce, the family ranch a few miles 
from San Miguel in guerrilla-held territory. He was full of determination to 
defend the family homestead after a three-day meeting organized by independent 
peasant groups in San Cristobal. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he stopped in to see his sister, who lives in a village along the 
route, he found that his father, Alejandro, the 82-year-old patriarch, had 
brought three generations of the family out of Zapatista territory. Mounted on 
10 horses with grandchildren trailing on foot, the De la Cruz family abandoned 
the ranch Alejandro had bought with his savings as a day laborer 20 years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels stopped the caravan at roadblocks along the route and tried to force 
them to turn back. "I told them that their pistols did not scare me," Alejandro 
said. " 'I'm old. If you want to kill me, kill me. If not, get out of my way.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 As the uncertain cease-fire in the region drags on, more people are making the 
same decision, filling refugee camps in towns outside the rebel areas. They are 
straining the state's limited resources at the same time the fighting is 
destroying its never-robust economy. The coffee harvest is already lost; the 
cattle appear to be next. 
</P>
<P>
 When guerrillas swooped down on the 470-acre ranch he and his father own, 
killing and eating a steer, Jose Francisco Lopez decided not to go back. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, manager of the Ocosingo Cattlemen's Assn., which ships 25,000 head of 
cattle a year to the United States for fattening, said 46 local ranches have 
been sacked since the year began. Local newspapers reported that 150 ranchers 
have left their spreads in or near rebel territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are constant confrontations between comrades and ranchers," Gomez, the 
peasant farmer, said. "These are problems that have gone on for 40 or 50 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 And even when peasant groups, such as the Rural Collective Interest Assn., 
have won some victories, he said, they have often proven hollow. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, for example, at the collective's insistence, the government 
expropriated a 6,000-acre ranch called El Rosario, dividing the land among six 
ejidos , including San Miguel. Peasants soon realized the land was suitable 
only for pasture and applied for loans to buy cattle so they could begin 
ranching. 
</P>
<P>
 They were told that for environmental reasons, there is an embargo on ranching 
so close to the Lacandon rain forest. Some people have tried planting corn on 
the land, but yields are low, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, some observers believe the peace process has gotten mired in large 
part because, in the past, the government was so slow to respond to Chiapas 
peasants' peaceful petitions for land, schools and medical service. As one 
parish priest noted, "The conflict would never have occurred at all if the 
government had not taken so long to find solutions that people became 
desperate."

FOUR HELD IN FATAL BOSNIA ABDUCTION; BALKANS: MUSLIM BANDITS ARE SUSPECTED OF 
KIDNAPING IN WHICH U.N. CONVOY DRIVER DIED. ITALY DEMANDS PROBE INTO

 Muslim-led Bosnian authorities have detained four men in the abduction of 
three British aid workers in central Bosnia in which one was shot dead, U.N. 
officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspected Muslim bandits hijacked a car carrying the three -- all U.N. convoy 
drivers -- to a desolate area outside Zenica on Thursday, ordered the aid 
workers out and opened fire, killing one and wounding the others.The assailants 
escaped with the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Abu Zayd, chief of operations for U.N. aid operations in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, was told in a meeting about the incident with senior 
Bosnian government officials on Saturday that four men had been detained for 
questioning, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate comment from the Bosnian government. The attack, which 
raised to 11 the number of staff members of the U.N. Office of the High 
Commissioner for Refugees killed in Bosnia, was among the worst on foreign aid 
workers trying to sustain 1.2 million civilians trapped in the center of the 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Rome, Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta demanded an 
investigation into the deaths of three Italian television journalists in 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter Marco Luchetta, 41, cameraman Dario D'Angelo, 41, and technician 
Alessandro Otta, 37, were killed in a Bosnian Croat mortar attack Friday in the 
Muslim-held quarter of Mostar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope Croatia's government will join in the condemnation of such an 
appalling incident," Andreatta said in a letter to his Croatian counterpart, 
Mate Granic. "Italy also expects all parties to collaborate fully in 
identifying who was responsible."

CLINTON SAYS HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM IS UNFAIR TO MANY FAMILIES, FIRMS; REFORM: 
THE PRESIDENT CITES FEE HIKES FOR SMALLER COMPANIES AND COVERAGE DENIALS OVER 
SOME PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, seeking to forge support for health care reform, charged 
Saturday that the nation's health insurance system "is rigged against ordinary 
families and small businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 In his weekly radio address, Clinton, his voice still raspy from his hour-plus 
State of the Union speech Tuesday night, said health insurance companies hike 
fees for businesses that are too small and deny coverage to those with costly 
pre-existing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we change things, 58 million Americans may have no coverage at all for 
some time this year," Clinton said. "And experts say three of every 10 small 
businesses may be forced to stop covering their employees in the years ahead 
because small-business costs are going up so much faster than big-business and 
government costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Estimating that he and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had received nearly 1 
million letters on health care, Clinton also derided claims that there is no 
health care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only place where people say there's really no health care crisis is right 
here in Washington, where so many enjoy secure health benefits at reasonable 
cost, paid for by the taxpayers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) had earlier questioned whether there 
is a health care crisis, but he later said the health care system does have 
"serious problems" that need reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's assault on the health insurance industry drew support from an 
important ally, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee. He also had frustrated the White House by questioning the 
existence of a genuine health care crisis, although he later said he meant that 
while there is no health care crisis, there is a health insurance crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our insurance system is klutzy and complex and inadequate and incomplete" 
Moynihan said on CNN's "Evans and Novak" program, where he drew a distinction 
between the quality of health care and the shortcomings of health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan responded angrily when shown a television commercial put out by the 
Health Insurance Assn. of America that attacked "new mandatory government 
health alliances" that would require "tens of thousands of new bureaucrats" and 
create "another billion-dollar bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had a big profit-making enterprise which was making a lot of profits, 
you'd probably be able to pay for ads like that," Moynihan said. "It doesn't 
help. . . . They've got to watch that. . . . We're trying to do something 
decent. We're trying to do it without blaming anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan also contended that no one ever got elected on a platform of favoring 
insurance companies, "so maybe they can just ease off a bit. They ought to know 
better. If they don't, they'll find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan, who earlier stressed the importance of reforming the nation's 
welfare system more than health care, said Clinton had promised him a welfare 
reform bill that his committee can take up after Congress deals with health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan said he expects to have the welfare proposal by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in his radio remarks, said he will ask Congress to "revolutionize" 
the welfare system because it discourages work and destroys families. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those who depend on welfare, we should provide the support, the job 
training and the child care needed for up to two years," Clinton said. "But, 
after that, anyone who can work must work." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican response to Clinton's speech, Sen. Judd Gregg of New 
Hampshire contended that the Administration's health care proposal "demands 
that the American people become dependents, that we rely for our sustenance and 
our happiness on the self-congratulatory few who know better." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg said Republicans believe "that independence, not dependence, underlies 
the fundamental culture and strength of America." 
</P>
<P>
 The health care debate spread Saturday to the opening of the National 
Governors' Assn. winter meeting here, where Republican Gov. Carroll A. Campbell 
Jr. of South Carolina, the group's chairman, and Democratic Gov. Howard Dean of 
Vermont, the vice chairman, split on Clinton's pledge to veto any reform 
measure that does not include universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The line that Clinton drew in the sand will be wiped out by "a rising tide of 
consensus on how to get somewhere," Campbell said, contending that he had 
already detected flexibility on the requirement for universal coverage among 
other Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, on the other hand, said it is "critical" to have universal coverage. "I 
don't see the sense of trying to control the costs unless everybody's in the 
system," he said.

FEDERAL LAYOFFS LIKELY UNLESS BUYOUTS OKD; GOVERNMENT: INTERIOR, AGRICULTURE, 
TRANSPORTATION AND PERSONNEL AGENCIES ARE AT RISK FOR THOUSANDS OF JOB LOSSES. 
COSTS HOLD UP RETIREMENT INCENTIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At least four federal agencies will probably have to lay off thousands of 
employees this year unless Congress approves "buyouts" to speed voluntary 
departures, according to Clinton Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agriculture, Interior and Transportation departments and the Office of 
Personnel Management are at the most risk for reductions in force, or RIFs -- 
the government jargon for layoffs -- the officials said, primarily because of 
tight budgets this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration still hopes to avoid such layoffs, but pressure to hold 
down payroll costs will continue into next year. The budget for fiscal 1995, 
due out Feb. 7, will require at least three more agencies to reduce personnel 
levels, said Christopher Edley, associate director of the Office of Management 
and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Edley did not identify the seven agencies at risk but said: "If we don't get 
buyout legislation, RIFs are likely." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of RIFs has set off waves of anxiety inside the Administration. 
Officials said layoffs would undercut initiatives to reshape or streamline the 
bureaucracy, deplete the ranks of minorities, women and younger workers in the 
civil service and hurt morale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration had counted on being able to offer buyouts of up to $25,000 
in fiscal 1994, which ends Sept. 30, as an incentive to get workers to resign 
voluntarily or take early retirement. But the legislation stalled last year 
when the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost $519 million over 
the next five years, primarily because of increased costs to the federal 
pension system. 
</P>
<P>
 During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Bill Clinton pledged to cut 
the federal work force by 100,000 employees by the end of fiscal 1995. Clinton 
said it would be accomplished through attrition or voluntary departures. 
</P>
<P>
 The work force reduction goal was increased by another 152,000 employees last 
year after Vice President Al Gore completed a six-month performance review of 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 But attrition rates throughout the government have fallen to historic lows, 
partly because of the recent economic slump. In general, federal employees 
appear fearful of taking their chances in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, anticipating possible buyouts, older federal workers apparently 
decided to postpone retirement plans to see if they could obtain a better 
separation package. 
</P>
<P>
 As Tom Collier, the Interior Department chief of staff put it: "Talking about 
buyouts and not delivering is worse than not delivering. Our retirements have 
gone down dramatically."

10 ARRESTED IN FOOD STAMP CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 10 people were arrested Saturday while trying to profit from the 
emergency distribution of food stamps, federal investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests and seizure of "a significant amount" of cash and food stamps were 
made outside a food stamp distribution center at Broadway and Manchester Avenue 
in South-Central Los Angeles, according to Dave Dickson, the Department of 
Agriculture's regional inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
 The food stamps are in plentiful supply because they are being distributed to 
earthquake victims with few checks, prompting long lines and numerous reports 
of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrested Saturday were buying the stamps at a discount from recipients 
and planning to resell them to retailers at a profit, Dickson said. The 
retailers can redeem them at full value with the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickson said scam artists literally swarmed around people as they picked up 
their emergency food stamps. "We've had fistfights between (scam artists) 
trying to buy stamps," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trafficking in food stamps is a federal offense punishable by up to five years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The fraud rings operate somewhat like drug-selling operations, Dickson said. 
One person sits in a car, holding large quantities of cash, then runners are 
sent out to buy the food stamps for cash, generally for half their face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency earlier said it was suspending its earthquake emergency food stamp 
program for today to implement anti-fraud plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickson said the flood of food stamps on the market offers a "golden 
opportunity" for ripping off the system. "We're going to stop it," he said.

QUAKE-RELATED OIL SPILL'S IMPACT WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More oil from an earthquake-ruptured pipeline oozed into the Santa Clara River 
than initially believed, causing a deadly impact on the area's wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the carcasses of 65 oiled birds, reptiles and mammals have been found 
in the ecologically sensitive area.But biologists say many small birds such as 
finches, gnatcatchers, vireos and orioles that die from the oil by ingestion or 
hypothermia will fly away and not be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, larger birds of prey that feed on oiled fish or rodents or 
become sullied with oiled feathers often fly miles from the site before they 
are overcome with illness. 
</P>

 "This spill is having a greater effect on wildlife than the numbers of dead 
animals indicate," Bob Schlichting, a spokesman for the Department of Fish and 
Game, said Friday. "We may never get the numbers of all the affected birds.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FINAL TOLL MAY SHIFT, BUT PATTERN OF DEATHS IS 
EMERGING; DISASTER: PINPOINTING QUAKE-CAUSED FATALITIES IS DIFFICULT. SAN 
FERNANDO VALLEY RESIDENTS, MEN AND THOSE OVER 60 FARED THE WORST OVERALL.

<P>
 Nearly two weeks after the 6.6 magnitude earthquake rocked Los Angeles, the 
death toll keeps shifting. Did 57 people die? Sixty? Sixty-one? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of fire departments and hospitals out there playing coroner," 
said Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
"That's fine. They can say anything they want, but as far as we're concerned 
the official number is 57." 
</P>
<P>
 Although that number may rise or fall in the weeks ahead, a picture has begun 
to emerge of how death struck, and who, and where. For example, most victims 
were over 60. Most were men. And the vast majority -- 41 -- died in the San 
Fernando Valley, scene of a disastrous apartment building collapse that killed 
16. Heart attacks accounted for 22 deaths -- second only to injury-related 
fatalities, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabulating the death toll in a major calamity is anything but an exact 
science. Carrier points out that the death toll from the 1992 Los Angeles riots 
has been revised several times, and that only recently a more accurate number 
has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was first reported to the coroner's office that there were 61 riot-related 
deaths," Carrier said. "That number has since been reduced to 54." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the number of deaths tied to the Jan. 17 earthquake could change in 
the weeks and months ahead, he said. Some names may be pared as more is learned 
about their deaths, others could be added as overworked hospital staffs make 
tardy notifications to the coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 "And some may die months later from injuries they suffered," Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis of what is known so far about the 57 quake victims reveals: 
</P>
<P>
 * Thirty were over age 60. Only eight were under 25. The youngest victim was 
4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Twenty-nine died of injuries suffered in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Twenty-two died of heart attacks, 16 were over 60. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than half the victims -- 32 -- were men. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forty-two people died in the Valley, and nine in other parts of Los Angeles, 
including two in Hollywood. There were two deaths in Santa Monica and one each 
in Pico Rivera, Inglewood, Torrance and Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 41 victims were white, 11 were Latinos, four were Asian Americans and one 
was black. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming weeks, Carrier said, coroner's investigators will give 
particular scrutiny to cases involving heart attack victims. (On an average 
day, there are 33 heart attack fatalities reported in Los Angeles County. The 
total number of such deaths on the day of the quake has not yet been computed, 
Carrier said.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some people who died at the time of the earthquake, and we have some 
people who died an hour later," Carrier said. "We will have to sit down at a 
later time and make a determination if those really were earthquake-related. 
Some may have had a predisposed disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and friends of some heart attack victims, such as 90-year-old 
Marguerite Burlington of Reseda, have said that they were literally scared to 
death. Medical experts say this is entirely possible. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge adrenaline rush brought on by a frightening situation can affect the 
electrical fibers that generate a person's heartbeat, causing an irregular beat 
that can result in a heart attack, said Dr. Linda Demer, chief of cardiology at 
UCLA Medical Center. An adrenaline rush can also result in a coronary spasm, 
where the heart muscle squeezes down and closes off the artery, preventing the 
flow of blood, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first instance, death is immediate, whereas in the case of a coronary 
spasm, death may come later when a person is in the hospital, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So in a sense it is possible to be frightened to death," Demer said, adding 
that she was surprised that so many cardiac deaths were attributed to the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Demer said she plans to consult officials from the American Heart Assn. about 
putting together programs to help those who suffer from heart disease better 
prepare for the mental and emotional shock of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just as important to prepare psychologically as it is physically" for 
these types of situations, she said. "That's what we should be learning from 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Well over half of the quake victims died in a home, apartment or trailer. The 
largest number of deaths to occur at a single location was at the collapsed 
Northridge Meadows apartments, where 16 were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the total number of deaths in Los Angeles County stands at 57, some 
reports have put the number at 60 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Those added to some lists include two people, one of whom was the son of 
Dodgers announcer Vin Scully, who died in the crash of a helicopter doing a 
post-quake oil pipeline inspection in the Tejon Pass. But the deaths, which 
occurred when the helicopter apparently hit power lines, are not officially 
considered quake-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "That had nothing to do with the earthquake," said Helen Bruce Frankel, a 
nurse in the Kern County coroner's office. "We didn't count it. They do those 
pipeline inspections regularly." 
</P>
<P>
 Another death attributed in some reports to the quake involved an unidentified 
truck driver who died late Wednesday when his truck overturned on the 
transition road from Placerita Canyon Road to Sierra Highway, one of the 
detours around the shattered junction of the Golden State and Antelope Valley 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a traffic accident," Carrier said. "But that case may be reviewed. 
You could say that was indirectly related to the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino County officials also reported one death that may have been 
quake-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Brace, 37, of Rancho Cucamonga died while running to her baby's crib 
during the quake. It was first reported that Brace may have died when she 
tripped on a toy. But Deputy Coroner Gabriel Morales said fright as a cause of 
death, perhaps in the form of a massive adrenaline rush, is not being ruled 
out. Officials said it would take at least six weeks for test results to be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Simi Valley Hospital in Ventura County initially reported that 
Joseph John Makert, 62, had died of a quake-related heart attack, but later 
said that the quake may not have caused the death. 
</P>
<P>
 A relative of the victim, who was stricken about an hour after the quake while 
cleaning up his house, said last week that the family believed that the timing 
was coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among the 57 victims on the L.A. coroner's official list, there are 
questions about how some died. Officials are investigating the deaths of 
Evelynn B. Henson, 92, whose Chatsworth mobile home caught fire after the 
quake, and Lionel Ventura, 21, of Sun Valley, whose hospital respirator stopped 
functioning when electrical power was disrupted. The cause of death of four 
others has yet to be determined.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; LEGISLATORS HOPE TO REVIVE STATE QUAKE 
INSURANCE FUND KILLED LAST YEAR; POLITICS: SUPPORTERS ADMIT THE PROGRAM HAS 
FLAWS BUT SAY IT COULD HAVE PROVIDED L.A. HOMEOWNERS WITH $5,000 EACH AFTER 
NORTHRIDGE TEMBLOR. CRITICS SAY ONLY A NATIONWIDE PLAN CAN WORK.

<P>
 In the wake of the Northridge earthquake, several legislators hope to revive a 
short-lived state insurance fund to help homeowners repair earthquake-damaged 
homes in the future -- even as opponents insist that the state cannot afford 
such a program. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to re-create the fund comes a year after legislators urged by 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi concluded that the California Residential 
Earthquake Recovery Fund was bordering on insolvency and had to be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the only way such a program can work is to spread the costs 
nationwide by creating a federal coffer for all types of calamities, including 
hurricanes and tornadoes in the South, East and Midwest, and volcanoes and 
earthquakes in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the defunct California fund acknowledge that the program had flaws 
but say Los Angeles homeowners with damaged property could have received 
several thousand dollars each under the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It probably seemed like good politics at the time (to abolish it)," said 
Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose), who tried to keep the fund in place and 
Monday plans to introduce legislation reinstating it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel badly for the people who advocated the repeal of that program, but 
what we said will happen has happened," said Areias, who is chairman of an 
Assembly committee on earthquake safety. "They took the risk and we all lose." 
</P>
<P>
 If the earthquake fund had been in place when the Northridge temblor hit, 
Areias and other officials estimate, the fund would have contained about $350 
million. If 60,000 to 70,000 Los Angeles-area homeowners applied for coverage, 
they could have received checks for $5,000 or more each. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of a disaster fund, people whose homes were damaged are left to 
make claims against private insurance, if they had quake coverage, or seek 
loans from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The state also offers tax 
breaks for rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Gov. George Deukmejian pushed for the creation of the California 
Residential Earthquake Recovery Fund after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 
October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, officials were rushing to find ways of responding to the 
$7.9-billion damage in the San Francisco area, and the program won near 
unanimous support in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was envisioned, homeowners were supposed to pay $12 a year into the fund 
if they lived in areas where the risk of earthquakes is low, and $60 if they 
lived in high-risk areas. The payments would be made when they paid their 
homeowners insurance premiums. In exchange, the state promised to pay as much 
as $15,000 to owners of single-family houses for quake damage, with a $3,500 
deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Deukmejian viewed the fund as a supplement to private earthquake insurance 
policies, which commonly have deductibles of 10% of the policy's value. On a 
$200,000 policy, the homeowner must pay the first $20,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Areias said the legislation never promised to pay the full $15,000. All it 
guaranteed was a prorated share of whatever was in the fund. In the short time 
the program was in place, homeowners whose residences were damaged by quakes in 
1992 received $120 million in payments. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 7.6 quake in the Mojave Desert and the 6.7 quake in Big Bear in 
1992, 4,900 people from as far as Los Angeles and San Diego filed claims, and 
received checks averaging $6,439. The fund also was in place in April, 1992, 
when a 7.1 quake rocked Northern California. In all, 1,370 homeowners received 
money after that quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a godsend," said Pat Tomasini, who received checks totaling $13,000 
after her home in the Victorian town of Ferndale was destroyed by the April, 
1992, quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big, big help," added Tomasini, who has rebuilt. "It can pay for 
foundations, it can pay for a lot of things. When you have no house, you have 
no collateral. That ($13,000) is your security." 
</P>
<P>
 Areias blamed legislators from areas where the risk of quake damage is low for 
undermining the program. Their constituents did not want to pay the minimum $12 
annual premiums, he said. He also criticized Garamendi for not trying harder to 
make the program work. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was a state senator, Garamendi was among legislators who voted to 
create the fund. But when he became insurance commissioner and was faced with 
the prospect of administering the program, Garamendi began sounding warnings 
that the program was unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of his criticism was that the program promised more than it could 
deliver. In an interview after the Northridge quake, Garamendi called the 
program a "bait and switch" because of an implied promise that people who paid 
their premiums could have collected up to $15,000. The fund never could have 
paid everyone who was eligible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never, ever promise people something that you can't deliver. That is known as 
fraud," Garamendi said. "You tell people: 'Pay $60 a year, and the state will 
pay you up to $15,000,' and we only give you $2,000, that is a fraud. I would 
shut down an insurance company that did that, and go to the district attorney 
to get an indictment." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the program was flawed from the start. There was, he and other critics 
noted, no requirement that people who paid into the state fund also have 
private insurance policies. Nor was there a penalty for failing to pay into the 
fund, and fewer than half the homeowners in California did. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months before the fund was abolished, Garamendi offered several 
suggestions to the Legislature for ensuring that people made their payments, 
ranging from liens placed on the property to adding the fees to annual property 
tax bills. But many of the options had the ring of taxes, and as the memory of 
Loma Prieta faded, no politician wanted to be accused of supporting new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suggestions I made were totally ignored," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 He then worked to abolish the fund and found allies in Assemblyman Phillip 
Isenberg, an influential Democrat from Sacramento, one of the few big cities in 
the state where quake risks are low, and Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). 
Torres is considering running to succeed Garamendi as insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, those who worked to abolish the fund are relieved. The Northridge quake 
caused so much damage that it would have bankrupted the fund. These critics 
believe that Los Angeles-area homeowners would have made claims against the 
state's strained $40-billion general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think people are angry now, imagine their frustration with a 
government that promised them a policy, and there was no money in the fund," 
Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
 As homeowners pick up from the Northridge earthquake, Assemblywoman Juanita 
McDonald (D-Carson), chairwoman of the Assembly Insurance Committee, is 
planning to hold hearings soon on the question of insuring against quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Areias, who is running for state controller, is looking for support for 
reinstituting a recovery fund, although such a kitty would not cover damage 
from the Jan. 17 temblor. The San Jose Democrat said the recovery fund could be 
financed by mandatory $60-a-year payments per homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg, who does not want to reinstate the fund, said it would cost property 
owners about $1,000 a year to make the fund solvent -- much more than 
homeowners would be willing to pay. Given the high price of a recovery fund, 
Isenberg and other officials suggested a statewide ballot measure to determine 
whether the electorate is willing to fund it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want no or very low-cost complete coverage, with no tax increase, no 
cutting of other programs, a no-pain solution. I don't know how to do that," 
Isenberg said. "Any politician who claims he or she does is lying." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the bill dismantling the program, opposes 
re-creating the fund. The state cannot afford to cover the damage associated 
with a major quake, said Marjorie Berte, Wilson's insurance adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 "It needs to be handled on a national level," Berte said. 
</P>
<P>
 As high as the $30-billion damage estimates are for the Northridge temblor, a 
major quake on the San Andreas or other faults in the Oakland, San Francisco or 
Los Angeles areas could cause damage in excess of $50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Rep. Norm Mineta (D-San Jose) is carrying legislation to create 
a nationwide fund to cover losses from all types of natural disasters, 
including earthquakes, volcano eruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes and tsunamis. 
</P>
<P>
 Mineta's legislation would create a fund to supplement private earthquake 
insurance policies. Annual premiums would be $60 to $90, Mineta said. The 
system would be similar to the national flood insurance program, in which 
people who live or own businesses in flood plains are required to buy flood 
insurance and comply with building codes designed to limit flood damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mineta, who intends to hold hearings on the issue next month, said chances for 
passage "are relatively good." 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is immune from disasters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the California Seismic Safety Commission, Executive Director Tom Tobin said 
some type of recovery fund, either on the state or federal level, is an 
essential part of the state's earthquake preparedness plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin opposed the abolition of the California Residential Earthquake Recovery 
Fund. After seeing it operate in 1992, he said he was "absolutely surprised by 
how well it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't live my life in fear of the Big One," Tobin said, "but we do need 
options for recovery."

LEGAL WARRIORS IN BATTLE OVER CITY'S HOMELESS; COURTS: ATTORNEYS HARRY SIMON 
AND ROBERT WHEELER LINE UP ON OPPOSITE SIDES IN THE DISPUTE OVER LAWS GOVERNING 
THE HOMELESS IN SANTA ANA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a small, dreary courtroom, attorneys Harry Simon and Robert Wheeler have a 
bad case of litigious deja vu . 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, a Legal Aid Society of Orange County lawyer, and Wheeler, an assistant 
city attorney for Santa Ana, are arguing -- again -- about the plight of the 
homeless. They have bickered in prior battles, steps in a long war over Santa 
Ana's three separate legal attempts to push homeless out of the downtown Civic 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "These laws make being poor a criminal act," says Simon, 32, who has put 
countless hours into defending the rights of the homeless in civil court. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Wheeler, 52, takes his turn: "The city has an obligation to everyone in 
Orange County to make the Civic Center open, accessible and safe." 
</P>
<P>
 So goes the war of words in Santa Ana's ongoing fight to outlaw the homeless 
from sleeping on the city's streets. It's a battle closely watched by leaders 
in urban centers across California and beyond who are awaiting legal guidelines 
spelling out how far local governments can go in rousting street people, 
panhandlers and the dispossessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler won the latest round, when a Superior Court judge recently allowed 
police to begin citing people for setting up house at Civic Center Plaza, the 
concrete basin and maze of government buildings at Santa Ana's core that has 
drawn hundreds of homeless looking for shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 But both lawyers know this was just a minor skirmish in the ongoing dispute 
that has permeated their lives for much of the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon and Wheeler, two men in the same field but miles apart in beliefs and 
motivations, will meet again -- soon -- on their common ground, the courtroom.  
</P>
<P>
 To Simon, his position as the unassuming advocate for the people is a matter 
of conscience. "There's a part of me that says, 'My side makes logical sense, 
and theirs doesn't,' " he said last week over pizza at a Santa Ana restaurant. 
"Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to win -- law is 
interesting that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler is pragmatic. His client is the city government, and the city must do 
what's good for its law-abiding residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The government workers, lawyers and residents who use the Civic Center each 
day, he said, have rights, too: They are entitled to a public plaza that is 
clean and safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been aggressively panhandled, yelled at, seen bizarre behavior, (and) 
stepped around pools of urine," said Wheeler, sitting at a long table beside 
shelves of legal volumes in a City Hall library. 
</P>
<P>
 He smiles -- a sight as common as his button-down shirts and brown-rimmed 
glasses. "The ordinances are part of changing the atmosphere here, making it a 
better place." 
</P>
<P>
 But constitutional rights are at risk in the Civic Center, Simon insists. And 
constitutional law is his passion. Simon credits his persistent defense of 
constitutional rights to his father, a former newspaper reporter, history 
professor and activist who served on the Colorado Civil Rights Commission in 
the 1950s. Simon studied at the University of Colorado at Boulder and Hastings 
School of Law in San Francisco -- a city he enjoys for its generally liberal 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined Legal Aid -- a group of similar-minded advocates for those who can't 
afford $250-an-hour lawyers -- in 1988. That was after what Simon describes as 
a draining year in family law and a few disappointing months with a San 
Francisco law firm that specialized in First Amendment law and represented 
television talk show host Geraldo Rivera, the New York Times and other 
prominent clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County posed a meaty challenge for him. "I think America, and 
particularly Orange County, has trouble with discrimination based on poverty 
and class," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But "did I ever imagine I'd be Harry Simon, Lawyer for the Homeless?" asked 
Simon, who splits his time defending the homeless and the elderly. "No, not 
exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hoped to join the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights 
division in the 1980s, but when job interviewers asked his opinion of Ronald 
Reagan appointees Ed Meese and William Bradford Reynolds ("It was hard for me 
to find anything good to say"), Simon decided on public interest work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler, meanwhile, calls himself a moderate. Ideology -- whether conservative 
or liberal -- doesn't really motivate him, he said. Competing in court and 
arguing legal points are more his style. "I just love litigation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also relishes the chance to create precedent in the ordinances against 
camping in the urban center. "These are what lawyers call cutting-edge issues," 
Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 California has long been Wheeler's home -- he went to California Western 
School of Law in San Diego after studying in the early 1960s at UC Berkeley, 
where he eluded the liberalism that was taking root. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked by (people espousing the Free Speech movement) wearing my penny 
loafers and Madras shirts, with my fraternity brothers," Wheeler said. "The 
movement was just beginning . . . and didn't really affect me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler and Simon do have a few things in common -- persistence, for one, in a 
legal whirlpool that has seen other lawyers come and go. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon started defending transient clients in 1990, when several homeless 
people in Fullerton complained they got sick after the state sent out planes to 
dust the area with malathion. Blocked from sleeping in armories, homeless 
people were exposed during sprayings. Simon wrote a brief for the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Simon said, "I was dressed as I usually dress -- in jeans -- so I 
had reporters coming up to me asking if I was one of the homeless clients."  
</P>
<P>
 In the first case against Santa Ana, Simon and Legal Aid sued over the city's 
ordinance in 1992 that blocked people from "camping" on public land citywide. 
He lost in Superior Court and took the case to the 4th District Court of Appeal 
in November. The case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The police later started arresting people under a state Penal Code section 
barring lodging on public land. Simon helped prepare another lawsuit against 
Santa Ana, completing legal briefs just before leaving on his honeymoon in 
October. A judge will hear that case in about three months.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, City Council members passed a second anti-camping law, this time 
forbidding anyone from sleeping or cooking at the Civic Center. That's the case 
that sparked Legal Aid's third lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no talking to these guys," Simon said.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's enforcement doesn't deter him. His New Year's resolution: to keep 
suing the city officials until they relent. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Christopher Mears, who has represented several homeless clients in 
civil and criminal cases involving Santa Ana, called Simon the "linchpin" among 
lawyers defending the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the brightest and most meticulous civil rights lawyers I've ever 
met," Mears said. "He has a tireless belief in his position." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler also quietly but persistently heads the city's effort to remove the 
homeless, under the direction of City Atty. Edward J. Cooper. He works nights 
and weekends, preparing the city's cases and studying laws in other cities. 
Earlier this month, Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis said the latest 
camping ordinance that Wheeler drafted is likely to pass constitutional muster 
when it goes back to court later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A former assistant city attorney in Simi Valley, city attorney in the Bay Area 
town of Mountain View, and deputy district attorney in Monterey County, Wheeler 
said he especially enjoys municipal law.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana has paid the homeless more than $450,000 in settlements in recent 
years. Simon decries that the city has spent that money on enforcement efforts, 
rather than on shelters, but he doesn't blame Wheeler. "The thing about Bob is 
he's the kind of guy who no matter win or lose, he still enjoys it," Simon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler admits that he admires Simon too: "Harry Simon is an exceptionally 
good lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man likes to lose. But Simon takes it particularly hard because he 
worries about his clients. "It's hard to leave it behind some days, it really 
is," Simon said with a sigh. To Simon, affordable housing and health care are 
rational solutions to homelessness -- not prosecuting transients. He said he 
fears such ordinances may become a trend if Santa Ana wins its court battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lose this litigation, there's going to be a rush on to do this 
everywhere," Simon said. "Who wants to be the last city on their block to have 
homeless people?"

BITTERSWEET NOSTALGIA; HOUSING GAINS DISBANDED MUCH OF SANTA ANA'S BLACK 
COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOREEN CARVAJAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the walls of Mr. B's barbershop are hundreds of fading photos of customers 
whose satisfied smiles pay tribute to the head barber's mastery of naturals and 
bone cuts, flattops and fades. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy (Mr. B.) Kirby still savors the sweet memory of when those clients lined 
up 20 deep in the morning chill outside his shop to wait for a clip or banged 
on his front door to beg for a razor cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Today he and his son, "Dollar Bill" Kirby Jr., linger late in the mid-morning, 
patiently awaiting the arrival of the first $12 haircut. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby's warm, welcoming smile masks a certain wistfulness; his community of 
African Americans is vanishing and he knows it simply by looking beyond his 
striped barber's pole. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s and into the 1970s, Bristol Street was a solid invisible 
border that hemmed Orange County's black population into a Santa Ana 
neighborhood of pastel bungalows and cottages variously nicknamed "Little 
Texas" or "the Rock." 
</P>
<P>
 The color line was guarded by the gatekeepers of real estate agents and police 
officers who held the border against black residents foolish enough to rent a 
house, order a vodka tonic or cruise down a traffic circle in the wrong 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 By necessity, the segregated Santa Ana neighborhood became the cultural hub 
for black Orange County residents, bound together by churches, clubs, 
barbershops, beauty salons, and barbecue restaurants with the smoky tang of 
Texas -- the home state for many black migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were more together than we are now," remembered Kirby, 55, a tall, lean, 
former Texan himself whose shaven head is covered by a brimmed hat. "There's no 
black neighborhood any more. There's 44,000 blacks in Orange County, but 
they've scattered all over. I remember when it was fun. We had two or three 
black nightclubs and people running for City Council. We had community meetings 
to discuss how to help our own people." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside his window, clubs like the Greasy Spoon and Sneaky Pete's have given 
way to a gleaming, flat-roofed shopping strip with offices labeled Clinica 
Medica. The Ghetto Record Shop, a Santa Ana institution specializing in gospel, 
jazz, funk and blues music, watched its customer base shift from an equal mix 
of black and Latino customers to a Latino majority. The trim bungalows and 
blooming rose bushes are tended by Latino families instead of the black 
residents who planted the garden patches decades ago.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the friendly rivals -- the barbers at Kelly's, Baxter's and Emily's 
-- who would meet with Kirby most mornings for a cup of coffee and scissors 
solidarity. And gone are the black doctors and lawyers and teachers who began 
moving out as fair housing laws opened the borders of new neighborhoods in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the shop that continued the smoky dynasty of Shaw's barbecue moved out of 
Santa Ana last summer -- to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The exodus of Santa Ana's historic black settlement has been building steadily 
since the the opening of housing opportunities in response to federal and state 
laws and pressure by local groups. While the population of blacks in Orange 
County has continued to grow, Santa Ana has been losing its share since the 
1970s when the number of black residents crested at more than 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1980, the city's proportion of the county's black population had dwindled 
by almost half and that decline continued through 1990, dropping again by 
almost 20% to 7,594. The black student population in the Santa Ana Unified 
School District also peaked in the mid-1970s at nearly 10% and steadily dropped 
to 1.5% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ghetto is a thing of the past," said Lawrence B. de Graaf, a professor of 
history at Cal State Fullerton. "Once Santa Ana was a bastion of racism and 
exclusion, but by 1980 the population was dissipating to every corner in the 
county. And that continues to be a trend. That looks very positive, but it also 
has a deeper dimension. There's a lack of a single community of African 
Americans here. From an integration point, there is something culturally and 
emotionally missing." 
</P>
<P>
 The history of Santa Ana's black community dates back to 1885 when a groom 
named Willis K. Duffy built a home in Santa Ana and later a reputation for 
himself as the barbecue king of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1920s, black home buyers were able to buy spacious, wooded lots in the 
southwest section of Santa Ana because whites were willing to sell properties 
to blacks in areas where neighbors did not live close by. The community grew 
along Bristol Street between 2nd and 4th streets, now Santa Ana Boulevard, and 
spread north and west. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson Chapel, an African Methodist Episcopal church with a trim steeple 
still rising along north Bristol Street, was the anchor of the neighborhood and 
a variety of black institutions blossomed nearby that drew the community 
together like a bright bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be the good old days," remembered Angie Madden, who grew up in the 
Santa Ana neighborhood and still comes here from Anaheim on Sundays to worship 
at the Gospel Light Church of God in Christ, one of nearly 10 black churches in 
the city. "There was a closeness of people. It was like a family. You did 
things together. And if anything happened, the word would get out fast and 
everybody would support you. It was a community and we all came together." 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, Jim Huff, the owner of the Ghetto Record store, could keep his 
shop open until 2 a.m when he would have to shoo out the young customers. 
Ninety-two-year old Leginia Gardner's entire world revolved around Johnson's 
Chapel, which now has a congregation dominated by commuter members from outside 
Santa Ana. J.J. King couldn't walk down the broad sidewalks without greeting 
somebody he knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fondest memories are of when we were all working together on a political 
campaign," said King, who left Santa Ana for Irvine. "We were trying to elect a 
school board member and the whole community was together. We sold food. We did 
a lot of letter writing. We rented equipment and had billboards. We were 
Democrats in a strong Republican bastion and we had to do it for survival." 
</P>
<P>
 But his nostalgia for the past is balanced by realism. The community's 
intimacy was imposed. With the borders closed, there was no where else to go. 
</P>
<P>
 When King returned from a stint in Vietnam with the Marines, he came to Orange 
County in the 1960s in search of a home to buy. "I was trying to find a place 
for my family and I wanted my daughter to go to a good school. I wanted to be 
part of the community. And when I went out to look for houses with a real 
estate agent, they would always come back to Santa Ana. We all knew what was 
going on. It was a gentleman's agreement among the agents." 
</P>
<P>
 It was just one of many informal social codes that everyone knew without 
reading a rule book. The Bristol Garden Club didn't serve cocktails to black 
customers in the lounge, but they could buy beer at a take-out window. Expect 
delays on certain well-traveled Orange County roads where a black man would be 
stopped by police officers who asked certain basic "traffic" questions: What 
are you doing? Where are you going? 
</P>
<P>
 Barber Billy Kirby said the humiliations he has suffered through the years 
still makes his stomach ulcer ache. He said he remembers when police escorted 
him off the property of his newly purchased house in Santa Ana after white 
neighbors called to protest that he was lurking around the property. Kirby said 
the police told him to return when he had the documents proving the sale had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Kirby said he felt the fury of his stomach ulcer. He said he 
was driving through Orange when he noticed a police officer trailing him. For 
17 miles, he said he was followed until the officer stopped him and asked a 
pointed question: "Where are you going?"  
</P>
<P>
 "By coming from the South," said Kirby, "I knew how to act. You just had to be 
humble. I was raised to cope with prejudice. It didn't bother me too much 
because when you're programmed or brainwashed or scared, you just take it all 
like an average person. Lot of people go to mental institutions, but black 
people have been wronged so long until you accept it. You don't like it, but 
you accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1970s, the Orange County Fair Housing Council and other local 
institutions had started to move to battle red-lining and illegal attempts to 
exclude black residents from other neighborhoods. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 
made housing discrimination a federal offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, some of the leaders in the movement to open up housing to black 
home buyers knew it might mean the demise of their cohesive community. Back 
then, J.J. King was a member of the NAACP and a participant in the Fair Housing 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost our power base," King said. "A lot of our people could afford to move 
to better houses. The doctors, the lawyers, the administrators, the teachers -- 
they were able to move. And once they got away from the fight, they took off 
their packs and started enjoying life like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 "What would have happened if it hadn't changed?" King asked. "We would still 
be down in that area. The change is for the better. It's up to us to make 
things happen in the city that we live in. I worked very hard to get out of 
there." Dwindling Black Population 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, two of every three blacks in the county lived in Santa Ana. Ten years 
later, that proportion was down to one in three and it now stands at about one 
in five.

DANA PARSONS: CAN THE GROWING PAINS OF SMALL-TOWN BREA BE CURBED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hell growing up. People make you do all kinds of things you don't want to 
do and that you don't think you need to do. Sometimes it makes you wonder 
whether it's worth growing up at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Like almost every Southern California town you could think of in the past 30 
years, Brea is going through some of that. With only 33,000 people, it's still 
small enough, says a longtime resident, that parents learn through the 
grapevine if their kids get into even minor trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 But that population figure is somewhat deceiving. It is nearly double what it 
was in 1970. In fact, Brea's population jumped 50% during the 1970s, as first 
the Orange Freeway and then the Brea Mall brought people and potential to the 
sleepy little town tucked against the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of growth spurt seldom comes problem-free. A couple weeks ago, what 
seemed like a simple little debate over a parking ordinance may have offered a 
glimpse of the seismic shifts taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea has always prided itself on its small-town atmosphere. And as in 
virtually every small town in America, the guiding civic philosophy is that 
townspeople don't like to be bothered by City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, for years in Brea, City Hall has pretty much left its residents alone 
when it came to having their cars parked outside their homes. They had to have 
a permit for cars that weren't kept in garages or in the driveways overnight, 
but the permits were free. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the city wants to charge for the permits and perhaps limit the number of 
cars that can be parked on the street. Some residents are furious. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the furor is over the money -- the latest figure is $20 a year, 
although it was first mentioned to be as high as $80. But the unhappiness goes 
beyond dollars and cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the justification behind limiting the cars on the streets is that, 
well, Brea could stand a little touch-up job. Sort of improve the look of the 
place, wink wink. 
</P>
<P>
 To many residents, that sounds rather condescending. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing with Brea is, they think they're Beverly Hills," says 21-year-old 
Cammie Holman, who grew up in the house she and her husband are sharing with 
her parents. The town's whole thrust in recent years, she said, has been to 
prettify the place, whether residents want it or not. She speaks with mild 
disdain for some of the outdoor sculpture that adorns new buildings around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 The four people in her household own 10 vehicles, she said -- most of them 
older models. If the parking ordinance goes through, she said, they won't be 
able to get enough permits to cover all the vehicles. "The whole thing is, it's 
just really a pain," she says of the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if her family's person-to-vehicle ratio is higher than most residents', 
it isn't uncommon in car-conscious California for couples with teen-age 
children, for example, to have several cars and not enough space for them. And 
while some of the county's communities wouldn't stand for the thought of having 
cars out on the streets overnight, Brea never seemed to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it does, and if it passes the ordinance before it, residents could be 
subject to stiff fines for violating the parking limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents see it as class warfare. One resident told council members 
recently they would have "a revolution on your hands" if they passed the 
ordinance. Another said, "I don't care what you do here in Brea, you're not 
going to turn it into Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
 I talked to a longtime resident, a realtor who over the last generation has 
raised a family in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first moved here, the Orange Freeway was not even in," he said. "So 
things have changed a great deal. Redevelopment has really changed the city. 
It's commercialized the whole city, and right now that's what it is, mostly a 
commercial city. I think it's lost some of its small-town flavor." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked whether Brea even wants to be a small town anymore. "It is a small 
town, population-wise," he said. "In Brea, they've tried harder to keep it than 
in other places, and people seem to get involved more here than in other 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a town that still has a large potential for physical growth, he told 
me, "I think the business community has pretty well overpowered the regular 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 When the council votes on the permit issue sometime in February, it may 
discuss it in municipal revenue terms. Or in city-beautification terms. Or in 
property value terms. 
</P>
<P>
 That will fall on deaf ears to many residents, however, who didn't sign any 
stinking covenants like their neighbors in Irvine or Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoot, they'll say, Our cars have looked just fine parked outside our houses 
for years. What are you busting our chops now for?  
</P>
<P>
 And then someone will tell them it's all about growing up, about dressing up. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll find out soon whether Brea residents think growing up is worth the 
price.

HOME INVASION ROBBERS CAST A WIDER NET; CRIME: PERPETRATORS AND VICTIMS HAVE 
TYPICALLY BEEN ASIAN, BUT NOW GANGS ARE BECOMING LESS SELECTIVE AND TARGETS 
INCLUDE WHITES, LATINOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a Friday afternoon last October, two attackers forced their way into the 
Westminster home of a 79-year-old woman, tied her up with an electrical cord 
and stuffed a ball of yarn into her mouth before ransacking her home and 
stealing her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 The brazen crime was similar to hundreds of other "home invasion" robberies 
reported in Orange County over the past five years, the vast majority of which 
have been committed by Asian gangs, police say. But in this crime, there was 
one difference: The victim was not Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, police say, gangs have almost always preyed on fellow Asians, 
capitalizing on cultural and language barriers that keep many victims from 
going to police. But authorities warn that the attack on the 79-year-old white 
woman, and others like it, may signal that robbers are widening the range of 
their targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gangs are starting to get less selective," said Westminster Police 
Detective Mark Nye, a specialist on Asian gangs. "Wherever the money is, that's 
where they are going to go." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been several other incidents in the past seven months in which 
non-Asians have been terrorized in their homes, reportedly by Asian gang 
members. Two of the robberies occurred in Westminster and one in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Home invasions have been most common in Westminster, Garden Grove and Santa 
Ana, which have sizable Asian populations. At least 150 of the attacks have 
been reported in those three cities since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But home invasion robberies have also been reported in Anaheim, Buena Park, 
Costa Mesa, Cypress, Dana Point, Irvine, La Habra, Orange, Seal Beach and Yorba 
Linda in the same time period. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that there may actually be many more home invasion 
robberies than the number reported. Police say that such crimes often go 
unreported because some Asians harbor a mistrust of police that may stem from 
experiences with authorities in their native countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gangsters I've talked to say they are targeting victims they know aren't 
going to report the crime," Nye said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other victims remain silent because of fear of retaliation by the attackers, 
who often threaten to come back and kill family members if they report the 
crime, Nye said. Other victims, police said, may be involved in illegal 
gambling or might be operating a business illegally out of their home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police also say copycat home invasions have begun to show up around the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, Seal Beach experienced what is believed to be its first home 
invasion robbery when three robbers, one carrying an Uzi submachine gun and 
another a semiautomatic weapon, forced their way into a home. Both the robbers 
and the victims in this case were white, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana and Costa Mesa, there have been at least five recent cases of 
home invasion robberies committed by Latinos against other Latinos, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these people might be learning the crime from Asian gangsters in 
prison or maybe they've seen it on television," Nye said. "I think now we are 
going to be seeing more non-Asian victims and there will be more attention 
focused on this crime, because these victims might speak out more." 
</P>
<P>
 In Garden Grove, the number of home invasions peaked in 1991, when 58 were 
reported. But the number declined dramatically in following years. In 1992, 
there were 17 home invasions reported, and last year there were just 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the gang members are starting to learn that their crime carries a 
fairly stiff penalty as opposed to doing other kinds of crimes," said Bruce 
Davis, an officer with the Garden Grove gang unit. "It's just not worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster, which does not keep annual statistics on home invasions, there 
have been approximately 35 to 40 attacks since 1991, said Detective Mike 
Proctor. 
</P>
<P>
 While Asian gangsters have typically targeted upper-income areas, the home 
invasions involving Latino gunmen have not occurred in wealthy neighborhoods, 
said Santa Ana Police Cpl. Futi Semanu, who works with the department's gang 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to commit home invasions in lower-income areas, hoping the 
residents have something of value," Semanu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proctor, who investigates home invasion robberies, said the spread of home 
invasion robberies to non-Asian victims is not a totally unexpected 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gangs had previously gone from only committing residential burglaries on 
Asians to burglarizing anyone," Proctor said. "We knew that eventually they 
would start robbing non-Asian families. They don't change their (method of 
operation), just their victims." 
</P>
<P>
 The robberies, which police have dubbed "home invasions" because of the 
military-style precision with which they are planned and executed, were first 
reported in Orange County in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical attack, gangsters force their way in, tie up and brutalize family 
members -- often sexually assaulting the women and beating the men -- before 
escaping with money, jewelry and other valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 The robberies are often well-planned. Attackers find out all they can about 
the house, the residents and the kinds of valuables inside the home. Some even 
study floor plans of the house and conduct surveillance before carrying out the 
attack, Nye said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may know one or more of the victims personally," Nye said. "It might be 
an ex-boyfriend or girlfriend, a casual acquaintance and maybe even a roommate. 
It could be an inside job." 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers use a variety of approaches to gain access to a home. One of the 
most common methods is to send a female gang member to knock on the door and 
make contact with the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "She will look very innocent and ask for someone who lives in the house. Then 
the others will rush in behind her," Nye said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Attackers have also followed business owners home and attacked them there. 
Merchants in Westminster's Little Saigon have been targets more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, a Costa Mesa family that owns a jewelry store in Little Saigon 
was robbed of $20,000 in cash and jewelry after five masked men with 
semiautomatic weapons burst into their home. It was the second time in four 
years that the family had been robbed at gunpoint inside their home. 
</P>
<P>
 But other approaches have been used as well. Two weeks ago, Proctor said a 
robber came to the front door of a woman's Westminster home carrying a package 
and dressed in what looked like a deliveryman's uniform. When a woman opened 
the door to sign for the package, the attacker pulled out a gun and forced his 
way into the home. 
</P>
<P>
 While police concede that it is often difficult to make arrests in home 
invasion attacks, Garden Grove officials said they have been having more 
success in recent years in identifying suspects. Detective Dale Walker said 
they identified suspects in 10 of the 14 home invasion robberies in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Nye said he would like to see legislation passed which would make home 
invasion robberies a federal offense like carjacking. Foiling Home Invasions 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of home invasion robberies have been committed in Orange County 
during the past five years. How to prevent becoming a victim:

<P>
 With little regard for the artificial boundaries of wealth and race, the Jan. 
17 earthquake left in its wake a swath of equal opportunity devastation, 
forcing San Fernando Valley residents from all backgrounds to pick up their 
possessions and their lives and begin to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sylmar man, already out of work, was left homeless when his trailer toppled 
from its foundation. A Sherman Oaks couple fled their hillside house, which 
slid down the hill and will take months to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 A grandmother in Pacoima, too afraid to sleep in her cracked house, now lives 
out of her garage and spends her days trying to generate more government 
assistance for her neighborhood. And a Northridge businessman, who left 
South-Central Los Angeles after his liquor store was burned to the ground in 
the 1992 riots, is struggling to replace thousands of dollars in merchandise 
lost in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are their stories -- universal, yet unique -- as they try to recover: 'I 
Can Go In . . .But I Feel Safer Outside' 
</P>
<P>
 Camping used to be a pastime for Lucy Perez. That is, until Jan. 17, when it 
abruptly became a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 The longtime Pacoima resident darted out of her Pinney Street home soon after 
the Northridge earthquake hit, afraid the walls would crumble down around her. 
Since then, Perez, 68, has stepped back in only to pick up some belongings, 
sweep up broken glass and use the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two weeks, Perez, her oldest son and two of her teen-age 
grandsons, have been living outside, first in tents in the front yard and now 
in the garage in back. 
</P>
<P>
 A propane-powered stove lent by a friend functions as the kitchen, and canned 
baked beans and eggs are often the only things on the menu. Her son sleeps in a 
chair; her two grandsons make do with a sleeping bag and a roll-away bed. Two 
plastic tarps pinned together constitute the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not what she's used to, but Perez, a widow, refuses to go back to indoor 
living, even though a building inspector has pronounced her house safe by 
taping a green tag to the porch window. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I can go in there and live," she said, using a stick to poke at 
yard-long cracks running along the walls of the one-story concrete-and-stucco 
home, "but I feel safer outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, what remains inside is only a fractured reflection of what had 
been -- 25 years of memories ransacked by Mother Nature in just 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 As in so many homes throughout the San Fernando Valley, items once perched on 
shelves and walls now litter the floor in pieces that cannot be reassembled. 
Odds and ends of china and crystal that Perez had displayed in a hutch don't 
exist any longer. Even photographs did not escape unscathed, because stray 
pictures that fell to the floor were overrun by the chocolate milk that spilled 
out of the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes the loan Perez recently took out to remodel her house a 
bitter irony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought when we got the money and started fixing the house, my house was 
going to look good," she said, shaking her head. "But now, no way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't given myself a chance to cry. . . . I'm too strong for that. If I 
shed tears over things that are broken, it's not going to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Perez, a slight woman with a wizened face who is not afraid to speak 
her mind, has channeled whatever sorrow she feels in the wake of the temblor 
into anger, directed mostly at a disaster-relief system she accuses of leaving 
behind poor neighborhoods like hers in favor of affluent communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's this area, right here, isolated. Its name is Pacoima," she said, 
gesturing with her hands for emphasis. "We're suffering just as much over here, 
if not more." 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by her indignation, Perez has gone knocking on the doors of elected 
officials and banded together with neighbors to express outrage at what they 
feel to be unfair treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is a short-term struggle, Perez realizes, something to ensure that 
she doesn't end up waiting again for hours in a line only to receive one liter 
of water and four pieces of bread, as happened during those first days. To 
rebuild her house and her life, she has applied for a Federal Emergency 
Management Agency loan, but Perez -- a nurse's aide who has lived on Social 
Security and disability payments for several years -- is not optimistic that 
she will receive one. 
</P>
<P>
 And if not, "I don't know what the next step is," she said with a sigh. But 
after a quarter of a century there on Pinney Street, "I'm not thinking of 
running away. I'd rather stay right here where I am," she said -- even if her 
home will have to remain her garage. 'My God. . . It Could Have Been Me' 
</P>
<P>
 For 17 years, Steve and Barbara Sadd gambled with Mother Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, they nearly lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The killer quake shook the Sadd's house on stilts like custom paint being 
mixed in a blender, jiggling the foundation 10 inches down the Sherman Oaks 
hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the beam-and-pole bungalow, a door came unhinged and furniture flew 
when the quake hit, forcing the couple to crawl to safety over their lives' 
collection of valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a piece of popcorn bouncing on the bed," recalled Barbara Sadd. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too soon to tell how much it will cost the Sadds in time, money and new 
furnishings to make their house -- which building inspectors have deemed unsafe 
to enter -- a home again. Before they can return and assess damage to the 
interior, the foundation needs to be repaired and reinforced. 
</P>
<P>
 But life was good for the Sadds before the quake, and for the most part it 
still is. 
</P>
<P>
 They are hopeful that their earthquake insurance will cover the cost to repair 
the foundation, which could exceed $60,000. In the meantime, the couple plan to 
wait out the renovations in West Los Angeles, where they rented a house the day 
of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Sadd, a Century City attorney, remained determined to return to the 
hills of Sherman Oaks this past week, even as aftershocks continued to jostle 
his house while workers prepared to pull it back up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss being in the hills," said Sadd, just moments after a 4.5 aftershock 
jolted him as he stood outside his house. "Earthquakes aside, there's a certain 
serenity that this home has had for me for 17 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sadds said they will go home with the realization that some things will 
never be the same. Many of their neighbors' homes were damaged in the quake, 
and some of them do not plan to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll miss them," Barbara Sadd said of her fleeing neighbors. "But I think 
life will be better in other ways because the earthquake gave us a heightened 
appreciation for what we have." 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, the couple will have to deal with their insurers, 
possibly apply for a FEMA loan, and, they hope, begin cleaning up the mess of 
furniture and glass that awaits them inside their house. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet possibly most haunting for the couple will be the constant reminder of 
what could have been. Their home perches beneath the bluff where another 
hillside home collapsed during the quake, killing 4-year-old Amy Tyre-Vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I go by, I look up there," Barbara Sadd said. "It was such a 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a tragedy that reminded Steve Sadd of the delicate balancing act being 
played out between nature and architecture for him and his neighbors, who defy 
the force of gravity in exchange for their breathtaking views of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing the demise of Tyre-Vigil's home, Sadd said he was struck by his 
own mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God, (my house) could have come off the poles," he said. "It could have 
been me." 'I'm Probably a Bad-Luck Person' 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of the earthquake, merchant Daniel K. Whang arrived at his 
Northridge liquor store and was met with a scene of utter devastation -- for 
the second time in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean immigrant had viewed the Valley as a refuge from destruction when 
he moved his business here after the Los Angeles riots, leaving behind the 
burned-out hulk of his South-Central Los Angeles market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably a bad-luck person," the Glendale resident said, with a smile 
that belies his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Whang moved his business to Balboa Boulevard over a year ago because he could 
not meet the tough conditions required by the city of Los Angeles to reopen his 
liquor store. He's hoping to open a coin-operated laundry at the South-Central 
site.  
</P>
<P>
 The 41-year-old businessman was just getting settled in when the earthquake 
savaged the store and destroyed nearly $90,000 in inventory. At 8 that morning, 
he arrived to find smashed bottles everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on a box in his store, Whang points to all the things he must repair: 
the windows, a refrigeration system, his store signs. "Just replacing the 
coolant costs $500. . . . Everything costs money," he sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the Small Business Administration had authorized a $251,000 
riot-recovery loan for Whang to build the laundry. Now he faces another 
protracted loan-application process to fix his Valley store and replenish its 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the staggering financial blows they have suffered, Whang said he 
and his family are optimistic about getting their derailed lives back on track. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Life has a cycle," he said. "One time is a good time, next is bad. Probably 
the next one coming is a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Whang could not have predicted the roller-coaster ride his life would become 
when he first emigrated from Seoul, South Korea, in 1982. Within months, the 
former civil engineer opened his first business, a grocery store, in 
South-Central. Three years later, the immigrant sold the business to buy a 
liquor store at 89th and San Pedro streets. Whang's first brush with tragedy 
came when his business partner, who also was a distant relative, was shot and 
killed in May, 1986, in an apparent robbery attempt at another store. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the next two years were prosperous ones. With their annual income 
inching into the six-digit range, Daniel and Cindy Whang moved to a modest, 
wood-frame house in Glendale, where they live with their children, Janet, 14, 
and Andrew, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 But now they face a difficult month. Just last week, according to Whang, the 
SBA told him the second installment of his riot loan would be delayed because 
most of the SBA staff is busy helping victims of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in his favor are an increase in business since the earthquake and the 
ability to begin replenishing his stock using credit extended by his supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as early as Tuesday, Whang must pay out a total $13,000 in loan 
payments on his store, his home and an apartment building he owns, and for 
repairs to one of the quake-damaged apartment units. And, by the end of 
February, Whang must start repaying his SBA riot loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next month, I will have no money," he said. 'It Was Like Hell Here That Day' 
</P>
<P>
 What a lost job and a lousy economy started, the earthquake finally finished: 
Joaquin Morales, a 29-year-old man -- equal parts resilient, upbeat and just 
plain tough -- is homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Monday before last, Morales lived at the Tahitian Mobile Home Park 
in Sylmar, where he paid $400 a month for a room in a mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 4:31 a.m., the ground shook, knocking trailers off foundations and 
breaking gas lines, which ignited fires throughout the block-long park. In the 
end, nearly a quarter of the park's 236 homes had burned to the ground and most 
of the rest were heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like hell here that day," Morales said last week, on his first visit 
to the park since the earthquake. "There were fires. No lights or phones. . . . 
Water flooding the street. Everyone was screaming. It was bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after the quake, Morales is one of hundreds of quake refugees who 
live in a Red Cross shelter at the San Fernando Recreation Center. Though he 
has never had much money, this is the first time Morales has been without a 
place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to living on my own, so this is hard," he said, nervously folding 
and unfolding a newspaper. "But hopefully, this won't last too long." 
</P>
<P>
 He has taken the bus to apply for jobs at car dealerships and thinks he has a 
good shot. Now he is waiting for a call back on one of the recreation center's 
office phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Morales tries to keep busy. He sits on his cot, reading the 
newspaper several times each day. He helps shelter officials do everything from 
looking after children to performing cleanup chores. But mostly, he watches 
people leave: During his stay, the population of the shelter has dwindled from 
more than 2,000 to fewer than 200 as the luckier ones have returned to homes 
that have been declared safe. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Jan. 17 quake hit, Morales had been wide awake, trying to get back to 
sleep. He didn't get up until the trailer had slipped off its foundation and 
crashed to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, he heard small explosions, as ammunition stored in neighboring homes 
went off and gas mains ignited. All over the park, he listened as people 
screamed in terror. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with others, Morales rushed to shut off the gas, checked on several 
neighbors and helped firefighters battle several blazes that were leaping from 
home to home. 
</P>
<P>
 He left when there was nothing else he could do. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his home was spared by the fire, it did shift about 2 feet to the 
right and crash to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten seconds of intense shaking caused about $7,000 damage and has made the 
30-foot-long mobile home uninhabitable -- two weeks later, it still leans badly 
to the right. Both doors are jammed shut. Inside, toilets came off their 
moorings. The stereo fell and smashed. Nothing is where it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 While several residents of the Tahitian Mobile Home Park have been able to 
move back into their homes, many, including Morales, are still homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales however, has managed to take it in stride. This is, after all, not his 
first disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, he lost his job when his car broke down and he was unable to 
get to the Simi Valley auto dealership where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a car, he was unable to find work, and when it became clear the car 
was beyond repair, Morales sold it to a scrap yard for $110 to help pay his 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been some two months," Morales said. "I don't have anything except for a 
few clothes, because I can't get back inside." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Morales -- ever upbeat -- quickly turns away from such dark thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to make it OK. . .. If I get this job. . . . and with the (FEMA 
aid), I'll be back on the road again. All I need is a job."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SHATTERED AMERICANA; DAMAGE IN QUAINT DOWNTOWN 
FILLMORE MAY BE TOO GREAT TO OVERCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY and SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They have been the backbone of Fillmore for decades. Passing their shops from 
father to son, they have kept main street alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Together they have preserved a slice of small-town Americana so pleasant that 
movie crews flock there to recapture an era lost to tract homes and shopping 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with their grit tested to the limit, some business owners on downtown 
Fillmore's Central Avenue say they don't know if they can ever recoup what they 
lost two weeks ago in the most devastating earthquake in Ventura County 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of this small oil-and-farm town say the city has the pluck to bounce 
back from $250 million in damage. But Fillmore is a town in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like losing family," said gun shop owner Gary Creagle. "People are 
already coming up to me and saying, 'We miss downtown. What are we going to do 
without downtown.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The shock of the Jan. 17 quake is wearing off, and merchants are facing a 
reality harsher than they thought possible just two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are discouraged," said Creagle, a former mayor. "Reality is setting 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffeted day-to-day by engineering reports that are ever gloomier, shopkeepers 
who spoke confidently of reconstruction a week ago, are now wondering if they 
can afford to rebuild at a cost of $200,000 to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the quake, Central Avenue was a bustling main street. Shoppers often 
had to drive the block five times to find a parking spot. But profits were 
never large. And many building owners say adding new reconstruction loans on 
top of old mortgages does not make economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of half a dozen buildings with 14 shops -- nearly all built of brick 
and mortar between 1910 and 1925 -- say they will tear down their structures 
and not rebuild. They say they are too old to start from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of Central Avenue's 55 merchants say they don't know where they 
will end up in the months to come. Nearly half of their shops are red-tagged as 
being too dangerous to enter. Most of the rest are marked unsafe. A high 
mesh-wire fence keeps the public away. Visitors wear hard hats to survey the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are finding out it's too expensive to rebuild. So it's like, 'Mark us 
red. We're outta here,' " said Janet Foy, whose flower shop has little damage, 
but whose neighbors are increasingly distraught. "We've heard a few more 
negative things. Today has been a bad day." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as merchants mourned their losses and pondered reconstructions that 
do not pencil out, they said they love their small town and don't want to go 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 They like the fact that they graduated from the same high school as their 
grandfathers, that their moms jerked sodas at Clough's drug store and that the 
all-male Fillmore Club is reputed to have met for cards and meals at a 
second-story Central Avenue walk-up every second Monday of every month since 
World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 And some merchants said they are certain Fillmore -- destroyed by fire in 
1903, swamped by flood in 1928, rocked by at least three strong earthquakes 
this century -- will ride out its latest catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the flood, and we had a real depression. We had rationing and price 
controls. So we'll stay in business," said Harvey Patterson, 74, who began to 
work in his father's Central Avenue hardware store at the age of 10. His own 
daughter plans to one day take over the family business. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as search-and-rescue crews entered cracked buildings to retrieve 
valuables last week, some merchants showed a resiliency that they say will 
bring Fillmore through its current trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Foy is selling flowers and Patterson is peddling hardware out of their stores' 
back doors. Double Deal is handing out pizzas in its alleyway. Grocer Jesse 
Segovia moved into a storefront across the street from his battered 83-year-old 
market and struggles on. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Aparicio moved his tax business back into his house, and Darrell Garner 
relocated his plumbing store to a different shop away from downtown. Other 
merchants retrieved their goods and pondered a city offer to set up storefronts 
out of trailers or tents in a park next to Central Avenue. 'The Show' 
</P>
<P>
 Locals call the 77-year-old Fillmore Theater, at the precise center of the 
town's central business district, "The Show." Its bright, new red-and-white 
marquee still announces "Beethoven's 2nd," the last picture before the Jan. 17 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 As the only movie theater along the 50 miles between Ventura and Santa 
Clarita, it lured customers from miles around. But now a key wall has 
collapsed. Demolition is expected. And many residents say they regret the 
theater's passing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the things that hurts me more than anything else," Fire Chief 
Pat Askren said. "A lot of little towns don't have their own theater. I'm going 
to miss it if it doesn't come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Show is important to a town like Fillmore because it had continued to draw 
not only teen-agers but old-timers who had once paid 20 cents to see its first 
talking pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there when the first sound movie came to town," Patterson recalled. "It 
was 'Hells Angels,' and in the very first scene there was a plane diving at us 
with its machine gun going. Every kid hit the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 The theater still brings the young to town after dark and customers to the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 "People around here aren't real wealthy, and it's a nice source of fun. I 
don't know where we'd go otherwise," said Gabe Asenas, proprietor of the 
Fillmore Billiard Parlor, a teen-age hangout a few doors away. 
</P>
<P>
 But the owner of the Fillmore Theater building, Dale Larson, is 76 years old 
and not in a position to think about starting over. "Right now I'm just 
planning on demolishing the building and having the plot for sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Graves has run The Show since 1983. At age 52, he said he's young enough 
to build a new theater if he can just get a low-interest disaster loan from the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life interest is movie theaters," Graves said. "So I'm sure going to try." 
</P>
<P>
 Already residents are talking about a "Save The Show" campaign on cable TV. 
And city officials, who spent $13,000 on the theater's new marquee when they 
spruced up the downtown a few years ago, want to salvage it and store it at 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just in case there is ever a theater here again," Graves said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a development late Friday, hope emerged that The Show might avoid 
demolition after all. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Roy Payne said state preservationists insist the theater is not 
beyond repair and have presented calculations that suggest reconstruction might 
be feasible. Domino Effect Feared 
</P>
<P>
 What finally happens to the Fillmore Theater and other badly damaged Central 
Avenue businesses may depend on disaster aid. U.S. Small Business 
Administration representatives are in town doling out application forms, but no 
loans so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's getting more confused and frustrated as we go along," said Ron 
Stewart, 44, whose grandfather started Ballard Furniture 57 years ago. Stewart 
bought the building from his mother four years ago. His sister's manicure shop 
is one of his three tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart figures it would cost him perhaps $250,000 to rebuild, "so financially 
I would be better off to just tear it down and start over," he said. Of course, 
he said, he couldn't afford the mortgage on the reconstruction loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just sounds like a lot of us are going to be out a lot of money, or just 
out, period," he said. "I'd like to carry on. What else am I going to do? My 
life's work has been in this business." 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing heavily on Stewart, and on store owners close to the Fillmore 
Theater, however, is the question of what will happen to their businesses if 
the theater comes down. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Central Avenue stores have common walls, as was the practice 80 
years ago. The strength of one store relies on its next-door neighbor, as have 
the merchants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But when one building falls, the others are threatened in a domino effect, 
several merchants said. Garner's plumbing and hardware stores share a wall with 
Stewart's building. And Garner shares a wall with The Show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theater has dominoed me," Garner said. "I'm yellow tagged now. They're 
letting me get all my stuff out of my store before they tag it red." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear runs in both directions from the Fillmore Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Aparicio, 44, whose building also abuts the movie house, said he's concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they demolish that, then there's a high probability my building might also 
have to go," he said. "I haven't received a notice of demolition. But a few 
(city) engineers told me they're considering that."

 After building a tax preparation business to 3,000 clients, Aparicio said he 
and a relative bought his 1918 storefront four years ago for $250,000. They 
invested another $50,000 in improvements last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the earth shook furiously in Fillmore, wiping out a lifetime of effort in 
mere seconds. Aparicio said he hopes to rebuild and save a building that has 
helped establish Fillmore's character. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all chose Fillmore because of the uniqueness of its architecture and its 
small-town feel," he said. "But if any improvement through demolition or repair 
will bring this building up to code, then I'm for it. It needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants along Central Avenue tend to agree. They realize what could have 
happened if the 6.6-magnitude earthquake had occurred at 9:30 a.m. rather than 
five hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't go back into those old buildings," chiropractor David Erickson said. 
"I'd rather work in an ugly building and be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Fillmore city officials moved quickly last week to demolish old, 
unsound buildings and rebuild from there, state and federal authorities 
intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the city announced that it would tear down 14 buildings, including 
five Central Avenue structures that contain 13 different businesses. Included 
were the Central Market, the Fillmore Theater, the Fillmore health clinic, the 
landmark Masonic Building and a small structure next to it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the state Office of Historic Preservation refused to allow any 
buildings to be razed, saying that its own inspections indicate that every 
Central Avenue structure can be saved. Distinctiveness Lost 
</P>
<P>
 But building owners say they don't have the money for costly reconstruction. 
And state representatives acknowledge that ultimately they cannot stop 
demolitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be really changed when those buildings come down," said 
Santa Paula architectural historian Judith Triem, who recommended against 
demolition. "What was so good was that it was so cohesive. And when you take 
those buildings out, you have holes. And it's never really the same again." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Fillmore's distinctiveness will be lost, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole valley -- Fillmore, Piru and Santa Paula -- is like a step back in 
time," she said. "It's like a time warp, really. It reflects a sort of 
frozen-in-time place that doesn't go much past the 1930s." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they must move forward by replacing unsound buildings with 
new ones designed to withstand quakes. And they note that a new city 
architectural policy requires all new downtown construction to generally match 
the brick-and-awning style of existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to keep it like it is, good old Fillmore," Segovia said. He plans to 
repair his 1911 corner market, which greets visitors as they enter the 
one-block downtown core. 
</P>
<P>
 Segovia is one of several longtime owners whose structures are severely 
damaged but who said they never considered tearing down a historical building 
that could be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert C. Harmonson and his wife, Laura, said they expect to quickly repair 
the two buildings their separate families have owned since 1906 and 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 Several shops are already open and inspectors downgraded the danger of several 
others on Friday. Still, city officials say it could be 18 months before 
Central Avenue is fully recovered. And some merchants think that estimate is 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be back to normal, but it will not be done for three or four 
years," Robert Harmonson said. "Hopefully, in my lifetime I'll see it back the 
way it was a month ago." Fillmore Damage 
</P>
<P>
 Historic Downtown Suffers Following Quake 
</P>
<P>
 No city in Ventura County was more devastated by the Jan. 17 earthquake than 
Fillmore, a town of 13,000 residents founded in 1888 on a new railroad line 
from Saugus to Ventura. The worst of the city's estimated $250 million in 
damage was on Central Avenue, the heart of the downtown business district. Most 
shops -- built of unreinforced brick and mortar between 1900 and 1925 -- 
suffered severe damage. Twenty-five businesses have been red-tagged as 
dangerous, 17 are yellow-tagged for limited entry and 13 are safe to enter. Key 
buildings that may be demolished include the Masonic Building, Fillmore 
Theater, Central Market and the Fillmore health clinic. The Businesses of

POLICE IDENTIFY MAN SHOT IN SAN CLEMENTE DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities have identified the victim of a shooting during a neighborhood 
dispute Friday as William Wallace Jolley, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Jolley, who was shot through the abdomen, was in serious condition following 
surgery at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center. His 10-year-old son, whose 
finger was wounded in the shooting, spent the night at Samaritan Medical 
Center-San Clemente, Orange County sheriff's officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrested Jolley's next door neighbor, Arthur Harry Triebel, 39, on 
suspicion of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told deputies that the incident began with an argument involving 
four members of Jolley's family in the driveway of Triebel's home in the 200 
block of West Escalones. Triebel attempted to intervene and began shooting a 
semiautomatic pistol, authorities said.

MAN FATALLY SHOT NEAR TIRE SHOP IN SANTA ANA; POLICE SEEK 3 MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange man was shot to death in a pickup truck Friday night after an 
apparent confrontation with gang members outside a local tire shop, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was identified as Zenen Bautista Delapaz, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that the victim, his brother and a friend were returning to the 
tire shop at 2701 S. Orange Ave. in Santa Ana just before 9 p.m. Friday when 
they were approached by three young men who asked them about buying tires. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim apparently worked at the site, police said. A shop called Delapaz 
Tires is listed at the address, but no one could be reached there Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 After an initial inquiry about tires, one of the would-be customers pulled out 
a dark-colored handgun and started shooting, firing six or seven rounds, Sgt. 
Anthony Levatino said.  
</P>
<P>
 Delapaz, who was driving the truck, was hit once and attempted to flee the 
scene. But he slumped over the wheel as the truck came to a stop about a block 
or so away, Levatino said.  
</P>
<P>
 He was dead by the time police arrived on the scene, but neither his brother 
nor his friend appeared to have been injured in the attack, the officer added. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailants fled the scene in an unidentified vehicle and were still at 
large Saturday night. Police believe they are gang members.

YOUTHS FLIPPING OVER POGS; GAMES: TOURNAMENT IN IRVINE SPOTLIGHTS THE FAD 
IMPORTED FROM HAWAII. ON SATURDAY, 200 YOUTHS 'SLAMMED KINIS' INTO STACKS OF 
MILK CAPS, HOPING TO FLIP THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wanda Medina has become accustomed to the clink of "slamming kinis" in her 
Tustin home in the months since her 11-year-old son, Ryan, traded his yo-yo for 
the colorful milk caps known as POGs or Trovs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite the fad," Medina said as she watched her son and about 200 other 
youths Saturday at the first tournament, held along a sidewalk at Parkview 
Shopping Center, to celebrate a craze that is sweeping Southern California. 
"When I was a little girl, the boys played for marbles." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by TROV USA, the milk cap tournament spotlights a fad that is 
usually played by handfuls of kids in schoolyards and at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of shooting marbles, players slam the plastic "kinis" on colorfully 
decorated cardboard disks the size of silver dollars. The discs, known in 
various circles as POGs, a registered trademark, or Trovs, short for treasure 
troves, are identical to the flat circles once used to seal glass milk bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to flip the Trovs over by bouncing the kinis off them. In the 
tournament Saturday, two players took turns throwing slammers at a stack of 11 
Trovs. The first to flip six caps advanced to the next round. 
</P>
<P>
 Rules vary, with children playing for points or to keep the caps they've 
successfully flipped. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 youngsters in the county have been caught up in the craze, either 
playing, trading or collecting the caps, according to promoters of Saturday's 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrill of competing and collecting is what many youths said makes the game 
so popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Medina said he loves the game because "you can get more POGs, and 
different ones. I've won about half my POGs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said 13-year-old Daniel Prepas of Newport Beach, who has amassed about 2,000 
caps: "Every recess it's the same. People keep playing." 
</P>
<P>
 The game is similar to one played by youths more than a half century ago with 
the same kinds of small cardboard circles. 
</P>
<P>
 The flying-chips game was reborn in Hawaii about two years ago, when teachers 
at an Oahu elementary school rounded up milk covers from a dairy and introduced 
the game to their students. The disc of choice among the children was the 
container cap for a drink made of passion fruit, orange and guava, otherwise 
known as POG. Hence the name. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Orange stockbroker Bill Hodson became curious about the game last 
winter, and decided to import it to the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 His TROV USA company has since organized more than 20 free tournaments for 
children of all ages throughout north Orange County and has become one of the 
major suppliers of milk caps in the state. A pack of five randomly mixed Trov 
caps sells for $1.25, while a Trov slammer costs $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Company employee John Coelho said he believes the game has staying power, and 
won't wind up becoming just another fad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cross between marbles and baseball cards, which makes it so exciting," 
he said. "You can play and collect." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Murray, 11, of Stanton tends to agree. "I think it's going to be around 
for a while," he said, while waiting for his turn to toss a slammer. "A lot of 
people I know play it. It's a real popular game."

SOUTH COUNTY REASSURED IT WILL HAVE SAY ON BASE; GOVERNMENT: OFFICIALS FROM 
LAGUNA NIGUEL, LAKE FOREST, LAGUNA HILLS AND MISSION VIEJO SAY WASHINGTON TRIP 
EASED CONCERNS THAT THEIR INPUT WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN CONVERSION PLAN. 
</P>

 After meeting with federal authorities in Washington, a contingent of south 
Orange County officials said Saturday they feel confident they will have a 
voice in the conversion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine officials from Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel and Mission Viejo 
flew home Friday night after meeting with representatives from the Federal 
Aviation Administration, the federal Bureau of Prisons, the Pentagon's Marine 
base-conversion team and the Department of the Navy, which decides who gets to 
use the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, only Lake Forest can vote on plans to convert the base for 
civilian use. But officials from the other three cities said they were assured 
in Washington that they also will have a say in how the 4,700-acre base will be 
redeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely have a place at the table and a chance to affect the process," 
Laguna Niguel Councilwoman Patricia C. Bates said. "I was very impressed with 
the attention they gave us and felt a real earnestness and sincerity to 
represent people's needs from the ground up." 
</P>
<P>
 Some south Orange County leaders have opposed using the base for a new 
airport, while officials in North County cities favor an airport as a way to 
increase tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 During last week's meetings, South County officials said, Navy representatives 
re-emphasized two priorities for base conversion -- providing local jobs and 
considering all plans equally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned they have no predisposition for any use," said Mission Viejo Mayor 
Susan Withrow. "They don't care what it becomes and they are committed to 
whatever is the best use for the property."  
</P>
<P>
 South County officials said they would consider commissioning their own study 
of the base's conversion that would be submitted alongside any other studies. 
The group plans to meet soon to discuss what they learned in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest has the only voice in a local Joint Powers Authority, which will 
work with the Navy to decide on the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority is comprised of the five-member Board of Supervisors, who each 
have a vote; the city of Irvine, which has three votes; and Lake Forest, which 
has one vote. 
</P>
<P>
 South County officials said they went to Washington to show their commitment 
to El Toro's future and the close proximity of their communities to the base. 
At each meeting, they passed out a booklet with demographic information and 
aerial photos of the base area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing more valuable than to have the ability to look people in the 
eye and hear what they have to say," Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph said. 
"It's not that they were unaware of who we were before, but I feel comfortable 
that they now have faces to attach with the names." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip was not only for fact-finding, but also to dispel rumors, South 
County officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy and Marine officials in charge of the base conversion say that all 
options, including an airport, must be considered. South County officials had 
the delicate task of persuading federal agencies that they are open-minded 
about plans for the base, despite the fact that several have publicly opposed 
the airport concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were able to show them that we weren't a wild-eyed bunch of antis 
(anti-airport)," Rudolph said. "It's true our citizens are probably 90% against 
the airport, but we mainly let them know that we just want to see all the 
information and verify it on our own." 
</P>
<P>
 They also sought to put to rest talk about interim use of the base as a cargo 
airport as the Marines prepare to leave. The move date is tentatively set for 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were told across the board (by FAA and Navy officials) that there are no 
plans for any interim use as a cargo airport," Bates said. "In fact, (the Navy) 
said they would not accept (cargo transport) applications for interim use."

AS NEW PRESIDING JURIST, JUDGE SMITH DOESN'T SHY FROM COURTING CRITICISM; 
JUDICIARY: SOME SAW HIS CALL TO DECRIMINALIZE DRUGS AS POLITICAL SUICIDE. 
OTHERS SAY IT SHOWED THE INDEPENDENCE AND CANDOR THAT WILL SERVE THE COUNTY 
SYSTEM WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Judge James L. Smith publicly endorsed decriminalizing drug use two years 
ago, many saw it as an act of political suicide: At the time, a lenient 
attitude toward drugs drew little support in conservative Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But others say coming forward was typical of Smith's independent nature and 
his determination to speak his mind. It's a trait that supporters say will 
serve him well as the new presiding judge of the county's Superior Court 
system, one of the state's largest. Smith took that post this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been hesitant to say what I've felt, but I'm also willing to say 
I'm wrong when I'm wrong, and in many ways that's more important," said the 
56-year-old former prosecutor who was appointed to the Municipal Court bench by 
then-Gov. Ronald Reagan in 1971 and elected to the Superior Court in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who stresses that he does not endorse drug use, said taking the profit 
away from drug dealers will mean more money for rehabilitating drug addicts. 
But the topic is one he plans to steer clear of while presiding over 59 judges, 
16 other bench officers and more than 650 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told several people that I will not actively participate in discussing 
this issue because there is a danger of people mistakenly believing that is the 
opinion of this court," said Smith, who was elected to his one-year post by his 
colleagues. "I will not promote an agenda. I'm here to keep court operations 
running smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one critic, however, says Smith's stance on drugs should eliminate 
his eligibility to be the county's top judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that for a man of his responsibility to think that way, it's a 
disgrace," said Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). "He shouldn't be in 
that position if he feels that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has also faced controversy over some of his legal rulings. Advocates for 
the impoverished say Smith is no friend to the mentally ill or the homeless men 
and women who have made the downtown Santa Ana Civic Center their home -- the 
same area where Smith, a fitness buff, often takes his daily runs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a decision that especially outraged advocates for the homeless, Smith last 
year upheld a law banning camping in downtown Santa Ana. In another, he sided 
with the city of Garden Grove when it evicted a center for mentally ill 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 "These decisions illustrated a total heartlessness," said one advocate, who 
asked for anonymity because he may appear in Smith's courtroom in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters, however, say Smith is a judge who concentrates on pointing out the 
common ground between warring parties. They point to the recent case in which 
Smith fashioned a compromise on an environmental review of land slated to 
become the San Joaquin Hills tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 "He genuinely cares about people and the court. He tells you what he thinks 
and is extremely open-minded, and more than willing to concede he could be 
wrong," said Superior Court Commissioner Richard M. Aronson. "I think that's an 
essential trait of any good judge." 
</P>
<P>
 To his friends and colleagues, Smith is known more as a thoughtful judge and a 
basketball fanatic who runs as much as 10 miles a day. He uses a tiny knife to 
carve Styrofoam cups while on the bench, a habit he says helps him concentrate, 
and he keeps a collection of the intricate designs in his chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends also say Smith is a perennial joker with a sharp wit and a 
self-deprecating sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Gary M. Pohlson, president-elect of the Orange County Bar Assn. and a 
friend of Smith's, recalled several years ago taking his newly repainted 
Porsche to a basketball game and inviting Smith outside to show off the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Pohlson was dismayed as he approached the car to find a handwritten note: 
"Sorry about the dent on the other side. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you, I was falling apart, I was dying, and of course this was all 
(Smith's) doing. He's a constant kidder," Pohlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said his main job will be to manage civil and criminal caseloads, keep 
trials moving smoothly and help oversee the merger of the county clerk's office 
with the Superior Court. Smith said he sees himself as "the guy steering the 
ship" and says the court is currently in "excellent condition" thanks to his 
predecessor, Judge Donald E. Smallwood. 
</P>
<P>
 While jazz played softly in his chambers recently, Smith sat beneath a 
portrait and two small busts of Abraham Lincoln. Smith said he has always 
admired Lincoln for his emergence at a critical time in the country's history 
and acting decisively to heal a divided nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not comparing myself to him, but I really admire that and hope that I 
live my life and conduct myself in the same way," Smith said. "When it's all 
said and done, I think it's important to be able to look back and realize that 
you've contributed something, that you've tried to make a difference in your 
own way, regardless of what people say."

NORTHRIDGE RANCH LATEST TO JOIN THE HISTORIC SITE CASUALTY LIST; DAMAGE: THREE 
OF SIX BUILDINGS AT THE 200-YEAR-OLD RANCHO CORDILLERO DEL NORTE FALL IN 
SHAMBLES.

<P>
 It's an idyllic slice of early California, all but gobbled up by Northridge's 
suburban growth and suddenly crippled by Mother Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cordillero del Norte (Ranch of the North Ridge) -- once a sheep farm on 
the sprawling old Mission San Fernando some 200 -years ago -- is another 
casualty of the Northridge earthquake, which has temporarily closed several 
other historic sites in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Rancho Cordillero's six buildings, obscured from motorists by trees 
at Nordhoff Street and Wilbur Avenue, fell in shambles. The others -- battered 
but restorable -- show scars and bruises worthy of their proximity to the 
epicenter of the 6.6-magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A circular tower made of river rock on this eight-acre estate collapsed in a 
heap, leaving the house alongside it (circa 1917) condemned. At a stone hut 
believed to be a former stagecoach stop, the tile roof caved in. 
</P>
<P>
 And a wooden porch and its shake roof ripped loose from a studio used by the 
property's owner-occupant Elisabeth Waldo, who composes, plays violin and 
teaches ethnic music here as founder-director of the nonprofit Multicultural 
Music and Art Foundation of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way this stops us!" Waldo said as reconstruction began on land where she 
and her husband, the late Carl Dentzel, a Valley pioneer who helped name the 
community Northridge, settled as newlyweds in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the spirit of what you do that keeps you going," said Waldo, who 
conducts concerts and workshops in Native American, Spanish and Asian music at 
the estate. "It's inconvenient living here now, but it doesn't throw me." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cordillero, where Waldo hopes to resume cultural events in March, joins 
three more of the San Fernando Valley's oldest buildings waylaid by the quake: 
the Andres Pico Adobe (1834) in Mission Hills, the Leonis Adobe (1844) in 
Calabasas and the Lopez Adobe (1882) in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Pico Adobe -- it was originally owned by Mexican Army Gen. 
Andres Pico, brother of Pio Pico, California's last Mexican governor -- had 
closed more than a year ago for earthquake retrofitting. But before work could 
begin, the Jan. 17 quake tore a gaping hole out of the two-story, Spanish 
Mission-style house, cracked walls and sheared off the chimney and parts of a 
courtyard adobe wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the adobe will stay closed for at least another year, said Bobette 
Fleschler, president of the San Fernando Valley Historical Society, which 
occupies temporary quarters on the grounds and will move back into the house 
when it reopens. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Leonis Adobe in Calabasas, the two-story Monterey-style mansion will be 
closed indefinitely, but other structures on the restored working ranch -- the 
Plummer House, barn and blacksmith shop -- will remain open 1 to 4 p.m. 
Wednesdays through Sundays, said Phyllis Jones, the site's director. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lopez Adobe, believed to be San Fernando's oldest structure except for the 
slightly-damaged-but-still-open San Fernando Mission (1797), will be closed to 
the public indefinitely for repairs to its chimney and walls, said caretaker 
Bert Weinmann, who resides there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sit and watch the walls now," he said, "and I wonder if they're going to 
fall in." 
</P>
<P>
 Other closings include: the Chatsworth Museum, which may resume tours on Feb. 
6; an adobe house museum and a two-story limestone house at Los Encinos State 
Historical Park in Encino; Glendale's historic Casa Adobe de San Rafael; and 
Sylmar's museum, known as San Sylmar, opened in 1969, home of the Merle Norman 
Classic Beauty Collection of "functional fine art," notably antique Rolls-Royce 
cars and musical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Clarita Valley, the William S. Hart Museum in Newhall has been 
closed for repairs but officials hope to reopen on Feb. 12. But Hart Park -- 
where the museum sits -- and Heritage Junction, the museum-home of the Santa 
Clarita Valley Historical Society, remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake destroyed the Mentry House (1893), once the residence of area 
pioneer Charles A. Mentry, on Pico Canyon Road west of the Golden State 
Freeway, said local historian Jerry Reynolds. A barn next door survived, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major loss because the house was a state historical landmark," 
Reynolds said. "Now I guess we'll have to change it to historical site ."

MAN KILLS ESTRANGED WIFE, THEN MORTALLY SHOOTS HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A man killed his estranged wife in the parking lot outside her condominium 
before shooting and mortally wounding himself, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Zola Ungureanu, 41, was pronounced dead Friday outside her home in the 800 
block of Singingwood Street shortly after 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Lorel Ungureanu, 48, was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa 
Ana, where he died Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Lorel Ungureanu shot his wife twice at close range with an 
automatic handgun, hitting her in the face and torso. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no indication of any motive other than the fact that he was 
apparently despondent that they had broken up about three months ago," Sgt. 
Greg McClure said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Zola Ungureanu had moved into the quiet, fairly isolated 
complex only a couple of months ago. She was in the process of divorcing her 
husband and shared her condominium with a woman she worked with at a cosmetics 
company, said neighbor Lori Klunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Klunder said two co-workers had driven Zola Ungureanu home just moments before 
the shooting and then drove to call the police.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators did not say whether they had located any witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Brian Klunder said Zola Ungureanu mentioned that her husband had 
previously abused her, but did not give any details. "Nobody seems to know much 
about them. They were on their own trip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Klunders lived two doors from Zola Ungureanu but said they never heard any 
arguments when Lorel Ungureanu visited. They said his visits had become more 
frequent in the past several weeks and that Zola Ungureanu apparently had given 
him a key to her condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 Staring at the hosed-down pavement and the spot where someone left flowers in 
Zola Ungureanu's memory, neighbors talked Saturday about how the burst of 
gunfire shocked their calm community where the most excitement usually comes 
when coyotes devour pet cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "My roommate thought I was crushing cans in the garage," said Mark Warburton, 
28. "Most people thought it was fireworks. They didn't even know they were 
gunshots until they heard the sirens." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Klunder said Zola Ungureanu was a kind woman who liked walking her German 
shepherd and who still cared about her husband even though she had filed for 
divorce.  
</P>
<P>
 "I asked her what she did for Christmas, and she said she had a dinner at her 
house," Lori Klunder said. "She said she had invited Lorel because he had been 
really depressed. He usually got depressed around the holidays."

AFTER THE QUAKE, CHARITY IS DREAM COME TRUE FOR AIDS PATIENTS; BURBANK: THE 
PRESIDENT OF DREAMS TO REALITY HAS TAKEN FOOD, WATER AND OTHER SUPPLIES TO MANY 
IN THE VALLEY WHO FEEL ISOLATED AFTER THE DISASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When the Northridge earthquake hit last week, Charles, a 30-year-old 
unemployed waiter who has AIDS, did what many throughout Los Angeles did. 
</P>
<P>
 He prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an evil world," he said to God as he clung to the doorway, sure that his 
shaking Los Feliz apartment was about to collapse. "But give us another 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Most everyone did get another chance, but as the recovery from the earthquake 
has begun, the bouts of depression brought on by his disease have gotten worse 
for Charles. With no income -- except from welfare -- and reliant on a brother 
who has not been able to reach him, Charles was nearly out of food last week 
when Christopher Spencer came to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, 24, co-founder and president of a small charity in Burbank, has been 
delivering bags of canned food, water and other supplies to Charles and others 
like him, those who had become double-victims -- of both AIDS and natural 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little bit of hope can go a long way," said Spencer, president of the 
Dreams to Reality Foundation, a small charity started in Burbank last year. 
While doing other work, the organization focuses on raising money to combat 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he started his relief effort, Spencer has received calls from about 50 
people who need help. They learned about him through public service 
announcements he placed with local radio and television stations. 
</P>
<P>
 A steady, dark-haired man, Spencer makes his deliveries in a silver Toyota 
Tercel with his groceries in the back and a cellular phone hanging from the 
rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 He owns a small office supply company in Burbank, and tries to get most of his 
work done in the mornings so he can do charity work in the afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 On an afternoon earlier this week, he made eight deliveries, driving to North 
Hollywood, Canoga Park, Studio City and other points in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't pretend to know what it's like to have AIDS," Spencer said. "But I 
know (people with AIDS) want friendship, compassion and understanding. They 
need to feel like they can belong." 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS experts make the point that while stress, lack of sleep, nervousness and 
depression may not be strangers to earthquake survivors, these feelings have 
long been companions to people with AIDS. Already, they have been forced to 
form an uncomfortable acceptance that they will die too young, and now even 
that disturbing reality has been shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want things to be secure and familiar," said Lorette Herman, director of 
client services for AIDS Project Los Angeles. The disease already forces too 
many changes in their lives, she said. "You want the earth to stop moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the earthquake, AIDS Project Los Angeles has established support 
groups for its clients to help them cope. Calls to the hot line jumped after 
the earthquake and the organization has tried to contact each of its 3,900 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you have an illness, a crisis makes everything worse," Herman said. 
Because AIDS can manifest itself in so many different ways, the psychological 
effects of a crisis like the earthquake can also vary. Some patients may only 
worry about losing their medication as it spills in the darkness, others may 
have an eye disease that compounds the problems of a sudden earthquake-induced 
blackout, Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are nearly 700 people with AIDS in the Valley, but AIDS groups do not 
have figures as to how many were affected by or made homeless by the 
earthquake. Patty Dailey of the Los Angeles Housing Exchange, which finds 
shelter or housing for people with AIDS or are HIV-positive, said the group has 
had three or four requests a day for help from earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake victims and AIDS patients do have something in common, said Julie 
Steres, the mental health coordinator at the Valley HIV Center. They both often 
feel helpless because they do not have control with what is happening to them. 
So the counseling may follow the same tack, but there the similarity ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't recover from AIDS," Steres said. "You learn to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Bowen, a North Hollywood man who received food and a supply of rubber 
gloves from Spencer, said the earthquake was "the most devastating thing to 
happen to me since I found out I was (HIV) positive." This was only the second 
earthquake for Owen, who is from Tennessee. He's so disturbed by the continuing 
aftershocks that he no longer sleeps well, and is down to only one meal a day. 
The stress could easily take a toll on his already taxed immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen's partner, Patrick Lyman, who also has AIDS, has been trying to keep his 
friend's spirits up, keeping him away from drinking, which would further wreck 
his immune system. The couple plan to commit to each other in a marriage 
ceremony later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tim Kopischke, a 28-year-old Hollywood man who tested positive for the HIV 
virus in July, 1991, the earthquake meant losing 30 pounds of frozen venison 
his father had killed for him in Minnesota. He had been counting on using that 
meat, and because he has not had steady employment for more than two years, 
Kopischke, who is healthy but must take care of his 3-year-old daughter who has 
AIDS, only had about $4 when he heard that there was help available. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer delivered juice, canned chili, soup and diapers for the baby, Amy, 
whose mother died almost a year ago from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've done it all now," said Kopischke, who listed among his life 
experiences living on the streets, working in construction, traveling cross 
country, having one wife leave him and another die of AIDS -- and now 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a damn thing you can do about it, either one of them -- the 
earthquake or the AIDS," said Kopischke. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the earthquake has brought his neighbors a bit closer, helping to 
remove some of the isolation he has felt from being HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 But the earthquake has taken away the sense of belonging for the handful of 
AIDS victims who have been forced out of their homes or apartments. Cheryl 
Kauffman, a family case manager in the Valley HIV Center in Van Nuys, predicted 
that one of her clients, a single mother of four, would take a turn for the 
worse as a result of the quake's trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 Kauffman said a volunteer worker with AIDS came into her office the day after 
the earthquake, shaking with distress. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted a hug, but he hadn't had a shower in two days," said Kauffman, who 
hugged him. "He was shaking like a scared animal." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake, which struck about 4:30 a.m. Jan. 17, found Charles, the 
former waiter, awake -- despite the early hour. He had been watching television 
news, a frequent middle-of-the-night activity for him because of the cycle of 
night sweats, lack of sleep, depression and anxiety. He likes television news 
because he does not have the mental concentration to watch anything for too 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 The violent shaking threw him out of the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my first feeling of God in a long time," Charles said. "I felt that 
the hand of God had touched people in a way that they had better wake up and 
realize how precious life is."

2 EACH WIN $1 MILLION IN 'BIG SPIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A California Highway Patrol officer from Trabuco Canyon and a Westminster man 
have each won $1 million in the California Lottery's "Big Spin." 
</P>
<P>
 Antoinette Kodera, 36, said she plays the lottery all the time, but had never 
won more than $500 before. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sit there thinking, 'Yeah, $25,000, that's OK.' But then a million 
(dollars) came up. It was beyond belief," Kodera said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Spin was held Friday but not televised until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodera, a CHP officer based in San Juan Capistrano, said she will pay off 
bills and probably invest the rest of her winnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Bush, 53, chief construction inspector for the Port of Long Beach, who has 
lived in Westminster for four years, said he may use the money to travel or fix 
his home's roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty positive about it. I told my wife, LaVonne, that when I got the 
wheel I'd win a million dollars," Bush said. "I always promised her that if we 
could afford it we'd take a trip to Europe."

DRIVER RUNS OVER MAN, 52, LYING ON ROAD IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 52-year-old man was run over by a car early Saturday while lying in a major 
roadway, but police aren't certain whether he was already dead at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they are unsure what the man was doing in the street or 
whether he may even have been struck by another vehicle before his body was 
discovered.An investigation is continuing, Anaheim Police Officer Dale Dambrun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim lived in Fullerton, but his name was not released pending 
notification of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Emard, 17, who was driving a 1981 Chevrolet Malibu, called police just 
after midnight to report that he had struck someone on westbound Orangethorpe 
Avenue, west of Raymond Avenue, near the railroad tracks, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 Emard of Anaheim was not arrested, and Dambrun said he did not appear to have 
been at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police are asking anyone with information about the incident to call 
(714) 254-1532.

ACTIVISTS VISIT 4 SUSPECTED PRICE GOUGERS

<P>
 In the first hours after the Jan. 17 earthquake, Alejandra Viveros of Pacoima 
bought a gallon of milk, a gallon of water, a pack of medium-sized flashlight 
batteries and a can of tuna fish from a local mini-mart. She paid $24. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivia Gonzales paid another local market $23 for two bags of ice, a gallon of 
water and two packs of batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, joined by Father Tom Russ of Mary Immaculate Catholic Church and 
about 20 other members of a San Fernando Valley activist group called VOICE, 
the two women went back to the merchants who they say cheated them and demanded 
that the store owners sign an agreement pledging to charge customers fairly.  
</P>
<P>
 "What we're talking about here are flagrant examples of price gouging right at 
the time of the earthquake," Russ said. "This is something that we can't let 
pass by. We need to mend our community because this is the kind of thing that 
tears us apart." 
</P>
<P>
 In a caravan of cars, the members of VOICE, or Valley Organized in Community 
Efforts, went to four stores where people said they were cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 At each of the stores, Russ introduced himself and the group and then asked 
the owner or manager to listen to the complaint of the disgruntled customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reactions varied. Two shopkeepers denied knowing of any abuse but said they 
had no problem signing the group's agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 At another Pacoima gas station mini-mart on San Fernando Road, Joseph Sanchez 
confronted the woman he said tried to charge him $2 a gallon for gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember me?" he asked. "I didn't appreciate being taken advantage of. I told 
you I'd be back and I am."  
</P>
<P>
 The woman told the group that her computers were not working properly, and 
were overcharging people. She said she was charging the correct price, which 
she calculated herself. She added that she would not sign the group's document 
without her attorney's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Group members were resolute, threatening to boycott stores whose operators 
would not pledge in writing that their prices were fair.

FEW LEADS IN PROBE OF SLAIN TURTLE ROCK WOMAN; HOMICIDE: POLICE SAY THEY HAVE 
LITTLE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO WORK WITH AND DISTRIBUTED FLYERS IN THE COMMUNITY. 
</P>

<P>
 It has been more than a week since Patricia Lea Pratt was found slain in the 
bedroom of her Turtle Rock home, but police said that so far they have few 
leads in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers have distributed more than 400 flyers throughout the community this 
week in the hopes that somebody will come forward with information that might 
lead them to the 46-year-old woman's killer, said Irvine Police Detective Larry 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you don't have a lot of leads, it makes it very difficult," Montgomery 
said. "We have had tons of calls, but nothing solid has come up from them." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Charles S. Brobeck said four detectives are working the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt died sometime between 5:30 and 11:45 p.m. on Jan. 20. She was last seen 
alive by her husband, Paul Pratt, who left for a business meeting in the 
evening, then returned later and discovered his wife's body, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were no signs of forced entry into the home, police said they 
believe the victim may have interrupted a burglary. Several valuable items were 
missing from the house, which is on Windflower near a small park. Montgomery 
said investigators have very little physical evidence with which to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have said Pratt suffered injuries to her upper torso but have refused 
to say exactly how she died.  
</P>
<P>
 Pratt's death has come as a shock to the quiet neighborhood, especially since 
Irvine rarely experiences homicides. Pratt's death was the fourth homicide in 
the city since 1990, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said the case will remain a "high priority" until a suspect is 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that a neighbor might have seen something during that time and 
maybe didn't make a connection," he said. "The suspect might have knocked on 
their door first to see if someone was home with the idea of committing a 
burglary. And if they answered the door, the burglar would come up with some 
excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Police also hope to get information from residents who might have been walking 
or jogging in the park next to the Pratt home at around the time of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with possible information about the crime is asked to contact 
Montgomery at (714) 724-7173.

VALLEY BRIEFING: LOST LANDMARKS

<P>
 Few people outside of the San Fernando Valley came to Northridge Fashion 
Center to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Few outside of South Central prayed at Southern Missionary Baptist Church and 
unless you lived on the Westside, you probably hardly took notice of Saint 
John's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 But these structures -- along with dozens of others severely damaged in the 
earthquake and aftershocks -- were vital parts of their neighborhoods. Whether 
schools, office buildings, art deco apartment houses, coffee shops, churches, 
medical facilities or malls; their absence is being felt. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a list of some of the more prominent neighborhood landmarks that have 
been destroyed or will have to undergo significant renovation. WEST VALLEY

THE HIGH SCHOOLS: HIGHLAND IS GETTING LAST LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Highland High's boys' basketball program has a bit of clown in its past. This 
season, however, the Bulldogs are no bozos. 
</P>
<P>
 Then: Highland was the Golden League equivalent of a floppy-shoed, bulb-nosed 
circus performer, finishing last with a laughable 3-12 league mark last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now: Wipe off those painted smiles. Real ones are in order. Friday night, the 
Bulldogs (13-6, 8-3 in league play) clinched their first playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called it a rebuilding year," Coach Tom Mahan said of last season. "Of 
course, you always do that when you don't win." 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday night's playoff-clinching victory over Littlerock, the key player 
was sophomore John Burrell -- whose father, Sam (Chico) Burrell, was a member 
of the Harlem Clowns, a barnstorming basketball team in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me how fun it was -- the travel and putting on shows for people," 
Burrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The athletic 6-foot-2 forward put on a show Friday night, scoring 16 points 
and pulling down 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played incredibly well," Mahan said. "He plays above the rim. Most of his 
points came when he got the rebound and laid it in while he was up there. He 
jumps quickly and explosively." 
</P>
<P>
 Burrell said his father, with whom he does not live, encouraged him to take up 
basketball when he was junior high. He had primarily played football, but he 
soon grew to love the hardwood as much as his 6-7 father. 
</P>
<P>
 And along with a talent for the game, he hopes to inherit a few more inches in 
height. "If he gets up to 6-4 or 6-5, he could be something special," Mahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Highland: The key to the turnaround has been the emergence Burrell and 
Jamal Dedeaux to take the pressure off 6-6 1/2 Pharoah Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior forward is one of the top players in the region, but Highland's 
problem is that every opponent knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, he surprised people," Mahan said. "This year everybody knows who 
to stop. There are usually two or three guys on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Highland relied on Davis too much early on and started 0-4, but have since 
become more balanced and won 13 of 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who averages 23 points and 10 rebounds, nearly signed with San Diego 
State this fall but decided to wait. He has drawn interest from such schools as 
Arizona State, Cal, Iowa, Oregon State, Oregon, Loyola Marymount and Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lauer power: Your team loses its first two league games. Soon after, your star 
player badly sprains his ankle, misses a game and scores a grand total of five 
points in the next two contests. You pack it in and start thinking about next 
year, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Not if you're Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending Marmonte League champion Lancers have been nothing if not 
resilient. Despite an 0-2 league start and the continuing ankle problems of 
Washington-bound center Jason Hartman, Thousand Oaks (15-5, 6-2) has won six 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman, averaging 18.3 points, was limited to five in two games last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Big shoes to fill, especially since Hartman wears size-16s. 
</P>
<P>
 Up stepped senior guard Peter Lauer, who torched Newbury Park for 30 points 
Wednesday night and had 19 in Friday night's victory over Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's picked it up to another level the last two games," Hartman said of 
Lauer. "He's a prolific shooter. You can't leave him open, because he's deadly. 
And in the last couple of years he's improved his ability driving to the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman and Lauer have played on the same team since they were 10 years old in 
a youth league. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, Lauer was the tallest and best player on the team, which once won 
50 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Hartman is 6-7 and Lauer is 6-1, but for the moment, Lauer is standing 
tall. 
</P>

 Crescenta Valley: What's in the air there? Last season, Falcon basketball 
player Adam Jacobsen launched bomb after bomb en route to becoming the Southern 
Section's all-time leading three-point shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Crescenta Valley's female star, Sarah Hagman, has made 105 
three-point shots, including a section-record 13 in a game. The senior guard 
needs eight more to break the section's season record.

 Irish aye: San Fernando High quarterback/defensive back Leon Blunt said 
Saturday he still favors Notre Dame over USC and he plans to sign a letter of 
intent to Notre Dame at 8 a.m. Wednesday, the earliest possible hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty much final that I plan to attend Notre Dame," said Blunt, who 
made an oral commitment to the Irish but later took an official recruiting trip 
to USC. "I've been thinking about it a lot, but I've never changed my mind."

RIDLEY POINTS LIFE IN NEW DIRECTION; MEN'S BASKETBALL: CAL LUTHERAN GUARD 
DOESN'T REGRET DECISION TO COME WEST AND ESCAPE THE MEAN STREETS OF 
CINCINNATI'S PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For someone raised in the projects on Cincinnati's west side, Damon Ridley, a 
guard for Cal Lutheran's basketball team, has come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only in the distance he has traveled, but in the lessons he's learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley, who is averaging 21.1 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.6 steals 
for the Kingsmen (16-1), occasionally gets homesick, but never regrets his 
decision to come west in 1989 after leaving Cincinnati's Withrow High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt like I needed to get away from there," Ridley said. "A lot of the 
kids who grew up with me are either selling drugs right now or in jail for 
something. I felt like I could expand myself a lot more than that so I really 
needed to get out of there. Because when you get caught up in the streets, a 
lot of bad things can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley's mother, Alberta, kept him on the straight and narrow by making sure 
he didn't have much idle time when he was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he was involved in school, playing sports or attending church 
functions, he had little time to be tempted by the ways of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley was constantly on the athletic go, participating in boxing, baseball, 
football and basketball before focusing on the latter sport in high school, 
where his coach prohibited him from playing anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real active because I wanted to stay out of trouble," Ridley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you weren't putting a lot of time into sports, you were out there doing 
something that you had no business doing." 
</P>
<P>
 As a single mother and Cincinnati native, Alberta Ridley knew that raising her 
two sons on the west side would be difficult, but the struggles of everyday 
life formed a close bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can talk to her about anything," Damon said. "We are just super tight. 
We're like best friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Alberta concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always told him that if there is anything you want to know, ask me," she 
said. "Whether it was about girls, or drugs, or whatever, I always wanted him 
to feel that he could talk to me about anything. But I didn't sugar-coat things 
because I feel it's very important, especially with today's kids, to tell them 
the truth, to tell it like it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Ridley, the father, did not have much contact with Damon and his younger 
brother Danyea until Damon's senior year in high school, when Withrow won the 
Division I title in the city championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't come around much until he started seeing my name in the papers," 
Ridley said with a tinge of disappointment. "But by then, it was too late for 
him to be my father. When I was growing up, it was my mother who took me to the 
doctor, or to ballgames, or taught me how to fish. All the things that a father 
should have done, my mother did. . . . I respect him and we stay in touch, but 
we're more like friends than father and son." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Playing on a Withrow team that included Steve Gentry (Xavier), Carl Brown 
(Western Kentucky) and Walter Evans (Cleveland State), Ridley was not heavily 
recruited by major schools. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to Sierra College in Rocklin, Calif., after then-assistant coach Rick 
Singer heard about him through Withrow Coach George Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley earned All-Bay Valley Conference honors during his freshman season, but 
the transition to life as an African American at a school with a predominantly 
white student body took some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so used to being around African Americans and then I came to Sierra and 
I was the only African American in class," Ridley said. "So it took me a long 
time to adjust to that. But people around (Sierra), just like (at Cal 
Lutheran), were so friendly that the color of your skin didn't make a 
difference. That helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Bur homesickness and academic difficulties got the best of Ridley in the 
spring of 1990, and he dropped out of school and returned to Cincinnati after 
basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 He told Sierra Coach John Rankin that he would be back and, true to his word, 
he returned in the fall, regained his eligibility and averaged 18.3 points, 6.1 
rebounds and 5.3 steals for the Wolverines (28-5). 
</P>
<P>
 He planned to continue his career at Cal State Sacramento -- where Singer had 
moved as an assistant -- but when Joey Anders, the head coach, was fired, 
Singer was out of a job and Ridley "had no idea what I was going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Cal Lutheran entered the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dunlap had just completed his third season coaching at the NCAA Division 
III school and was looking to recruit a quick guard with good all-around 
skills. Singer told Dunlap that Ridley fit the bill, but he didn't think Ridley 
would be willing to play for a small school like Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it doesn't matter who you play against or where you play," Ridley said 
of his surprising decision to play for the Division III Kingsmen. "It's all 
competition. No matter if you're playing against the Sisters of the Poor, you 
still have to put the ball in the basket." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley led the team in scoring (15.7) and steals (3.6) last season as Cal 
Lutheran (20-7) won a share of its second consecutive Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title, and he's made big strides as a 
perimeter shooter this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits more repetitions in practice and improved technique with improving 
his field-goal percentage and three-point percentage, to 54.6 from 48.3 on the 
former to 50.0 from 28.6 on the latter.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a tendency to drift off to the side when I shot last year," Ridley 
said. "I wouldn't jump straight up and that affected my shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap is pleased that Ridley took it upon himself to become a more complete 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows that he has to be able to shoot from outside or defenses are just 
going to shut down the lanes when he tries to drive," Dunlap said. "He's worked 
very hard on that part of his game." 
</P>
<P>
 Better communication with Dunlap has also made basketball more enjoyable for 
Ridley, who occasionally butted heads with his coach last season. 
</P>
<P>
 An earnest discussion after the season cleared the air when player and coach 
told each other how they felt and what they expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that once he understood that it's not a conditional relationship, 
that I'm going to treat you the same way whether you score 20 points or two 
points, he felt better about it," Dunlap said. "Once he was able to say, ah, 
this isn't predicated solely on that orange thing going through a hoop, we came 
to a level of understanding. . . . We established the ground rules for a 
lifelong friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap will conclude his coaching career at Cal Lutheran this season before 
leaving to direct the Adelaide 36ers in Australia's National Basketball League, 
and Ridley plans to join him next year after completing requirements for his 
degree in physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, Ridley would like nothing better than to give Dunlap an 
NCAA title as a going-away present. Even if that doesn't happen, he seems 
content with the direction his life is headed. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother recently bought a house in the suburban Kennedy Heights section of 
Cincinnati and Danyea, 17, is a junior three-sport standout at Taft High who 
has received letters from the football programs at Notre Dame, Georgia Tech and 
Penn State.  
</P>
<P>
 Ridley is dating Sherri Howard, a three-time Olympian in track, and enjoys the 
quiet, peaceful surroundings at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, it's like La-La Land, because you don't have to watch your back when 
you're walking around and hearing gunshots," he said. "You can go to school and 
just concentrate on playing ball. As far as back home, you always had to watch 
what was going on. I really like it here."

PLAYOFFS A MIDWINTER NIGHT'S DREAM RIGHT NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Jan. 30, and the Mighty Ducks are tied with the Kings for the eighth and 
final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after the Kings' 5-1 victory over the Ducks at the Forum, they 
each have 44 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that worth the paper the standings are printed on? Do the Ducks really have 
a shot at making the playoffs in their first season? And do they think they do? 
</P>
<P>
 January in hockey is about like July in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of season left. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the most important number isn't the 44 points the Ducks have compiled, 
but the number of games they've played -- 53. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings have played only 49. Ditto the San Jose Sharks, who are one point 
behind. Ditto the Vancouver Canucks, with 50 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Kings have four or five games in hand, so even though we're tied 
right now, those games in hand are going to be important," said center Bob 
Corkum, who figures the Ducks would probably have to pass the Stanley Cup 
finalists to make the playoffs. As it stands now, the Ducks would go because 
the first tie-breaker is most victories. The Ducks have 20, the Kings 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to at least do as well as we did in the first half. Anything less 
would be selling ourselves short. The second half, though, tends to get a 
little tougher with everybody vying for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Jack Ferreira knows that. Everybody knows that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is usually when the intensity picks up," Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the team printed up optimistic "Skate for Eight" T-shirts at the 
start of the season, they aren't spending every day in a playoff-race frenzy. 
They say they believe they can do it, but they haven't thrown all their eggs in 
that basket yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not thinking that way," Ferreira said. "All we're thinking is stay 
close, stay in the race, make it miserable for the other teams. The pressure's 
on the other teams, not on us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you just stay close, who knows what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, staying close helps you stay close. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it does when you stay close and compete for that spot, eighth overall, 
is it enables the players to focus every night," Ferreira said. "It puts more 
emphasis on every game." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson was amazed the Ducks were tied with the Kings the first time 
the teams met, Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 30, and the standings are the same. And the Ducks, who would probably 
taken 15 victories this season and been happy, given the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum said the team started really believing about the time they got their 
12th road victory this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Ducks get seriously upset when they lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody realizes the importance of every game -- that's because we're 
close," Ferreira said. "When there's disappointment after a loss, it's because 
we didn't get the two points we should have gotten."

'YOU CAN'T EXPECT MORE THAN YOU ARE GIVEN'; BASKETBALL: COACH JIM HARRICK KNOWS 
IT'S NOT EASY BEING A WALK-ON FOR NO. 1 UCLA, BUT HUNTINGTON BEACH'S TOMMY 
WALDEN THINKS IT'S GREAT ANYWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tommy Walden gathers some UCLA classmates together a few times a month at a 
Westwood pizza parlor, but more than just pepperoni and anchovies are on the 
menu. 
</P>
<P>
 They come not so much for the pizza but the TV. They catch nearly every 
telecast of the Bruin basketball team's road games, cheering every rim-swaying 
dunk by Ed O'Bannon and sweet pass by Tyus Edney. 
</P>
<P>
 But at home games, you'll find Walden cheering not from the Pauley Pavilion 
student section, but from the Bruin bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden, a freshman from Huntington Beach, has the demanding and often 
thankless role of a walk-on with the top-ranked Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 All week, he makes sure starters such as Edney and O'Bannon don't coast 
through practices. 
</P>
<P>
 His reward: wearing jersey No. 22 for all home games. Playing time is 
optional. 
</P>
<P>
 For road games? A seat in front of the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA carries only one walk-on -- forward Bob Myers -- on its travel roster. 
Myers has seniority, and the Bruins need him for depth on the front line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of weird watching us on TV," Walden said. "They'll pan down the 
bench, and I'm not there. That's strange, especially after you have practiced 
all week with the guys you're watching." 
</P>
<P>
 Walden has appeared in only five games this season, playing nine minutes. He 
played three minutes in an early-season game against Nevada Las Vegas but only 
two minutes since Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bruins build a lead around 15 points, Walden's parents, Tom Sr. and 
Deborah, often hear fans lobbying for their son: 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy! Tommy!  
</P>
<P>
 But they rarely see him play. Walden is the only Bruin who hasn't scored this 
season. He has taken only two shots and has one rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is quite a change from what I'm used to," said Walden, a 6-foot-2 guard 
who started three seasons at Huntington Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I can't be upset about playing time. It really doesn't bother me because 
I'm a walk-on. That's my role. This might sound strange, but I actually enjoy 
practices. They're fun." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Jim Harrick found in Walden several things he seeks in walk-ons -- 
good fundamental skills, quickness, shooting ability and potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "But most of all," Harrick said, "you need to have the right attitude to be a 
walk-on. You can't expect more than you are given." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not much. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden doesn't stay on the athletic dormitory floors but with the regular 
students. He eats at the cafeteria, not the training table. He and his parents 
pay for tuition and books. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden says he doesn't worry about scholarships and benefits. He came to UCLA 
for an education. He's getting it. As a kid, he dreamed of playing basketball 
at UCLA. And now he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I complain?" he said, looking up at the national championship banners 
amid the rafters. "This is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Unwanted and unrecruited by Division I programs, Walden enrolled at UCLA as a 
pre-med major. He wasn't considering a second major in hoops. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Huntington Beach senior, he averaged 13 points and helped the Oilers to 
the Southern California Regional semifinals. A fine student with a 3.73 
grade-point average, Walden applied to some of California's top schools -- Cal, 
UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara and UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 But only three small schools -- UC San Diego, Colorado School of Mines and 
Ohio Wesleyan, were interested in his basketball skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really surprised me," Huntington Beach Coach Roy Miller said. "Here you 
have a 6-2 kid who can run the floor and play defense. He's very quick, very 
intelligent and can handle the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an outstanding student, and he can play ball, so I found it hard to 
believe that nobody (in Division I) actively pursued him." 
</P>
<P>
 Walden came to UCLA with topics such as chemistry and calculus on his mind, 
not basketball. Before tryouts, he had played only a few times since the Oilers 
lost to Crenshaw in the regional semifinals last March. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring, he started part-time at outside hitter for Huntington Beach's 
volleyball team that won the Southern Section Division I championship. During 
the summer, he took a two-week tour of Egypt, a graduation gift from his aunt, 
Celonia Walden. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was an experience that will probably never be matched," Walden said. "We 
saw everything -- the pyramids, the Sphinx. There was so much history, so many 
things I never knew about. 
</P>
<P>
 "My summers had been so compacted with sports, I never had one off. But last 
summer, I did nothing athletically inclined." 
</P>
<P>
 After a month at UCLA, Walden pondered trying out for basketball. He was out 
of shape, so he started shooting and playing pickup games. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't sure if he was good enough to make such a talented team but changed 
his mind after talking with his parents and Cameron Dollar, the Bruins' 
freshman guard from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cameron was sitting in front of the student union one day, and I just walked 
up to him and told him I was thinking about trying out," Walden said. "He told 
me that if I didn't give it a try, I would always have this bad feeling in my 
gut, wondering if I could have made it." 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation from student to student-athlete hasn't been easy. Practices 
limit his study time, but he's keeping his grades up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember coaches from UC San Diego telling me that I would have to set 
aside 1,000 hours just for basketball," Walden said. "With academics and 
basketball, that would mean my social life would be hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents told me they would support me playing and going to school, but 
they warned me that my education still had to come first, or basketball would 
have to go." 
</P>
<P>
 That explains why Walden left practices early twice a week during first 
semester. History and chemistry classes he had scheduled in the fall conflicted 
with UCLA's afternoon practices. Harrick cut Walden a break so he didn't have 
to cut class. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden's future with the Bruins remains in Harrick's hands. Will he earn a 
scholarship as David Boyle, a walk-on from Mater Dei, did last season? Or will 
he fall by the wayside when the Bruins bring in next year's recruiting class, 
which many experts are calling the best in the nation? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about Tommy's future in our program," Harrick said. "But he may 
have one in another program, if he chooses to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Walden practices, and occasionally plays, with the nation's 
top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look up and see all the banners hanging from the ceiling and you realize 
this is the tops of the tops in the country," he said. "But all the guys here 
are cool -- the scholarship guys all the way down the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no egos. They make you feel like you're part of the team. That's 
one of the main reasons why we're doing so well."

MIKE PENNER: JOHNSON SPEAKS TRUTH, VOLUMES ABOUT THIS ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You probably didn't hear it, because it wasn't planted on some Dallas radio 
talk show, to be beamed off satellites into the living rooms of millions of 
American households, where hourly Tonya Harding updates could be interrupted 
for this-breaking-news-bulletin, but Jimmy Johnson has again predicted victory 
for the Dallas Cowboys in today's Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 He said it at Tuesday's media day, during a discussion/dissection of the 
Buffalo Bills' fragile psyche. It has been preserved on micro-cassette 
recording tape, played and replayed, in the pursuit of clarity and accuracy, 
and I quote:  
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's got to be some frustration with Buffalo. They've lost four 
Super Bowls in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there's got to be some frustration in Buffalo. To this point, the Bills 
have played in only three Super Bowls, lost them all, won't play another until 
the sun sets in Atlanta this evening . . . and already Johnson has them down 
for four.  
</P>
<P>
 Freudian slip? 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly. Johnson has never met a football game he didn't think he could win, 
and with a mouth powered by Diehard battery, that tongue is bound to commit a 
turnover every now and then.  
</P>
<P>
 Nothing but the truth? 
</P>
<P>
 So help the Bills. If Johnson was caught looking ahead, he wasn't alone. Super 
Bowl XXVIII has become Foregone Conclusion II. In the four-year de-evolution of 
the Bills as Super Bowl contenders, their pre-kickoff chances have looked 
something like this:  
</P>
<P>
 XXV: The better team. 
</P>
<P>
 XXVI: Evenly matched.  
</P>
<P>
 XXVII: The lesser team, though Dallas is young and unproven and possibly ripe 
for an ambush, though, then again, this is Buffalo we're talking about.  
</P>
<P>
 XXVIII: Blindfold and cigarette? 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo's margin of Super Bowl defeat has grown exponentially, from one point 
to 13 points to 35 points to what? The league record for biggest 
championship-game blowout is 73-0, Chicago over Washington, 1940. The Super 
Bowl record for biggest blowout is 55-10, San Francisco over Denver, early 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep those numbers handy today, because with the Bills on one side of the 
football and Johnson ("If we've got 41 points, I want 51") on the other, they 
could serve as helpful reference material.  
</P>
<P>
 In a perfect world, a team coached by Marv Levy would be able to beat a team 
coached by Johnson. Levy is the Super Bowl's foremost tragic figure, a likable, 
sensitive, good-humored, highly intelligent man who in no way deserves the 
cruel fate he has been dealt. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy's daily sessions with the media were free-form parlor discussions, with 
the conversation roaming from Dickens to Patton to the Battle of the Bulge to 
the no-huddle offense to the ethical treatment of animals.  
</P>
<P>
 And he wasn't referring to the endangered buffalo.  
</P>
<P>
 Levy remembered when he was "about 12 years old and went out in the woods with 
some people, and they shot a bird. And I looked at that bird and thought, 'Why 
do we come out here and call it fun to kill this creature, who was as happy as 
I was when I got up this morning?' I just don't understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy is one coach who has studied football and has studied the great battles 
of history and can tell the difference between the two. He talked about a Bills 
fan who calls his radio show every week to chide the coach for not taking the 
game seriously enough.  
</P>
<P>
 Every week, the fan tells Levy, "Coach, you're not doing the right thing. 
You've got to tell your players football is war, this is war, I'm telling you." 
</P>
<P>
 Each time, Levy would tell the caller he's wrong, football isn't even in the 
same ballpark with war, until last week. Then, Levy told him, "I've done you a 
disservice. I checked back in history and interviewed a bunch of guys who 
landed on the beaches of Iwo Jima and Normandy, and when they went in, they 
were all yelling, 'This is football!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, on the other hand, could have been that caller. In his view, the 
world is flat, green, 100 yards long and striped with chalk. His social sphere 
is about as big as the diamond-loaded Super Bowl ring on his left hand, because 
the game is the only thing that matters, and "I don't want to go to a party 
where some lady in a big bouffant hairdo is asking me what's the name of my 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson spent most of his Super Bowl week talking up Jimmy Johnson, in some 
shape or form.  
</P>
<P>
 See this ring here? Big, isn't it? "By the way," Johnson says, "I had a large, 
large part in designing this ring. And I designed the national championship 
ring at Miami . . . Put a flawless three-karat Marquis in my Miami ring. I 
bought it myself, by the way. That ring is worth more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, if any jeweler out there needs any assistance or advice . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 When a Charlotte television crew informed Johnson that the owner of the 
expansion Panthers is predicting a Super Bowl title within 10 years, Johnson 
shot back, "Good for you, happy for Charlotte." Then he fired off his resume. 
"Now, if they offer me $10 million to coach their team. Give me a new franchise 
with an open checkbook. I'll beat their prediction." 
</P>
<P>
 In less than 10 years? 
</P>
<P>
 " Much less." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the real world.  
</P>
<P>
 Here, professional football championships are won with swagger, obsession, 
tunnel vision and a gluttonous accumulation of talent. Talk to Levy, and you 
sense he could have been many things in this life -- historian, fiction writer, 
English professor. Talk to Johnson and you know he was born to do this and only 
this -- coach the Dallas Cowboys.  
</P>
<P>
 The difference is reflected in the two teams. Levy's Bills are smart and 
sensitive, which is why the Buffalo jokes and the national Anybody But The 
Bills sentiment truly seems to bother them. They ought to be loose -- it can't 
get any worse, right? -- but they were on the defensive all week here.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, meanwhile, are faster, quicker, stronger and cockier, because 
Johnson designed it that way. Hate us, love us, good for you, happy for 
Charlotte, we couldn't care less. Levy worries about his players and the 
emotional fallout from another defeat today. Johnson sees a player nodding off 
in a team meeting and cuts him.  
</P>
<P>
 It's an unkind world, and life isn't fair, and in this game, nothing is 
well-rounded, not even the ball.  
</P>
<P>

BACKPACK & BUDGET; CHEAP SLEEPS NEAR WINTER RESORT AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Skiers can sleep for less than $20 near many of North America's most popular 
winter resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canada and the United States, more than 60 hostels are situated near major 
downhill and cross-country ski areas. Rates for a bed in a dormitory-style room 
average $7 to $20 per bed, per night. Some hostels also have packages that 
include lift tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 You can find out about these types of facilities through tourist information 
offices, guidebooks and the hostels themselves. (Some hostels are linked 
through associations; other independent hostels tend to promote each other.) 
</P>
<P>
 Most hostels have cooking facilities, allowing travelers to avoid expensive 
resort restaurants. Hostels also help solo travelers keep their costs down if 
they don't mind sharing a room with a stranger. Some hostels, such as the 
Hostelling International (HI) facilities in Lake Louise and Banff, Alberta, in 
the Canadian Rockies, have private rooms for couples and families. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the sites and packages available through Hostelling 
International this winter. The rates are set for HI members; non-members may be 
asked to pay a surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-bed Winter Park, Colo., hostel (telephone 303-726-5356) is at an 
altitude of about 9,000 feet, right at Winter Park's Mary Jane ski area, which 
has 106 trails and 20 lifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can also take advantage of 60 miles of groomed cross-country trails, 
plus a 3,000-foot alpine slide. There is also winter inner-tubing. The hostel 
has many double rooms and is within walking distance of services. Beds are $11 
per night. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-bed Hilton Creek International hostel (tel. 619-935-4989), which is on 
the eastern slope of the California Sierra, normally charges $11 (plus tax) per 
bed, per night. It also offers "Introduction to Ski Touring" packages for 
backcountry explorers. Cross-country ski equipment is available for rent, and 
there is a hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-bed Pocono Hostel (tel. 717-676-9076) is one of nine Pennsylvania 
hostels near downhill and cross-country ski areas. This rustic lodge, where 
beds are available for $8 per night, is only two hours from New York City and 
is close to 10 downhill ski areas, including Mt. Pocono, Alpine Mountain and 
Camelback. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers can relax by a wood stove in the century-old, 18-bed Trojan Horse 
hostel in Ludlow, Vt. (tel. 802-228-5244). It's near the Okemo Mountain ski 
area and within 25 miles of nine other ski areas, including Killington and 
Stratton Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, contact the hostels directly or the headquarters for 
Hostelling International-American Youth Hostels, 733 15th St. N.W., No. 840, 
Washington, D.C. 20005; tel. (202) 783-6161. In Santa Monica, there is an 
office at 1434 2nd St.; tel. (310) 393-3413. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's Lake Louise is a World Heritage Site. Its 100-bed Hostelling 
International hostel (tel. 403-522-2200) has a stone fireplace and is operated 
with the assistance of the Alpine Club of Canada. This winter, travelers can 
arrange a bed for a night plus a one-day lift pass (including breakfast and a 
shuttle bus to the mountain) for about $37. There are also three-day versions 
of this package that range from $134 to $140, depending on the date of your 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight accommodations at the 154-bed Banff International Hostel, with lift 
tickets and bus transportation to the Mt. Norquay or Sunshine ski areas is $46 
for one day or $129 for three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Ski-and-sleep packages are available for the 52 trails at Marmot Basin in 
Jasper National Park. You can stay at Whistler's Mountain Hostel, or the 
Athabasca Falls and Maligne Canyon hostels. One-day ski-and-sleep packages 
range from about $26 to $30. Reservations must be made through the Hostelling 
International Travel Shop in Edmonton; call (403) 439-3139. 
</P>

DESTINATION: QUEBEC; WHERE WINTER WORKS; WHY GO TO CANADA IN FEBRUARY? QUEBEC'S 
CARNIVAL PROVIDES A HISTORIC VENUE FOR CELEBRATING THE BIG CHILL.

<P>
 Perched on a cliff overlooking the St. Lawrence River, Quebec City appears 
from a distance like a vision from a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Cloaked in a mantle of snow and trimmed in glistening icicles, rows of 
steep-roofed, stone row houses climb along a warren of narrow cobbled streets 
to a crowning castle that bristles with copper-roofed turrets. Yet when I am 
within the city's embrace, walking those narrow medieval streets, a frosty wind 
nipping at my ears, the words that come to mind are not those of a fairy tale, 
but of Quebec's most famous contemporary poet, Gilles Vigneault, who wrote, "My 
country is not a country, it is winter . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing could be truer of Quebec City when it is locked in the jaws of ice and 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, would anyone dream of heading north to Canada in February? For the 
five years I have lived in Montreal -- 150 miles southwest of Quebec City -- I 
have rarely missed an opportunity to visit the city's pre-Lenten carnival 
celebration, not just for the planned events, but to join the locals and others 
from around the world in welcoming winter's chill full on, during an 11-day 
frozen Mardi Gras. 
</P>
<P>
 From Feb. 3 to 13 this year, the Carnaval de Quebec is a full calendar of dog 
sled races, ice canoeing competitions and -- for those, unlike me, with iron 
constitutions -- outdoor "snow baths," which means taking a tumble in frozen 
powder dressed in only a swimming suit. I do, however, bring my own skates for 
a modest little whirl around the outdoor rinks -- some set up especially for 
carnival in parks and along the St. Lawrence River. For those with confidence 
enough, there is organized barrel jumping on skates. (I take a pass on this.) 
Even horses don spiked shoes to race on the ice of the frozen Charles River. So 
I bundle up, stomp my feet to the rhythm of a French Canadian jig being played 
over loudspeakers and watch in astonishment as the Quebeckers' famous joie de 
vivre expresses itself in various ways including dancing in the streets, 
despite temperatures that may hover near 10 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec, as the city is usually known, is home to 500,000 people. But within 
the modern metropolis beats an ancient and still vigorous heart locals call 
"Vieux Quebec," Old Quebec. Through 4 1/2 centuries, this exquisite 
half-square-mile of European ambience, brimming with more than 3,000 historic 
buildings, has aged like fine French cognac. Cradled by massive granite and 
sandstone ramparts, it is the only walled city north of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern Quebec grew up outside these walls and though the historic district 
fell into substantial disrepair, it was not razed, as city centers elsewhere 
were. Instead, during the 1960s and '70s, people began moving back into the old 
quarter, restoring whole streets and infusing them once again with life. 
Finally, in 1985 UNESCO declared Old Quebec a World Heritage Site, the first 
city in North America to join the designation that also includes Jerusalem, the 
Taj Mahal and the Pyramids. Most of the festivities of carnival take place in 
and around Old Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the events or prowling the warren of winding streets in the old city, 
I soon feel the winter chill making its way through my parka and boots -- the 
perfect excuse to duck into one of the many cafes or pastry shops on the main 
shopping streets of rue St. Louis and rue St. Jean. In the true French style, 
most establishments post their menus outside beneath the light of Victorian 
street lamps and temptingly display their pastries and cakes in the windows, 
making them all the more difficult to resist. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec food is a specialty that is hard to find elsewhere. I have a soft spot 
for this hearty cuisine that was created with winter in mind: pea soup rich 
with smoked ham chunks, maple sugar sweetened baked beans, tourtiere, a main 
course pie made from a selection of game meats, and sinfully decadent maple 
syrup pie served warm and topped with whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Being rather sentimental, I find one of the nicest ways to explore Old Quebec 
during carnival to be from the comfort of a caleche, wrapped in a cozy fur rug 
as my driver, his curling mustache sparkling with ice crystals, directs the 
horse-drawn carriage past beautiful, Notre-Dame-de-Quebec cathedral, past 
Quebec Seminary, one of the first universities in North America, and past the 
bustling cobblestone pedestrian street rue de Tresor -- a narrow sliver of 
Paris' Montmartre, where artists hang their sketches and paintings outdoors for 
sale even in the depths of winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dry snow scrunches under my feet on the broad wooden boardwalk of Dufferin 
Terrace that skirts the Chateau Frontenac, one of Canada's grand railway hotels 
built in 1893. Although I had to book six months in advance of my 1993 carnival 
visit, staying at the Chateau, with its old English Tudor interior and 
spectacular views of the city, was truly romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the crooked maze of streets I have found surprises at almost every 
turn by asking the question: "What did this used to be?" Everyone, from waiters 
to workmen, suddenly becomes an amateur historian, in the city where it seems 
everything was once something else. One day my lunch is served in La Couchon 
Dingue, which turns out to be a former 19th-Century police station. On another, 
in the Pape George (Pope George), a cozy wine bar with low-beamed ceilings and 
three-foot-thick walls, the barman opens a thick portfolio of engravings he 
plucks from beneath the counter to show me the place as a fur store dating back 
to the 1750s. 
</P>
<P>
 With a furry bearhug I meet Bonhomme, carnival's master of ceremonies and 
mascot -- a jolly snowman wearing a red toque and braided sash of the hearty 
hommes du nord -- men of the north -- whose intrepid pioneering spirit has been 
the inspiration for carnival since it began in 1954. Bonhomme's residence is in 
the 75-foot-high palace made of snow blocks that is carnival's centerpiece. And 
it's here, just outside medieval St. Louis Gate, that I grab a toboggan and 
slide down the icy incline that takes me in a breathtaking whoosh, from the top 
of the castle to the ground, perhaps 40 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonhomme's smiling countenance also appears on the tops of hollow carnival 
canes that are filled with a traditional brew of red wine and spirits that make 
a blend called Caribou. The concoction -- which carries the kick of its 
namesake -- helped the early explorers stay warm, a role it still performs each 
year at carnival where it is illegal to drink from a bottle outdoors but 
acceptable to tip the cane for a sip. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnival spills outside the old city walls and down nearby Grande Allee, a 
broad and elegant avenue of Victorian stone row houses converted to stylish 
restaurants. It's here I head to watch entrants from a dozen countries take 
part in the International Snow Sculpture Competition, where they chip and saw 
away at great blocks of ice from which emerge a fantastic repertoire of 
serpents, polar bears, a Statue of Liberty, larger than life Eskimos and an 
entire family on a giant sled. 
</P>
<P>
 Stomping my feet and slapping my hands together to keep warm, I await the 
grand finale of the festival, the two-mile-long canoe race across the ice 
choked St. Lawrence River to Levis on the south bank and back. Ice canoeing is 
a traditional sport that was once the only means of transport to many islands 
in the river during winter. As an ice breaker travels to and fro to keep a 
pathway open, the starting gun sends the five-man team off, alternately rowing 
with long oars in open water or running across the bluish ice slabs with metal 
crampons on their shoes.  
</P>
<P>
 A little over 30 minutes later, I am still among thousands of spectators 
stoically lining the river banks to cheer as the first boat touches the 
shoreline. In true hommes du nord style the winning team does a victory leap, 
almost making my own heart stop as they plunge backward into the cold 
thickening waters. I swear I feel a shiver pass through the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening carnival draws to a close with a spectacular candlelight parade 
winding through the streets. Sure it's cold outside watching the glittering 
floats pass by, but there's been something in the air these past 11 days: a 
gaiety and sense of celebration that truly warms the heart. GUIDEBOOK

GRAND ILLUSIONS; HANDMADE CARNEVALE MASKS ARE MODESTLY PRICED COLLECTORS' ITEMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm standing in La Bottega dei Mascareri, a tiny mask-making studio in the 
shadow of Venice's Rialto Bridge. The proprietor, Sergio Boldrin, is chatting 
amiably with customers as he applies a wash of white tempera to a cartapesta 
(papier-mache) face that will, by week's end, join the staggering cavalcade of 
creatures looking down at me from walls, shelves and cases. 
</P>
<P>
 High above, a gold-faced and green-haired Medusa hangs just far enough away 
that I feel safe from her glare. A row of black and white Jokers gazes 
pleasantly at the crescent moons, gilt unicorns and elaborately coiffed, 
resplendent ladies across the way. Brightly painted commedia dell'arte 
characters (Pantaloon, Harlequin and company) parade across the shelf to my 
left, providing an illustrated history of the well-known Italian masked comedy 
from which so many of the popular masks are derived. Every surface in the shop 
-- less than 10 feet square -- is taken up with finished products or tools of 
the trade: stacks of paper, glue pots, a variety of paintbrushes and 
watercolors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are an estimated 200 shops selling masks in Venice but only about 15 
mask-makers use the traditional techniques. Of the 10 or so mask artists and, 
perhaps, 100 shops I have visited, there are three that I enjoy revisiting 
because of the beauty of their work, their reasonable prices and because the 
mask-makers seem to like to discuss their work, endowing me, for my efforts, 
with an education, as well as a mask. Fortunately, I speak Italian but there 
almost always seems to be someone in each of the shops who speaks English. 
</P>
<P>
 Though I am here in the fall of 1993 and the annual carnevale is still four 
months away -- this year, Feb. 5-15 -- production is already in high gear. For 
a Venetian, the mask-maker assumes prime importance as February blows in and 
brings carnevale (carnival) with it. Yet for the average tourist -- and 
especially for a devotee of the art like me -- mask shopping is a year-round 
delight. 
</P>
<P>
 When I leave La Bottega dei Mascareri, I'll catch a vaporetto and cruise to 
the Ca'Rezzonico stop for a visit to Ca' Macana, another of my favorite 
mask-making workshops. After that I will probably take the 20-minute stroll 
through the tiny alleys near Campo San Polo to another shop -- the endlessly 
fascinating Tragicomica, where the selection of fine handiwork is so 
overwhelming that I sometimes spend half the afternoon trying to make a 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, I look around La Bottega dei Mascareri as Boldrin holds forth in his 
charming and knowledgeable way, his paintbrush in constant motion as he speaks, 
and I try to decide which mask to buy. I finally settle on one of the commedia 
figures: Boldrin insists that I choose Pantaloon, for "he is one of the most 
important characters." 
</P>
<P>
 The character -- a pompous, beak-nosed merchant, clad in the pantaloons that 
got their name from him -- will soon join his cohorts on my wall at home . . . 
relics of past visits to Venice and the Bottega: Coviello, dancing boldly, his 
cape billowing from outstretched arms, and Zanni, the servant/clown (and origin 
of the word zany ), whose mischievous gaze and feathered turban are a 
delightful contrast to Pantaloon's vain attempt at dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a great fondness for these three particular masks that show the entire 
costumed character portrayed in colorful relief across their faces, but they're 
certainly not alone on the wall of my New York apartment. In fact, as a result 
of the four trips I've made to Venice in as many years, my living room has 
begun to take on the look of a carnevale outpost. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the mask of the round-faced woman I bought in Ca' Macana four years 
ago, a $25 wonder almost a foot in diameter. Bold flowers cascade over the 
slices of yellow, red, pink and blue that intersect across her hair; her 
crimson lips are outlined in gold, while silver sequins trace the contours of 
her almond eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 A delicate orange, gold and black butterfly -- elegant far beyond its $25 
price tag -- floats above a hook-nosed, stunningly three-dimensional Pulcinella 
I picked up at Tragicomica two years ago for $40. A graceful silver-faced 
Persian lady, swathed in a cloud of pink, glances up at a psychedelic sunburst 
from which dangle thick black ribbons (both under $30). While none of my masks 
set me back more than $40, and some purchased last fall were as little as $12, 
a mask-lover with boundless imagination and limitless funds could easily spend 
a hundred dollars, or several hundred, for a custom-designed creation. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm certainly not alone in my admiration for (and acquisition of) these 
uniquely Venetian products. The masks are the products of an artistic heritage 
that has prospered for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only papier-mache in Venice is the real mask," Boldrin says. The craftsperson 
creates art in the time-honored manner, shaping the glue and paper mixture in a 
clay mold before giving it its tempera wash, watercolor embellishment and final 
sealing coat of hot wax. 
</P>
<P>
 The technique has survived for centuries and achieved great expression in the 
commedia dell'arte, which thrived for 200 years, beginning in the 16th Century. 
Many February revelers still cloak themselves in the garb of the 400-year-old 
characters, whose names evoke a colorful world of comedic tradition: Brighella, 
Pulcinella, Arlecchino, Capitano, Pantaloon, Balanzone . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But disguise flourished even after the commedia declined and the theater began 
to abandon masks for a greater realism. It was at this time, in the mid-to-late 
1700s, that the annual pre-Lenten carnival reached its height, drawing 
incognito revelers from all regions. For the merchant frequenting Venice's 
ubiquitous gambling dens, or the lawmaker slipping off to a nocturnal liaison, 
the protection of the tricorno (three-cornered hat), tabarro (cape) and above 
all, the cloaking bautta (mask) was indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern-day visitors can imagine the mask-maker of yesteryear, when Venice was 
the party capital of Europe and its licentious carnevale a six-month affair, 
culminating, as it does today, with Fat Tuesday, the last day before Lent. The 
18th-Century fetes began in October and featured sword dances, bear-baitings, 
beheadings of bulls and pigs, immense human pyramids, flower-bearing tightrope 
walkers and, in 1751, the sensational presentation of the first live rhinoceros 
to appear in Venice. So famous was the event that Pietro Longhi painted a 
rendering of the rhino presentation, which now hangs in the Museo del 
Settecento Veneziano in Ca'Rezzonico (although it is on loan to the Museo 
Correr through April 4). 
</P>
<P>
 Today's carnevale was revived in the early 1980s by the local tourist board, 
which -- after an absence of any official celebration for nearly 200 years -- 
embraced the smaller parties that had always occurred and elaborated on them 
with a program of events. Though it is perhaps less known in North America than 
carnivals in New Orleans or Rio, Venice's carnevale attracts more than 100,000 
people -- many of them Europeans -- according to official estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks just before Lent, the city is turned over to revelry as locals 
and visitors fill the town, clad in outrageous costumes and luxuriant masks. 
Dances, competitions, masked balls, theatrical presentations and other 
spectacles are presented day and night, though the real delights lie in the 
spontaneous and free-wheeling displays by masked celebrators on every corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of disguise still appeals, and the range of possibilities is 
unlimited, as I realize on my annual pilgrimage to Ca' Macana, a lively 
workshop run by Carlo Brassesco who, with his partner, Mario, employs about 10 
young artisans year-round for the making of masks. 
</P>
<P>
 Several craftspeople are always at work in the shop's two rooms, and the 
merchandise is as varied as the prices. The simple masks in white, black and 
red run as little as $12, with most pieces in the vast inventory between $30 
and $50. Brassesco describes with relish the wide selection: "All kinds of 
masks, large and small, theatrical masks, traditional carnival masks, styles 
popular in the Middle Ages, and also masks of fantasia. We can make anything to 
order." The shop hums with the bustle of the young artists, and it's fun to 
whisk away a newly dry piece that has just been placed on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tragicomica, the affable and accomplished Gualtiero Dall'Osto creates not 
only masks but complete costumes, as well. "Historical, traditional, fantasy 
masks," Dall'Osto recites the litany with infectious enthusiasm, as a stunning 
parade of noblemen, grand ladies, zodiac-inspired figures and mythical beasts 
nod their mute approval, "la bautta, la dama, commedia characters, masks with 
feathers, any individual idea that a person wants to present." 
</P>
<P>
 Shall I choose a simple, white bautta ($15), or a jazzier gold-leafed version 
of this traditional mask ($40)? Maybe I'll impersonate the pompous Dottore or 
the mustachioed braggart Capitano. Like most of Dall'Osto's lovingly re-created 
commedia masks, these range from $30 to $55. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting Tragicomica's studios (there are now two) puts me in the company of 
such illustrious clients as Venice's opera house La Fenice and famed Belgian 
choreographer Maurice Bejart. For me, the sign in Tragicomica's window says it 
as well as the scowling, grinning, plumed and florid faces that peer out from 
the shop. Fabbrica Trasformazioni, it's called: "Factory of Transformations."

DESTINATION: NEW YORK; ROOM RELIEF IN MANHATTAN; DESPITE HIGH TAXES, THE BIG 
APPLE HAS A RANGE OF LODGING PRICES 
</P>

 When your arms are heavy with shopping bags and your feet beg for relief, 
there's nothing like kicking back on a soft bed or comfortable couch. But in 
Manhattan, the price of doing so can be more pain than pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 With one of the highest hotel taxes in the country, the city has long suffered 
a bad reputation for being too out of reach for those who want to lay down 
their sleepy heads in Big Appledom. 
</P>
<P>
 But can you stay overnight in the city without breaking the bank? Actually, 
yes. "That's a myth of New York -- that there are no inexpensive hotels 
available," said Jeanine Moss, director of communications for the New York 
Convention & Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're willing to forgo 24-hour room service, health clubs and an 
extravagance of space, there are a number of affordable hotels from which to 
choose. And if you want to wallow in luxury, New York City hoteliers are happy 
to serve you. 
</P>
<P>
 (But don't forget those hefty taxes. For rooms costing $99 and less, the tax 
is 14.25% plus a $2 hotel occupancy tax each night. Taxes jump to 19.25% for 
rooms costing $100 and more, plus $2 hotel occupancy tax each night.) 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some options: * The Franklin, 164 East 87th Street near Lexington 
Avenue (telephone 212-369-1000), made a splash this summer when it opened its 
chic doors and found elite models and artsy types clamoring to stay in its 53 
tiny rooms. But the lack of space is made up in a generous dose of style. The 
charming rooms can be described as Jetsons meets Bauhaus: stainless-steel 
sinks, cherrywood desks topped with polished black granite, cedar closets, 
back-lit canopied beds draped with sheer voile. Each room has a TV/VCR (borrow 
a tape from the free video library in the lobby). At $115 for a single room 
with one double bed, The Franklin is sure to do heavy repeat business. Rates: 
$115 single, $125 double. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hotel Beacon, 2130 Broadway at 75th Street (tel. 800-572-4969), is the hip 
place to stay in the Upper West Side. This recently renovated property (130 
rooms) is also a hotel within an apartment building with full-time residents. 
Each room features a kitchenette with in-room coffee maker, full refrigerator, 
stove and sink. Suites, with a separate bedroom, can fit four. Rates: $99 
double, $140 suite. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ameritania Hotel, 1701 Broadway at 54th Street (tel. 212-247- 5000), is a 
recently renovated hotel (235 rooms) in an apartment building that has some 
full-time residents. But it has a measure of coolness and the added cachet of 
being neighbors of David Letterman. Rates: $149 for a double.  
</P>
<P>
 * Hotel Macklowe, 145 West 44th St. between Broadway and 6th Avenue (tel. 
212-768-4400). This midtown high-rise in the theater district has all the 
luxuries of the major chain hotels but none of the tackiness. The lobby soars 
in Art Deco with extensive use of black marble and African mahogany. The 
hotel's 629 rooms on 52 stories exude a cool elegance, Ask to be situated as 
high as possible facing south, or, better yet, in the corner rooms facing west 
and north, and you're in for a skyline treat. Rates start at $195 for a single 
and $210 for a double. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paramount Hotel, 235 West 46th St. between Broadway and 8th Avenue (tel. 
800-225-7474), is a charmer, popular with European visitors and artsy types. 
And why not? The Philippe Starck-designed lobby and guest rooms wear style on 
their sleeves. Pose in the lobby, mezzanine lounge or adjoining Whiskey bar. 
The 610 rooms are minuscule, but with a whimsical flair. Rates: $155-$205 for a 
double. A weekend package goes for $165 a night and includes breakfast and 
choice of free parking or video rental. 
</P>
<P>
 * Manhattan East Suite Hotels (tel. 800-637-8483), operates nine hotel 
properties throughout the city, offering mini-suites (all with kitchenettes and 
living room areas) that are clean and spacious. My favorite hotels in the 
collection are the Plaza Fifty, 155 East 50th St.; Shelburne Murray Hill, 303 
Lexington Ave.; Dumont Plaza, 150 East 34th St., and Eastgate Tower, 222 East 
39th St. For families, Manhattan East is a gem. Double-occupancy rates at most 
of the hotels range from $165 for a studio to $435 for a two-bedroom suite. The 
two most luxurious properties, Beekman Tower Hotel at 3 Mitchell Place and 
Surrey Hotel at 20 East 76th St., range $290-$370.  
</P>
<P>
 And if you are ready to wallow: 
</P>
<P>
 * By far the most eagerly awaited new building in Manhattan has been I.M. 
Pei's stunning Four Seasons Hotel New York on 57th Street between Madison and 
Park -- shopper's heaven. Rising 52 stories in dramatic step-backs, this power 
spire claims to be the tallest hotel in New York. It is certainly one of the 
grandest. 
</P>
<P>
 My room on the 37th floor only slightly disappointed. For $295 -- the least 
expensive room -- I somehow expected more pampering. But I was charmed by the 
bronzed tone of the bedspread (hiding Frette sheets), the muted Scalamandre 
wall coverings and scrumptious English sycamore. In the bathroom, wall-to-wall 
Florentine marble, I found generous bathrobes, luxury soaps and shampoos and 
linen hand towels. Stunning views south and west allowed me to gaze at the 
Empire State Building and Central Park.  
</P>
<P>
 Four Seasons Hotel New York (309 rooms, 58 suites), 57 East 57th St.; tel. 
(212) 758-5700. Rates: $380-$480, single, for rooms ranging from "superior" to 
"deluxe park view"; $420-$520, double.

WINTER TRAVEL; WHERE TO GO FOR OFF-SEASON VACATIONS; FROM SUN TO SNOW, SOME 
LIKELY LOW-COST GETAWAY SPOTS IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Even if your post-holiday wallet is thin, a midwinter getaway isn't out of the 
question. True, if you fancy a resort hotel beside a palm-shaded Caribbean 
beach, you can expect to pay top dollar. But there are many overlooked travel 
bargains available now -- if you know where to find them. 
</P>
<P>
 About 133 million Americans are expected to take a winter vacation trip of 
more than 100 miles, an increase of 3% over last winter, according to a survey 
by the Travel Industry Association of America and the American Automobile Assn. 
The period covers December through February, which includes the busy holiday 
travel season. The overwhelming majority (76%) will go by car, 21% by plane and 
3% by train, bus or boat. The average trip will be for four nights at a cost of 
$907. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep your travel costs low -- or to stay in luxurious lodgings you couldn't 
otherwise afford -- the idea is to go to inviting places where winter is 
considered the off season. Lodging is plentiful and almost always cheaper, and 
often other incentives such as reduced meal prices are offered. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, northern Florida is too chilly now for a beach vacation, but the 
weather remains mild enough for good golf and tennis. Amelia Island Plantation, 
a beautiful seaside golf and tennis resort just north of Jacksonville, 
currently is advertising three nights for the price of two through February.  
</P>
<P>
 If cultural Europe is your interest, winter can be a much better time for a 
transatlantic visit than the summer or fall. Air fares to Europe are cheapest 
in winter, budget-priced lodgings are easier to book, the performing arts 
calendars are brimming, and you can tour the art and history museums when they 
are uncrowded.  
</P>
<P>
 Travelers who aren't intimidated by the prospect of cold days have many more 
choices. A week in one of America's top ski resorts, such as Aspen, Vail or 
Deer Valley, can be rough on the budget. But for about $1,200 per person from 
New York (under $1,600 from Los Angeles), you can fly to Lapland in Finland for 
a six-day "Icebreaking Adventure."  
</P>
<P>
 Other offbeat possibilities include a visit to a northern city such as Boston, 
which has its own cultural and historical riches. Through February, the Bed and 
Breakfast Agency of Boston is promising a three-night stay for the price of two 
nights. The historic cities of the South can be explored on inexpensive driving 
tours with only an occasional threat of bad weather. And not the least of 
winter's travel bargains is Las Vegas, where a good room for two under $50 a 
night is easily found, and the gaming tables and slot machines never shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 To find this season's travel bargains, scan the travel ads, seek 
recommendations from family and friends, consult a travel agent, check into 
airline air/hotel package deals and keep your mind open to going to some place 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 Some destinations where you will find off-season bargains: United States 
</P>
<P>
 Boston: New England's city streets can be numbingly cold in midwinter, but in 
Boston there is a wealth of cultural and historical museums and interesting 
shopping areas to keep you warm indoors. Through February, the Bed and 
Breakfast Agency of Boston, which represents more than 150 bed-and-breakfast 
lodgings in private homes, is offering a three-night stay for the price of two 
nights. Rates begin at $65 a night for one person and $70 a night for two 
people. The lodgings range from waterfront lofts to rooms in Beacon Hill 
townhouses and stately Victorian apartments in Copley Square. For information: 
(800) 248-9262. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The South: While winter storms rage up north, now is a relatively quiet time 
to explore much of the South. A few years back, I took a four-day, midwinter 
driving trip through eastern North Carolina, visiting three historic towns 
along the way. Snow flurries dusted the road one day, but otherwise the getaway 
proved entertaining, relaxing and inexpensive. The three communities, all 
looking much like they did two centuries ago, are Edenton, which is filled with 
fine old mansions; New Bern, which has a restored governor's palace to rival 
the one in Williamsburg, and Beaufort, an old sailing port. I stayed in an inn 
or bed-and-breakfast lodging in each of them. In Beaufort, the Cedars Inn (tel. 
919-728-7036) charges a winter rate of $55 a night for two people on weekdays 
and $75 on weekends, including a full breakfast. For lodging and other 
information, contact the North Carolina Division of Travel and Tourism, 430 N. 
Salisbury St., Raleigh, N.C. 27611; tel. (800) 847-4862. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Florida: Amelia Island Plantation, a deluxe resort that stretches for 
3 1/2 miles along the Atlantic Coast, is offering a three-night stay for the 
price of two nights through February. A large oceanview room for two is $139 a 
night. Sports facilities, scattered among protected sand dunes and marshlands, 
include 21 tennis courts, 45 holes of golf, an indoor spa and pool and miles of 
paved or boardwalk jogging trails. For information, call (800) 874-6878. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas: America's neon-lighted casino capital is one of the liveliest 
cities in the country and one of the least expensive -- that is, if you don't 
lose big at the slot machines or gaming tables. To keep the gamblers pouring 
into town, Las Vegas casino hotels and restaurants offer plenty of good deals. 
If you are flexible and can plan a trip when no major convention is in town, 
you should be able to get a room on weekdays in a good casino hotel beginning 
at as little as $30 a night for two people. The Las Vegas Convention and 
Visitors Authority operates a central reservation service for lodging. For 
information: (702) 892-0777. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii: Yes, Hawaii. A surplus of hotel and condo rooms and a drop in the flow 
of tourists from both the U.S. mainland and Japan have kept lodging prices in 
check. Some of the best Hawaiian rates are in the bustling Waikiki area of 
Honolulu. Repeat visitors to the state generally skip Waikiki en route to more 
romantic resorts on neighboring islands, which feature golf and tennis. But 
Waikiki's beach is lovely, and its strip of high-rise hotels is the jumping-off 
place for tours of the gardens, pineapple plantations and rich Polynesian 
heritage of Honolulu and the island of Oahu. The 104-room Aston Waikiki Circle 
Hotel, which reopened Jan. 1 after a major renovation, is offering rooms 
beginning at $79 a night for two people. For information, call (800) 922-7866. 
Europe 
</P>
<P>
 London: Thick winter fog no longer haunts London's old streets, and overall 
the weather is surprisingly mild. For departures beginning Tuesday through 
March 25, British Airways is offering a six-day "Value Plus" package to London 
called "Castles and Crowns." The cost from LAX begins at $825 per person 
(double), $929 single, depending on choice of hotels. The price includes a lot: 
round-trip air fare, airport transfers, six nights in a London hotel with 
private bath, continental breakfast daily, a London arts season "White Card" 
for entrance to 13 museums, the "Royal Pass" for admission to five palaces, two 
traditional pub lunches, one dinner and a seven-day bus and subway pass. For 
information, call (800) 359-8722. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Finland: Wrap up in your warmest parka for an unusual adventure in Finland's 
northern Lapland. From now into April, a tour operator called FinnWay is 
organizing weekly six-day tours that feature an Arctic Circle "snowmobile 
safari," a lesson in driving a reindeer-drawn sleigh and a cruise on the 
icebreaker Sampo. The price begins at $1,195 per person (double), depending on 
departure date. It includes lodging, daily breakfast, some other meals and 
round-trip fare from New York on Finnair. Air fare from Los Angeles is extra. 
For information, call (800) 526-4927. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Prague, Vienna and Budapest: At this time of year, you will miss the outdoor 
cafes, but you can soak up plenty of atmosphere in the beer halls and 
coffeehouses of these three elegant old capitals. Delta Air Lines is offering 
an 11-day budget package for independent travelers called "The Crowns of 
Central Europe" that begins at $1,229 per person (double) from the West Coast. 
Departures at this rate are Feb. 10 and 24. On the March 10 departure, the rate 
is $1,329; March 24, it's $1,429, and April 7 and 21, the cost is $1,529. 
Single supplement is $190. The price includes round-trip air fare, three nights 
in a tourist-class hotel in each city, first-class train service from Prague to 
Vienna and from Vienna to Budapest, a buffet breakfast daily and a sightseeing 
tour of each city. For information, consult a travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Russia: A number of tour operators have put together bargain-priced, eight-day 
packages to Moscow and St. Petersburg that make Russia one of the best travel 
buys available today. In winter, prices are at their cheapest. In February, 
FinnWay is offering a package, called "Russian Price Break," at $999 per person 
(double). The price includes round-trip air fare from New York on Finnair, 
three nights' lodging in Moscow and three nights in St. Petersburg, overnight 
train with a sleeping compartment between the two cities and most meals. Air 
fare from Los Angeles is extra. For information: (800) 526-4927.

HEARTS OF L.A. / HOW THE QUAKE ROCKED OUR SPIRITS AND CHANGED OUR LIVES; TAKING 
CHARGE; 'THEN I REALIZED, "THAT'S THE FIRST FLOOR! MY GOD!" ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Henry, Henry, 36, has been an L.A. city firefighter for 14 years. He 
drives the hook-and-ladder truckAerial Ladder 70for Fire Station 70 in 
Northridge and helped rescue people from Northridge Meadows apartment complex. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were eight of us sleeping in the dormitory on the second floor of the 
station house and, like everybody else, we got jolted out of bed. Actually, I 
was thrown out of bed. It was just like a bomb hit us. 
</P>
<P>
 I crawled over to a doorway 10 feet away. All the ceiling tiles and T-bars 
that hold them up had fallen down. I cut myself on this T-bar. Then I finally 
got under the doorway until the shaking stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the firefighters were getting under beds. Some were trying to ride it 
out in bed. Some were screaming and yelling. As soon as it stopped, people were 
yelling, "Is everybody all right?!" It was pitch-black. No lights. I was 
scrambling around looking for my turnout boots and pants. You couldn't see 
anything. I finally located my boots and stuck my foot in one of them. Then I 
had to take it out because the boot was full of pieces of ceiling tile. It's 
kind of comical. I had to dump my boots out before putting them on. 
</P>
<P>
 We ran out of the dorm. I was the first one on the pole. Some guys took the 
stairs because they didn't trust the pole. It was still pitch-black. There were 
a couple guys running around with little flashlights. I went to get the doors 
open because we needed to get the rigs out of quarters before we could do 
anybody any good. We went to the front doors. They are electric doors. Without 
power, you have to pull a lever and engage the manual override. You pull on a 
chain. We started to raise it, but it was jammed and we broke the chain. We 
couldn't get out the front doors, so we had to go around to the rear doors. 
</P>
<P>
 I drive a long hook-and-ladder. We got it and the rest of the equipment out of 
quarters safely and split into two companies. The engine company took one half 
of the district and we took the other. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as we rounded the corner, we saw people standing there from apartments 
from across the street asking for help. We told them to help their neighbors 
and do what they could for themselves and said, "We'll be back for help as soon 
as we can." We told them, "Do not go into the fire station. It's not safe." It 
would have been a natural refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 We drove south on Reseda Boulevard, and about every building we came upon, we 
encountered another group of people in the street asking for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earthquake, we have to do this assessment. It's kind of a triage. We 
have to make an assessment of the major dangers in our district before we can 
commit ourselves to any particular emergency. We drive a specific route. Ours 
was south on Reseda to Nordhoff. As we went south on Reseda, we wrote down just 
about every apartment address. The street is lined with apartments, and people 
were complaining they had stuck doors and some damage and needed help. 
</P>
<P>
 We drove south and actually went by the Northridge Meadows apartments. It was 
pitch-black out. You couldn't see the outlines of buildings. All you could see 
were people in the street, and we shone a spotlight on them. The building 
looked fairly normal, so we told the people to go help their neighbors get out, 
to try and find out who they were and that we'd be back. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't realize the Meadows had collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 As we got to Tampa, we noticed a single-family house on fire. We decided to go 
and try to make a quick knockdown of that fire so we wouldn't lose the whole 
block. We have lot of shake wood roofs in that neighborhood, and they go off 
like matchboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But we didn't have any water in hydrants, so we had to use our 500-gallon 
tank. But that lasted only about three or four minutes. We had to write off the 
house that was on fire. The owner was there. We told him, "We can't save your 
house." He understood. Reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 As we were driving and taking assessment, my thoughts were about where this 
thing was centered, and I said to myself, "My God, if it's centered toward 
Ventura, my house is worse than these houses here." I live in Simi Valley. My 
wife and kid could have been buried in rubble too. All I could do was pray to 
God that they were fine, that He would keep them alive. As it turned out, they 
were just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The engine company that went to the north end of the district had a set of 
townhomes completely engulfed in fire and spreading to adjacent ones. They 
needed help bad, but we had to tell them we had to check out these other 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, we still didn't realize the magnitude of Northridge Meadows. We 
were just driving south on Reseda and, knowing we had reports of people 
trapped, we went back down there. This seemed to be the most important place 
for us to be. Sure enough, we had a lot of people saying there were people 
trapped under the building. I couldn't imagine that. I was thinking, "How did 
they get under the building?" 
</P>
<P>
 As we pulled up, there were guys with hammers tearing at the building, trying 
to get people out from under there. I'm going, "Is there an underground parking 
garage here? What are these people doing under there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then I realized, "That's the first floor! My God!" 
</P>
<P>
 I compared the height of that building to one next to it, and it was a full 
story shorter than other one. Then the magnitude hit me: "We've got a whole 
floor down there. How many people could be trapped under here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Clark, Jack Lewis and I were racing around the rig, getting lights on, 
getting equipment. Our captain, Bob Fickett, was making a plan on how to attack 
this. Where do we start? What do we do? As soon as we got the lights hooked up, 
we got a little assessment of who was trapped and where they were. I went to a 
spot where civilians were tearing at the building with their hammers. They were 
talking to a man who was buried in the first floor. I had him tell me how many 
feet he was from the wall. I told him: "Stay calm. We'll get you out of there 
in a few minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 I stepped over a windowsill on the ground, which had been a second-story 
window. We got inside and started cutting. There is an inch and a half of 
concrete over the wooden subfloor. I was standing on the second floor and 
underneath me was first floor that had collapsed to about 18 inches. I had to 
cut through that floor. 
</P>
<P>
 I got a knife out and cut the carpet out of the way. Then I had to hammer 
through this inch and a half of concrete to get that out of the way. Initially, 
I tried my chain saw. But once I realized it was concrete, I got my ax out and 
started chopping. 
</P>
<P>
 My worst fear was that I'd cut through my victim -- run a chain saw right over 
the top of him. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'd cut through a layer of concrete, a layer of wood and the floor joist. 
Then, there was the dry wall ceiling of the first floor. We punched through 
that and we were in the bedroom space of the first floor. It had collapsed to a 
height of only eight or 10 inches in places, and the only thing holding it up 
was the contents of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 As we broke through the drywall, we looked at him. He was trapped. He was on 
the floor. His leg was up over a file cabinet and he was pinned. Now that we 
located him, we had to enlarge the hole. But we had to be careful. Our saws 
were getting duller the more we used them, and we were getting tired. We had to 
make each cut count. 
</P>
<P>
 We enlarged the smaller hole and we cut over the top of him and told him, 
"Stay calm. Don't move much." 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as we got him out, he was very much relieved. He wasn't bleeding. I 
think he just had a broken leg. We didn't have an ambulance on scene, so we 
took a door off its hinges and used that to pass him out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was talking to roommates in another bedroom when the quake hit. He 
said that while we were getting him out, he heard them stop talking. We found 
out what their names were, and we started yelling for his roommates -- and got 
no response. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, my captain was trying to find out if there was anyone else 
trapped and talking. He said, "I've got a family supposedly trapped in the next 
unit over. Mother got out, but her baby and husband are still in there." That 
was our next rescue effort. It turned out that the baby was really a 
14-year-old teen-ager, but the mother called him her "baby." She was Asian, and 
there was a terrific language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 We cut through three layers of stucco before we got to inside of their 
bedroom. That's where we found this woman's 14-year-old son -- in bed. We ended 
up being right over the top of his face with this hole. He was obviously 
crushed to death. They found his father the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 In about another hour, we got a report of a man talking to people at the 
southeast corner of the building. We grabbed our saws and equipment and tore at 
that wall and uncovered a man in bed. His feet were sticking out of the 
building. The outside edge of the building was on top of his stomach. He was 
still in bed, lying right on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 We tried knocking the legs out from under the bed to lower him. It was too 
tight to pull the mattress out from underneath him, so we took our air bags -- 
inflatable bags capable of lifting 11 to 72 tons -- and we put these bags in 
there and put heavy timber up and lifted that building a few inches. It was 
amazing. That gave him enough relief so he could breathe easier. We got this 
thing shored up, and we lifted it to the bag's maximum capacity. We cut some of 
the wood out and we took out a chain saw and cut three inches of wood from over 
on top of him. That gave us clearance so we could slide him off his mattress. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing he said when he got out was, "Thank God, I'm going to see the 
Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 He had a roommate in the next bedroom to the north. He was pinned. His head 
was on top of the bed and a wall had collapsed on top of him and pinned his 
head. We pried him out of there and brought him out. He was just glad to see 
blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
 I was there until about 10 o'clock that night. We brought three out alive and, 
oh, three or four out dead. I wish we could have saved more people. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of that day was real tough. Any time I was relieved, I'd go to the 
corner and use a pay phone, but I couldn't get through to my family. 
</P>
<P>
 Here I am digging people out and I can't help think but my family's under the 
same kind of rubble. It's tough. I just had to trust they were OK. 
</P>
<P>
 I finally got hold of my wife, Jo-Anne, at 2 the next morning. There are no 
words to express the relief I felt when I talked to her and she told me my kids 
are fine. 
</P>
<P>
 I spend a third of my life at the fire station. That's a third of my time away 
from the family, and if this kind of thing happens, I'm not with them. But this 
is the career I've chosen. I have to live with it. I wouldn't want to do 
anything else.

By Joe Castruita, Castruita, 37, has been with Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power for 11 years. For the last year he has been operations supervisor at 
the West Valley Water District in Northridge, the same post his father was in 
when he retired from DWP five years ago after 37 years with department. His 
father went through the '71 Sylmar quake.

<P>
 I was in Las Vegas. My wife, Pamela, and I had just gotten in from a night of 
shows and gambling. At about 4:30, we just felt our room shake and roll. I knew 
it was an earthquake. What troubled me was I knew Las Vegas was not a real key 
place for an earthquake to occur.  
</P>
<P>
 Everything calmed down, then the loudspeaker in the hotel room came on. They 
said, "Everything is fine. The building is OK. No fire present."  
</P>
<P>
 My wife said, "I'm going to call home. Do you think they felt it?" She tried 
to call my children, Joey Jr. and Nicholas, who are 11 and 8, who were staying 
with my parents in Reseda. She couldn't get through on the phone. I turned on 
the TV and changed it to a news station. In about 20 minutes, they were saying 
the earthquake was around the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 We were extremely concerned. We knew if we felt it in Vegas and it occurred in 
San Fernando Valley, it could be bad. My wife was falling apart. We were 
terrified. 
</P>
<P>
 We decided to pack our belongings, and we were out the door. We went to the 
lobby and there were a number of people in the lobby and they were in tears and 
they just said (to the cashier) "Please, mail my billing to my home." They 
didn't want to stay in line.  
</P>
<P>
 We waited for our friends. Then we fueled up our cars and left. We listened to 
the radio to see which freeway was accessible. We found out that the 14 freeway 
we needed to get home on was devastated. My wife checked a map and we ended up 
coming through San Bernardino on the 10 freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 On the long ride back, we monitored the radio. As we kept driving, they were 
assessing more and more damage. It sounded worse and worse. The apartment that 
collapsed. The water system.  
</P>
<P>
 It seemed like a 20-hour ride. My wife was in tears all the way home. 
</P>
<P>
 I drove to my parents' house first. At that point, we hadn't viewed a lot of 
damage. There were lots of block walls knocked over, but when I got to my 
parents' house, it was in utter shambles. Everything on a shelf was on the 
ground. Our kids came out and there were kisses and hugs. It was utter relief. 
I just hugged and crunched them in my arms. My wife was just so relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I wanted to see my home in Winnetka. As I was trying to get home, there 
were gas company units all around trying to repair the mains. I finally ended 
up going a mile out of my way. I'm starting to see streets buckled. I'm seeing 
water coming up through cracks in the street. And as I get closer to my house, 
I see streets rippled out in places. I'm imagining what my home looks like. 
</P>
<P>
 I got home and my driveway was broken up, so I parked in the street. The front 
door was stuck shut, so I ran around to the back door and couldn't open the 
back door. I went back to the front and pushed until I got it open. The kitchen 
floor was full of dishes and food.  
</P>
<P>
 I had bolted the china hutch and everything had come out of it. Stuff passed 
on from our family. Mirrors had fallen off the walls. The stereo fell over. I 
have a small Pomeranian, and she was tucked up behind a storage shed in the 
back. I had to go over to coax her out. My block wall fell over against the 
house. The gates to come into the back yard wouldn't open. I still haven't 
fixed any of that. I haven't been able to get home a day to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to the West Valley Water District. They had command post set up with 
our radio system. There was no power. There are large valves that take three to 
six people to shut the feeders down manually. These valves range from 68-inch 
to 24-inch valves. Some of those valves require 800 turns or more to shut off. 
. . . Some valves, we were able to put valve operators on them, and they were 
literally standing on top of the pipe and turning. 
</P>
<P>
 We operate on a grid system. There are valves that must be shut down prior to 
shutting off another valve. You can't turn them off like a faucet. You have to 
shut them down in a sequence. It takes a lot of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 We repaired more than 350 water leaks (since the earthquake). These are 
blowouts in which sections of pipe have fractured and water has caused street 
damage. We lost a lot of water pressure in a lot of our neighborhoods. We have 
a number of water tanks that more or less follow the ridge of the Valley. They 
carry a half-million gallons to 5 million gallons of water. Those tanks 
literally drained themselves with all the leaks in the streets. Some of the 
piping going to these tanks was sheared off and spilled onto the hillsides and 
caused hillside damage.  
</P>
<P>
 There was a major break on Balboa. We have two large feeders running from the 
Van Norman Reservoir down Balboa and west down Rinaldi. The street caved in. 
There was a ruptured 16 or 20-inch gas main on Balboa that was running parallel 
to our water main.  
</P>
<P>
 Our crews couldn't get in because the gas company had a fire wall going there. 
The air was so hot and intense, you couldn't get in until the gas company could 
isolate the gas main and get the gas stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 We just had to let it go. As you are shutting the water down, you are taking 
away fire protection. It was just a snowball effect. You had major fires, water 
mains bursting, and having to shut down water mains. The result was just havoc. 
</P>
<P>
 I would say that by Friday and Saturday (of the first week), we could get 
control and plan our actual repairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The largest crisis was the major feeders. The two major feeders that run in 
the north end of Valley from the Van Norman Reservoir were broken in multiple 
places. We were cutting holes in the main trying to pump water out so welders 
could weld the main again. You can't weld under wet conditions. We are putting 
rocks and pea gravel down in the holes so the welders could lie down. 
Otherwise, they would sink in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Van Norman complex, the Granada trunk runs under a channel called Bull 
Creek. Well, that major trunk line broke in four or five places under the 
creek. We opened access holes and we had welders crawl inside the pipe and weld 
the pipe from the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 My major concern now is, I'm responsible for keeping the water from leaking 
into the pipe that would literally drown the welders. . . . We also are getting 
tremors. I could see the nervous looks on their faces (when they crawled into 
the pipe). We have air blowers. We have radio communications inside the pipe. 
They have crawled 150 feet down the pipe where there were water leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 (Going through this) really drops personal possessions down to another level. 
The safety of family and the well-being of other people really jumps into play. 
As far as this job is concerned, it has been the ultimate learning experience. 
The department has gone through the ultimate bashing, but when it goes down 
like this, no one complains. The major concern was to get the system back on 
line. These people are just troupers.

By Jackie Tatum, Tatum is general manager of the Los Angeles City Department of 
Recreation and Parks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the earthquake struck, I hit the floor running, hollering to my 
79-year-old mother and my two grown children, who happened to be home on a 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 We were all upstairs because we have a two-story home in the Crenshaw-Wilshire 
area, and I think all of us were standing in doorways. Luckily, we had enough 
doorways for everybody to have one. 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing that came to mind I can't really understand: I thought about 
Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of my responsibilities as the general manager of the Department of 
Recreation and Parks, and it's one of the oldest establishments in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 I said, 'Oh, my goodness, Olvera Street!' 
</P>
<P>
 My mother said, "What?" 
</P>
<P>
 I said, "Olvera Street. I wonder if it's still standing after all of this? 
Thank goodness it's this time in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 So, after we got ourselves together with the portable radio and the 
flashlights and all those kinds of things, I got in my car and called downtown. 
They told us we had to report down to the emergency operations office. 
</P>
<P>
 I started cruising that way, but before I went to the emergency operations 
headquarters I drove around Olvera Street. It was still standing, and I said 
that it goes to show you that those before us really knew what they were doing 
when they built things. 
</P>
<P>
 After a meeting in the emergency operations center, I went out to visit the 
parks. I went to about 15 that first day. When I hit that Valley, I just 
couldn't believe the damage that had happened. The big problem, of course, was 
people in the parks: What to do for them? 
</P>
<P>
 We have approximately 100 facilities in the Valley. We figured that we should 
make a survey and find out where most of the people were gathering and, 
starting Tuesday, we put staff there around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 People kept coming. This was kind of unexpected. The staff started talking to 
them, but they just refused to leave. They didn't want to go back to their 
buildings, and we could understand that. 
</P>
<P>
 As the days went on, we started understanding that there were many needs that 
would have to be satisfied. So we had a team of people down here at City Hall 
working from 6 in the morning to 6 in the evening, calling corporations, trying 
to find out if we could get Pampers, batteries, flashlights, blankets, cots. 
</P>
<P>
 We've known for a long time that since our department's budget has been cut, a 
citywide disaster would require us to go out to the corporate world to assist 
us. So we had a team already there that was already skilled at doing these 
kinds of things. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the 21st, we met with the mayor and Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development Henry Cisneros, and we were talking about tents going up, maybe 
Saturday. But we decided that maybe the weather would be a problem sooner than 
was forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 So, from that meeting, which was at the Encino Community Center, I decided 
that I would go out to Lanark Park in Canoga Park, where we had our largest 
gathering of people. When I arrived, to my amazement, the director was standing 
there with three of our park rangers and about 20 National Guard people. 
</P>
<P>
 As I walked up, the director said, "Here's our general manager. She can OK 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 He introduced me to Maj. Gen. Tandy Bozeman, commander of the California 
National Guard, who said: "I'm so glad you're here. We need to start up with 
the tents right now." 
</P>
<P>
 I said, "Proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, I called (Police) Chief Willie Williams and I said, "Chief, I want to 
inform you that we're starting with the first tent installation. The National 
Guard is here." 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "All right, Jackie, you will have the support of LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
 And no sooner than I could walk 50 yards out into the field, there were two 
cars of L.A.'s finest there to assist us. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we all have to give thanks that in a city as large as Los Angeles -- 
with as diverse a population as we have -- that this was one time it didn't 
make any difference if we had to use a different language or sign language. We 
communicated that we were there for one another. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that's the bottom line: The City of Angels became a city of many 
angels doing some positive things for one another.

By Richard Riordan, Riordan is mayor of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like everybody else, I was in bed when it started. And, even though I've been 
through so many earthquakes in California, it struck me as the strongest I've 
ever felt. So it scared me a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
 But then it stopped and my immediate thought was: "What do I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 I combed my hair, got on a sweat shirt and some jeans and took off. My home 
phones were out and so was the cellular phone in my car. So, first I drove 
myself to one of the police stations to establish communications. I realized 
almost immediately how bad things were because they weren't even revved up. 
</P>
<P>
 But while I was there, David Novak from my staff got hold of me. We talked 
and, after 10 minutes, I decided to take off for the emergency operations 
center below City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 I went along the 10 Freeway, not realizing the bridge was out. I think I 
lucked out, because if I had gone 10 minutes earlier, I could have easily have 
been one of those 10 cars that went off there. But when I saw a truck turned 
around, it made me suspicious, and I decided to get off and go up La Cienega 
and along the surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the emergency operations center, I started talking to people about traffic. 
Representatives of all the major city departments were there. I talked to the 
different ones about what we should be doing right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the middle of it all, I realized nobody had had any food, so I called 
the Pantry (a downtown restaurant owned by Riordan) and they delivered a couple 
hundred breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic thought in my mind then and all day was: "What can we do in the 
short term -- and in the long?" I made lists and everything. But I've learned 
that people in these situations seem to have an incredible ability to relax and 
think more clearly, rather than becoming scattered all over the place. When you 
relax like that, you essentially have an advantage over everybody else in 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 When I got downtown, I knew one bridge was down. I quickly found out there was 
a problem with the 118. At that point, though, we had only one confirmed dead 
person. Then it began to look like we had maybe 10 or 15 dead -- and then, all 
of a sudden, this one apartment house had 16 people killed. 
</P>
<P>
 I stayed at the emergency center pretty much all of the first day. President 
Clinton called, and I talked to other people in Washington. I was networking 
with all kinds of people, making calls to people who could help in various 
areas. I knew, for example, that transportation was a big problem, so we called 
people in Caltrans and the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we got together and decided that Chief (Willie) Williams and I had to 
communicate with the public. So, at 4:15 in the afternoon, I took my first 
shower of the day -- in cold water. Then I mixed hot coffee with a little bit 
of cold water to shave and went into my office. I stayed until about 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, I went to Northridge. We went to Lanark Park in Canoga Park and 
one thing I realized was that we had no leadership there. I asked, "Who's in 
charge?" They didn't even have enough water. The park was full of people and 
there was nobody there you could hold responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of supplies around. It was just a matter of asking for it. 
So I went a little bit ballistic and got on the cellular phone right there and 
got hold of the president of the Parks and Rec Commission and asked if he'd get 
together with Jackie (Tatum, the department's general manager) and get some 
leadership going there so someone would be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, I went to the Northridge Meadows Apartments. First, I thought of those 
16 families and the tragedy that they had suffered. It also occurred to me that 
the building looked almost like a child's playhouse that had been crumbled by 
an older brother or something. It was just an incredible amount of destruction. 
Fifty cars had been crushed and this building looked just like cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, in the face of something like that, there's a temptation to feel 
helpless. But you can't afford to be helpless in my spot. You have to always 
think positively, to say with each situation, "How could I make it better?" 
</P>
<P>
 The main thing is how do I get the best and the brightest people involved 
right away so whatever thoughts I have I can unload them on other people and go 
onto my next thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 I really admire the people who work for this city. The Riordan axiom is: It's 
much easier to get forgiveness than to get permission. And I had several people 
who just went out and did it -- like the transportation department people, who 
just commandeered some intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, though, the most rewarding is the general attitude of the 
population. I've said this time and time again, but I'm very proud to live in 
L.A. There are doomsayers all over the place, but that's not the typical 
resident of L.A. Our people are optimists; they're doers. They help and respect 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel this tremendous coming together and camaraderie, and I think it's just 
great.

By Lt. Dan Hoffman, Hoffman, 42, Los Angeles Police Department, Devonshire 
Division Daywatch Watch Commander, resides in Thousand Oaks with his wife and 
three sons. He is a 20-year veteran of LAPD. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I run the football program out at T.O. (Thousand Oaks), and we had one of the 
people on the board over for dinner that night with her son. The kids were 
playing outside about 8 o'clock in the evening, and they tell us, "Hey, there's 
a weird wind out here, dad. If you stand right here you can feel hot air." We 
shined 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 When the guests were leaving at 9 o'clock, all three of my sons and this other 
boy, Sean, said, "You've got to come out here and feel it," so we did. Me, my 
wife and the boy's mother went over to the area where the boys told us to stand 
and, by God, you could feel hot air coming.  
</P>
<P>
 The wind was blowing in a southern direction. It was like a gulf stream of air 
that was blowing down onto our front porch area. I thought it was crazy, but 
when they got me out there, it was happening. So, when we got back in the house 
that night, my two little ones insisted -- which was unusual -- on sleeping 
with their older brother after this incident. It scared them. They were down on 
the bottom floor, and my wife and I were on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, I woke up at 4:27. I have a clock right by my head. And I 
was wondering how many minutes before my alarm goes off. Usually for a workday, 
I get up at 5:30. I had kicked the covers off me and I was pulling them on me 
and rolling around and looking at the ceiling when the earthquake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a violent earthquake. I lived in Van Nuys when we had the '71 
earthquake. Immediately, my mind flashed back to 1971. It was a real violent, 
direct hitting, solid shaking (earthquake), as opposed to '71. I remember back 
at my dad's house and opening the door to my room and standing out in the back 
yard and I could see the patio and the wall doing a wave. This one was 
completely different. This one was quick, violent, sustained, as if someone was 
hitting you with an uppercut. Just pounding the foundation of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like "The Exorcist." The bed in my bedroom was literally lifting off the 
ground and smacking into the floor and everything was shaking around me. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife woke up and she started screaming, "Oh, my God!" For whatever reason, 
she ended up at the end of the bed and was kind of like huddling on the end of 
the bed. I was grabbing the headboard. Then the thing stopped, and I yelled 
down to the kids. By now, my little one, Patrick, was screaming, "Dad! Dad! 
What's wrong?" So, I went downstairs. We got them all together. 
</P>
<P>
 My father passed away in November. My mother and father lived about a mile and 
a half away from me. My mom now lives there by herself. She had never lived by 
herself. So, I told the family, "Get the flashlights going, and all of you just 
stay in the family room. I'm going to be back. I've got to get to my mom." 
</P>
<P>
 I went to my car, and the thing that struck me was the eeriness. Everything 
was totally dark. I remember thinking the headlights on my car weren't doing 
the job because I'm used to more light. There was no power. So when I got to my 
mom's, I pulled my car onto the front of her lawn and lit up the front of her 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor next door yelled at me, "Are you checking on her?" I said yes. 
So, I banged on the door and got my mom. I opened the door and she was visibly 
shaking. I just said, "Let's go. You're coming with me." 
</P>
<P>
 When I got back to my house, I got the flashlight, checking for damage, and 
told my wife, "As soon as I'm done here, I'm going into work." I got the radio 
going and I knew we had been hit hard in the West San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 As I'm coming into the station, I wonder if I can handle the news media in the 
lobby, because I knew they were going to be here, but when I got here they 
weren't here. They were out at the train derailment, Northridge mall, gas main 
blowup. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked into the station, and it was on its knees. Total bedlam. Everything 
was tipped over. You couldn't walk without having to step over file cabinets, 
desks. The walls were cracked. The ceiling panels were on the ground. The 
lights were out. There was so much destruction here that when they set up the 
CP (command post), they couldn't get into the room where we keep our radios. It 
took them an hour and 15 minutes to clear the debris away. 
</P>
<P>
 When I walked in, everything was on the ground. This place was trashed. 
Shotguns. Everything was trashed. Morning watch is not what you would call a 
heavily deployed watch, so I knew there weren't a lot of people working.  
</P>
<P>
 I was operations lieutenant, which meant I was in charge of all units, where 
they were going, what their assignments are to be. Making all the necessary 
liaisons with building and safety. It's almost like a blur now that I think 
about it.  
</P>
<P>
 You immediately do a roll call of officers right over the air to see if 
they're OK, and Jim (Lt. Jim Cansler) had done that, which really impressed me. 
Now, we know what our force is. Then I assigned people to call everyone at home 
and tell them to get in. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . (As supervisors) we are trained in an earthquake situation to delegate, 
assign, monitor and make telephone calls. The officers in the field do the 
assessments, and the assessments were coming in. Right away, we knew about the 
9500 block of Reseda (Northridge Meadows apartments). We knew that a 
three-story apartment building was now a two-story apartment building. The Fire 
Department was on scene, and we knew it was bad.  
</P>
<P>
 The other thing that we had was the train derailment at Nordhoff and Tampa. We 
knew there were hazardous chemicals on the train. So, that was a whole other 
major problem; you have the evacuation process, (have to) close down traffic 
lanes. We knew the Northridge college campus had sustained a big hit and that 
the newly built parking structure had completely collapsed and that the science 
building was on fire, and the Fire Department told us hazardous chemicals had 
combined and are burning into the sky.  
</P>
<P>
 We knew Northridge Mall had been totally demolished. And, of course, we had 
citizens coming in. We knew we had single-family residences out there and there 
was a lot of damage. I personally thought there were going to be a lot of 
injuries and we were going to see lots of deaths, based on how violent this 
thing had been and the damage I had seen. We knew there were other apartment 
buildings out there that were just as demolished and uninhabitable. You could 
just look down Reseda (Boulevard) and see it. 
</P>
<P>
 We found out fairly soon that we lost one of our motor officers. He was a 
traffic motor officer assigned to the Valley Bureau. We got the word . . . that 
he had gone off the end of the freeway and then it was like, "My God, we're cut 
off from everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 We had Balboa and Rinaldi where that gas vent was on fire, where Clinton 
visited. That was in our division too. We had houses on fire . . . and we knew 
it. On top of all this, the traffic signals weren't working. And then you had 
everybody in the United States calling asking, "Is my son OK? Is my mother OK?" 
And we didn't have the manpower to do it at that point. For two days, we were 
basically telling them, "We can't do anything for you," but then we were able 
to take the light-duty officers and they became our welfare check cars, so we 
were able to start doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 I went out and assessed the damage with Capt. Vance Proctor. We went to the 
Northridge Meadows apartments, the Northridge mall and Cal State Northridge. We 
saw a lot of destruction. We knew there had been death. I'm surprised there 
wasn't more. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of our officers came in on their own, officers who lost just as much as 
these people. Some in Santa Clarita were stranded. But we had officers who live 
in this division who came into work and told us their homes had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 At the station, we didn't have any water. We were running off a generator. You 
have to feed your people. Gas the cars. All these things become huge problems. 
We had food delivered. We had water trucks brought over here. Gasoline was 
delivered. You couldn't flush the toilets, so we had outhouses delivered. Then, 
of course, you've got rescue operations and seeing families without food and 
water. We had officers come in, load up their cars and take it out to them. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd load them up four bodies (officers) to a car at a time. You wouldn't see 
them for six hours. You knew they were there doing a job. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted a flush toilet real bad. Hot water. A hot shower and a flush toilet. 
When we got the water back here and were able to flush the toilets, it lifted 
morale. You didn't have to go to a stinky little outhouse. The little things 
really mean a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife's mother sustained severe damage in Van Nuys. She lost her chimney and 
all her dishes and walls. So, Tuesday night, when I got home, I told my wife's 
sister, "I can't get over to see your mom, but I want you to buy her a whole 
new set of dishes and cups." My wife told me when she walked in and gave her 
that new set of dishes, you would have thought it was a 16-year-old girl 
getting her first kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 When I'm at home, the tremors scare me a lot more. The tremors really belly me 
up at home. I don't like it and I get really scared. But for whatever reason, 
when I'm at work it doesn't hit me that way. I don't know why. I think it's 
because my family's there. When I'm here, everybody's a professional. Everybody 
is trained like me. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember I got heavily involved in the apartment situation. Those people, I 
met them several times in the lobby. They wanted to get their property. The 
people were very upset. I told them, "Here's how you handle this earthquake. 
You got dealt a really bad hand here, but you're alive. No. 2, each day that we 
progress through this shock, things get better." 
</P>
<P>
 I said, "For instance, yesterday you weren't allowed in your apartments. Now, 
today, there is a system in place to allow you into your apartments, so things 
are better already." 
</P>
<P>
 This division will not be back together quickly, but every day it gets better.

By Janice Kane, Kane, 39, a private investigator, lived in mobile home, space 
No. 31, Tahitian Mobile Home Park, Sylmar, where dozens of mobile homes went up 
in flames after the earthquake. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We had a pretty nice place. There were trees. Most of the houses were nice. 
Now it's just smoke and nothing. The water main to the park is turned off and 
there's no electricity or gas. Sixty to 70 homes are burned out. Every single 
house -- 238 families -- is off its jacks. We have National Guard troops out 
front because there were looters here within hours. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to the (Federal Emergency Management Agency) disaster center in Sun 
Valley. If I owned a business and FEMA was my manager, I'd fire him. They've 
managed to create a disaster all on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 I went there on Friday and got an appointment for Sunday. On Sunday, I was 
there from 1 in the afternoon until 9:30 at night. 
</P>
<P>
 First, you have to get the FEMA forms filled out. Then they tell you what you 
are eligible for. Then they give you your (Small Business Administration) 
package. Then they tell you to fill it out and bring it back. That took until 4 
o'clock. 
</P>
<P>
 We got to another table at 4 o'clock, and they did not call us until 8:30. 
They had six people from the city Housing Authority there, four of whom were 
sitting on their butts doing nothing. They had two men doing "eligibility." 
They were handing out these forms and saying, "We'll investigate it later. 
Don't lie." 
</P>
<P>
 I got a (housing) voucher, but it's not a take-it-to-the-bank voucher. What 
they give you is this form. They give it out saying, "No questions asked. We'll 
verify it later." 
</P>
<P>
 They give you this form you have to fill out, and the potential new landlord 
has to fill it out. Among other things, your landlord must give up a copy of 
his grant deed. He has to provide them with his Social Security number and what 
his total rent is supposed to be. They will report the whole thing to the IRS 
and then the potential landlord has to submit his property to inspection by the 
city Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no cash given or any other kind of assistance for first and last 
month's rent. As a single person, the maximum they would give me is $536 if the 
landlord paid the water and $570 if I paid the water, of which my portion was 
$330. Except, here's the catch: I couldn't rent anything but a single. My best 
friend was also burned out, but we couldn't go in together and rent a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Bureaucracy is rough to deal with, but so is the realization that I'm not as 
brave as I thought I was. That shook me a lot. I don't know how long it'll be 
before I feel happy and safe in my home again.DISASTERS

By Bob Tur, Tur, 33, is a helicopter pilot-reporter for KCBS Channel 2 news and 
KNX 1070 AM radio. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was in bed with my wife. We're up in the (Pacific) Palisades. I've got a 
couple of kids in the next room. At 4:31, I was on the floor. By 4:40, we were 
leaving the house. We've gone through a number of earthquakes and we have an 
earthquake plan. That is to get the hell out of the house and get down to the 
helicopter hanger and get it airborne. 
</P>
<P>
 We left the house, got dressed in the truck and went down Pacific Coast 
Highway. Right down the street from where I live is where that house at 
Chautauqua and Pacific Coast Highway came down. Portions of that house were 
still sliding down. There was no rhyme or reason to where anyone was driving. 
It was just to avoid landslides, dust and falling boulders. 
</P>
<P>
 We got down to Santa Monica Airport and there was no power. I was on two-way 
communications with KNX-AM radio doing reports. They had lost power so they put 
a two-way radio up to a microphone inside the booth, and we were able to 
broadcast. I had all the police and fire radios going on in the truck, so we 
were able to get the first information. 
</P>
<P>
 My kids have several thousand hours in the helicopter. . . . They were sort of 
born into the news profession, and they helped out listening to radio calls. My 
daughter, Katie, is 10 and my son, Jamie, is 8. My wife, Marika, was writing 
down information from the fire department. We were relaying the information to 
the listeners.  
</P>
<P>
 Once we got to the airport, we had another problem. There was no power to 
raise a 50-foot-wide steel and aluminum door, so we ripped it off with a 
forklift. All my friends were there. Dan Lunsky, a contractor, had a generator 
and he also had a (power) saw in case we had to cut down the hanger to the 
helicopter. Another friend, Bob Clark, from the Santa Monica Outlook, lent 
assistance. I had people from the Museum of Flying and Super Marine Aviation 
show up. A limo driver that didn't even know me came along. We had some cops 
show up, some firemen show up. Everyone converged at the hanger.  
</P>
<P>
 We were up in the air by 5:05, pilot Doug Denoff, my wife and I. There was 
another station that was up ahead of us, Channel 5, only because they have that 
early morning news. Doug was going to do the flying, Marika was going to do the 
shooting, and I was going to do the reporting, coordinating all the frequencies 
and monitoring police and fire radios.  
</P>
<P>
 KNX, being a 50,000-watt radio station, is where you want to report from, 
since you can hear it from Albuquerque to Hawaii. Simultaneously, we are 
setting up our microwave feeds for TV. That was downlinked to CBS and then 
uplinked back on a satellite all throughout the United States. So anything that 
we were broadcasting was picked up by the networks. 
</P>
<P>
 We're over Santa Monica and we're diverting right to the area that we're 
hearing as the hardest-hit areas. We crossed over the Hollywood Hills and we 
saw what looked like fog, but we realized it was smoke. In the Hollywood Hills 
there was a home on fire. Then over to the right we saw two homes that had 
collapsed. One had slid down the hill and there were people waving at us. I 
reported the location to the police department. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene from the air was surreal. You're used to seeing the lights of the 
city, and it looks like a bright jewel. Unfortunately, after the earthquake, 
there were no lights. It was eerie. Once you crossed over the Santa Monica 
Mountain range and Hollywood Hills and looked into the west Valley and the 
Burbank/Glendale areas, it was pitch black, dotted by fires. 
</P>
<P>
 It was very strange. We almost got spatial disorientation because you couldn't 
see a horizon. There was so much smoke and no visibility that it was difficult 
to keep the helicopter level. There was enough ambient light from starlight and 
a little bit of the moon. What really made a difference was a 30 million 
candle-powered night sun (light). It's what the police use. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing that we wanted to do was survey the homes that are perched on 
the cliffs of the canyons. Most withstood the quake but a few didn't. We went 
into another area and saw water mains flowing 50 to 60 feet in the air and I 
realized that there would be a water problem in L.A., a contamination problem. 
So we reported that, and then the sun began to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an office building on Ventura Boulevard that was in flames. There 
was a gas and water main that (had broken) apart, and there was an explosion 
that (had) leveled five homes. That was spectacular since it was very dark. 
This geyser of fire was rising 50 feet into the sky.  
</P>
<P>
 When we got into the Newhall area, the sun was really upon us. Looking at the 
5-14 intersection, you could see all the damage to the overpass. There a 
helicopter showed up and picked up victims. Then there was the destruction of 
that Northridge apartment. It looked like someone had picked up this 
rectangular section of the apartment house and shoved it down. (And) the Cal 
State Northridge parking structure was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 With dawn, I was able to see the full scope of what was going on. I was able 
to give more accurate reports. Unlike the Whittier and Coalinga earthquakes 
where there were pockets of damaged areas next to undamaged areas, here it 
looked like there was damage everywhere. I thought Santa Monica had been hit 
pretty hard, but this was a forgotten area because the Valley was hit the 
hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 What a place to be (in the sky). We were immune to the aftershocks and 
distanced from the danger. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three memories I will always remember. One is the actual earthquake 
at 4:31 and the feeling of helplessness, and seeing the flashes of light as all 
the transformers were blowing up. The (third) memory was when I saw the Santa 
Monica Freeway (had) collapsed. . . . I was hovering over that, and I watched a 
highway patrolman drive over a buckled portion of the freeway and then drive 
over the edge, on live television. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't injured, but after seeing all this tragedy, it made everyone laugh. 
It was humorous. Here was somebody that was probably suffering from delayed 
stress that got into his patrol vehicle, drove through his own barrier and 
drove off the side of the freeway, on live television. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, I was feeling very guilty. All these people had suffered a lot 
of damage and here we were in the news helicopter immune from it and not really 
helping anybody. Then the people from Granada Hills Hospital asked us to 
medivac patients.  
</P>
<P>
 It was about four in the afternoon. They couldn't get an ambulance or the fire 
department to transport anybody, so they called us.  
</P>
<P>
 We have a medical kit aboard the helicopter so we can do ambulance runs. It 
was an option in the helicopter and I never thought that I would ever use it, 
but here we were transporting burn victims into UCLA Medical Center. It felt so 
great to actually do something to help.

HEARTS OF L.A. / HOW THE QUAKE ROCKED OUR SPIRITS AND CHANGED OUR LIVES; TAKING 
CHARGE; 'MY DAUGHTER SAID, "YOU'D BETTER START PACKING." ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Darlene Pyle, Pyle, 59, of Portland, Ore., is a reservist for FEMA, the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. She is a real estate agent when not 
working for FEMA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I first heard about it when my daughter called an hour after the quake and 
said, 'Mom, you'd better start packing.' I've handled almost every kind of 
disaster -- floods to earthquakes to volcanoes to fires and tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes are the most frightening because they're so sneaky and there's no 
warning, and the aftershocks just keep coming. The damage is so incredible. 
Sometimes when there's a flood, they have advance notice, but with earthquakes 
there isn't any preliminary planning. 
</P>
<P>
 I really enjoy the disaster relief part of my job. In the midst of crisis and 
chaos, we try to bring normality. We are doing everything humanly possible to 
bring aid to these people here, but the logistics of so many is just kind of 
overwhelming. It's frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 But the people and their stories are interesting. One, an Armenian, was very 
upset because they'd gone through the earthquake in Armenia and moved here to 
get away from earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 People coming in have been pretty calm, even though some have been afraid that 
maybe we'll run out of money.

HEARTS OF L.A. / HOW THE QUAKE ROCKED OUR SPIRITS AND CHANGED OUR LIVES; 
BINDING THE WOUNDS; 'BABIES WERE AMAZINGLY QUIET THROUGH IT ALL . . .' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joan Cardone, Cardone, 28, of Beverlywood is a resident in obstetrics and 
gynecology at UCLA Medical Center. When the quake struck, she was on call at 
Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar. In 1971, the hospital was destroyed by an 
earthquake. In 1994, the building survived, but things got a little wild 
inside. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was like being in "The Poseidon Adventure." After the quake hit and we 
started down the stairs from the sixth floor to the labor-delivery room, water 
was leaking everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 All I remember from that movie was people trying to make their way around and 
steam coming from everywhere. That's what we felt like. The water pipes broke 
immediately, and when we went down the stairs, we were getting soaked. And the 
air was filled with dust, making it difficult to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 Once we got to the labor-delivery ward, we checked on the patients. The 
monitors were working and everyone was remarkably calm. One patient was very 
active in labor, about to deliver.  
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, we realized there was a gas leak in the entrance to the 
labor-delivery area. The air was very stagnant and, until they could turn off 
the gas leak, we couldn't breathe. We tried to get some windows open but 
couldn't. So we cleared people away from there.  
</P>
<P>
 We could also see that the power was starting to fail; it was like a brownout, 
the lights going down. Immediately after the earthquake, the backup generators 
kicked in, but about 20 minutes later, they also failed. 
</P>
<P>
 People were making a mad dash for flashlights, but we hadn't secured them yet. 
When we got them and saw that things were getting worse, we decided to move the 
patients to the operating room, where there were some battery-powered lights. 
</P>
<P>
 We moved everybody back there and had about five active patients at that time. 
The rest of the postpartum patients stayed in their rooms. We had two moms and 
two babies in the doorjambs of every room, sitting quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 The babies were amazingly quiet through it all, maybe because they were being 
held the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
 One patient who delivered was remarkably calm and together. And she hadn't 
even received any medication. By the time we got her back to the operating room 
and had her settled down there, we didn't have any monitor and preferred not to 
give her medication. After the delivery, when her husband realized that his 
wife and their baby were OK, he turned green. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire situation resembled working in the Third World -- with no monitors 
-- and it made me think how unprepared I was. We had no fetus scopes. So we 
tried to listen to the baby with a stethoscope. In other parts of the hospital, 
the people on ventilators had to be hand-ventilated because there was no power. 
Luckily, there was nobody in the operating room, and there were no emergencies 
at that time, which is pretty rare. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought of Kuwait because you could see the fires at the trailer parks. And 
there were two gas lines that had caught on fire, so we saw four different 
fires. That was the first time that I realized how horrendous this was. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been here for 2 1/2 years, and I've seen far too many disasters in 
Southern California. But for me to go back to the Midwest, I don't know. The 
wind chill during the week of the earthquake was 50 below in Chicago.

By David Cole, Cole, 30, is an electrician who lives in Northridge. He suffered 
a broken hip when the roof of Gold's Gym in Northridge caved in during the 
quake. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was working out at Gold's Gym in Northridge. All of a sudden, everybody 
jumped up and the building started shaking and everybody took off running. I 
already had a broken leg, I was on crutches, and I couldn't run out of the 
building, so I dove under a piece of equipment and I was holding on to the 
bench. The next thing I knew, the whole ceiling, not just the ceiling but the 
roof, came in on top of me. 
</P>
<P>
 The bench protected my head, but my hip was sticking out and it got busted. 
After a couple of minutes of sitting there underneath the debris, I started 
yelling and one of the guys who works at Gold's came in with another guy and 
dug me out of the debris and pulled me into the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 They flagged down a chief of the fire department who was driving around and 
asked him if we could get an ambulance. The chief said there's no ambulances 
and no fire engines right now, and we don't even know if (Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center) is still standing; so they gave me a ride to my house. That was 
probably around 5. I was in severe pain, pain like you couldn't believe. I 
couldn't move. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the guys from the gym helped me out of the truck. They pulled a couch 
out of the house and stuck it in the driveway. I stayed on the couch while the 
tremors kept going by and figured out what I was going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of my roommates threw me and the couch in the van and took me to 
(Northridge Hospital Medical Center) emergency. It was a pretty scary 
experience being in that parking lot with 200 other people, screaming and 
yelling and being in pain. I wasn't in Vietnam, but you picture a war zone with 
people all over the place like that. I was looking up, I was sitting on a bed, 
and then all of a sudden this helicopter came flying over. Then they accepted 
me into emergency and gave me some medication for the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, this hospital looked pretty good considering the rest of the San 
Fernando Valley. There were nurses who would come in and tell me how it was a 
new building, built on wheels to withstand all of the pressure, that it was 
made for earthquakes and stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
 But to tell you the truth, I still can't wait to get out of here because with 
the tremors it feels like the whole building moves three feet one way and three 
feet the other and you just don't know what's going to happen. When you're 
lying in bed with a broken leg, you have no control over your body and it's 
pretty terrifying. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd already been laid up from October from my last break. The reason for going 
to the gym was to get my body in shape to go back to work. And then all of a 
sudden, the ceiling falls down on me and busts my leg again (he laughs). This 
is going to put me out for 2 1/2 or three more months. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel fortunate that I'm alive because I've seen pictures of where I was at 
the gym, and if I (had been) two feet in another direction I wouldn't be here 
talking to you, OK? And if I wasn't smart enough to jump underneath that bench 
at Gold's Gym, I'd be in worse shape than I am. I got off lucky with a broken 
hip.

By Carol Abbey-Mounedji and Theresa Volland, Abbey-Mounedji, 38, is a clinical 
nurse at the UCLA Medical Center and Volland, 25, is a first-year resident in 
obstetrics and gynecology. Both were on duty when the earthquake sent them a 
very unusual patient. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Abbey-Mounedji began the account: The day of the quake, it was business as 
usual. We hooked up our coffee pot up to the emergency power supply and we went 
to work.The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was really bombarded. All of Olive 
View Medical Center was evacuated, and they got 17 babies from there and six 
from other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then all of a sudden the Emergency Room called and said, "Did you know you 
were getting two patients from Olive View? They're on their way in an 
ambulance."  
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, this lady on a stretcher arrived with this little note 
taped to her abdomen that said, "Needs emergency C-section." 
</P>
<P>
 Volland added: Doctors at Olive View were only seconds away from operating on 
her when a quake jolted the building. 
</P>
<P>
 They lost power and there was water everywhere. The ambulance driver and the 
med-techs had to carry the woman four flights of stairs to an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Abbey-Mounedji: In the 17 years I've been a nurse and the 14 years I've 
worked here at UCLA, this was probably the easiest patient I ever admitted. The 
intravenous tube was in her, her abdomen was prepped, she already had the 
catheters in her and her epidural was already in for the anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
 So we just evaluated her baby and took her into the operating room and did a 
safe C-section on her. She was one lucky lady. Mother, baby and dad were very 
happy to be in a very safe place.

By Wendy Cottam, Cottam is an English teacher at Belmont High School in 
downtown Los Angeles. After Cottam, a lifelong volunteer, cleaned up the quake 
damage in her Van Nuys home, she and three colleagues organized Teachers 
Without Walls, an outdoor school in a Sherman Oaks park filled with displaced 
quake victims.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I've always been a volunteer. I was a Candy Striper at 15 at Columbia 
Presbyterian Hospital in New York. I was the Library Lady at Sloan Kettering as 
an adult. It's the fabric of my life, a natural extension of teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 So as I saw Hazeltine Park filling with more and more children seemingly lost, 
bewildered, shattered, I thought: Let's do something; let's start a school. I 
called a few fellow teachers and they said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't have any supplies, so I called Office Depot near my neighborhood. 
They didn't even stop a heartbeat. "What do you need?" the manager asked. I 
took crayons, notebooks, golf pencils that were already sharpened, pens and 
markers. I also had a couple of easels and boards of my own. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, we went over to a pavilion where children were playing and wrote 
a sign, "LAUSD Volunteer Teachers Without Walls. School Is Open" on an easel. 
My ESL teacher wrote it in Spanish. A crowd of parents and children formed. 
First the parents checked us out to see if we looked legitimate, I think. And 
then the little ones, even diaper age appeared, all the way through high 
school. They sat down at the table with their little hands folded -- all sizes, 
shapes and ages -- parents behind them ready to go. It was the most exciting 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 First day we had between maybe 35 kids. With the little kids we sang and 
colored. They drew pictures of their homes and taped them up on a nearby wall. 
It became our memory wall. 
</P>
<P>
 With the older children, we did some writing and math assignments. They also 
drew -- pictures of the freeways that fell down and their houses. 
Interestingly, they drew houses with children inside, sort of floating around, 
with parents on the outside, without hands, symbolizing that the parents could 
not help them, I believe. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids were hungry to learn. They were so thrilled. They said to me, "We 
love our teacher. We love our school." 
</P>
<P>
 We were constantly interrupted by tremors, and the kids grasped at any adult. 
I must have had three clinging to me. Some just scooted back to their little 
camps or tents. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the parents started coming, so we started a group where the parents were 
being taught to write a journal in Spanish, a history of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 We were there just two days, before we had to go back to our own school, but 
emotionally, it was amazing. We really bonded with the children and the 
families.

By Dr. Bert Lockwood, Lockwood, 51, a dentist, lives on Beverly Ridge Drive in 
Sherman Oaks. His house is next door to the one in which 4-year-old Amy 
Vigil-Tyre died when her family's home fell down the ridge. Last week, 
Lockwood's house, a green sticker prominently affixed to its front, was the 
only one on the street occupied.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a rude way to wake up, and the way things were rocking and rolling, I was 
sure it was a big one. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I looked out of the window and heard a rumble, and I wasn't sure if it 
was from the earthquake -- I didn't know.Later, I put some clothes on and 
walked out into the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The house next to me, which had been on the street, was 100 feet down the 
hill. The only reason it didn't go farther was because there were some big pine 
trees, and that stopped it from going the rest of the way down the hill. The 
next house went farther down because the other trees were farther down the 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
 There were people kneeling around and I was very impressed with the response 
from the fire department in that they had already brought a hook-and-ladder 
truck out here. They had a spotlight, and the firemen were rappelling down the 
hill on ropes with chain saws, trying to get whoever was in there out.  
</P>
<P>
 They were down there with chain saws and jackhammers trying to get the roof 
open and get people out. The house was only about three feet tall. They were 
cutting a square in the roof to get down to where the people were screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 They got the man out; he only got a broken jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 They also got the woman out. They carried her out. 
</P>
<P>
 But they left the little girl who was dead there for probably three hours, 
because they were waiting for the coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 He never came. 
</P>
<P>
 They just wrapped her up in a blanket, put her in the trunk of the car and 
took her away.

 I remember hearing a tremendous roaring sound. I had been through the Sylmar 
quake and I lived in Pasadena during that Whittier quake, so it has a 
particular sound.I grabbed my 7 1/2-month old baby, and I got under a desk, 
which was next to the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband got under the door. After it was all over, he got a flashlight and 
we looked around the house and we just saw that the ginger jar had broken. We 
got back in bed and then we started getting phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of ours called half a mile away and half their house was destroyed. 
And I realized that we had been very, very lucky.  
</P>
<P>
 I was really grateful that the school district did not make us go back to work 
because it would have been very hard to have to take care of 30 children and 
their fears when there were a lot of aftershocks. What surprised me the first 
day of school was that the kids did not want to talk about the earthquake at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 They just said: "We don't want to talk about it any more, we just want to do 
our work."  
</P>
<P>
 And when I asked about that later, they said that by starting their work 
again, it's symbolic of their lives returning to normal. And by talking about 
it, it just keeps it going, and they just want it to be over.

By Irma Munoz, Munoz, 30, mother of three, ages 2, 5, 7, is a volunteer at 
Cahuenga Elementary School. She is a Guatemalan immigrant who has lived in Los 
Angeles 15 years. Her apartment near Beverly Boulevard and Kenmore Street in 
Los Angeles was damaged in the quake. She and her children have been staying 
with friends until she decides where to move. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've gone through an earthquake in Guatemala in '76. So right away when my bed 
started moving I knew it was an earthquake. The first thing I did was to throw 
the blankets on my children and embrace them and try to protect them as much as 
I could. When the shaking didn't stop and everything felt like it was coming 
down, my children were yelling, "Mommy, Mommy, please help us!" 
</P>
<P>
 They said at school they had taught them to get under the table. But I told 
them we couldn't because I felt that the building was coming down on us. We 
live on the third floor. They were yelling for their kitty. The kitty broke a 
leg; something fell on him. 
</P>
<P>
 My neighbors who know that I live alone knocked on the door so we could get 
out. They helped us get the children down in the dark. We didn't have a 
flashlight available. We just wanted to come out running. But when we were 
going down the stairs, it began to shake. It was very sad to see people who 
weren't able to leave the apartment. A lady hurt her knee badly. They had to go 
get her. She was the last one to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, I'm staying with different friends. The building hasn't been 
inspected like it should be. As you can see, there are still aftershocks and we 
can't put our lives in risk. We all know that the building is not OK. The 
majority of families have already left. 
</P>
<P>
 When you walk too fast upstairs in the apartment, the building feels like it 
moves. It feels like it's shaking. It's not my nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 We are begging city inspectors to come and inspect the building. If they can 
at least go and check so that people won't risk their children's lives. There's 
many people who have two, three kids like me. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a big problem what we're going through with our building. What the owner 
wants us to do is to pay rent. The few of us who are left are waiting to see if 
the building will still be livable. My things are in there, but I'm not 
planning to live there. I won't risk my children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been sad for us. I had no money. The neighbors would give me eggs and 
bread for the kids. We were cooking outside. We had no gas for a whole week. 
Yesterday the Salvation Army helped me with $56 to buy food. They made me fill 
out a form to see if I qualify for public housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteering at the school helps the nerves. After school I'll cook or bring 
something for the kids to eat. Sometimes they don't want to eat. Then I put 
them to do homework. Every day homework. 
</P>
<P>
 I need help. I need to move as soon as possible. That's the most important 
thing for the well-being of my children. Right now I depend on welfare's help 
to pay my rent and everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, right now, I carry this pain in my heart. It's sad to see, coming 
from another country like I do, that I am going through this. But thank God 
that He sent us this earthquake in the early morning instead of during the day. 
There would have been many more deaths. It would have caused the pain in my 
heart to be bigger for the children in many schools.

By Dr. Alvin Rosenblum, Rosenblum, a West Los Angeles dentist, lost all his 
equipment and the records of 2,500 patients, some dating to 1964, when the 
six-story building at Olympic Boulevard and Barrington Avenue, in which his 
30-year practice was housed, was severely damaged. The building was demolished 
five days after the quake. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tenants of the building are upset about the fact that every one of us, to 
a person, feels that there was no reason why we shouldn't have been able to get 
into the building to rescue our records. Our feeling is that it was rushed 
through to create access for Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 They began with the wrecking ball. They just knocked out windows and they sent 
somebody up in a cherry picker to look in. He could have reached out and 
grabbed paper, and he didn't. As they were using the wrecking ball, papers were 
flying out of the building. And then they watered everything down. There was no 
attempt to salvage anything. 
</P>
<P>
 When they had portions of the building down, they just dropped the wrecking 
ball on the top of it, just pounding it to nothingness. They were hauling 
truckloads of stuff out of there to we-don't-know-where so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 My office was state-of-the-art equipment, and everything was exactly what it 
was supposed to be. I had instruments that I modified for my own use that have 
been used for years. I can't replace those things. I've spent a lot of time on 
the wrecking site. I've taken photographs, and I think it's extremely unlikely 
that any of it is retrievable. My understanding right now is that we have zero 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know who had appointments, who's in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 I know I can get by this. I just hope my patients understand and find me. On 
reflection, I guess I am mad as hell. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, this experience just reinforces the knowledge of the way things are. 
We can't control what we can't control. People don't always do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best part for me is all the wonderful people who've been so caring and 
supportive -- all the offers of help and love. It would be nice if we could all 
be that supportive when we're not in periods of crisis.

By Monica Leveque, Leveque, 26, of Cheviot Hills, is job developer at the UCLA 
Placement Center and a single mother. During the earthquake, her 6-year-old 
daughter, Christina, was staying with Leveque's former husband in Los Angeles, 
with whom she shares joint custody. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm not even sure how I got out of bed because the dresser next to me fell. As 
I tried to gather some things to leave my apartment, a friend of mine came by. 
It was a relief to see her. She had a flashlight and told me step by step what 
I needed to do, because I was somewhat still disoriented. She helped me find my 
clothes and practically put them on me. 
</P>
<P>
 During the quake and afterward, I just started thinking about people that I 
knew who would be frightened, such as my grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 And my daughter. I didn't know if she was all right or if anything (had) 
happened to her. The phone lines were out so we couldn't contact her. 
</P>
<P>
 We left the apartment and picked up my friend's sister and another woman who 
were also alone. My friend knew how worried I was about Christina, and so we 
started across the city to find out how she was and what was happening with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 We went down Wilshire. It was really interesting with no stop lights. Most 
people were pretty much automatically doing the four-way stop throughout the 
city, but not everyone. Also, it was completely dark except when we went 
through Beverly Hills and all the lights were on. That was really odd, surreal. 
</P>
<P>
 It took about an hour and a half, much of it in tears, before we got to 
Christina's father's near the La Brea tar pits. I could be strong about the 
earthquake; that didn't bother me. But I was worrying about how she was. And 
whenever I would focus on that, I would break down a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried to think of other things because I was trying not to think about 
something bad happening to Christina. 
</P>
<P>
 When we finally got to her dad's place, I knocked on the door really loud 
because I didn't know what was going on. Her dad opened the door and she was 
sleeping on the couch under a lot of blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't tell you what a relief it was to see her. She was very calm. It didn't 
seem that she really understood the magnitude of what had happened. I don't 
think she even woke up until her father took her out of the room during the 
earthquake. I just immediately went and picked her up and just held on to her 
real tight. 
</P>
<P>
 We left Christina and her dad, and went from apartment to apartment of the 
people that were (in the car) seeing what the damage was and picking up a 
little bit. No one wanted to be alone again. So we pretty much stayed together 
the rest of the day, just going from place to place. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that evening, Christina's dad called. They had gone through the city 
trying to find a place to eat but couldn't find anything open. Then his car 
broke down in Hollywood and they had to walk home. He was calling to see if I 
could pick her up because he still didn't have electricity yet, and he figured 
that she should be with me because then she'd have electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 I was actually relieved that he called because I was just very, very happy to 
have her home.

By Jean Priestman, Priestman, 56, is the administrator for the Sparr

 I recall a very large explosive noise. Boom! I got out of bed in my mobile 
home and didn't know where the heck to stand because mobile homes are not 
designed very well, but I just went into any archway at that point. The 
movement was up and down, up and down and then crossways. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't know what in the world was happening. I did have a fear, but mostly 
how to take care of myself. The earthquake let up for one split second like it 
was all over and then suddenly it really rocked and rolled. I tried to get out 
the front door, but it was jammed. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't get out and I was scared. So I went to the back door and it was OK, 
and I opened up the door and the gas main had been severed. All the gas fumes 
were coming into my home. The odor was very, very strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it seemed like it was quiet for a minute and I went back into my mobile 
home and I was sort of numb for a moment. And then I went outside and people at 
that point were starting to stir around. It was very, very dark and black. 
There weren't any lights. People were getting terrified. There was a lot of 
screaming in this park. People were screaming at the top of their lungs. I 
looked over to the left of me and there was a fire that had started. It was a 
large fire and as it went up, I knew it was in our park, and then at that point 
everybody was getting more and more terrified. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing we could do. We couldn't get any water. Then all of a sudden 
I looked over to the right and there was another fire starting over at the 
other end. I was trying to get things out of my house. It was important that I 
got my papers . . . and the picture that I had of Sparr, my dog, that was 
hanging on the wall. I grabbed those and threw them in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Fires were raging. People were running helter-skelter. There was an awful lot 
of panic. People were driving every which way. It reminded me of World War II 
and all the news reels that you would see of Europe: the fires, the people 
running in their pajamas in the streets, screaming, panic. Just like a war 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 We were told to get out of the park. The fires were coming closer and closer 
and closer. I felt like I was in a movie set. I was walking around alone a lot 
of the time because I chose to do that. I didn't want to be around too many 
people. There were two ladies who would not get out of their mobile homes; they 
had dogs and they were terrified. They just felt like they could not go out of 
that home even though it was moving. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a man who was running down the street in his pajamas and it was like 
he was confused, like the patients in the hospital when they get very confused 
and disoriented. I told him that he was going to be OK, and the most important 
thing was to save his own life. I told him to come along with me and I'd get 
him to a safe area.  
</P>
<P>
 There was one lady who said she wasn't going, and I just said, "Look, you've 
got to get out of here because this place could blow up right on you." So I was 
talking to her like that, and I took her by the arm and more or less just 
forced her out of that place and onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
 A tree was catching fire right behind me. I was scared the fire would come 
over into our trailer section. I got a pail because there was a lot of water 
running down from the street here in front of me from a broken main. I grabbed 
another person and said, "Look, you just keep filling up this pail," and I 
would run over and throw the water onto the tree to stop it from catching fire. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so dark, and it was terrible because the wind was blowing and the wind 
was carrying the sparks from the fire in the trees into our hair and on our 
bodies. That was very frightening. It was more than frightening, it was 
terrifying. There was nothing you could do but watch it and try to help people, 
that's all. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of guys were running around trying to turn off the gas and the 
electrical. I had a wrench by my gas meter and I tried to use it, but I 
couldn't see anything. They finally turned off the main gas line to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 I cried a lot when I saw my friends' homes going up in the fire. I cried 
because I was just happy that everybody got out of here alive. It was wonderful 
to see people helping each other. A lot of those people aren't going to move 
back here anymore. They're going to move out of California. One I know moved to 
Canada. Some want to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 How I am coping now is basically by using the skills I've learned through the 
12-step recovery program. I know I have no control over what happens. What's 
going to happen is going to happen, and I have no control of that, and indeed, 
that's what happened here. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm turning my fate over to a higher power. I'm a survivor; I've always been a 
survivor. I'm going to keep going on with my life. I won't stop. And I'll 
continue enjoying just what the Earth has to offer me: a simplicity of life.  
</P>
<P>
 No question about it, this little ol' earthquake showed me what life is really 
all about. When I walk on the face of this Earth, it is still the most 
comfortable of all places to be, even if it rocks and rolls.

<P>
 I was still half-asleep when I realized I was completely in midair. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like the house had raised up and dropped just enough that I was no 
longer in contact with my mattress. That brought me around to consciousness, 
but in the shock of it, I just held my breath out of pure panic. 
</P>
<P>
 I reached over and found that my wife had already gotten out of bed and was 
crawling toward our kids' bedroom. I just lay there, riding it out, holding my 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shaking wound down, I grabbed my flashlight and surveyed the room: 
bookcase down, TV on the floor, the draperies off the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 And I'm still holding my breath. 
</P>
<P>
 I could hear my wife calling to my kids because there was so much debris in 
the hallway that she couldn't get to them. It was time for me to be the man of 
the house and settle everybody down. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I'm still holding my breath. 
</P>
<P>
 I jump from bed, leap the bookcase and take four steps down the hall. By now 
my wife and two daughters have met in the hallway. The kids are screaming and 
my wife is trying to settle them. And I still haven't breathed. 
</P>
<P>
 That was my last conscious moment. 
</P>
<P>
 I woke up utterly delirious. My kids were still screaming because they saw me 
take a few steps and then go down. I guess I passed out from lack of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried to orient myself, but had no idea where I was. It took me a long time 
to figure out why I wasn't in bed and was instead in the hallway. Then I kind 
of remembered and crawled around. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't help but laugh and ask, "What happened?" They said they thought I 
had maybe seen our cat or dog squashed and that caused me to pass out. I told 
them: "No, I just stopped breathing." They said, "What a fool thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 It was pretty embarrassing and frustrating. I wanted so much to show them that 
they could put their confidence in me in an emergency, and the next thing I 
know, I'm waking up on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure what I'll do in the next quake. Friends suggested hypnotherapy 
that tells me, "When the house shakes, inhale," or have a small oxygen mask 
close by. My wife said I should crawl slowly on the floor instead of trying to 
run around the house doing everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, I did the same thing in the '71 earthquake. I got up out of bed 
and held my breath until I passed out. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughters love kidding me about this. The younger one, who's 8, says she's 
a little nervous about going back to school and talking to her friends. When 
they tell stories about how heroic their dads were, she's going to have to tell 
them: 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to resuscitate my dad."

By Guillermina Sanchez, Sanchez, 31, a child-care provider, lives in the Adams 
district with her husband, Alberto, a garment worker, and their daughters, 
Luisana, 7, and Gabriela, 5. Their apartment was on the second floor of an 
eight-unit building, which was condemned shortly after the quake. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was awakened by the quake, and I wanted go outside with my two daughters. I 
was trying to get up because the girls were yelling to me that something was 
wet and to come and get them because they were very afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 All the neighbors were screaming that gas was escaping. Those on the first 
floor had to get out by breaking windows because the doors wouldn't open. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were screaming and crying, and I didn't know where water was falling 
from. Gaby would scream that she was wet, that she was cold. When we went 
outside to the street, she cried because it was cold. There was a lot of fog 
and all we had to keep us warm was one blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 The building looked fine. But when the sun rose, everyone was frightened when 
they saw the building. The building was cracked beneath the cement. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about 9 or 10 o'clock when the supervisor came, and he told us that we 
couldn't enter the building because security was going to come guard the 
building. He told us to get out only what we could carry, a sweater or a 
blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to my mother's in South Gate because I didn't have anywhere to go. I 
don't know what would have happened if I didn't have my mother. Because the 
people who had nowhere to go waited all day, until noon or 1:00, until they 
were given a place to stay. They had to go to the main office, where they could 
find out where to get a vacant apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager called me at my mother's house to tell me to come get my things on 
Thursday or Friday because they were going to tear down the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the earthquake, I didn't feel well, but I didn't feel too bad. 
By Friday, I started feeling sick. Saturday, I felt very nervous because I 
didn't have a house to stay in and because I only had one day to move my 
things. That day I felt sick as if I was drowning. I began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt so bad that I went away while my daughters stayed with my mother. My 
husband told me that I had to get better and calm down, because we had our 
daughters to look after. He said that he understood why I was afraid and 
nervous, but that I needed to calm down. 
</P>
<P>
 All of my neighbors were left without homes and were staying outside. All of 
the chimneys in the area fell. A building that's about a block away was 
destroyed. That morning the police came and told the tenants that they had to 
leave because the building wasn't safe. 
</P>
<P>
 So the people began moving their things out. All day there were parents and 
their children outside cooking. All the children, including my own, were hungry 
by 10 or 11 in the morning. All this was difficult for me. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have anything. You feel like a victim in a helpless situation. And 
you feel very afraid. That same day I couldn't enter my house because I felt as 
if someone was watching me waiting to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not go to FEMA for help because I was only left without a home, while 
people were in worse situations who needed more things. I was able to go to my 
mother's house and have hot food, a roof over my head, and my husband still had 
his job to go to. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaby, my youngest, still thinks a lot about it. She says that her heart hurts 
her but I don't know what's wrong with her. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't give them a good explanation. If I tell them that it was caused by 
earth movements, she asks why it happens in some areas and not in others, why 
it happens at midnight or at four in the morning when everyone is asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 I tell them that it's God's will and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

 When the quake hit, my next-door neighbor ran out naked with just her 
daughter's leather jacket on. I had on thongs and my nightgown.We went down to 
the ocean, where things wouldn't fall on us. There were a lot of homeless 
people sleeping there, but none of them woke up. For once, we kind of envied 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The people I was with wanted to get to a phone to call their parents. We went 
to their friends' house very near by. I sat there with total strangers, 
drinking cappuccino and eating birthday cake in a million-dollar house. Then I 
went home. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd left in the dark. It was worse than I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a three-story condominium. The top story is my office. I work there 
full-time. It's no more. Everything fell -- scripts, files, folders, endless 
amounts of books, all the televisions. I'd just bought a new CD player; I 
played it once and it's history. 
</P>
<P>
 I hired two men for five hours Tuesday and it took them that long to find the 
office phones, which were off the hook and completely buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I have my office in my car. I took the fax and the word processor and the 
files I could find and the Filofax. My chimney is going to go any minute, so 
every time I go inside, I think it's the last time in there. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are so many people much worse off. I'm a goal-oriented person, so my 
main complaint is that I don't know what to do. Once I can figure out what to 
do, I'll be OK.

post-quake commuter-speak. She normally takes the Santa Monica Freeway to work.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes I go north on La Brea, sometimes I go south. The first time I took 
the Santa Monica Freeway going home from work, I got off on La Brea and got 
onto Olympic, but there was a building coming down on Olympic, so it was backed 
up for miles and that was awful.The other day, I went south on La Brea and I 
went up toward Baldwin Hills and I got a little lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, I've been playing around trying to find a route. Normally the 
morning drive would be 45 minutes at the most, the longest, and I would leave 
the house by 7:30. Now I leave at 5. Before when I left at 5, I could zip on 
the freeway and literally get to my destination in 20 minutes. Now it takes at 
least 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm thinking about public transportation. I'm waiting to see what's happening. 
I'm hoping that things are going to calm down, but they probably won't.

By Robert Arnold, Arnold, 33, North Hollywood, is a sign language instructor 
for adults at Learning Tree University in Chatsworth and Classes Unlimited in 
South Pasadena. He is 90% deaf without a hearing aid.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deaf people don't hear an earthquake. I can imagine what an earthquake must 
sound like, but because we are deaf, we are overly sensitive to vibrations.But 
to have everything -- everything -- shaking through your legs and through your 
hands, that freaks you out. It intensifies, it really rattles the body. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, my hearing aid was not where I usually keep it, on my 
desktop. Finally, after 45 minutes, maybe an hour -- I lost sense of time -- I 
found it, on the floor. It was under papers and some files. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ultimate fears for deaf people: When rescuers are looking for 
survivors under the rubble, they yell. How would the deaf people respond to, 
"Are you there? " Deaf people can't keep on screaming forever. You faint. 
</P>
<P>
 And then I think, what about blind people, how do they handle it? And what 
about people in wheelchairs?

By Ana Morale; Rosa Dominguez, e, lland, ; Sylvia Elizabeth Garcia, Morales, 
42, and her 14-year-old daughter, along with three other families, have been 
living in a makeshift plastic tent across the street from their apartment 
building at Westlake and 3rd streets, near MacArthur Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, we have remained outside. We went to MacArthur Park for 
a while, but we didn't like it there. We came back and set up a plastic tent on 
this side of the street. On the other side is our apartment building.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the "no entry" sign was put up on our building, we only go back in for 
necessities, for emergencies. The American Red Cross came and scolded us. They 
want us to go to a shelter, but we have to keep an eye on our building. What if 
looters try to get in? 
</P>
<P>
 I lost my job the day of the quake. The lady I work for in Beverly Hills took 
my job away because I didn't go to work on Monday. How was I supposed to go 
clean her house in Beverly Hills if I was out here? 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't gotten ill, but my nerves are shot bad. My daughter has a sore 
throat. That boy over there has the flu. Everyone who's here is ill. People 
from Clinica Para Las Americas came on Wednesday and took care of us. 
</P>
<P>
 I had paid my rent on Sunday and then on Monday this happened. The owner said 
he wasn't going to give anyone back their rent money. I paid and now I'm living 
on the street with my traumatized daughter. She hasn't gone back to school. I 
don't know if anyone will send us help. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dominguez, 38, came to America 15 years ago from El Salvador. She is the 
single parent of two children, ages 9 and 1.  
</P>
<P>
 We walk to Belmont High School at about 8 p.m. every night to sleep there 
because my son is very frightened. We don't stay in the apartment because the 
ceiling is buckling. During the day, we're here watching that our things are 
not taken from the apartments.  
</P>
<P>
 The owner says that the building is OK, that we can go inside. But we're 
scared, the apartments are very bad. We've asked the owner for our deposit to 
go elsewhere, but he said he wouldn't give it to us. And he said whoever wanted 
to leave, they could, but he wasn't going to return the deposit. We don't have 
any support whatsoever from anybody.

<P>
 Garcia, 30, from Guatemala, a single parent of 4-year-old Luis Alfredo Godoy 
Garcia, has lived in Los Angeles for nine years.  
</P>
<P>
 When the earthquake hit, it was terrifying. The balcony doors are now shut 
closed, sealed. There's only the stairs because the elevators don't work. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the quake, we built our tents out here to sleep. The plastic for 
the tents was given to us by the Chinese man from a nearby furniture store. 
We're not sleeping on beds, just on cushions and mattresses that were thrown 
there on top of cardboard and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the daytime we are here. At times we go up to the apartment for clothes, 
but nothing else. We're afraid. At the moment we don't know what we are going 
to do. We are confused with all that has happened. The day after the 
earthquake, the police came around midnight and 1 a.m. knocking on our doors to 
get out of the building because of the damage, to not to be in there anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 I was very ill from coughing and the flu. The night before last, I had high 
fevers from sleeping out here. I don't want to sleep at Belmont High School. We 
can't abandon the apartments. We have to be near. I'm feeling a lot of tension. 
 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what I'm going to do. The owner took us to other buildings he 
owns that are in worse condition than the one we are in. But I don't want to 
live there. Meanwhile, people here don't know what they are going to do. We are 
living day by day.

By Nathan Gardels, Gardels, 41, is editor of New Perspectives Quarterly. He and 
his familywife, Lilli, and sons Alex, 3, and Carlos, 6lived in Woodland Hills, 
but they left town right after the quake. He was interviewed by phone from 
Milan, Italy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 4:31 in the morning, all lights were off, it's pitch-black, I immediately 
jump up, ask my wife to get the younger son to hide in a doorway. The TV set is 
the first thing that falls on my leg as I'm running out of the bedroom in pitch 
blackness. We have a linen closet that opens horizontally. I run into closets. 
I can't see. I have bruises all over my body. 
</P>
<P>
 The roar is deafening, like a jet taking off, like a train going by. We huddle 
until the first shock is over. It seems interminable. The doors have flown 
open. There's one flashlight downstairs; it's very weak. 
</P>
<P>
 I start fishing then, saying OK, there are batteries in some of the kids' 
toys. I discover everything has fallen out of their closets. The toys with the 
batteries I need are buried under 10,000 other toys that have fallen from the 
shelves. I make my way back to the table. Meanwhile, aftershock after 
aftershock is happening every time I stand up. I'm searching in the dark for my 
glasses, then I'm trying to go downstairs to get more flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I discover the ruins. The walls are cracked in 15 places, there are 2,000 
books strewn cross the floor. All the crystal is broken. There's wall-to-wall 
glass and debris on the floor. It is now 5:30. I can't see a thing.  
</P>
<P>
 I walk barefoot over glass and debris in a state of semi-shock. I go outside 
to turn off the gas. The wrench was hanging there already. I have a pool, 40 
feet from my house. There has, in effect, been a tidal wave. It washed all the 
planted flowers, lifted them up by the roots and washed them onto the patio, 40 
feet away, knocked over huge pots with palm trees, broken. There are more 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it's 6:30 and getting light enough to see. The fireplace is cracked 
to smithereens. I have 13 rooms in the house, each one with major cracks. 
Plaster is falling off the walls. Italian vases, everything shattered. All the 
spices are out of the cabinets. Honey mixed with coarse ground pepper and 
vinegar. It's a total mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Your first instinct is to start cleaning up. You don't know where to begin. 
Every book is out of the shelf. Every pot is broken. Every dish has fallen out. 
And every time you start to move, there's an aftershock. We cleaned up a bit, 
then sat outside and just stared into space. 
</P>
<P>
 We kept the kids away from the chimney. We talked to neighbors to assess the 
damage. I went to see the blind lady down the street -- she's alone -- to see 
if she needed help. Who knows where the day went? It's 3, 4, getting dark; 
geez, we'd better start getting ready for darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 We pitch a tent in the back yard, put out candles, a bottle of water. We get 
the kids dressed in two, three layers of clothes and prepare to sleep outside. 
That we did until 8 o'clock. We were singing campfire songs. It was incredible 
to see the stars. Usually, there are so many lights in L.A. you can't see the 
stars. Too much light refracting in the sky. It was pitch-black. We saw 
shooting stars. 
</P>
<P>
 It was cold. Then we got a call from my brother-in-law. He said the 101's 
finally open, you should come up here. Their house was not damaged at all. We 
didn't take two seconds. We drove with great trepidation along the 101, 
imagining at every turn that the freeway would break apart and we'd fall 
through a crevice. 
</P>
<P>
 We stayed the rest of the week, then I took the family to Washington, D.C., 
and I had to go to Europe (on business). I was going to stay, but the schools 
were closed. We can't live in the house; the chimney is dangerous. A beam 
across the living room could be structurally unsound. We can't get ahold of a 
building inspector to check it. 
</P>
<P>
 We were terrified of going back in the house. I read the L.A. Times; I read 
the scientists' analysis, the pattern of the earthquake moving northwest to the 
San Andreas Fault. I didn't want my family in California when I was out of 
town. I would have no peace of mind. I couldn't do my work. 
</P>
<P>
 I frankly am so freaked out, but I'm not, generally speaking, a neurotic 
person. The pattern was so clear: The Big One could come tomorrow, in two days, 
two weeks, two years. If this one wasn't the Big One, I can be sure the house 
would not be standing in the Big One. So let's get out of there, look for 
another place to live, maybe the suburbs outside of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 People who didn't go through this damage, like friends of mine in Redondo 
Beach or Orange County, it's like just another earthquake to them. For those 
who experience it, it is like you don't want to wait for the Big One. 
</P>
<P>
 It breaks my heart to leave. I worked in Gov. Jerry Brown's office; I work 
with institutes to think about the Pacific Basin. I'm a promoter of California. 
But it's not worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 (On Wednesday) I'm out there cleaning the house, the sun is glinting on the 
pool, the garden is blooming, the grass is green. It's beautiful. It's 
paradise. It's lovely. Nice Mediterranean style. It's perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 And you start thinking, Jesus, this is a shame. Is this real? And all you have 
to have is another 5.5 aftershock. That day we did. Five in a row. And I said, 
I'm out of here. 
</P>
<P>
 At any moment the Big One could strike. Talk about writing on the walls. There 
is writing all over the walls on my house. The writing is all over the sagging 
walls of my house. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial aftershocks -- this quake shook every ounce of equity out of my 
house. In California, you save by buying a home. You get equity, you sell, move 
on, move up. This has wiped out the effective savings of a big chunk of the 
middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't wipe me out. I have to put 20 grand up front to fix my house; I'll 
get 40 or 50 from the insurance company. I'll be putting 60 grand into a house 
which is going to sell below what I bought it at. You should say I live in a 
beautiful two-story home with a large pool on one-third of an acre. It's 
available at a good price, a $400,000 house. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm telling you two statements: I love California. I'm leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time you get ready to go to sleep, you feel something, a truck going by. 
The adrenaline starts rushing. I'm a cliche. (After the quake) the kids were 
not out of my sight the whole time I was in California. I slept with them, ate 
with them. Everybody was in the car with me. 
</P>
<P>
 You've heard the voice of a rational man who's in terror.

By Lowell (Pat) Patton, Patton, 66, is the owner of a building at 734 Montana 
Ave., Santa Monica, that was condemned after the earthquake. Downstairs is 
Patton's Pharmacy, which is now operated by another pharmacist; upstairs are 
six rent-controlled apartments. Patton has owned the 63-year-old building for 
about 30 years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My initial response when I got to the building about 30 minutes after the 
quake was, "Thank God no one was hurt in the building." We were still having 
aftershocks, and I just felt that we should not be near the building. I wanted 
to make sure that everybody had been evacuated. I wasn't sure where they all 
went, but later in the day I made contact with some of them and found they were 
OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I wondered what I was going to do with the building. Was I going to have 
to take it down and start from the beginning? 
</P>
<P>
 You can see some huge cracks in the building on the west side. There are three 
or four rows of bricks that actually were shaken out of the building. I'd say 
there's been a movement of approximately six to eight inches; the building has 
moved on the corners at the top of the second story. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm still getting calls about the pharmacy a week and a half after the quake. 
Old friends have called in tears, crying about the pharmacy. We were allowed 
under security to go into the pharmacy to secure the computer and all the 
backup tapes for our charges and our prescription files. We have relocated the 
pharmacy to 20th and Arizona, and our calls are going there. 
</P>
<P>
 All the prescriptions are being filled there, tracked by computers, and we're 
totally up and running with all our documentation. I think we had somewhere 
between 4,000 and 6,000 charge accounts here at the store. They were all 
neighborhood people who had sustained the pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always been proud of this building. We remodeled it after we bought it, 
and the architect won a city beautification award when it was finished. It's an 
early California structure with brick and some stucco. It's sort of been a 
landmark as far as pharmacy services here in our community. I have other 
properties in Santa Monica, and my home is here. None of them suffered any 
major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early spring, we had a complete seismic retrofitting of this building, 
and you can see the retrofitting plates on the roof level and on the level 
between the first and second floors. Those go all the way through the building 
and connect to the front of the building. The same way going laterally on each 
side. So each side, four sides, are covered with this retrofitting. Had it not 
been for having that work done, I believe the damage would have been much 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 I really don't know what the fate of the building will be. There is a great 
possibility it will have to be demolished. I would feel sad at that.

By Jerry Podany, Podany, 43, the head of antiquities conservation at the J. 
Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, lives in the Larchmont area of Los Angeles. He and 
his wife, Amanda, have a 4-year-old daughter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was definitely the worst shaking I had ever felt. The first thought, of 
course, is just for the safety of the family. But early on, in a separate part 
of my brain, I was concerned about the museum's collection. Anytime there's an 
earthquake, a part of me thinks about the efforts we've made and the objects at 
the museum, trying to envision what I might find. We have objects there that 
are priceless. 
</P>
<P>
 We've worked with seismic engineers for more than 12 years now, devising 
methods to secure our pieces in the event of an earthquake. We've even put our 
pieces on shake tables to make sure they'll remain stable. Some of the pieces 
are designed to roll, others are tied down. But you never know whether those 
methods will work until the real thing happens. 
</P>
<P>
 I received a phone call from the museum within about 40 minutes of the quake. 
We had an initial report that four items were partially damaged, but that we 
were spared major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I felt that my family was calm and our home secure, I got in touch with 
Bruce Metro, who prepares museum pieces for display. We met at La Brea and Pico 
and drove in separate cars. When we got to Pacific Coast Highway, we had to 
weave around all these huge landslides. There were these huge boulders all 
around and furniture in the road from that one house that slid down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember thinking, "What are these people doing taking pictures?" But I 
guess that's just our nature. That, in a very surreal way, added to the anxiety 
because it was an implication that things were very severe, much worse than I 
thought when I was at my home. 
</P>
<P>
 I was thinking about the whole collection. We had just remounted a couple of 
very fragile, large terra cottas, and I was wondering how they did. 
</P>
<P>
 When we got to the museum, they had already cordoned off areas of the museum 
where pieces were lying around, so no one would walk through them. They had 
noted objects that needed to be made secure in case of aftershocks. We had 
practiced this once a year, in the event of an earthquake, and it was 
surprising how quickly the plan kicked into gear. 
</P>
<P>
 We then headed off into the galleries and began the walk-through. 
</P>
<P>
 One part of me was in an automatic mode that doesn't have time to feel 
anxious. We had a plan in place so that we didn't go helter-skelter through the 
museum, worrying about specific things and ignoring others. But another part of 
me was concerned about those areas of the museum I hadn't gotten to. 
</P>
<P>
 Two sculptures, both marble, were damaged. One was a bust of a boxer that had 
a small chip on the back shoulder. It had rotated on its mount and come in 
contact with the pedestal. The other was a Roman head, part of a life-size 
figure, that jettisoned to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Two vases in the antique collection downstairs were damaged. One fell over and 
broke. It was a nice clean break. And a small, dish-like vase was cracked when 
another vase fell on it. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, we were spared any major damage. And being familiar with these 
objects and all the efforts that have gone toward saving them, I felt very 
proud. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, any damage to these pieces is terrible. It doesn't really matter 
about their market price; they're all invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, the light of day made things better because, like everybody 
else, I feel much more in control of my environment in the light. But later as 
I made my way to our Wilshire office in Santa Monica, the devastation that had 
occurred began to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody asked me, since this was an earthquake-prone area, should an art 
collection of such value be kept here? Well, where would you put it where it 
wasn't going to face potential danger? Are we going to deny ourselves of these 
beautiful pieces because of earthquakes? 
</P>
<P>
 My commute is a nightmare now, but the other night after I finally made it 
home, I wanted to take a bit of a breather. I wandered into my back yard for a 
few minutes. I was stressed out, I guess from the commute, which for me has 
gone from 45 minutes to about 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 I was really feeling a little wound up about the city, mostly from trying to 
drive through this mess. But I looked up and a blimp was going overhead. And 
instead of the usual beer or suntan oil advertisements, it was flashing out 
locations and telephone numbers for assistance and shelter. In English and 
Spanish, it was flashing a message about not using open-flame candles in the 
house in case there was a gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
 I suddenly had this really clear sense of how prepared L. A. was. With all 
these disasters happening one after the other, one could imagine that after 
suffering all of that, and then a big earthquake, that the city could have just 
fallen apart. But here the city had put all of this effort, which obviously had 
taken a long time to plan and think of. The city was taking care of its people. 
</P>
<P>
 That blimp, probably more than anything, really expressed the concern the city 
had for all of its people, people who didn't have power, people who didn't have 
telephones, people who couldn't speak English, couldn't read English. Even 
though more needs to be done, it gave me a good feeling.

By Michael Rotondi, Rotondi, 44, of Silver Lake, is a downtown architect who 
designed the new L.A. restaurant Nicola. Other than things falling from 
shelves, his home and officein an old brewery near Chinatownhad little damage. 
He finds earthquakes more fascinating than frightening. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an architect, I'm always interested in earthquakes and the academic level 
of just knowing how forces work. All our experiences with earthquakes are that 
they move laterally, but this one hopped -- which is why a lot of things didn't 
fall off shelves. In some parts of the city, it's like it was as much vertical 
as it was horizontal. 
</P>
<P>
 When I came back, my desk had been hopping up and down and I could see where 
the paint was (damaged). Also, just to see the fatigue on some of the 
buildings. It works its way back into your mind that when you're designing, you 
begin to think about forces coming from every direction. 
</P>
<P>
 I've also worked in Tokyo, which probably has one of the strictest earthquake 
codes. I think that the codes here are going to become closer to those. They 
design buildings in Tokyo as if every building is the epicenter. They design 
completely rigid buildings and I think that's what is going to begin happening 
here. The building code is going to be rewritten structurally and so the cost 
of construction is going to go up. There's going to be a whole shift in the 
whole system of designing and constructing and all of that. 
</P>
<P>
 We have to be ready. Most places that we build are the places that are most 
likely affected by something. It's like we cut hillsides, then put houses on 
them and then are surprised that there are landslides. We build on the 
flatlands and then we're surprised that there is earth movement. It's all the 
flatlands, like underneath here and parts all over the city, wherever it's 
flat, there's water below the ground and it shakes like Jell-O. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for earthquakes, we're never aware that the Earth's crust is actually 
moving, that the Earth is an organism that is constantly moving just like 
everything else and, in the immediate sense, it affects us, shakes us all up. 
There's something destabilizing about having your body moved by the Earth. 
We're 75% water and so when you're shaking, your cells remember that. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody was talking about the earthquake. Everyone I talked to, the first 
question they asked was about the earthquake. Everybody shared stories and the 
one positive thing about that is that there isn't much else that cuts through 
all the differences we have. It was something that affected the entire city.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just a fire in Malibu or a landslide in some other part of the city. 
The riots almost did that, but they still had distinct lines that they were 
following. The earthquake hit everybody, and everybody, regardless if whether 
you were affected directly with major damage, knows somebody that was. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that I was really struck with that if it's not this one, 
there will be another disaster that's going to make you have to live like a 
camper. I immediately started thinking about what everyone else was thinking 
about. You know, the long term, the next three to five days, water, food and 
all of that and how unprepared I was for that. 
</P>
<P>
 This happens at a time that one of the things that I've been working on for 
the last four years is the whole topic of death. My mother is slowly dying. 
Physically she is losing all of her strength, but mentally she is completely 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
 So, I began reading a book called "The Tibetan Book of the Dead"; it's a 
guiding mechanism that you read when someone is dying, as a way of helping them 
work their way -- the spirit separating from the flesh -- as the Tibetan 
Buddhists believe. 
</P>
<P>
 It also talks about life. But it primarily talks about the nature of 
impermanence, and how attached we get to everything and how we always want to 
turn everything back to its original condition and how resistive we are when 
anything changes -- even the smallest things in our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing for me is that the earthquake served as a kind of a lesson. We've 
got the disadvantages and the liabilities that come with natural disaster, but 
we also have the benefits of knowing that natural disasters are just that -- 
they're not created by other people. 
</P>
<P>
 With an earthquake, you can't place blame, so you have to have faith. The 
whole element of faith has been missing across the board. The only time most 
people pray is when they get close to death or something traumatic is going to 
happen to them. I think all of this seems pretty clear to me, that this is some 
sort of precursor to all of us having to move back into a spiritual realm, not 
religious, and going inside ourselves and seeing what really matters. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something extraordinarily symbolic about being swallowed up by the 
Earth -- ashes to ashes.

 I waited it out underneath a big desk I have in my bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I got my flashlight and turned it on, I saw that this was quite a 
quake.It had thrown a lot of stuff around. So I got dressed. I got my black 
leather carrying bag and I put all my accounts in there -- my checking 
accounts, corporate accounts and so forth. I got a leather jacket on, and I 
just got on my bike to ride over to Ed Begley Jr.'s house, half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew Eddie was hooked up to solar power. So he would have electrical power. 
But Eddie wasn't home. He was in Prague doing a picture. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to just be with friends. I didn't want to die alone. I thought this 
is why man has a civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 The people across the street from me are older people. They're in their 60s. 
They've lived in their home for 38 years, and they have a lot of memories 
invested in the objects there. All those were destroyed. And it's hard to let 
it go. It's hard to die in a sense. So I felt compassion and a desire to help 
them. That is the goodness that I think has come out of this for me. It has 
awakened my heart a bit to everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the balance between culture and nature. I think the earthquake has 
just awakened me more to the natural world. It just knocked me out of my 
cultural knot. I think perhaps that is the message to all of us: to stay more 
conscious of the planet. It's destructive, but we can be as equally destructive 
by ignoring it.

By Scott and Kim Lee, Lee and his wife, Kim, both 47, came to the United States 
from Korea in the late '70s. Nine years ago, they began selling tropical fish 
from the Aquarium Center, a red-brick building in Santa Monica. Their business 
prospered, and six years ago they bought a $400,000 house in Malibu. Then, the 
Lees were dealt two mighty blows. First, their home was destroyed in November's 
wildfires. (The heat was so intense it even melted the refrigerator, Lee said.) 
They moved to an apartment near their business. Two weeks ago, the Northridge 
quake slammed their shop, toppling dozens of plastic aquariums (I tell my 
customers to get a plastic aquarium because plastic absorbs the shock) and 
spilling hundreds of fish and thousands of gallons of water onto the floor. But 
the Lees (pictured on page one) are moving ahead with their lives, 
philosophical about the setbacks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are problems everywhere. It may happen to anybody, it just happened to 
us. So we've got to get through somehow.We are much luckier than those people 
who lost their lives, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 I did cry at first, Kim said. What can you do? Now we are trying to rebuild 
our business and rebuild our home. 
</P>
<P>
 We worked hard the last few years, but since the fire, the money and material 
things, it's not that important, Scott said. Staying safe and healthy, living 
happier, those are the most important things. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, I hope that this will be a turning point for our family to lean on 
God more, Kim said. I was not a serious Christian and Scott would say, "I just 
drive her to church." He falls asleep during the ceremony. But I hope that this 
will be like a turning point for all my family. Even for other people, too. If 
they trust in God more, they can find peace in God. 
</P>
<P>
 We've got to keep going, right? Scott said. I try. And luckily, I have a lot 
of support from my employees and customers. And all my friends and from my 
church -- her church actually. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's not that bad. Hundreds, even thousands of people are a lot worse 
than me. It's even better than when we had the riot. I think that one was 
really bad. This one is Mother Nature. The riot has a human cause. Compared to 
that, it's a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I think it made Los Angeles people think more. People try to help 
each other. I think it's a good lesson.

By Gary Apfel and Serena Apfel, Apfel, 41, is a Los Angeles-based partner of 
the New York law firm Kaye, Scholer. His wife Serena, 36, is a native 
Californian who teaches dentistry at USC. They live in Los Angeles with their 
five children, who range in age from 10 years to 6 weeks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was clearly the most frightening experience of my life. Bar none. 
</P>
<P>
 But not more than 10 minutes after the quake, a really interesting thing 
happened: The phone rang, and we both assumed it was Serena's parents. It was 
my younger brother calling from London. He's a stock trader, and he was sitting 
in front of a computer screen in London and across it flashed something saying 
that a major earthquake had hit Los Angeles. And he was able to get through to 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 I was just so relieved that everyone was OK, (but) so shaken that it didn't 
even occur to me at the time to do something cheery with the children. I just 
thought: We're all together; we're all OK. But they were scared. 
</P>
<P>
 So, a couple nights later, we all got into our bedroom and I asked each of 
them to tell me how they felt about the earthquake. They all said they were 
scared, and I told them that there's nothing wrong with being scared. Frankly, 
I said, we were scared, too. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with being scared. It's very human to be scared, but one 
has to be brave. That's the definition of being brave -- being scared yet not 
letting that keep you from doing whatever it is you're supposed to be doing. We 
were very proud of our children. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, we were scared, too. In fact, as soon as I calmed down enough to 
start thinking semi-rationally, I said to myself: What do I need this for? I'm 
from Manhattan, and I was just thinking to myself: This is crazy, I should move 
my family back East. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'd say about a day later, I really thought about it, and realized we love 
L.A. We're very happy here. My wife and my children are happy here. It's just a 
nice place to live. And even with the riots and all the other problems that 
we've been having, having lived in New York for 36 years, I have no desire to 
move back there. I'm a real L.A. booster. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, conversion is the right word here because, when Serena and I decided 
to get married, we discussed where we'd live, and I said to her the last place 
on earth that I would live is L.A. Never!  
</P>
<P>
 But, as a New Yorker, I'm able to experience here the things that really 
appealed to me about New York without the negatives -- the freezing winters, 
the gray skies 90% of the time, the hot and sticky summers, the blackouts. And 
the hot subways, the multitude of people on the street, the pushing and the 
shoving. 
</P>
<P>
 You know what was great about our experience the morning of the earthquake? 
Everybody was out. And that's unusual. I mean, we rarely get to see our 
neighbors except for the ones that we socialize with. It was a real feeling of 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 As with every other experience in human nature, as time goes by, we will all 
forget the terrible fear that we experienced and get back to our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Life will go on because that's human nature. But I guess for me having lived 
through this now and seeing that we are able to survive and the city is able to 
survive and we're able to cope with it. . . . If, God forbid, something like 
this ever happens again, I just know it will be a lot easier to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 And it definitely doesn't make me want to leave. To go back to the freezing 
cold in New York? What for? What for?

<TEXT>
<P>
 My recollection is that I awoke just milliseconds before it happened. I threw 
myself onto my companion in some kind of overly protective way. I don't know 
whether it was a noble gesture or just a good diversion from facing my own 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've got problems in your life, it's nice to have to worry about a 
natural disaster because then your own problems aren't so big anymore -- or 
maybe it solves your problems. Good, I don't have to worry about the problem 
I'm having with work -- I'm gonna be dead. Maybe that's a little bit overly 
escapist, but then again, I am in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a little bit earthquake prepared. So I got the flashlight and checked what 
was going on with the gas. Then I called my family -- my wife and I are 
separated -- to see how they had done and, luckily, that house, too, was 
spared. I talked to my daughter, who was scared and hasn't been able to contain 
that fear since. The most difficult part of this whole experience has been the 
aftershocks inside us. I think they are worse than the ones we're standing on. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning of the quake, for example, we went into a crowded delicatessen. A 
woman came over to order and I asked, "How you doin'?" She said: "Well, the 
truth is, what I really feel like doing right now is falling apart, but I'm not 
gonna do that." I felt everyone in there trying to pretend that it didn't 
happen, it wasn't going to happen again, and we could forget it and have our 
pastrami.  
</P>
<P>
 I sensed a combination of denial and shared fear, and also a kind of 
resiliancy which is a part of the American spirit, a sense of, "You can make it 
through disaster." There's also bizarre priorities, that the immediate 
gratification of certain needs and desires become paramount to a greater 
realization of where you are, what's going on in life in the bigger scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm now off there trying to finish my movie. If an aftershock could destroy 
the editing room, then there wouldn't be a movie to finish. And it's 
interesting because the movie is about nature, power, control and how we fit 
into the bigger scheme. Maybe the point of all this is to remind us that we are 
these frail beings who will die and if we can gain a greater awareness of what 
death is, then I think it may make our lives easier to live. 
</P>
<P>
 One response I had was thinking about a higher power; that's certainly an 
arrogant but functional way of dealing with an uncontrollable problem. I'm also 
trying to put some kind of perspective on the issue of dying and understanding 
that it is part of all of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, there's a character I regard as the harbinger. When the fires 
happened, I looked out this window that looks out on a little patch of green. 
In the background were the burning mountains of Malibu. On the grass I saw an 
old man wearing a white cap, with a golf club, putting away. I've never seen 
him before, but I saw him as the mountains were burning in the distance. 
Monday, before sunset, as the earthquakes were still rattling and rolling, 
there was that man again -- on the green, putting.

HEARTS OF L.A. / HOW THE QUAKE ROCKED OUR SPIRITS AND CHANGED OUR LIVES; MAKING

<P>
By Kakuyei Tada, Tada, 63, a priest at the San Fernando Valley Hongwangi, a 
Buddhist temple in Pacoima, has lived through several big earthquakes. He was 
born in Canada and grew up in Japan, where, as a teen-ager, he experienced his 
first big quake. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was a teen-ager when a 7.2 earthquake hit Japan in 1943. It happened in the 
early morning, before dawn. I was sleeping on the second floor of a Japanese 
house that was 10 years old. I remember they didn't report very much on the 
earthquake at that time because of the war. The Japanese government did not 
fully report on the earthquakes because information like that could be used 
against Japan by the Allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Old houses collapsed, but there was no fatality that I remember in my village. 
I don't know if any person got injured or not. We had very few paved roads; we 
depended on the horse and buggy and bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 I was afraid, but we accepted an earthquake of this kind as part of the 
Japanese culture. Life must go on. And don't forget it was the war, and we had 
to fight the war. It's a frightening thing. . . . When you experience Mother 
Nature like this, you feel completely out of control. But it is a culture where 
you accept death. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when I was a freshman in college, I remember the 1948 earthquake. I 
remember it happened in June, in the daytime, maybe around noon. I was in the 
college dormitory on the second floor and I was the only student, I think, in 
that building because other students had returned home for vacation. You have 
to remember this is after the war, and many Japanese were starving, so they 
shortened the academic year. School closed at the end of June, due to lack of 
food. It's unthinkable, but it happened. Suddenly the building started shaking, 
and I thought it would collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 For this (Jan. 17) earthquake, I was home. I was half-asleep, and I thought it 
was like a nightmare. But after a few seconds, I realized it was not a 
nightmare, but reality, so I had to get up. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1948 earthquake was the most frightening, more than this one. I was in the 
dormitory, which was an old wooden structure and there no fire escape or 
emergency exit.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't mind the earthquake. No matter where you go, you have Mother Nature of 
some kind. My fear is not of death, but of uncertainty.

HEARTS OF L.A. / HOW THE QUAKE ROCKED OUR SPIRITS AND CHANGED OUR LIVES; MAKING 
SENSE; 'ONCE YOU GET BEYOND STATUES OUR CHURCH IS PEOPLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Father Ken Deasy, Father Deasy, 39, is associate pastor at St. Monica's 
Catholic Church in Santa Monica. The church was seriously damaged during the 
quake. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just the Sunday before the quake, I was saying in my homily that this building 
could collapse -- the church could collapse -- but we ourselves would still be 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
 People come here -- and we're a very popular place -- not because of the 
building, but because of the general warmth. And then, ironically, the next 
time they're here, the church is closed and they're in the gymnasium. So I 
said, "Oops." 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, though, I think it's helped people realize that once you get beyond 
the statues and the stained glass and the pillars and the murals, our church is 
people. The building itself has been here for 66 years. We've been here for 107 
years. Hundreds of baptisms. Thousands of funerals, weddings, Masses, 
celebrations. People bring their joys and their pains. And it took us 45 
minutes to get into the building and take everything out -- the music books, 
whatever statues were still standing, microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 The doors are closed but not the doors of the congregation's heart. The 
poorest are being cared for; people who are dying are being cared for. The sick 
are being taken care of. The elderly are being taken care of. We've had two 
sessions here already where a psychologist came and talked to help with fears 
and anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the interesting things is how people are dealing with that whole sense 
of losing their stuff. Some feel like they've lost everything. Others focus 
more on family and friends and feel like they've lost nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 So you find out what their value system is. 
</P>
<P>
 There is always someone in our family that drives us crazy -- we love them, 
but they drive us crazy. There's one in my family. And whenever I call her and 
ask her how she's doing, I get a list of, "Well I got a job, I got a house, I 
got a new car, I went to Hawaii." I'm just terrified to call her now and ask 
her how she's doing because I don't want to hear that she lost all of these 
things. Because sometimes, by what we have we try to conclude how we're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people lost their homes. Some lost jobs. That's scary. I have kids that 
were in detention camps that are out now and trying to go to occupational 
schools; now they (the schools) are shut down. So now they're on the street. 
They're bored. They're probably going to get in trouble. One of my little guys 
called up and said, "We have no food, Father. I can't go get a job because I'm 
standing in line at the churches to get food." These are very serious things. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I'm hearing a lot of hope. I'm feeling that after that one initial 
sense of despair, people are trying to find some type of peace, look at the 
positive things and discover the joys of God. It's almost like a blind person 
who can hear better. Someone who is hurt can be more sensitive to others who 
are hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 People are learning that some things they have are not as important. Perhaps 
they've taken some things for granted and now say: "I'll never do that again. 
Thank God I'm alive. I'm sorry that someone else got hurt. How can I help 
them?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's what I'm finding going on. I'm finding people just really stopping and 
assessing their values, appreciating their loves and trying to reconcile those 
hates. Anger takes a lot of energy. So they find that reconciliation is much 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously a lot of good can come from this. The whole message of the good news 
of Christ is there's no greater love than to give one's life to one's friends. 
I think what it's done is it's taken maybe an intellectual faith and idea and 
made it more real to people and allowed us to find that we can be Christ to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 For people who feel they have lost everything, I tell them that God didn't 
cause this to happen. It's a thing of nature, but sometimes the Lord does leave 
a hint of an explanation. I think people who have suffered a loss also realize 
how much people can care for them, and hopefully they can start again. 
</P>
<P>
 If they're angry I don't say, "Don't be angry." If they're hurting, I don't 
say, "Don't hurt." I count on Christ. I say, "Give him your anger. Give him 
your hurt. Get it out." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't have any answers as to why the earthquake happened, why the roof fell 
in or something like that. But I just try to let them know they're not alone. 
Sometimes it's not saying anything; just listening and holding their hand and 
asking if you're OK and can I do something for you. Trying to make connections. 
</P>
<P>
 But I also try to tell them that as Christ fell, he got up, too. You can get 
up when it's time. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows what good is going to come from this; that's part of the mystery. I 
don't try to deal off false hopes, but it seems we'll get through it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a story about St. Francis of Assisi when he was a playboy-type guy 
and wild and crazy. In the process of his conversion, he was walking through 
the fields of Assisi and there was this little abandoned collapsed chapel. He 
goes in there and the cross spoke to him in a dream and said, "Rebuild my 
church." 
</P>
<P>
 Francis, being of the worldly view or lifestyle, thought the Lord meant to 
rebuild the physical church. And he did. But as time went on, he realized God 
meant much more than the building. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what we're doing here in Santa Monica. We're in this process of 
rebuilding and restoration, and not just of the church building. We are 
constantly trying to rebuild the world, to transform and rebuild others' lives: 
those who are in jail, widowed, orphaned, divorced or separated, the homeless. 
Young adults, those who are gay or straight, those who are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is a message for people who have suffered material losses in the 
quake. Don't just rebuild your home; rebuild your minds and your faith. 
</P>
<P>
 I think people underestimate their power to do good. Basically, we get focused 
so much on our own needs that we forget about others. 
</P>
<P>
 The paradox is when you give love, you are also ministered to. I am baffled at 
the many times I have gone to help someone and found myself being ministered to 
in return.

SENSE; 'I THINK GOD INTERVENED.'

By Bill Tunberg, Tunberg, 57, a Venice artist, designed the 16-foot cross of 
exotic woods that sits near the pulpit of the cavernous new sanctuary of the 
Bel Air Presbyterian Church, whose congregation includes former President 
Ronald Reagan. The 300-pound cross, barely anchored to the floor, did not 
topple, nor was it touched by the water, though everything around it was 
ruined. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cross is an inlaid cross made of cherry wood, padauk and zebra wood. It's 
16 feet high and eight feet across.The structure that holds it to the floor is 
the plinth, which is simply a plywood sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 The building has large fissures in the walls. The venting system has crashed 
to the floor, the ceiling fell down and the whole sprinkler system was so 
disturbed that it ruined the entire church. Not a bit of moisture touched the 
cross. 
</P>
<P>
 There are sprinklers above the cross. That sprinkler showered out a huge fan 
of water. The moisture would've completely buckled the cross and destroyed it 
much like it did the floor, which is buckled. The whole thing is absolutely 
destroyed. And it's incredibly tragic and sad for the congregation of this 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 So this is something that was a very important thing to them. And I think that 
there was something bigger than all of us that helped. I think God intervened 
in this situation simply to make a point about icons and things that symbolize 
God's presence. It's as simple as that. I think that he was doing something 
special for the people here.

<P>
 We are very much children in our society and encouraged to stay that way in 
some ways. And children depend on parents to take care of them. 
</P>
<P>
 In our relationship with the Earth, we are children thinking of the Earth as a 
parent that will take care of us. Often it does, because it certainly provides 
us with food. But at the same time, like any parent, it's got its own needs. 
And those needs sometimes are antithetical to the child's needs. It's difficult 
to accept the fact that your parents have things they may want to do that are 
not to your benefit at all, but to theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earth's shaking is to its benefit, but not necessarily to ours. So I think 
there's a feeling of suddenly being, if not rejected, certainly upset by our 
parent's behavior and we realize that we, in fact, are dependent children and 
our parent will not necessarily always be there to take care of us. 
</P>
<P>
 That's quite an arresting shock. CHILDREN'S VOICES

CITY ARTS; FROM LA. TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorful parasols will brighten a parade down Crenshaw Boulevard that kicks 
off the sixth annual Louisiana to Los Angeles Festival (LALA) at Leimert Park 
on Feb. 6. It is a coincidence that LALA is about the same time as traditional 
Mardi Gras festivities in New Orleans, said Sandra Rivkin, a representative of 
the City Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which drew more than 5,000 last year, will be held from 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. and offer a continuous lineup of music from blues to Zydeco. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mardi Gras parade will start at 9 a.m. at 60th Street and Crenshaw Boulevard 
and travel north on Crenshaw to Leimert Park. Festival highlights will include 
Creole and Cajun food, an arts-and-crafts sale and a gumbo cook-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivkin attributes the festival's popularity to the closeness of Louisiana 
transplants who call Los Angeles home. Organizers work hard to bring Cajun, 
Creole and black Angelenos together to celebrate their Southern heritage, she 
said. 
</P>

VOICES: LEARNING BY TEACHING; A BELMONT HIGH JUNIOR HAS DEVELOPED SOCIAL SKILLS 
BY HELPING OTHERS AT COMPUTER LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alexander Ishakputro, 16, was born on the island of Java in Indonesia. He 
immigrated to Los Angeles with his parents four years ago. A junior at Belmont 
High School, Ishakputro is a volunteer computer coach at the Echo Park branch 
of the Los Angeles Public Library. The small but busy branch has a room in the 
back where patrons can use computers and learn word processing. He was 
interviewed by Monica Gyulai.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Belmont High, students are sent every week to a computer lab to do word 
processing. Some of the students don't realize how important computer skills 
are, but working in the lab got me interested in computers. I wanted to learn 
more, so I borrowed books about software and programming from the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, I heard that the Echo Park library needed volunteers for its computer 
center, where people learn English by using computers. The lab has software 
that helps people learn vocabulary and sentence structure. I started 
volunteering two years ago and now I practically run the place, along with one 
other volunteer. The lab can be open only if one of us is here. We both work 
two afternoons a week and all day Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 We need a new computer with a huge hard disk and more software. Then we could 
network our computers. If we had a modem, this lab could become an information 
center. If we had programming software, this could be a place where programmers 
could talk about computers. But the library does not have the money. 
</P>
<P>
 By volunteering at the computer center, I can meet some of my own needs. I 
have lots of English classes, and those require lots of word processing. I get 
to use the lab, and so do lots of interesting people -- many who have never 
used computers before.  
</P>
<P>
 When I first started volunteering, I was very shy. Two years ago I would have 
been shaking during this newspaper interview, but now, after teaching at the 
lab, and especially after teaching older people, I have confidence. I am more 
socially involved with people. Troubled kids come to the lab and they tell me 
about their problems. Many of my peers live in broken homes, and they are 
confused. I talk to them, I listen to them. 
</P>
<P>
 I never used to talk to my teachers or ask them questions. All I did was sit 
in class, do homework and make straight A's. When my English teacher assigned 
something, I would do it two or three ways if I wasn't sure what he wanted. 
That's the way we were in the old country. Students in Java don't talk to their 
teachers. Teachers issue commands ; students do . Now, I can actually talk to 
my English teacher and find out what exactly he wants.  
</P>
<P>
 School was tougher in Indonesia, but it's better here because rules are less 
rigid. I became more loose. But I also became more motivated. In Indonesia, the 
assignments are not very hard. Here, we do research, but there I didn't even 
know where there was a library. 
</P>
<P>
 In Java, I didn't even know what a computer was. Now, I think I will study 
computers in college. 
</P>
<P>
 When my friends need emergency typing equipment, I tell them about the 
library's computer center. But I've never really talked to any of them about my 
volunteering. I am very proud of myself for keeping the center running, but not 
talking about my volunteering is a way of Asian modesty.

VOICES: BEATING SWORDS INTO SATELLITES; SPACE-BASED PROJECTS CAN PROVIDE 
MEANINGFUL, NON-MILITARY WORK FOR DEDICATED STUDENTS, AN ENGINEER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON WILLIAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly 20 years in the military end of the aerospace industry, Ron 
Williams is on a new mission: expanding the horizons of human communication. As 
an electrical engineer for Hughes Aircraft's Space Communications Co., Williams 
is working on commercial satellites to be used internationally. He was 
interviewed by Donna Mungen.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was raised in the East New York section of Brooklyn close to "Gunsmoke 
City," the area where heavyweight champion Mike Tyson grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 My West Indian parents raised me in a very strict manner. For them, education 
was everything, and that was a major factor in pushing me to reach the highest 
possible level of education.  
</P>
<P>
 My mother's determination to get her five boys a better way of life resulted 
in her enrolling us in Peter Stuyvesant High, one of the technical, 
science-and-math-oriented schools in New York City. Even today, something like 
97% of every graduating class continues to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Because science requires a lot of discipline and memory work, this academic 
setting provided the environment I needed to nurture my interest in the 
sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strange way, being a kind of "nerd," or one who can pull away from the 
crowd, is what it took for me to succeed in the sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My interest in engineering was motivated by two things: my natural love of the 
sciences and my interest in making money.  
</P>
<P>
 When I was small my parents worked in essentially blue-collar jobs and they 
didn't make much money. I guess you could say I just got tired of being poor 
and saw the sciences as a ticket out. 
</P>
<P>
 When I graduated from Howard University in 1975 with a bachelor of science 
degree in electrical engineering, it was a totally different job market. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in those days, the work found you. Hughes Aircraft came recruiting to 
Howard, and they made the best offer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's now 18 years later and I'm still with Hughes. In between, I've learned 
and done a lot and I feel like I've made a few contributions to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 In my early years at Hughes in Los Angeles, I was placed with a team that 
trained the users of the radar system on F-14s. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, I was transferred into field engineering, which resulted in me 
relocating back East to our off-site location in Calverton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 During this period I was part of the support team for the assembly flight line 
for the F-14. I became an expert on airborne radar and weapons control systems, 
and it was an exciting time.  
</P>
<P>
 After eight years, I got an offer from Northrop and I remained with them for 
three years, designing and building test equipment for the B-2 Stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a challenging experience because I was doing the opposite of what I had 
done at Hughes, and this forced me to change my whole thinking pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 But Northrop was one of the first companies in Southern California to suffer 
the overall cutbacks in the military industrial complex. 
</P>
<P>
 My group was suddenly down-scaled from 6,000 to 900. Eventually, I was laid 
off, but this gave me an opportunity to move into an area that I had always 
wanted, which was the space component of the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 I got a job in the space division of Hughes in El Segundo, working on the 
Intelsat-VI, the most complex commercial communication satellite launched to 
date.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I really like the work I'm doing, and unlike what I had done in my earlier 
years in aerospace, I'm not supporting the military industrial complex. Rather, 
I'm involved in bringing the world together in a little different way. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of making bombs, I'm building communication tools that help the entire 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 The Intelsat-VI joins 129 countries in a consortium. It allows countries that 
can't afford a $160-million satellite to still communicate with the rest of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after managing a satellite program for Indonesia, I am figuring out how 
to apply Japanese auto manufacturing concepts to building spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, the aerospace industry has really been under attack 
with all the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 For the near future, it may not be as lucrative as it once was, but 
regardless, the sciences, and engineering in particular, will always be a good 
career choice. Majoring in the sciences or math will be an important component 
for any new developments in this country.  
</P>
<P>
 For the immediate future, students may want to diversify themselves, 
especially since the big military complex isn't employing as many people as it 
once did. But there will be many new opportunities, and young people need only 
rethink how they want to use their scientific background. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Computers will be a big area, and there will also be some interesting 
developments in the biomedical engineering field. 
</P>
<P>
 And I don't want to forget all the changes that will come as it relates to the 
Information Superhighway that Vice President Gore has discussed. In the future, 
the direct broadcasting of programs will be drastically different from the way 
they are today.  
</P>
<P>
 I see space and engineering as a powerful career combination, because just 
like the sea, space is one of our last unconquered frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think your kid has an aptitude for the sciences, I'd encourage you to 
expose him or her to computers and math, and instill discipline and good study 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 This will serve as a great foundation for any challenges they may encounter in 
the sciences.

GAME OF THE WEEK; LOYOLA TAKES ITS GAME TO NEW LEVEL -- ABOVE THE RIM; 
BASKETBALL: CUBS SCORE AN EASY 84-48 WIN OVER BISHOP MONTGOMERY THAT INCLUDES 
NINE RIM-RATTLING SLAMS. CANADY HAS GAME-HIGH 19 POINTS.

<P>
 It's one thing to get beaten badly. It's another to get mercilessly dunked on 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 And Loyola showed no mercy Thursday night, scoring an easy 84-48 win over 
Bishop Montgomery that included nine dunks in a Mission League game at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone from UCLA-bound Toby Bailey to reserve Patrick Klein, the son of 
former football star Bob Klein, got in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had quite a few dunks tonight," said Cubs forward Edwin Canady, who had 
four dunks among his game-high 19 points. "I know we had another game where we 
had a lot of dunks, but I can't remember when." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe when the rim stops rattling, Canady will remember. Bishop Montgomery 
certainly can't forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Canady's first dunk gave the Cubs a 9-6 lead in the first quarter. His second 
-- a two-handed, hang-on-the-rim slam -- gave the Cubs a seven-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I made that first dunk, I took it stronger to the basket," Canady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who scored half of his 16 points on four dunks, got his first when his 
brother Moose threw a pass that bounced off Canady's chest. Toby Bailey 
clutched the ball and made a garden variety one-handed slam. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was just in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 As the score grew more one-sided, the Cubs became more creative with their 
above-the-rim antics. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in the third quarter, Bailey had a reverse dunk and Canady followed 
10 seconds later with a two-handed version. 
</P>
<P>
 Cubs point guard Corey Woods missed a short jumper, but Bailey made a 
two-handed jam off the rebound to make it 58-32. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter, Cubs swingman Moose Bailey forced a turnover and led 
his brother with a pass on a breakaway. Toby Bailey caught the ball and 
dribbled three times before making a 360-degree dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one of each -- a 360, a tip-dunk, a reverse and a regular one," said 
Toby Bailey. "I liked the 360 best. I could see out of the corner of my eye the 
Loyola cheering section and I wanted to do something special for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The show-stopper came with five seconds left when Klein broke loose and 
slammed his way into the box score. It wasn't pretty, but it was Klein's only 
points of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took us out of everything we wanted to do offensively and defensively," 
said Knights Coach Douglas Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery was expecting a fired-up opponent after beating Loyola twice 
last season en route to a Mission League title. The Cubs entered the game in 
first place with a two-game advantage over the third-place Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 Moose Bailey, who set up several dunks with his passes, was especially looking 
forward to this game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came here talking and pushing," said Moose Bailey, who had 15 points. 
"They're were holding on to memories from last year. We had to beat them up." 
</P>
<P>
 It was enough to make Knight guard Kareem Mutrie sick, or in his case, sicker. 
Mutrie, who has signed with University of San Diego, managed 14 points despite 
suffering a stomachache. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Loyola Coach Bill Thomason: "That was a good-looking game. It was the 
epitome of the way we want to play. We scrambled after the ball. We pressed. We 
ran up and down the court and still played good half-court defense." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Cubs slammed a hole in the Knights' chances of repeating as champions. 
</P>

 Visiting East Los Angeles College built a 19-point second-half lead and then 
held on for a 66-64 upset victory over Los Angeles City College in a Southern 
California Athletic Conference game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs, the state's ninth-ranked team, missed three three-point baskets in 
the final eight seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies led 41-27 at the half and stretched their lead to 50-31 with 15:17 
remaining, allowing only one field goal in the first 14 minutes of the second 
half. However, East L.A. committed 22 fouls in the game, sending the Cubs to 
the free throw line 19 times alone in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 LACC, which made 19 of 33 free throws, used a 12-point run to climb within 
62-61 with 2:01 to play. East L.A.'s Alex Espinoza sank a pair of free throws 
and Jerrod Parrott made another to put the Huskies out front, 65-61, with 47 
seconds remaining before Raheem Muhammad's three-pointer cut it to 65-64 at 
0:29. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Barajas was fouled on the Huskies' next possession with 14 seconds left. 
He made the front end of a one-and-one for a 66-64 lead but missed the second 
free throw. The Cubs drove down court but three three-point attempts bounced 
off the rim before time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Washington scored 17 points, 14 in the first half, to lead five East 
L.A. players in double figures. Barajas, Espinoza and David Ng had 12 each and 
Parrott added 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy Thomas scored 14 and Derrick Higgins and Sai Tuialli had 11 each to lead 
LACC. 
</P>

 Trade Tech 78, East L.A. 69--James Wade had 14 points and 11 rebounds as the 
Beavers overcame a 14-point first-half deficit in the Southern California 
Athletic Conference game Friday at East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade Tech took its first lead, 64-62, on a basket by Greg McDowell with 5:39 
left and then made 13 of 18 free throws in the final 3:16 to seal the win. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Washington scored 23 and Danny Barajas had 13, including four 
three-point baskets, for East L.A. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cal State Los Angeles 71, Cal State Dominguez Hills 64--Forward Maritza Cruz 
said defense and rebounding were the keys to the victory Thursday, but her 
game-high 24 points also contributed to helping Cal State Los Angeles upset Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the evening, CSLA would build a lead only to have CSDH whittle it 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 With 6:28 to go, the Golden Eagles' lead ballooned as Cruz capped off seven 
consecutive points to put her team ahead 64-53. 
</P>

 Verbum Dei 96, Mary Star 57--Andre Miller scored 24 points and Jamal Cobbs 
added 23 as Verbum Dei won its fourth consecutive Santa Fe League game Friday 
night at Mary Star. "We're playing really well," Verbum Dei Coach Mike Kearney 
said. "We've got guys who can handle the break and score. Now our big guys are 
stepping forward and contributing."  
</P>
<P>

break a 43-43 tie and the Lancers held on to clinch a share of their third 
consecutive title in an Almont League game at Alhambra Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Santana scored nine of his game-high 17 points in the fourth quarter to 
propel Bell Gardens to its sixth victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers, who trailed by 14 in the first quarter, overcame a 40-37 deficit 
with five minutes to play to take a 43-42 lead on a free throw by Santana with 
3:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Bell Gardens 17-5, 6-0; Alhambra 11-19, 2-4.

 Bell Gardens 75, Schurr 63--The Lancers completed the first half of Almont 
League play undefeated, rebounding from a 13-point first-half deficit Tuesday 
at Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens trailed 24-11 with six minutes left in the second quarter, but 
rallied to tie at 30. The Lancers scored the first four points of the second 
half to take the lead for good.

 Espy Landeros, who had 10 rebounds, sealed the victory on a layup for a 45-42 
lead with 1:14 remaining and Monica Malagon added a free throw with 25 seconds 
left for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Malagon scored 23 points and Christina Lopez dished out five assists for Bell 
Gardens.

 California's wine scandal ensnared numerous growers and vintners who were 
named in 17 civil lawsuits filed by the attorney general, all of which were 
settled out of court with the payment of fines. In addition, federal criminal 
charges were filed against seven men and three wineries. All pleaded guilty or 
were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records and interviews, the other criminal cases -- besides 
Bronco -- involved: 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Licciardi, partner in Stockton wine brokerages Corvette Co. and 
Costa & Licciardi, who was convicted of conspiracy after a 1991 federal jury 
trial. He was sentenced to 51 months in prison but remains free on appeal.  
</P>
<P>
 Licciardi bought grapes and sold most of them to Delicato Vineyards in 
Manteca, where he had his own office. He was accused of misrepresenting 4,900 
tons of grapes valued at $3.1 million. The grapes made over 900,000 gallons of 
wine with a retail value of $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Licciardi bought many of the grapes from growers Nick and Frank Bavaro -- who 
separately pleaded guilty -- and contended he didn't know what was going on. 
But prosecutors portrayed him as the mastermind.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also believed Licciardi had hidden his activities from his 
semi-invalid father, Jack, who ran the brokerages. About four months before 
Michael Licciardi's trial, his father was shot to death in his Stockton home. 
The case has not been solved, but Stockton police say the homicide was 
apparently unrelated to the wine fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
 * Delicato Vineyards, which paid a $1-million fine in 1992, and its president, 
Anthony Indelicato, who was barred from the business for five years. 
Investigators said the Delicato winery unwittingly bought the misrepresented 
grapes from Licciardi, but after being notified of this by federal agents, 
vineyard officials altered and destroyed records to try to erase the deception 
and sell the wine at the higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nick, 37, and Frank Bavaro, 32, owners of Bavaro Brothers in Escalon, who 
served 21 and 15 months, respectively, after pleading guilty to conspiracy and 
mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 They were accused of misrepresenting 6,500 tons of grapes valued at $4 
million, selling them not only through Licciardi's Delicato connection but 
directly to Sebastiani Vineyards, Chas. Krug Winery, Lost Hills Winery, Robert 
Mondavi Winery, Bear Creek Winery and Master Cellars Winery. 
</P>
<P>
 * Angelo Papagni and his son, Demetrio, owners of then-bankrupt D. Papagni 
Fruit Co. in Madera, who pleaded guilty to misrepresenting the content of about 
500,000 gallons, most of it sold under the Papagni label. Demetrio spent six 
months in a halfway house and Angelo is serving an 18-month term. DONALD WOUTAT

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ELYSIAN PARK; AIDS HOSPICE MARKS 5-YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A couple hundred community leaders and health care workers gathered recently 
to celebrate a dubious distinction: the fifth anniversary of the Chris Brownlie 
AIDS Hospice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hospice has been successful, I'm sorry to say. Working with the HIV-AIDS 
issue, it's almost with a tone of regret that we say that," said Keith Malone, 
spokesman for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which runs the Elysian Park 
hospice.  
</P>
<P>
 But from its beginnings as the county's first licensed residential hospice, 
the facility at 1300 Scott Ave. has focused on celebrating life rather than 
grieving over death. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled in a peaceful, shaded hillside near Barlow Respiratory Hospital, the 
25-bed facility opened in December, 1988, to provide a pleasant last home for 
people dying of AIDS. The hospice provides 24-hour care as well as counseling 
for patients and survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is funded by state and federal 
AIDS funds as well as private donations, accepts private and public insurance 
for the hospice care, which often costs several hundred dollars a day. No 
patient is turned away for lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation also operates the Carl Bean AIDS Care Center in the West Adams 
district and clinics in Downtown, Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Brownlie residents have a life expectancy of six months or less. They are 
allowed to furnish and decorate their individual rooms as they wish. The 
facility also has a cozy common area with hardwood floors, comfortable couches, 
a piano and a television. The garden areas overlook the natural beauty of the 
canyons and provide a view of the Downtown skyline as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We celebrate everything here, whether a person is so ill he can only sit up," 
said Mary Nalick, interim director. "It's about appreciating the little things 
and celebrating each day." 
</P>
<P>
 Every two weeks, the staff and residents hold a memorial in honor of the 
residents who have died in recent days, releasing a balloon for each death. At 
the recent anniversary celebration, each attendee was handed a balloon to 
release in memory of the 787 people that have passed through the hospice in its 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as we must let go of these balloons so they can soar . . . so we at 
Chris Brownlie have had to let go of our friends," the Rev. Matthew Sprouffske, 
the hospice chaplain, told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 During the emotional ceremony, speakers also praised the loving care provided 
by the 50 staff members, from the groundskeepers who tend the gardens to the 
nurses who "turn the residents, bathe them, change their diapers, sit with 
them," according to foundation President Michael Weinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurse Lindsay Ralphs explained how the staff keeps its positive attitude and 
energy: "Every resident we've worked with has had heart, and we get their heart 
and their courage." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Robert Uhrich credits the hospice with saving his life. When the 
50-year-old travel agent came to the hospice seven months ago, his motor skills 
had deteriorated and doctors gave him three days to live. Since then, his 
T-cell blood count has increased and his improved health has baffled doctors. 
"Something has gone right here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uhrich has become the outspoken resident nagger. It was he who pointed out the 
lack of rubber skids in the bathtubs to keep weak residents from slipping. And 
he enjoys serving as a vocal spokesman for the residents because "I've never 
been a comforting type of person." 
</P>
<P>
 He's also considering writing a book for families and friends of AIDS patients 
on the do's and dont's of dealing with their sick loved ones. Uhrich said he 
has been lucky to have a supportive family but he has seen too many make the 
wrong decisions: "One mother actually shaved her (ill) son's beard . . . and 
stole his identity. He died a week later." IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; TRIAL ORDERED IN PANDERING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Little Tokyo business owner was ordered last week to stand trial on charges 
of running a prostitution ring that catered to Japanese-speaking businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief preliminary hearing Tuesday, Municipal Court Judge Richard G. 
Berry scheduled Yoshifumi Koike to be arraigned Feb. 8 in Superior Court on two 
counts of pandering and one count of pimping -- all felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Koike, 34, a Japanese citizen who lives in Monterey Park and holds a resident 
visa, was arrested in October after a two-month investigation triggered by an 
anonymous tip. He is free on $25,000 bail and faces a maximum sentence of seven 
years in prison and possible deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Ron Seabolt sought unsuccessfully at the preliminary hearing 
to have the charges dismissed, contending that there is insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives say that while running a legitimate graphic design firm on Boyd 
Street, Koike also allegedly ran an escort service on the side that he 
advertised only in local Japanese-language newspapers. Detectives said Koike 
hired 20 young Japanese-speaking women, most of whom live in the area on 
student visas. The women met their clients in local hotel rooms and charged 
$200 per hour, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koike collected $75 per hour from each of his employees and made more than 
$100,000 from his escort service over the past nine months, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police attributed the success of their investigation to two undercover reserve 
officers who are fluent in Japanese and familiar with Japanese customs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve Officer Ron Hasegawa, who posed as a visiting businessman, testified 
that he called the advertised telephone number twice in August and asked each 
time, in Japanese, that a female companion be sent to his room. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasegawa testified that in the first instance, the woman took a shower soon 
after arriving and then asked him to take a shower. After a brief conversation 
and discussion of the $200 fee, the woman said, "Let's do it," in Japanese, 
Hasegawa testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve Officer Randi Tahara testified that she posed as a woman interested in 
working for the escort service in September.  
</P>
<P>
 Later that month, she said she called Koike and he sent her to meet a customer 
at a hotel. The customer was actually another undercover detective, Tahara 
said. She testified that she called Koike later and told him, "It wasn't as 
difficult as I thought. It was just straight sex,' " to which he responded, 
"Congratulations. Well done." 
</P>
<P>
 But under cross-examination, Tahara said Koike never insisted that she have 
sex with clients. "He said I didn't have to do anything I didn't want to do," 
Tahara said. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK; VOLUNTEERS RALLY TO AID QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>

<P>
 Galvanized by the Jan. 17 quake, volunteers and community groups set up an 
emergency shelter at the Echo Park Recreation Center last weekend for about 250 
residents who had been living in local parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The displaced residents came from apartment buildings on Echo Park Avenue, 
Park Drive and Sunset Boulevard.Only one or two of the buildings have been 
condemned but many left their homes out of fear of structural damage, said Jose 
Gardea, an aide to Councilman Mike Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for building inspectors, residents set up camp in Elysian Park 
and around Echo Park Lake, Gardea said. "We were concerned for their safety, 
especially with the rains coming. And we were concerned for the kids' health," 
Gardea said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Hernandez's staff called together community groups Jan. 21 to help open a 
shelter the next morning in the recreation center. In addition to the 
councilman's staff and city Recreation and Parks workers, members of Central 
City Action Committee, Echo Park Improvement Assn., El Centro del Pueblo, Grupo 
Latino Echo Park, the Echo Park Chamber of Commerce and Jovenes Inc., 
volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
 Local businesses such as Barragan's restaurant, Burger King, Celaya Bakery, 
Phoenix Express takeout and Domino's Pizza donated food, while Pioneer Market 
donated diapers, paper goods and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these folks who'd been in the parks got their first hot meal in 
several days," Gardea said. 
</P>
<P>
 By last Sunday morning, the apartment buildings had been inspected and most 
were deemed free of serious damage, allowing many residents to return. The Echo 
Park shelter was closed at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no hesitation -- these people were there for the community," said 
Bonnie Scanlon, a community activist. "It was great to see so many people 
working together." IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EL SERENO; CUSTOM EDUCATION FOR PREGNANT STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the walls of their classrooms hang three-dimensional illustrations of the 
birth canal, and their reading material includes children's books that they 
might want to read to their babies after giving birth.  
</P>
<P>
 The girls at Thomas Riley High School East, a cluster of bungalows on the 
Wilson High School campus offering special physical education and childbirth 
classes, have chosen to attend the school after wrangling with the difficult 
situation of finding themselves pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said they heard about the school from friends and school counselors. 
Others said teachers at their former high schools scared or harassed them into 
enrolling at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me: 'If you fall, we won't want to take responsibility,' " said 
Yvette Melendez, 18, whose baby was overdue Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Armida, 16, whose baby is due today, said she was denied an elevator key at 
Wilson High School, where students have to climb five flights of stairs to get 
to some classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another, Marisa Gonzalez, 18, said a teacher wanted to send her to 
detention for having to go to the bathroom too often. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't go (to detention) because it wasn't right, so she just kept giving 
me more detentions," said Gonzalez, whose daughter, Michelle, was born Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 That type of harassment, they said, along with the sneers and rude comments, 
make their situation even more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Riley, they find comfort among the other girls going through the same 
hardships -- boyfriends who no longer come around, distraught parents and 
friends who don't quite understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you get pregnant, everything changes," Gonzalez said. "Your whole life 
changes. You get depressed a lot, thinking you're not going to finish school. 
Here, everybody just talks." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley consists of three campuses -- East, Gardena and Nellie Blanding in 
Watts. The Los Angeles Unified School District offers students the choice of 
enrolling in one of the Riley sites, or the Harold McAlister High School, which 
has four campuses, or continuing in their regular school.  
</P>
<P>
 The Teen Mother Program offers counseling, bus transportation, classes in 
child development and preparing for the birth, and graduation credit.  
</P>
<P>
 The students usually return to their original schools after delivering their 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
 The East campus was at Booth Memorial Home, 2670 Griffin Ave., for 25 years 
but moved in September to its present location because Booth serves girls on 
probation, Principal Mary Ann Shiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move has hurt enrollment: There are 45 students but the school has room 
for 30 more. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the program learn about their bodies and developing child in ways 
that are not offered at high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom told me I know more about this than she does," said Elizabeth, 15, 
whose baby is due Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra James, who has taught pregnant students for 18 years, said many of them 
do better at Riley because of the close supervision and smaller classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some find it more difficult to continue school after they have their babies 
because they can't find good infant care. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's one thing to be said, it's that pregnancy is not the main reason 
for dropping out, child care is," James said. "It's sadly lacking." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the girls, some of whom have jobs after they finish morning classes, 
leave their babies with family or a next-door neighbor.  
</P>
<P>
 "My interest is in seeing these kids stay in school," Shiner said. "We try to 
get them as much information before the baby comes because we tell them: 'Once 
you have the baby, life is going to be much more difficult.' "

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; PROJECT TO YIELD JOBS AT ESTRADA COURTS 
</P>

<P>
 If he were building a housing project today, Estrada Courts manager Phillip 
Chavez says the first thing to go up would be a community center and gymnasium, 
with a stage for community performances and classrooms to house programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Estrada Courts was built 50 years ago, that apparently was not on 
officials' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't consider it important," said Chavez, former manager at Imperial 
Courts in South-Central and Aliso Village in Boyle Heights. "They didn't care." 
</P>
<P>
 After four years of planning and securing funding, Chavez and residents are 
gearing up for the construction of a $1.9-million community center in the 
middle of the 143-unit complex at 3232 Estrada St. 
</P>
<P>
 The Housing Authority of Los Angeles petitioned the city Jan. 20 to grant a 
conditional-use permit for the construction and operation of a child-care 
center and a variance for the construction of a gymnasium. The petition asks 
that the city allow the project to proceed with only six parking spaces instead 
of the required 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning Administrator John Parker has not yet ruled on those requests. With 
Parker's approval, the Estrada Courts Resident Management Corp., a nonprofit 
organization formed to secure construction and maintenance jobs for the 
development's residents, will begin getting bids and training residents for at 
least half of the estimated 100 jobs that will be created in the first year of 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the 13,612-square-foot center include an 8,000-square-foot gym and 
adjoining rooms for job training, child care, senior citizen functions and a 
stage. It was designed by Martinez Architects of Playa del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 When the construction is completed, residents hope to hire a job developer and 
have employment clinics, sports and youth programs, and more resources for 
seniors. They envision themselves working as tutors, recreation leaders, 
child-care workers, the center director and lab technicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The programs will be open to our imagination and efforts," Chavez said.  
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Paez, director of the Estrada Courts Resident Management Corp., said 
the center's construction is but one project on a list of residents' proposals. 
 
</P>
<P>
 This month, residents unveiled a unique construction project that trained and 
hired 10 residents to replace the housing project's water and sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the funding, $1.3 million, has come from the federal 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. An additional $200,000 was 
recently approved by the city Community Development Department.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're crowded for space and we have a lot of people who want to come in and 
develop programs for the residents. That's why the community center is a 
necessary adjunct to the housing development," Chavez said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
 Salvador Quezada has had problems with the police and city officials before. 
The owner of Don Quixote's East, a former theater turned restaurant and 
nightclub, has had three of his establishments closed by the city in the last 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing possibly another closure, the 58-year-old Quezada wants to pack up and 
move out of town. He has owned Don Quixote's East, 2811 E. Olympic Blvd., for 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the business," he said. "People like to go dancing, where the boy 
meets the girl and the girl meets the boy . . . All the places I have I pack 
them in wall to wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) with all the problems I have, I want to build this one again and sell 
it and go to Las Vegas and buy over there." 
</P>
<P>
 He may not have a choice but to sell his place, if neighbors have their way. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 of them attended a zoning hearing last month to complain about 
shootings and other crimes, a lack of parking, lax security and excessive noise 
at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada disagreed and asked the city for a conditional-use permit to allow him 
to open the business for public dancing instead of the private parties to which 
he is restricted now. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Zoning Administrator William E. Lillenberg denied Quezada's request 
and gave him six months to improve his standing with his neighbors. He ordered 
Quezada to find 300 parking spaces, close by 11 p.m., hire security officers, 
comply with fire safety and occupancy standards, hire a parking valet and not 
allow underage drinking. After a trial period that ends June 2, the city will 
decide whether to allow Quezada to continue his business. A date for the review 
has not been set.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: JEFFERSON PARK; MEETING TO FOCUS ON CRENSHAW RAIL

 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is sponsoring a community meeting to 
discuss plans for the proposed Crenshaw rail line at 6 p.m. Tuesday at West 
Angeles Church of God in Christ, 3045 W. Crenshaw Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary studies have been completed on two possible rail lines, both 
beginning at Pico Boulevard and running south through the Crenshaw corridor to 
Los Angeles International Airport and Hawthorne Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is a 15-month environmental impact study. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Royal, the Crenshaw project manager, said it is crucial to amass 
community input since the MTA approved further development of the rail line 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already taken into account a real concern about (elevated) structures 
running along narrow streets like Vernon Avenue, so we've redesigned some 
portions as tunnels," Royal said. "We need to get feedback on station 
locations, what types of businesses and services should be developed around the 
stations, what things should be explored in the environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these things are critical if we're going to get funding. A lot of rail 
lines in other areas are competing with us."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; BLACK ART EXHIBIT IS NATION'S LARGEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 12th annual Artists' Salute to Black History Month, the largest exhibit of 
black art in the country, will open Wednesday at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 exhibitors from 22 states will display paintings, ceramics, 
sculpture, quilts, lithographs, serigraphs, drawings, wearable art and 
mixed-media works on the plaza's two levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Several opportunities to chat with artists are planned. Among those exhibiting 
are: Synthia St. James, William Tolliver, Bernard Stanley Hoyes, Sylvia Walker, 
Albert Mukasa Williams and Varnette Honeywood. A "Legends" exhibit will feature 
works by Benny Andrews, Claude Clark, Samella Lewis and Charles White. Painter 
Jacob Lawrence will conduct a symposium at 7 p.m. Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The theme of this year's salute is "Our Children . . . Our Hope." Exhibit 
coordinator Barbara Wesson has planned several events aimed at children, 
including storytelling sessions, crafts workshops, mask-making workshops, mime 
performances, juggling and a parade Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to honor more than just specially gifted children, but those who are 
really trying and improving," Wesson said of the parade and ceremony. "We're 
recognizing 200 'most improved' kids from neighborhood schools to give more 
young people a nod of appreciation that they're working to pull themselves up." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will run from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, 10 a.m. 
to 7 p.m. Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Feb. 6.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: LADERA HEIGHTS; PROPOSED LIMITS ON LABORERS 
PROTESTED 
</P>

 In yet another chapter in the conflict between day laborers and residents, a 
group of civil rights advocates gathered last week at a Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors meeting to protest a proposal that would prohibit day 
laborers from soliciting work on public streets and in private parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen day laborers, members of the American Civil Liberties Union, 
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other groups staged the 
demonstration Tuesday, saying that the proposed ordinance is racist and 
unconstitutional. After the demonstration, the board postponed a vote on the 
ordinance for 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "These workers are engaged in speech protected by the 1st Amendment," said 
Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU. "They have a right to solicit 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have complained for years about day laborers loitering near the 
HomeBase home improvement store at Slauson and Fairfax avenues. Last year, 
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, the board's chairwoman and newest member 
whose area includes Ladera Heights, took action. She wrote a measure that would 
ban day laborers from soliciting work in public places and privately owned 
parking lots. Violation of the measure could result in $1,000 in fines and 
imprisonment for workers and their employers.  
</P>
<P>
 It was immediately assailed by civil rights advocates, who charged that the 
area's mostly affluent homeowners were trying to drive the mostly poor Latinos 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "All labor is dignity," said Joe Hicks, executive director of the SCLC. "Why 
are we trying to criminalize the activities of people who are simply offering 
themselves for a full day's work?" 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time the supervisors have postponed voting on the measure 
to allow for mediation. Talks that started two months ago stagnated and need 
more time to progress, said Vicki Pipkin, a Burke spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 Pipkin said some supervisors suggested after the demonstration that a national 
mediating group be brought in. "Some homeowners felt that the day laborers 
weren't really speaking for themselves," she said. "We're going to try get a 
fresh start." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; TALK SHOW BRIDGES BLACK CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It began, said Elizabeth Yiaba, with the desire to bridge the gap she saw 
between black people on both sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Africans and African Americans, for all of their rich common history, knew 
precious little about their very different cultures. The misperceptions and 
ignorance, Yiaba said, were ensuring that the twain had little chance of ever 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 So Yiaba, a 30-year-old Sierra Leone native, launched a cable-TV talk show on 
Christmas Day, 1992, called "The Chesima Series."  
</P>
<P>
 "The word chesima means 'Tell the people the truth' or 'Transmit the facts' in 
my language, Kono," Yiaba said at her Crenshaw Boulevard boutique opposite the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. "And the fact is: We -- Africans and African 
Americans -- have a lot more in common than we think. I created 'The Chesima 
Series' to show people that." 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong show is broadcast at 8:30 p.m. Fridays on South Central Community 
Television, Continental Cablevision's community programming channel. On a 
vibrant set decorated with African fabrics and furniture, Yiaba and three or 
four guests discuss topics from both the African and African American 
perspectives: relationships, business, the black male crisis in America, 
health, beauty and coping with stress, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in traditional West African garb, Yiaba moderates the discussion among 
guests who seem very different on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent show on stress management brought together Georgianna Williams, the 
mother of Damian Williams, a defendant in the Reginald Denny trial, and Kwame 
Boateng, a Ghanaian native who, last year, became the first African to run for 
Los Angeles mayor. Another session on polygamy -- part of some African 
traditions -- versus monogamy generated plenty of sparks when a Muslim, a 
Nigerian polygamist and two staunch American Christians argued their points. 
</P>
<P>
 Yiaba said that such open dialogue -- any open dialogue -- dispels myths and 
therefore is healthy: "I'm constantly learning things myself. We all have to 
learn to look beyond the tribalism that keeps us all apart. We, as black 
people, should be glued together. . . . If we don't support each other, learn 
about each other culturally, we're lost." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chesima Series" is not Yiaba's first attempt to bring blacks together. 
Two years ago, after being struck by the sight of a distraught, young 
AIDS-afflicted woman wandering in a Sierra Leone airport, she founded Bessama, 
a nonprofit group dedicated to helping and educating Africans and African 
Americans with HIV. Made up of African and American politicians, health 
professionals, educators and others, Bessama has staged one Hollywood 
fund-raiser and is planning another. 
</P>
<P>
 Both "Chesima" and Bessama are largely one-person operations, and Yiaba 
frequently finds herself doing legal word processing work when she puts most of 
the profit from her African boutique into Bessama. Yiaba has amassed enough 
advertisers to break even on the cable show, which costs about $4,000 to 
produce weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Yiaba, who is a wife and mother of a 3-year-old girl, said the workload can be 
overwhelming at times. "Yes, it's hard work, but I believe that if you see a 
problem, you must address it. Be a solution." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; THREAT OF FINE CALLED A MISTAKE

 A letter warning vendors of the Alameda Swap Meet that they would be fined if 
they failed to remain open the day of the Northridge earthquake has been called 
an error by the management company after a meeting with the head of the Korean 
Vendors Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 The management company called the Jan. 17 letter an unfortunate "mistake," 
said Charles Yang, general manager of the swap meet at 4501 S. Alameda St. "The 
fee has been waived. They (vendors) came to my office this morning (Jan. 21) 
and everything has been straightened out." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Yo, the head of the vendors association, agreed with Yang's assessment. 
The letter, Yo said, created some disharmony between vendors and the management 
company, but the company has apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no longer a problem here," Yo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem began after some of the 100-or-so vendors closed early or didn't 
open for business the day of the quake. When they returned to their stalls two 
days later at the undamaged buildings, they discovered they were in violation 
of their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect this, would you?" said one vendor, who didn't want to be 
identified, after receiving a tersely worded letter warning of a $25 fine for 
failing to remain open from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was closing. Everybody was scared of the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is strictly unfair, because the media told us to stay home," said 
another who didn't want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know how many people were hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Some were unable to open the day of the quake because of family problems the 
6.6 temblor created. "My children were with my mother and I had to go get 
them," said one vendor. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors said their concern wasn't rooted in the amount of the fine, but in the 
lack of cooperation displayed by the management company. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said they haven't received a formal notice telling them not to pay it.

 Fernando Pullum doesn't make promises he can't keep. 
</P>
<P>
 So when students in his Washington High School marching band learned last fall 
that they had been invited to play in the New Orleans' Mardi Gras parade next 
month, Pullum was reluctant to tell them start packing. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week Pullum and his students began packing boxes after raising nearly 
$50,000 through bake sales, concerts and donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going great here," said Pullum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids' spirits are very high. We're packing and measuring the cases for 
their instruments and weighing them for the airline. And that makes (students) 
see the trip as a reality now." 
</P>
<P>
 Fund-raising took off over the last two weeks as the 130-member band and drill 
team garnered nearly $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of it came from donations, including $15,000 in matching funds from the 
Weingart Foundation, $7,000 from area churches and $500 from the city's general 
purpose fund, Pullum said. 
</P>
<P>
 The band still remains about $10,000 short of its $60,000 goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the churches is across the street and they hear us play all the time," 
said Pullum, after he approached the church for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rogers, a pastor of Faithful Central Missionary Church at 6200 S. 
Hoover St., said his church pledged $6,000 for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're great. The competition is in trouble when they play," Rogers said. 
The church rents the school's auditorium and has sponsored scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of looking at a larger issue of commitment to this community. And 
we know there are budget restrictions on the school board, so we've chosen to 
help be part of the solution," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Marguerite LaMotte acknowledged that during a time of shortages, the 
money raised for the trip could have been used for schoolbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, you think about it and you say, '$60,000 is a lot of books,' " said 
LaMotte. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is a different type of 'books' that will leave an indelible 
impression on the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 And the band's fund-raisers have attracted some big names in music. Linda 
Hopkins and Billy Childs were among the jazz notables who joined the band 
during a fund-raiser this month that pulled in nearly $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called and begged the artists," said Pullum, a musician who has played with 
Childs. "We may even do 'The Arsenio Hall Show' before we go." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; 2 PLEAD NO CONTEST TO MEDI-CAL CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Owners of a defunct South Gate-based wheelchair company have pleaded no 
contest to charges of grand theft and fraud for failing to deliver wheelchairs 
to disabled Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Delatorre, 50, of Menifee and her brother, James Freelove, 48, of 
Norwalk entered the pleas Jan. 20 and agreed to pay $90,976 in restitution to 
the state.They are scheduled to appear Feb. 17 in Norwalk Superior Court for 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Health Services began investigating the company, 
called The Chair Concern, in July after customers complained that they had 
filed Medi-Cal prescriptions for wheelchairs and parts that were never 
delivered. Delatorre and Freelove were found to have billed Medi-Cal and 
received payment for 42 of the wheelchairs, said Paul Fice, an investigator for 
the Department of Health Services. Most of the customers were outpatients at 
Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Leonard A. Matsuk said Delatorre and Freelove wanted to deliver the 
wheelchairs, but "got caught in a cash-flow crunch. They did not deliberately 
set out to defraud the medical system. They were victims of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Therese Farrell said evidence shows the company 
had "no intention of fulfilling the orders" when it submitted the claims to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuk said Delatorre and Freelove pleaded no contest to avoid trial and a 
possible harsher sentence. They were facing a maximum jail sentence of six 
years, four months. JOHN POPE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted 5-0 to institute a pilot program to determine 
whether restricting overnight parking to one side of a street can ease the 
city's parking woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the six-month program, scheduled to begin in May, residents who obtain 
free permits may park on alternate sides of San Juan Avenue between 2 and 5 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 San Juan Avenue was chosen because parking during the day is already limited 
to alternating sides of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was one of several alternatives presented to ease the city's 
parking problems, which pose safety hazards and hamper motorists traveling the 
narrow streets.  
</P>
<P>
 In September, residents howled when the city banned street parking from 11 
p.m. to 6 a.m. unless the vehicle had a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 And the council rejected a proposal last fall to charge households a $25 
annual parking fee after more than 500 residents protested the move.  
</P>
<P>
 According to last week's ordinance, residents may obtain a free permit to park 
on San Juan Avenue during the restricted hours, City Manager Todd W. Argow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents who spoke at the meeting applauded the measure, suggesting 
the council extend the program throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been fighting the parking problem for six years, and now we have to 
wait six months to see what will happen. This should be implemented across the 
city," said Mary Poole. JENNIFER OLDHAM

 County Supervisor Gloria Molina has allocated $189,000 to fund two building 
inspectors and a part- time code enforcement officer for Walnut Park and the 
East Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina provided the Community Development Block Grant funds, citing an 
increasing need for code enforcement in Walnut Park after a community watch 
program was begun last fall, said Robert Alaniz, Molina's press deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a number of complaints about illegal dumping, questionable garage 
conversions and unsightly property," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor's office provided $60,000 in block grant funds last fall to 
hire additional county code enforcement workers after Walnut Park residents 
complained that illegal garage conversions were causing congestion. Residents 
said that congestion was leading to violence in the unincorporated area.  
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders instructed residents to report suspected illegal garage 
conversions to the Walnut Park Community Assn. so that it could seek county 
inspections. County officials said they have discovered a fairly large number 
of violations in Walnut Park as a result of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no enforcement. Now we have some enforcement," said Mike Gomez, vice 
president of the Walnut Park Community and Merchants Assn. "It's better. It's 
improving." JENNIFER OLDHAM

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; COUNCIL RENEWS SHERIFF'S CONTRACT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lynwood City Council has extended its contract with the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, scrapping an earlier proposal that recommended the city 
join forces with the South Gate Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract will run through 1998, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city pays the Sheriff's Department $4.8 million a year to patrol the city. 
Last fall, city officials had considered a joint operating agreement with the 
93-officer South Gate Police Department, which they said could have saved the 
city millions of dollars. In return, Lynwood would have provided fire services 
to South Gate, which has a contract with the county Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was scuttled, however, when officials in both cities found that the 
deal would be more difficult than originally believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies replaced the Lynwood Police Department in 1977 and the 
station has been at the center of recent controversy, including allegations 
that some of its deputies were members of a racist gang. In 1992, a special 
investigation found evidence that some deputies had used excessive force but 
praised former Cmdr. Bert Cueva for cracking down on the problems. JILL

 A fund-raiser for the Korean-American Grocers' Victims Assn., postponed 
following the earthquake, has been rescheduled for Tuesday at the Radisson 
Wilshire Plaza Hotel, 3515 Wilshire Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The association was established to assist and be an advocate for Korean 
American grocery store owners whose businesses were destroyed or damaged during 
the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six of the 174 Korean American grocery store owners who lost their 
businesses have been able to rebuild, in large part because of new conditions 
and restrictions imposed on them by city authorities, said Min Paek, the 
association's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The program begins at 6 p.m. Tickets are $50 each or $75 per couple.

<P>
 Hundreds of residents hard hit by the Northridge earthquake Jan. 17 received 
help last week when federal disaster officials opened a mobile unit at the 
Central American Resource Center (CARECEN). 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 had registered with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's 
mobile unit at 668 Bonnie Brae Ave. as of Wednesday, said Jose Luis Monge, 
manager at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of food, shelter and medical assistance were among the most common 
problems, Monge said. 
</P>
<P>
 CARECEN officials, who had been doing outreach in the area, said they expect 
that number to climb as more residents learn about the FEMA center. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first to arrive last weekend when the mobile site opened was Jessie 
Vega, 20, who had been living in a parking lot after the quake left the 
apartment he shared with his mother and five siblings uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know where to go or who to call," said Vega. "I called the Red Cross 
and they told me they couldn't do anything because they didn't have anything 
set up for this area." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people don't know FEMA is here," said Delmy Ruiz of CARECEN, which 
has been providing assistance since the day of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Monge said the center would remain open until "there is no need."

FEW QUAKE VICTIMS RESPOND TO OFFER OF FREE MOTEL ROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The South Gate Motel Owners Assn. has received little response to its offer of 
100 motel rooms to earthquake victims who have nowhere else to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a low occupancy rate, the association is able to provide free rooms 
to earthquake victims who do not have family or friends to stay with, said Sam 
Patidar, an association representative.Rooms are available for several days in 
a row, but not on a long-term basis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will withdraw its offer if queries don't increase this week, Patidar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The association offered its assistance at City Councilman Albert Robles' news 
conference Jan. 21. Since then, officials have received several calls from 
Northridge-area residents requesting shelter, but no takers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to drive down here to find a place to stay when they're all 
the way up in the Valley," Patidar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles said he hopes the association's offer will prompt motel owners in other 
cities to extend a helping hand to those who lost their homes in the 6.6 quake 
on Jan. 17.

PIECES OF HISTORY AMONG THE CASUALTIES; LANDMARKS: AT LEAST 30 VENERABLE 
STRUCTURES IN THE CITY WERE DAMAGED BY THE EARTHQUAKE, OFFICIALS SAY. AMONG THE 
HARDEST HIT WAS THE STIMSON HOUSE. 
</P>

<P>
 Pieces of the city's history were among the casualties of the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake as dozens of landmark buildings were reported damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary list compiled by the city's Cultural Affairs Department found at 
least 30 such structures were affected, with the damage ranging from a fallen 
sandstone facade at the Ecung-Ibbetson house on West Adams Boulevard to minor 
plaster cracks at the Auto Club of Southern California on South Figueroa 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Childs, chairman of the Adams-Dockweiler Historic Organizing Committee, 
estimated as many as 36 homes in that area were damaged by the 6.6 quake and 
subsequent aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damages to historical monuments is large," said Childs, whose home 
sustained only minor damage. "The larger institutions, such as the Auto Club, 
had minimal damage and they have the resources to deal with it. But the 
individual homeowners had a lot of damage, and there is no program to help 
people with historical homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hardest hit was the Ezra Stimson House at 2421 S. Figueroa St., 
where the roof was expected to be removed last week, after bricks fell through 
it. The chimney, parapets and tower were also damaged, according to Sister Mary 
Allen of the Sister of St. Joseph of Carondelet, the order that moved into the 
house last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masonic Temple at 4126 S. Figueroa St. sustained major damage and was 
deemed unsafe by city inspectors. The 70-year-old brick-and-tile building, with 
elegant blue arches, was cracked throughout. Bricks littered the back alley and 
front sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Lodge members have vowed to rebuild the two-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a beautiful building. We're not going to lose it," said Albert Barry, 
deputy grand master of the chapter, St. Anthony's Grand Masonic Lodge.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Watts Towers Art Center, a large wall mural was severely damaged, but 
the towers survived without critical damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The four spires atop the First Congregational Church at 6th Street and 
Commonwealth Avenue shifted on their foundations and had to be removed, said 
Virginia Somerville, the church's executive assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the earthquake, police officers notified the church after 
noticing that one of the 12-ton spires had shifted. An inspection of the others 
showed that they also had been damaged. "We've always ridden through 
earthquakes before," she said. "It must have been the particular angle or 
thrust of this one." 
</P>
<P>
 The church was built in 1932, Somerville said, and the congregation celebrated 
its 125th anniversary last year.

ITS SPIRIT UNBROKEN, ST. MONICA'S REBUILDS; QUAKE: PARISHIONERS QUICKLY DONATE 
MONEY AND LABOR TO REPAIR ONE OF THE CITY'S OLDEST ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hours after Monday's earthquake, hundreds of shaken parishioners hurried to 
check on St. Monica's Catholic Church, one of the oldest and largest Roman 
Catholic churches in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cried at the sight of the crumbled bell tower, the roofless sanctuary and 
the broken altar, where thousands of babies have been christened, marriages 
blessed and deaths mourned. 
</P>
<P>
 But 10 days later, the church where Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and other luminaries worship is on the road to recovery thanks 
in part to its affluent members and community support. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't hurt that the restoration effort is being guided by a longtime 
parishioner who happens to be a structural engineer working on a project to 
strengthen Los Angeles City Hall against earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The outpouring of charity has buoyed officials of the landmark church, which 
was founded in 1886 and is housed in a 1928 Byzantine granite and terra-cotta 
building at 7th Street and California Avenue. Roughly 5,000 families are 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have come here all last week with tears in their eyes . . . offering 
to help in any way they can," said Monsignor Lloyd Torgerson. "And unsolicited, 
they have (written checks and) said: 'Here, this is to help.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers have helped relocate Masses to St. Monica High School's gymnasium 
and clean up rubble at the church and adjacent elementary school, which 
sustained damage to its gable. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioner Nabih Youssef, a structural engineer who is retrofitting Los 
Angeles City Hall, is a consultant on the restoration of the church and school. 
He estimates the rebuilding will take at least six months and cost $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Youssef oversaw the shoring up of the church after the Jan. 17 quake and has 
begun mapping the restoration of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, he said of the damage: "It could have been a lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the monsignor's chair was destroyed and pieces from the sanctuary 
fell on the granite altar, the building did not collapse, Youssef said, 
principally because it has a reinforced concrete skeleton. After the quake, the 
building was shored up to prevent a collapse during aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to preserve every piece of material and replicate whatever is 
lost," he said. "If it were demolished it would be such a loss to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Many agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Even from as far as Brooklyn, N.Y., donations were collected Sunday from about 
1,100 members of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church at the urging of a cousin of a 
St. Monica parishioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to explain to someone how important St. Monica's is to the 
community," said churchgoer Diane Buzzita, who was stunned to see several 
broken statues lying in the courtyard. "It's not like, 'Oh, the church is 
damaged, so we'll go somewhere else.' I think we'll find everyone will be 
saying, 'OK, what do we need to do to fix it? Let's roll up our sleeves.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some members have offered to hold benefit concerts to raise funds for 
rebuilding the church. Although the Los Angeles Archdiocese has earthquake 
insurance, it is unclear how much of the policy would be paid out for St. 
Monica's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ken Deasy, who has been known to liven up Easter services by donning 
bunny ears and calling himself the "Priester Bunny," turns philosophical when 
discussing the rebuilding effort. He recounted the story of St. Francis, who 
was told by God to rebuild the crumbling church of San Damiano -- but not in 
the secular sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "God meant for St. Francis to rebuild the spirit of it," Deasy said. "Just the 
other day, I was talking about how we are a church not because we are a 
building, but because we are a people. We have served the poor, the sick and 
the aged and we will continue to. Though the doors have been shaken, they 
remain open. Though the bricks have crumbled, our spirit hasn't."

TALKIN' A GOOD GAME; PLAYERS USE VERBAL EXCHANGES ON THE COURT TO MOTIVATE AND 
INTIMIDATE. BUT IT HAS ALSO BECOME A POINT OF CONTENTION.

<P>
 After Markee Brown swished his third consecutive three-pointer in less than 
two minutes, he immediately turned to find his defender. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not enough that the Los Angeles City College guard knew he had taken 
over the game against Compton. Brown had to make sure his opposition knew it as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't hold me," Brown insisted. "You can't stop me." 
</P>
<P>
 Game-time exchanges like this go on weekly between some of the area's best 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the trash talkers -- players who talk a big game and have the 
offensive skills to back up their boasts. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brown, trash talking comes as naturally as shooting the three-pointer. 
"Trash talking gets me motivated," he said. "I do it to psyche out my defender 
and take him out of his game." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is exactly what Brown did in the Jan. 19 televised home game against 
Compton. With the Cubs trailing, 49-44, Brown hit a three-pointer to open the 
second half and connected on three more during a 29-16 LACC run. The Cubs won, 
106-101, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 On one occasion, Brown, who scored 29 points, arched a three-point shot, and 
then stood and watched. The ball entered the hoop and snapped the net. And then 
Brown let loose: "It's comin' again! All you can do is watch!" 
</P>
<P>
 As if his 6-foot-5, 230-pound frame doesn't say enough, Washington High's 
Dayron Harris never passes up an opportunity to tell a defender of his 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to talk a lot because it keeps me motivated," said the senior, who 
averages 24 points and 12 rebounds. "You hit some shots, your confidence goes 
up and (the defender's) goes down." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris dominated a 4-A City Section consolation game of the Pacific Open 
Tournament at Santa Monica College on Dec. 20. In a 72-54 win over Serra High 
and guard Ricky Price, who will play at Duke next fall, Harris had a game-high 
28 points and eight rebounds. Price, who scored 25 points in the game, blocked 
a short jumper by Harris early in the first half and the two began exchanging 
words. Harris answered by scoring the Generals' first 10 points of the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Ricky, and playing against people I know fires me up," Harris said. 
"We started talking and it elevated my game." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a language spoken on the court mainly to have fun, but there is an 
important rule honored by every good trash talker. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're gonna talk it, you'd better be able to walk it," said Fremont guard 
Calvin Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 And it isn't confined to the boys' teams. Chaka Smith, Jefferon's 5-9 senior 
guard-forward said she can't play quietly. "I just do it for fun. When people 
see girls talk, they might say, 'Ooh, she is hyped up.' I can't go on the court 
silent."  
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that it's a healthy part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan High Coach Ed Kamiyama believes it is detrimental to performance. "I 
try to tell my kids that trash talking doesn't get you anywhere because you are 
concentrating on what your next words will be to the opposing player," he said. 
"I don't tolerate it from my kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Kamiyama's Bulldogs suffered through a 1-21 season. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Jordan is 11-5 overall and sits atop the Southeastern conference 
with a 4-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamiyama says concentration is the reason for the marked improvement. "My team 
has stayed really focused this season by keeping their heads in the game," 
Kamiyama said. "If someone talks to them, that's fine, but I don't want to see 
their lips moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Players are becoming more vocal not only with one another but also with the 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players are starting to question the referees more," LACC Coach Mike Miller 
said. "I tell my players to shut up (about calls) and play, or else I pull 
them. Referees don't change their calls and don't want to be shown up." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Joseph, special adviser to the Los Angeles Unified School District 
Athletic Department and a referee for 32 years, acknowledged the need to keep 
the chatter at a minimum: "Trash talking used to be low key in all ballgames, 
and a player would say something like, 'In your eye.' Today, kids are taking 
showmanship to another level. They are making remarks like, 'You can't hold my 
jock.' Some can take it, some can't. Those who can't get into fights. When a 
player challenges another player, it's all right. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when a player belittles another player, it is getting out of hand. . . 
.Most referees will tell the players to knock it off. If a player continues, he 
is given a technical foul. If the player persists, he is thrown out of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, trash talking is condoned only by players like Crenshaw 
point guard Tommie Davis, who attests that it can be intimidating. "When I 
throw an alley-oop pass to Tremaine (Fowlkes) and he slams it, I may turn to 
the defender and say: 'Whatcha gonna do about that?' " Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei leading scorer Andre Miller, who averages 24 points, is one of the 
few area players who posts big numbers without the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone says something to me, I show them by scoring points," Miller said. 
"It pushes me harder when someone talks to me, but I don't need to do it. I let 
my play speak for itself."

SOCCER; PLAYOFF SCHEDULE REVISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 All City Section soccer games were postponed last week for the second week in 
a row in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. All high school 
soccer action is to resume Monday, except for the Northwest Valley Conference, 
which will resume games Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first round of playoffs has been rescheduled for Feb. 17 and the 
championship match has been moved back to March 5. Those dates are tentative. 
</P>
<P>
 The final, which has been played at Birmingham High since 1972 when soccer was 
integrated into the City Section, has been moved to Weingart Stadium at East 
Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
 City Section Athletics Commissioner Barbara Fiege said the move will improve 
soccer's image in the city. "The student population of this city requires that 
soccer be one of the major sports in the district," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Games canceled Jan. 19 and 26 have been rescheduled for Feb. 11 and Friday, 
respectively. The Northwest Valley Conference games will not be made up. Games 
not played will not affect the seeding process for the playoffs, Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the season reaches the midway point, two teams have come to the forefront 
as contenders for the sectional title. Undefeated Bell and San Pedro high 
schools are poised to meet in the 1993-94 City Section final. Both have 
dominated their conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (6-0-1) will be looking for their second sectional title since 
1990, and the Pirates (6-0-1) are seeking their third in eight years.  
</P>
<P>
 Bell's devastating 5-0 blowout of defending City Section champion Fremont 
(3-2-1) two weeks ago proved the Eagles' consistency as a power in the 
Southeastern Conference. The win was even more gratifying for the Eagles, who 
had lost to the Pathfinders in last season's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing in the section's toughest conference with Garfield (4-0-3), 
Roosevelt (4-2) and Locke (2-3-2), the Eagles have had trouble only with the 
Bulldogs, tying 0-0 at the beginning of the regular season.  
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro has beaten every Pacific Conference foe by two or more goals. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, Garfield, Manual Arts, Belmont and Jefferson are the top Central 
City teams capable of making it to the quarterfinals. The local teams' biggest 
challengers for the title look to be Kennedy (8-3) in the Northwest Valley 
Conference and Canoga Park (5-0-2) of the Valley Pac-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two schools -- twice the number as in the past -- will have a chance to 
advance to the sectional playoffs this season.

<P>
 The high school athletic season in the Los Angeles Unified School District was 
knocked down but not out by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of City Section administrators and athletic directors decided last 
week to resume competition in basketball and soccer for boys and 
girls.Wrestling begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 High schools, especially those in the San Fernando Valley, sustained damage to 
their gymnasiums while others were used as American Red Cross shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 City Section Athletic Director Barbara Fiege said that 24 of the City's 49 
schools were affected by the 6.6 Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Central City schools in the Coastal, Northern, Southeastern and Southern 
Pacific conferences plan to make up all canceled games. Those regularly 
scheduled for Jan. 19 and Jan. 21 will be played Feb. 7 and 15, respectively. 
Games for Jan. 26-28 will be played Feb. 17 and 18. In the San Fernando Valley, 
games will either be rescheduled, played during a three-day round-robin 
tournament, or not played at all depending on the league. SEAN WATERS

 It didn't take long for Washington High wide receiver Jim McElroy to show the 
colors of his future school. At the UCLA-Arizona State basketball game on Jan. 
21, McElroy wore a blue-and-gold hat and sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy (6-foot, 165 pounds), one of the fastest receivers in the City 
Section, kept college recruiters guessing until the final two weeks before the 
signing period, which will begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA was always one of my top two choices," he said. "But I also had a good 
time when I visited Washington. It came down to those two schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Often double- and triple-teamed, McElroy caught 18 passes for 308 yards and 
four touchdowns during the regular season. But he was also used as a tailback 
in midseason and ran 99 yards for a touchdown against Fremont in the City 3-A 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 While McElroy will stay in the area to continue his football career, most of 
the other top Central City players will head out of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Gregory Gales (6-2, 210) has decided to attend Nevada Las Vegas and 
not Arizona State. Gales had 14 sacks, one interception and four fumble 
recoveries last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson defensive end John Johnson (6-4, 215) has made an unwritten 
commitment to play for Kansas, according to Hank Johnson, coach at Jefferson. 
Johnson, who was a three-year starter for the Democrats, had 32 tackles and six 
sacks. Jefferson defensive back Robert Robinson (5-9, 165) is leaning toward 
signing with Kansas, but is also being pursued by Oregon and Hawaii. He led the 
area with 12 interceptions, returning three for touchdowns. Johnson also has 
been recruited by Arizona, Oregon, Hawaii and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola leads all area schools with players receiving scholarship offers. 
Defensive lineman Eric Scanlan (6-2, 225) has decided to attend Duke. One of 
the quickest lineman to play for the Cubs, Scanlan had 39 unassisted tackles, 
six sacks and two tackles behind the line of scrimmage. As reported earlier, 
Cubs running back Kadar Hamilton (6-0, 200) will attend Stanford and punter 
Anthony Scotti (6-2, 180) will play for Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw linebacker Dennis Fomond (6-0, 210) chose California over UCLA on 
Wednesday, joining Cougar basketball star Tremaine Fowlkes, who signed with the 
Golden Bears in November, and former Cougar receiver Kofi Nartey. Fomond, a 
three-year starter, led his team with 179 tackles and had two interceptions. 
Cougar linebacker Darrell Mayo (6-1, 215) has committed to Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey's Norman Ysaguirre (6-0, 295) has narrowed his list to Fresno State, 
Oregon State and Wyoming. Ysaguirre, the City Times' 1993 Lineman of the Year, 
had 52 tackles, including 31 solo tackles, and six sacks. Don defensive back 
Jabulani Smith-Freeman (5-10, 165) will choose between Colorado State and 
Wyoming. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, a Division I-AA school, is recruiting Dorsey 
running backs Che Johnson (6-1, 175) and Christopher Phillips (5-8, 175), free 
safety Max Kaleem (5-9, 160) and strong safety Gino Hutcherson (6-0, 185). 
</P>
<P>
 Locke quarterback Akili Roberson (6-0, 185) and receiver Russell Shaw (5-8, 
165) have received scholarship offers to Nebraska and Nevada Las Vegas, 
respectively, but have not passed their college entrance examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles running back Shina Onaolapo, (6-1, 205) who rushed for 815 yards, 
is waiting for his latest test score. He is being recruited by Colorado State, 
Oregon State and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont quarterback William Yates (6-0, 185), the City Times' 1993 Offensive 
Back of the Year, and receiver Andre Johnson (6-2, 170) will take trips to 
Hawaii this weekend. However, Yates is leaning toward signing with Nevada Las 
Vegas and Johnson is expected to sign with Kansas. Pathfinder linebacker Carl 
Bledman (6-0, 235) is considering University of San Diego, and Division III 
schools Humboldt State and Claremont-Mudd. All three are waiting for their 
December test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts running back Kareem Wafer (5-10, 180) and lineman Vone Russell 
(6-2, 250) are being recruited by San Jose State and Oregon State, but need to 
pass their entrance exams.

STATE NEAR BOTTOM OF BARREL OF WINE GRAPE SCANDAL; FRAUD: WINERIES THAT 
UNWITTINGLY BOUGHT OVERPRICED GRAPES SIMPLY USED THEM TO MAKE OVERPRICED WINE. 
NEW SAFEGUARDS ARE NOW IN PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nobody was killed, unlike in the great Italian wine scandal of 1986, when 
vintners used methanol to boost sugar levels and sent two dozen wine drinkers 
to early graves. Now that was serious. 
</P>
<P>
 But by California's priggish wine standards, the scandal that is drawing to a 
close here in Federal Court -- a series of sneaky crimes whereby cheap, 
characterless grapes were passed off as pricey zinfandel, chardonnay or 
cabernet -- was the biggest in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers paid some $55 million for wine that was not as advertised, five men 
went to jail and the president of the nation's fifth-largest winery has just 
pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy in the largest and most complex of 
five criminal cases arising from the schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases showed a raw side of what is described as a generally friendly, 
handshake-based industry -- the bargain-basement part of the wine world where a 
few bottom fishers care less about what is in the bottle than how much shelf 
space they get in the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Very few people were directly damaged by the fraud, and even the murder of a 
witness in one of the cases turned out to be unrelated. And while a handful of 
wine outlaws collected millions of dollars they weren't entitled to, the 
wineries that unwittingly bought the overpriced grapes simply used them to make 
overpriced wine. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the consumer holding the bottles -- in most cases a $5 bottle of 
bogus white zinfandel, a sweet pink wine much derided by connoisseurs. But in 
wine circles they say that "white zin" would taste the same whether it was made 
with zinfandel grapes or, say, barbera, a kind of grape blended with others to 
make generic jug wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the very integrity of California's $20-billion wine industry was at 
stake. "Some people snicker at these cases," says one federal investigator, 
accustomed to arresting gun-runners, drug traffickers and other hard-core 
sorts. "But you've got to have standards in any industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal investigation that began in 1988 is now complete, and 
authorities, growers and vintners say that it triggered new industry-funded 
safeguards that have all but halted the practice of misrepresenting grapes and 
wine. But the matter has not quite been put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Still to be decided is the penalty to be handed down against the man whom the 
government portrays as the chief figure in the biggest and most sophisticated 
of four criminal ventures unmasked in the scandal: Fred T. Franzia, co-founder 
and president of Bronco Wine Co., the nation's fifth largest winery. 
</P>
<P>
 Franzia's indictment by a federal grand jury in Sacramento in December marked 
the end -- and arguably the high point -- of the five-year investigation of 
fraud in California's wine industry. 
</P>
<P>
 (Fred Franzia and Bronco are unaffiliated with Franzia Brothers Winery in 
Ripon, Calif., which sells Franzia-label wines. Bronco, its name is derived 
from "brothers and cousin," is owned by Fred Franzia, his brother, Joseph, and 
their cousin, John Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
 Franzia, 50, a nephew of industry statesman Ernest Gallo, is a director and 
former chairman of the influential Wine Institute -- trade association 
representing 80% of the wine produced in California -- and a highly successful 
businessman who built Bronco Wine from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Franzia declined to be interviewed. He has a reputation as a bull in the wine 
shoppe -- widely described by acquaintances as smart but boastful, arrogant and 
brash, ready to intimidate employees, squeeze growers and fight battles in 
court. By all accounts he runs the company single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employees and others with whom Franzia deals are afraid of him," says 
Assistant U.S. Attorney R. Steven Lapham, who prosecuted all the wine cases. 
"I'm not sure what it is, if it's his manner or the economic power he holds." 
</P>
<P>
 Bronco's license was suspended briefly by state agriculture officials in 1985, 
a rare action, after complaints by an unprecedented number of growers.  
</P>
<P>
 The company was found to have repeatedly used improper tactics to lower the 
prices it paid growers for their grapes, typically by refusing to take 
deliveries until the grape quality had deteriorated. In the words of one 
hearing officer, Bronco's actions were "reprehensible." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Franzia has struck a deal with federal prosecutors to avoid a prison term 
in favor of a $3-million fine -- much of which, the government admits, is 
payable from ill-gotten gains. If this plea bargain is accepted by the judge, 
Franzia will be the only one of six defendants identified as major conspirators 
in the series of wine frauds to avoid incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 Franzia pleaded guilty Jan. 19 in Sacramento federal court under an agreement 
that reduces his role at Bronco to chief financial officer for five years, 
requires 500 hours of community service and imposes fines of $500,000 and $2.5 
million on him and his company.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's bought his way out," says Jack L. Hart, a longtime wine industry lender 
as a Fresno-based Bank of America vice president. "That's what is so 
upsetting,"  
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, a former client of Hart's, 72-year-old Madera winemaker Angelo 
Papagni, is serving an 18-month term in federal prison for a lesser scheme than 
Franzia's. Hart and others are trying to get Papagni released early. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not equitable," concedes prosecutor Lapham. 
</P>
<P>
 Lapham said he recommended the plea agreement because he believed that Bronco, 
a major employer in the small town of Ceres near Modesto, might not survive 
without Franzia -- a judgment strongly denied by Bronco itself. Moreover, he 
said, the plea bargain avoids a difficult and expensive trial. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge William B. Shubb in Sacramento will decide whether to 
accept the terms of the plea bargain. Sentencing is set for March. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the merits of Franzia's proposed penalty, it is touted as the biggest 
fine ever levied in the Eastern District of California, which extends from 
Bakersfield to Oregon and Nevada to the Bay Area. And his case culminates the 
state's worst wine scandal -- not that there is a lengthy list to compare with. 
</P>
<P>
 The last such known deception occurred in 1974, when Almaden Vineyards 
mislabeled 28,000 gallons of wine in the little screw-top bottles served by 
airlines. The company paid a $250,000 fine, at the time the heaviest ever 
imposed by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, the Almaden case was dwarfed by a French scandal in which 2 million 
cases of cheap red wine were passed off as the most expensive Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 The more recent California disgrace was set in motion by severe 1987-88 
shortages of certain grapes -- especially zinfandel, cabernet and chardonnay -- 
when the industry was caught unprepared by the soaring popularity of a new 
category of medium-priced varietal wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Varietals are those at least 75% composed of the grape cited on the label, and 
include such wines as cabernet sauvignon, zinfandel, sauvignon blanc and 
chardonnay. Generic wines -- typified by California burgundy and chablis or 
those simply labeled as table wines, often sold in big jugs -- are blends of 
many types and are said to have no "character." 
</P>
<P>
 In heaviest demand -- and the focus of most of the fraud -- was white zin, a 
newly conceived product whose flavor resembles sweet rose wines but has the 
hallowed "zinfandel" name on the label. It and similar pink "blush" wines have 
been called "Yuppie Kool-aid." 
</P>
<P>
 Though absent altogether from the wine snob's list, the combination of the red 
zinfandel grape with cheaper, generic white fruits came to mean big bucks for 
many well-known California wineries. It brings in cash quickly because it needs 
little or no aging. 
</P>
<P>
 But the shortages vaulted zinfandel prices to $800 to $1,200 a ton, while 
other types of red grapes used in generic jug wines -- valdepena, Grenache, 
Ruby Cabernet, carnelian and others -- were in plentiful supply and could be 
had for $100 to $200. 
</P>
<P>
 With falsification of documents and a few other wrinkles, a grower or broker 
could collect $15,000 to $25,000 for a gondola full of supposed zinfandel 
grapes that were actually valdepenas worth $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The scams were facilitated by lax controls at some wineries -- apparently not 
a problem at the better wineries in Napa, Sonoma and other regions -- and the 
difficulty of conclusively identifying some grape types. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became a real temptation," says Mark Urban, a deputy state attorney 
general who filed 17 civil complaints -- all settled out of court with the 
payment of fines -- arising from the joint state-federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of growers got a little bit greedy, a few people got a lot greedy, 
truckers started looking the other way, and it just got completely out of 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors swept the industry during the 1987 harvest, and numerous growers and 
vintners tipped off state and federal authorities. As the next harvest began, 
dozens of vineyards were put under surveillance by investigators from the 
California Department of Food and Agriculture and the ATF. 
</P>
<P>
 Using public records to identify the types of grapes grown in the vineyards, 
agents watched as grapes were loaded into trucks, then followed the trucks to 
wineries. They then checked winery records and determined that the delivered 
grapes had been misrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bronco, more than 15% of the "zinfandel" and about half the "cabernet" 
crushed by the winery in 1987 was actually something else, said another federal 
investigator who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bronco -- which mainly sells non-varietal wine in bulk to companies that 
sell it under their own labels, some as wine coolers -- this represented only 
about 3% of the winery's overall tonnage that year. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the inflated prices, the misrepresented grapes accounted for a 
considerably higher proportion of Bronco's revenues, investigators said. And 
because of the shortages, the fraud enabled Bronco to fill orders that 
law-abiding winemakers couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, Franzia would sometimes order that zinfandel 
leaves, distinctive in their shape, be sprinkled on truckloads of cheaper 
grapes as part of the subterfuge. He called this the "blessing of the loads," 
court papers show. 
</P>
<P>
 He would order that field identification tags be altered or destroyed, the 
indictment said. And to launder revenues that wouldn't withstand the glare of 
investigation, he allegedly enlisted an unwitting, well-known wine broker -- 
later a grand jury witness -- to whom he owed money. 
</P>
<P>
 On three occasions, he wrote checks to the broker totaling $2.9 million, 
supposedly as payment for expensive grapes, according to the indictment. The 
broker then would write slightly smaller checks to one of a series of 
partnerships controlled by Franzia. The broker would keep the difference as 
payment of bills for previous, legitimate services. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronco treasurer Daniel J. Leonard also declined to discuss the case, noting 
that this is a "ticklish period" with sentencing yet to come. He produced a 
letter from the winery to its customers and growers in which Franzia said: "I 
accept responsibility for what happened six years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also said Bronco cooperated fully and had "voluntarily" turned over 
100,000 pages of records. But prosecutor Lapham said, "If you call cooperation 
responding to grand jury subpoenas and court orders, Bronco cooperated. If 
you're talking about voluntarily coming forward, they didn't cooperate, in my 
view." 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuous by its absence from any brush with the scandal was E & J Gallo 
Winery in Modesto, the biggest vintner of all, where security and quality 
controls are legendary and winemakers literally stand guard at the gate as 
trucks roll in during the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the irregularities by Franzia, a nephew of co-founder Ernest Gallo's late 
wife, didn't appear to affect his standing in the family. Asked to comment, 
Ernest, 85, said through a spokesman: "I have a high regard for Fred Franzia." 
</P>
<P>
 And as chief financial officer at Bronco, he remains "a director in good 
standing" at the Wine Institute, says President John DeLuca. "There hasn't even 
been one person who's raised a question about it."

 A drive along the Redwood Highway offers travelers a chance to witness the 
divergent forces that feed upon Northern California's evergreens.A tour bus, 
top left, hauls in those probably more familiar with skyscrapers made of 
concrete, while a truck, top right, hauls away lumber, an industry's lifeblood. 
An eerie calmness filters through the giant evergreens, left, along the 
highway, which stretches 359 miles from San Francisco north to Crescent City. 
Every grove, every tree along the way seems to have a name or have been 
transformed into some kind of tourist oddity -- such as the Founders Tree in 
the Avenue of the Giants, below. Trees, bottom, are stacked high at the Eel 
River Sawmill.

CRIME CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) characterized Atty. Gen. Janet Reno as a "sweet 
lady" unsuited for the job, contending that she should concern herself with 
prosecuting criminals rather than issues such as day care and other social 
services for low-income children (Jan. 22). Gramm probably was more comfortable 
with ineffective attorneys general like John Mitchell and Edwin Meese who 
prattled on about "wars on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 50% of all crimes reported to police are committed by the most 
persistent 5% or 6% of offenders. A growing body of research indicates that the 
antisocial behavior of these people is most likely to result from the early 
life course factors Reno emphasizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank God, we finally have someone in this county's top law enforcement slot 
who understands that day care, maternal and child health care and education are 
key crime control issues. Far better to focus resources on nurturing productive 
human beings during their critical early years than to deal with the 
depredations of hard-core criminals, who make us live in fear and constipate 
our courts and prisons all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno is right. It is time to quit declaring "war" on ourselves and attack the 
roots of crime. Any balanced set of crime control strategies must consider both 
early life course factors that spawn our worst criminals and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortsighted politicians like Gramm are an important part of this country's 
crime problem.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; JOHN GREGORY DUNNE; DOMINICK DUNNE; EXPERIENCING 
L.A. THROUGH THE EYES OF THE WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt is a producer for Fox News and a contributor 
to National Public Radio's All Things Considered and Morning Edition. He spoke 
in a conference call with John Gregory Dunne, in New York, and Dominick Dunne, 
at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1960s and '70s, Dominick Dunne and his younger brother, John Gregory, 
pretty much owned this town. Sons of a well-to-do Connecticut family -- "We 
were like minor-league Kennedys," Dominick once wrote -- they came to Los 
Angeles and prospered. Dominick became a movie producer. John, with his wife, 
writer Joan Didion, crafted novels and screenplays, earning literary kudos and 
lots of Hollywood lucre. Dominick produced Joan's "Play It as It Lays," as well 
as "Panic in Needle Park," written by Didion and her husband, who also wrote 
the remake of "A Star Is Born." Both brothers eventually left Los Angeles, but 
each remains wedded to it. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the '70s, Dominick Dunne's drinking had gotten out of control. 
He abandoned the city and his career as a producer. "I sold everything," he 
remembers, "even my shirts." He emerged, sober, after six months of isolation 
in Oregon, and recast himself as a writer. His first book, "The Winners," was a 
sequel to Joyce Haber's Hollywood potboiler, "The Users." Critics abhorred it, 
but it sold well enough to earn him a sizable advance for his next effort, "The 
Two Mrs. Grenvilles." Then, in short order, his youngest brother, Stephen, 
committed suicide, and his daughter, Dominique, was murdered by her boyfriend. 
Dominick took notes throughout the trial, which became the basis for a Vanity 
Fair article, "Justice." He has since written dozens of pieces for the magazine 
-- his latest is about the trial of Erik and Lyle Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, John Gregory Dunne and his wife had become among the highest-paid 
screenwriters in Hollywood. They also created powerful essays and fiction; Joan 
wrote "Salvador" and "A Book of Common Prayer," while John skewered Hollywood 
mores in "The Studio" and spent four years writing the novel "The Red, White 
and Blue." Then, in 1988, after 24 years in Los Angeles, they shocked their 
friends, and themselves, by picking up and moving to New York. John says, "I'd 
written nine books, each of which touched on Los Angeles, and I felt tapped 
out. We weren't working and needed a goose." 
</P>
<P>
 Today is John Gregory Dunne's 30th wedding anniversary. He's 61, the proud 
father of a photographer daughter who works for Travel and Leisure. His latest 
novel, "Playland," will be published this summer. Dominick, 65, has been in Los 
Angeles for six months, covering the Menendez trial -- he experienced the fires 
last fall and rode out the Northridge earthquake in his room at the Chateau 
Marmont. Each man speaks about the city as one might of a longtime lover, with 
the kind of longing one has for someone cherished and too casually spurned. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've both experienced many of the modern calamities we've been 
through in Los Angeles. What stands out in your memory?  
</P>
<P>
 John Gregory Dunne: Joan and I went into South-Central during the Watts riots 
of 1965 -- we wrote about that. In 1971, we were thrown out of bed by the 
Sylmar quake. We were living in Malibu at the time, and got a really good 
shake. We went through three major fires while living in Malibu. So we were 
aware of nature and its discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 I have one strong memory from the Watts riots. We went down to South-Central 
and we wrote about what we saw there. But my memory goes back to something far 
away from the scene of the action. We lived, at the time, in Portuguese Bend, 
at the very tip of Palos Verdes. And I remember our landlord showing me a 
shotgun he had just bought. He said, "I'm going to be ready in case people come 
out here." The idea of buying a shotgun in Palos Verdes to stop the hordes 
seemed most bizarre -- and these were days when people were not so likely to 
buy guns as they are now. This was a shotgun that could have brought down a 
goddamned elephant. That is my most striking memory of the Watts riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Dominick, how does the Northridge earthquake rate in your pantheon of Los 
Angeles disasters?  
</P>
<P>
 Dominick Dunne: I have been through others, of course, but this was the worst. 
I did not do that smart thing that you are supposed to do -- hop up and get 
under a table. I just lay there and thought, "Well, this is the end of the 
line." I collected myself, said my little prayer and watched my television set 
fly out onto the floor. I was extremely calm. 
</P>
<P>
 When it stopped, I began to think of what I wanted to have with me, and I 
began to collect my things -- my glasses, my wallet, my watch. It was pitch 
dark. And I took the latest draft of my article and stuck it in my back pocket, 
and made my way down the stairwells. 
</P>
<P>
 All the guests gathered out on the lawn in front of the hotel, and then we 
realized there was a surreal light above us. It was coming from the huge 
Marlboro sign in front of the hotel, there on Sunset Boulevard. Somehow, the 
Marlboro man was the only thing left shining in the whole city. That was truly 
strange -- something I will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the sun came up, I returned to my room, and I started working. I 
wrote all day, and the next day as well. I think I was like many people -- I 
just wanted to get things back to normal, and I threw myself into my work. So I 
didn't have time to have a reaction for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm almost embarrassed to talk about my own experience, when so many 
others experienced things so much worse. 
</P>
<P>
 J.G. Dunne: People talk about how this wasn't The Big One. But I think it 
would have been plenty goddamned big if it had happened during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some people have remarked that Angelenos face these disasters -- fires, mud 
slides, earthquakes -- with a great deal of equanimity. Is there something in 
our nature that prepares us for disaster, or do we simply learn to deal with 
it?  
</P>
<P>
 J.G. Dunne: We learn. When Joan and I lived in Malibu, we began to know 
exactly what we would take with us. Once we heard about a fire, we would place 
our car so it was facing out the driveway. We would bring out what we were 
working on, we would bring photographs, and we would bring Joan's old family 
silver, and cram it all in the car. We were ready. But I wouldn't say we were 
particularly calm. We were spooked by fires. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Dunne: I was always baffled how, after terrible fires, people would rebuild 
on the same site. That's something I could never do. Then, while covering the 
Menendez trial, I met a man -- he was a witness -- whose house had burned to 
the ground in the Malibu fire. He explained to me that the only way he could 
collect on his insurance was to build on the same site. So it turns out all 
this rebuilding may be more about finances, and less about resilience and 
tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
 J.G. Dunne: There's a curious thing about these quakes and fires. We tend to 
want to place blame on someone, rather than believing that nature is acting 
naturally. I'm often skeptical about claims that these fires are the work of 
arsonists. But then, in some ways, even the arsonist who sets a fire may be 
part of that natural cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The question of the moment -- the one we get in phone calls from back East 
-- is, why do we live here? Why do we live in this desert that shakes and burns 
and slides?  
</P>
<P>
 J.G. Dunne: Most anyplace one lives is essentially dangerous. There are floods 
in the Midwest, and tornadoes. There are hurricanes along the Gulf. In New 
York, you get mugged. All life is inherently dangerous. But beyond that, Los 
Angeles is just a wonderful place to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you think the storied hordes who are making their exodus from the state 
are making a big mistake?  
</P>
<P>
 J.G. Dunne: Well, I remember a story Joan wrote about a fundamentalist 
minister who moved himself and his entire congregation to Tennessee because he 
was terrified of earthquakes. They moved lock, stock and barrel -- and one 
month later, they had a terrific earthquake in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Dunne: I left Los Angeles in 1979, in what were less than favorable 
circumstances. I had pretty much single-handedly wrecked my career because of a 
problem with drinking. A few years later, I had a terrible tragedy in my 
family. And I developed a feeling about Los Angeles, something more than a 
strong dislike. I simply never wanted to come here again. Over the years, I 
came back to write about various things, but I did my work, and left as quickly 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, I came here to cover the Menendez trial, and expected to stay about 
eight or 10 weeks. It's been over six months now, and I have once again fallen 
in love with Los Angeles. I realize there are so many people here who I love. 
And then this earthquake happens. It has not in any way shaken my faith, or 
disturbed my new love for this city. I truly feel like I'm part of Los Angeles 
again, and I love that feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 J.G. Dunne: I liked Los Angeles for odd reasons. For one, there was no sense 
of community. You were really left to your own resources, spending this 
inordinate amount of time alone in a balloon of an automobile. I liked that a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When coupled with the state's economic malaise, has this extraordinary 
series of natural and social disasters meant that the California dream is over? 
Does California no longer represent that place where anything is possible?  
</P>
<P>
 J.G. Dunne: I resist and resent the idea of California as a metaphor. It's 
something thrust upon us, usually by people in the East. Even though I left it, 
I suppose I loved Los Angeles more than any place I've ever been. I loved the 
idea of being alone. People say the city has no street life, but I think that 
street life is highly overrated. What sort of street life did William Faulkner 
have in Oxford, Miss.? And my wife, Joan, said she never realized how much she 
loved Los Angeles until she left, and returned to do some reporting. When we 
lived here, I always did the driving. It wasn't until she came back, and drove 
herself around, that she realized how much she loved the place. So being behind 
the wheel is very much part of the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Dunne: I went to a party the other night, and people were so desperate to 
be there, just to talk with other people and tell their own experiences with 
the quake. This was a real Beverly Hills group of people -- and even these 
people were devastated by all of this. I didn't hear anyone saying they wanted 
to leave the city. But I did hear people questioning the way they've gone about 
their lives acquiring wealth and possessions. An earthquake can be very 
humbling in that sense. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is virtually the only topic of conversation. I was at the Golden Globe 
awards last week, and I heard the word "God," more than I've heard it in a long 
time. "Thank God we're here," "thank God we all survived." I was impressed with 
that, from that sort of jaded group. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, I was in a restaurant, in Beverly Hills, having lunch, when we had a 
strong aftershock. Everyone stopped and became silent. But no one headed for 
the exits. We all looked up at this great, huge chandelier and watched it stop 
shaking. In 30 seconds, everybody went right back to making their deals. It 
made me love the spirit of this town, the lack of hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
 J.G. Dunne: You know we have no real memory of pain. If you slam your thumb 
with a hammer, you have terrible pain. But once it goes, you have memory of the 
event, but the pain doesn't reoccur. So you go on, and try and get your life 
back on track as quickly as you can. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the experience of these kinds of catastrophes can be very invigorating 
in a way. After we heard about the quake, Joan said she sort of wished we had 
been there for it. And I said, "Babe, we've been there. We lived through the 
Sylmar quake. We've had that experience." 
</P>
<P>
 But in my heart of hearts, I wish I had been there, too. When you do what we 
do, when you are always looking for a powerful experience, it's always nice to 
be there. There is a sense which is almost like jealousy when people like us 
miss an event like an earthquake.
