 Hewlett-Packard Reports 41% Jump in Earnings: The Palo Alto-based maker of 
computers and scientific instruments said rising sales and a rein on expenses 
helped boost earnings to $368 million, or $1.42 a share, for the first quarter 
ended Jan. 31. Hewlett-Packard Co.'s net income was $261 million, or $1.03 a 
share, during the same period last year. Revenue jumped 24% to $5.7 billion 
from $4.6 billion, and orders rose 18% to a record $6.1 billion from $5.2 
billion.

 Calgene to Sell Genetically Engineered Cotton: The Davis, Calif.-based 
agricultural biotechnology company said it has received approval from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture to sell without restriction its genetically 
engineered cottonseed.Calgene said its gene-altered cotton, known as BXN, is 
resistant to the effects of the herbicide bromoxynil, used by farmers to 
control morning glory and other broadleaf weeds. Such weeds reduce the 
country's $4-billion cotton crop by 15% annually, Calgene said. It said use of 
BXN should reduce the use of herbicides because chemicals could be used in 
lower doses. But the Union of Concerned Scientists issued a statement 
criticizing approval of Calgene's BXN, saying the creation of 
herbicide-tolerant crops will "deepen U.S. farmers' dependence on toxic 
chemicals."

DOW UP, DOLLAR DOWN AMID JAPAN FRICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks rose Wednesday in a nervous session dominated by concerns about an 
escalating trade war with Japan and upcoming inflation data on the U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar traded lower as currency dealers awaited word of the next step in 
the growing trade friction between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term bond yields edged upward in listless trading as investors bided 
their time ahead of consumer inflation statistics due out today. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22 points early in the session in a 
follow-through from Tuesday's 24-point increase. But the rally began to fade in 
late morning amid concerns about trade tensions with Japan, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-chip indicator finished the day up 9 points at 3,937.27 on Big Board 
volume totaling 295.45 million shares. In the broader market, advancing issues 
outnumbered decliners by about 6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trade problems, or the fight over trade with Japan, represent more of a 
threat to the bull market than rates themselves," said James Solloway, director 
of research at Argus Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Solloway said stock traders are concerned that the Clinton Administration's 
increasingly tough stance with Japan could backfire on U.S. companies by 
pressuring the yen too high against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 A higher yen, while lowering prices of U.S.-made goods abroad and thus helping 
U.S. exports, could also chill foreign investors' interest in buying 
dollar-denominated securities, including U.S. stocks, Solloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also pulled back amid "a little bit of caution ahead of tomorrow's 
numbers," said James Schroeder, a stock analyst at MMS International. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hewlett-Packard said its fiscal first-quarter earnings rose to $1.42 per 
share from $1.03 a year earlier, above many analysts' expectations. 
Hewlett-Packard jumped 3 5/8 to 89 1/8. IBM was up 1/8 at 54 5/8 and Compaq 
advanced 1 1/4 to 93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boeing rose 2 1/8 to 46 1/2 in active trading on the NYSE. The White House 
said Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp. will share a $6-billion commercial 
aircraft order from Saudia Airlines. McDonnell Douglas rose 1 7/8 to 118 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Blockbuster Entertainment fell 3/4 to 24 1/2 and Paramount Communications 
dipped 1/8 at 77 7/8. Blockbuster and its partner, Viacom, won a five-month 
campaign to acquire Paramount for $10 billion in cash and securities. Viacom 
Class B closed unchanged at 28. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meanwhile, QVC Network, which lost its bid to acquire Paramount, added 1 1/4 
to finish at 51 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Benefiting for the second day from Clinton Administration efforts to get the 
Japanese to buy more U.S.-made cellular telephones, Motorola was up 3 1/8 at 
104 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * A federal court jury ruled in favor of Johnson & Johnson in a patent 
infringement suit brought by rival U.S. Surgical. J&J slipped 1/2 to 41 3/4, 
but U.S. Surgical tumbled 5 5/8 to 21 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Atlantic Richfield lost 1 1/8 to 103 1/4 as analysts cut their first-quarter 
and full 1994 earnings estimates on Arco following a meeting with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in overseas trading, Tokyo stocks recovered slightly from the 
previous two days' losses. The Nikkei-225 average closed at 19,052.11, up 
77.51. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Mexico City's Bolsa index snapped a five-day losing streak and rose 
19.64 points to 2,780.23. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average ended at 2,136.61, 
up 20.99 points, while in London, the Financial Times 100-share average gained 
24.5 points to finish at 3,417.7. Currency 
</P>
<P>
 Aggressive purchases of dollars by the Bank of Japan helped lift the dollar in 
overseas trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of new developments on the trade front, dealers said many are 
scrambling to buy back dollars sold in a hurry after the U.S.-Japan trade 
summit ended Friday without an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers said the U.S.-Japan trade gap will drive the dollar's direction 
against the yen. If the gap widens, dealers are likely to sell dollars on the 
idea that the White House might push for a stronger yen to help trim the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the dollar moved lower in early trading as the market 
digested Washington's attempts to clarify its dollar-yen policy, said Buddy 
Eichorn, senior vice president at Marine Midland Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 103.80 yen, down slightly from 103.85 yen 
Tuesday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 103.15 yen, up 1.13. Other 
Markets 
</P>
<P>
 Investors found little reason to buy or sell bonds despite a report showing a 
steep decline in the housing industry last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield rose to 6.46% from 6.45% a day earlier, 
pushing prices up 3/32 point, or 94 cents per $1,000 in face value. Yield and 
price move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said housing starts plunged 17.6% in January because 
of inclement weather and the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors were also reluctant to make major moves without seeing today's 
inflation statistics for January, which are expected to give further clues into 
the Federal Reserve Board's next move. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in commodities trading, gold fell on the New York Comex to $383.60 
an ounce, down 20 cents from Tuesday. Silver closed at $5.274 an ounce, up 1.9 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, warmer weather helped drive oil futures lower on the New York Merc. 
Light, sweet crude for March delivery fell 13 cents to $13.93 a barrel.

AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE: A 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL' NIGHT; FOR THOSE ATTENDING 
THIS VALENTINE'S DAY MIXER, FAT IS NOT A FOUR-LETTER WORD. THIN IS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Pamela Lynn, 400 pounds and swathed in purple, works the room: "How're you 
doing tonight? Having fun? Hi, guys!" 
</P>
<P>
 Red and white balloons float above. The deejay's music is loud, the lights 
dim. 
</P>
<P>
 We're at a Valentine's dance at a hotel on the Westside, by definition a place 
where one can't be too rich or too thin, where the pinch test is the true test 
of one's worth. But here, most of the women are big -- very big. Most of the 
men are thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Think "My Funny Valentine," with a "figure less than Greek." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn, a 30-year-old onetime nanny and founder of party sponsor the Big 
Difference, surveys the room. She is pleased. Almost 200 men and women, mostly 
women, have come to her mixer "for big, beautiful people and their admirers." 
</P>
<P>
 No need to beat around the bush here, to search furtively for euphemisms. "Fat 
is what I am," Lynn says. She and others like to say that fat is not a 
four-letter word. Thin is. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lynn knows only too well, it's tough to be fat in L.A. You can be a 
closet drinker, but you sure can't be a closet fat person. She's tried it all 
-- yo-yo dieting, stomach-stapling. Now, she just wants to be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostess Connie Matus, a brunet from Whittier, is getting guests to mix and 
mingle. She says: "I stayed home for seven years with my mother, which is a 
story you'll hear a lot. I was afraid to go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 She introduces her boyfriend, Alan Towar, a slim, bespectacled man in a 
look-at-me print shirt. He lives in Ventura and is in computers. They met at 
one of these dances. "I've always been attracted to big women," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Davey, a customer service rep from Long Beach, explains the thin man 
syndrome: "We call them FAs, fat admirers. Myself, I have a preference for the 
average size male, but I say thank God for the FAs." 
</P>
<P>
 Davey is a pretty 33-year-old with long, wavy, brown hair and 350 pounds on a 
5-foot, 9-inch frame. Her see-through burgundy lace number reveals glimpses of 
black lingerie. She is sitting in an armless chair, she says, because "I can't 
fit in those booths. I drag the tablecloth along with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the National Assn. to Advance Fat Acceptance, she's been trying to 
stamp out discrimination. She's come to believe that she's OK, fat or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Before discovering the Big Difference and another group, More to Love, Davey 
struck out socially. Even a man who seemed attracted to her wouldn't ask her to 
dance for fear of his friends' ribbing. But here, she says, "I feel attractive 
and popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Hers is a story echoed by others. "Everyone expects you to be one (small) 
size," says one. "I refuse to compete with girls who look like Playboy 
bunnies," another says. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the room is Kevin Lacy, 30, of Mar Vista, a college student and bouncer 
at House of Billiards. Since October he has dropped 70 pounds on the Scarsdale 
diet and -- at 6 feet, 2 inches -- weighs in at 320. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Scarsdale, he says, he wouldn't go out socially and face the sneers and 
snickers, the "What's she doing with him ?" looks should he even get a girl to 
dance with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacy likes "women who look like women. Very, very large women, personally I'm 
not physically attracted to, but I prefer women who have a shape." 
</P>
<P>
 The music stops. Time for the lingerie show. Karen Clark, a blaze of red 
sequins, is describing the lace things and leopard things and fringed things 
being modeled by large and lovely ladies. Clark, who runs a home party lingerie 
business, is saying she can fit hips and busts up to 80 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Clark, who describes herself as a "super-size woman," bemoans the 
paucity of sexy unmentionables to fit women like her. Admittedly, she says, 
only 20% of men are turned on by dimpled flesh in come-hither scanties -- "The 
other 80% will be repulsed." 
</P>
<P>
 But, hey, look around. Check out all the thin men. "These men aren't 
perverts," Clark says. "They have a thin woman for cover, but they want to date 
a fat woman on the side." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the women here tonight, she prefers a man "with a waistline under 
40 inches." And, in this cocoonishly comfortable atmosphere, she is no 
wallflower. Once, she says, "I was always the fat girl holding the purses while 
my thin friends danced." 
</P>
<P>
 Surveying the scene is Shasi Kumar, an engineer who lives in Hollywood. A 
slight man, he likes his women big. In India, where he came from, "We were 
taught if somebody's big, they're eating good and having a good life." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat coquettishly, Orrette Biro of Maywood, a size 28, is showing off a 
sparkler on third finger, left hand. She and beau Frank Gorton of Hawthorne, a 
fairly average-sized man with "a bit of a bulge" at the midriff, are 
celebrating the first anniversary of their meeting -- at last year's Valentine 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are meant to be soft," says Joyce Best of Temple City, a big, 
beautiful, brunet construction worker. "These men just take that to an extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy told me, 'If I wanted just the bones, I wouldn't order prime rib.' " 
Returning a Favor -- With Many Thanks 
</P>
<P>
 AU-Haul truck rolled into Venice late last week, bringing more than 3,000 
pounds of food, water and other basics to victims of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Joseph Center, workers unloaded boxes hand-lettered "Frijoles" (beans), 
"Tomate Olido" (canned tomatoes), "Botes de Sopas Cambles" (Campbell's soup). 
</P>
<P>
 The benefactors? Field and cannery workers in Watsonville, a community 
devastated by the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so touching," said Rhonda Meister, executive director of St. Joseph, 
which, with the Westside Food Bank, is distributing the food. "People with very 
little managing to pull together for people who have even less right now." 
</P>
<P>
 It all began last month when Angeleno Suzy Marks went to a reunion of women 
who had visited Central America under auspices of Capacitar, a 
Watsonville-based hands-across-the-border women's empowerment group. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the women, Teresa Padilla, a former strawberry picker who now runs a 
day-care center in Watsonville, was there with her husband, Camarino, a onetime 
picker now working in a processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarino, who emigrated from Mexico 21 years ago, told Marks that his people 
wanted to help people in Los Angeles. He understood the pain; the Padillas lost 
their home in the 1989 quake. Back in Los Angeles, Marks set the wheels in 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Camarino asked his parish priest to spread the word at Sunday Mass 
at St. Patrick's. He was overwhelmed by the response: "People came to the 
church bringing beans, cereal for the kids, potatoes." About 300 people pitched 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 They remembered the help that had come to them from neighboring cities in 
1989. It was time to give back. Some gave money, which paid for a driver to 
bring the U-Haul to Arroyo Grande, where it was handed over to a team from St. 
Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poor give and don't ask, give without limit," said Pat Cane, director of 
Capacitar. Teresa and Camarino Padilla, she added, are "two really beautiful 
people."

PRACTICAL VIEW: A 'WHOLE EARTH CATALOG' FOR TECHIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BOUDREAU, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Its pages were printed on recycled newspaper. Its topical approach arose from 
the alternative lifestyles of the late 1960s. Readers learned about living in 
communes, the Dairy Goat Journal and hydroponic farming. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, eight years after its last update, "The Whole Earth Catalog" is leaving 
its hippie image behind in a remake for the '90s and beyond. Instead of 
studying macrobiotic rice and living in tepees, readers of "The Millennium 
Whole Earth Catalog," to be published in October by HarperCollins San 
Francisco, will tune into contemporary trips. 
</P>
<P>
 The compendium will still contain handy information on raising livestock, but 
the emphasis will be on the high-tech tools of Generation X and the concerns of 
late-century dwellers -- biodiversity, surfing the Internet and relating via 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The frontier has shifted," says Contributing Editor Patrizia DiLucchio, whose 
specialties are the sections on sex, birth and death. "It used to be back to 
the earth and raising your food and goats. But the lands have been mostly 
filled. Now, the new frontier is the intellectual frontier." 
</P>
<P>
 The 400-page soft-cover book will cost $30 and have a first printing of 3 
million copies -- about as many as all the previous editions sold over more 
than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing it's still around after all these years," says Stewart Brand, 
55, who was a member of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters 26 years ago when he 
figured out the world needed "The Whole Earth Catalog." He's since called the 
idea a mistake that worked; he won a National Book Award for the second edition 
in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Brand works out of an old land-bound fishing boat across the courtyard from 
the catalogue editors' headquarters. He is editor emeritus of the new edition 
and is putting the finishing touches on an architectural book, "How Buildings 
Learn." 
</P>
<P>
 The original "was really a counter-counterculture catalogue," Brand says. "By 
late 1968, a lot of people were leaving college to start their own way, create 
communes. There was a lot of romantic ideology that didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was meant to bring back the kind of material practicality and respect for 
new ideas," Brand says. "The catalogue was patterned on L.L. Bean's catalogue 
of outdoor goods and the Diodorus encyclopedia of telling all of civilization's 
secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 The book became part of an emerging culture. "It was perfect and whole," 
recalls Jim Fisher, professor of magazine journalism at the University of 
Missouri, Columbia. "We loved it and we lived with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't buy anything out of it," he says. "You just read it. You learned 
how to grow giant vegetables. If you lived in a serious commune, you had to pay 
attention to 'The Whole Earth Catalog.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first edition in 1968, there have been periodic updates: "The Last 
Whole Earth Catalog" in 1971, an updated "The Last Whole Earth Catalog" in 
1975, "The Next Whole Earth Catalog" in 1980 and "The Essential Whole Earth 
Catalog" in 1986. The contents changed, but each cover was adorned with a 
picture of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first started out, we told people how to grow wheat in a flower pot," 
James Baldwin recalls. The 60-year-old contributing editor is an expert in 
alternative energy and calls himself the "seniorist" editor. "We started out a 
pretty funky operation. Now, we're tightening our ship. We're tapping into new 
sources of information." 
</P>
<P>
 The 35 contributing editors are as eclectic as the new catalogue's topics, 
which range from organizing communities during disasters to drug education and, 
of course, livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin has experience as a land steward for the California Academy of 
Sciences in San Francisco. "And I still hold a white-water guide's license," he 
says. DiLucchio is a public health nurse. The catalogue's librarian is a scuba 
diver and naturalist. The new executive director, John Sumser, once worked as a 
manager in the defense contracting division for Westinghouse Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrasting the new edition with previous ones, Baldwin says, "The focus is 
very different, not in spirit, but in detail." 
</P>
<P>
 Brand has a longtime interest in computers, which is not incongruous with his 
early "Whole Earth" concerns. "Personal computers were a product of the 
counterculture in the '60s. They didn't do much dope because they got high on 
computers. But they were counterculture in every way. Steve Jobs is a flat-out 
hippie," says Brand of the Apple Computer Inc. co-founder who helped launch the 
personal-computer revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Taming Technology" section of the catalogue will include six pages on 
Internet, as well as information on desktop radio broadcasting and electronic 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not technology for its own sake, but (for) finding the best tools," says 
Managing Editor Michael Stone. "Six years ago, we were introducing people to 
high technology. Now, we want them to know how to protect themselves from it. 
How do you keep it from controlling you?" 
</P>
<P>
 As the world becomes more complex, Whole Earthers promise to continue to work 
hard to provide everyone the means to create their own utopias. "This is a 
mission," Baldwin says.

 One of the few sure things in the fickle business of publishing is the 
enduring friendship between National Public Radio and books. 
</P>

 Authors have been known to berate the publicists who failed to land them an 
interview with Terry Gross on NPR's "Fresh Air." A book featured on NPR's "All 
Things Considered" can ride that exposure into another printing or take a giant 
step toward the bestseller list. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, working for NPR can ease the way into print. NPR's Noah Adams of 
"All Things Considered" and floating anchor Susan Stamberg have written books 
about their NPR experiences: Adams' "Saint Croix Notes: River Mornings, Radio 
Nights," in 1991, and Stamberg's "The Wedding Cake in the Middle of the Road: 
23 Variations on a Theme," in 1992, both from W.W. Norton. 
</P>
<P>
 Their fellow anchor Bob Edwards' warm new memoir, "Fridays With Red" (Simon & 
Schuster), recalls his friendship with sports commentator Red Barber, a Friday 
guest on NPR's "Morning Edition" until his death in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Marion Winik. Like other contributing essayists to NPR -- Andre 
Codrescu, Daniel Pinkwater, Bailey White -- Winik has put her quirky world view 
between hardcovers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sample of her take on life, she was telling us about herself at the end 
of NPR's "All Things Considered" on Valentine's Day: "Since the day I could cut 
the shape of a heart from a piece of red construction paper, I fell in love, I 
fell in love, I fell and fell until I hit the bottom of the pit of rejection."  
</P>
<P>
 Winik -- a thirtysomething mother of two who lives in Austin, Tex., and writes 
manuals for a software company -- tells us more about herself in "Telling," 
newly published by Villard Books. She tells it, well, like it is -- and was.  
</P>
<P>
 Subtitled "Confessions, Concessions, and Other Flashes of Light," the 
collection is hilarious, wise, grim and heartbreaking. She recalls a blissfully 
misspent summer on a Jersey Shore boardwalk, a condo rental from hell, the 
stillborn delivery of her first child and more than a few sordid dates with 
serious drugs. A favorite essay: "Women Who Love Men Who Don't Pay Their 
Parking Tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Winik says she had been minding her own business, writing confessional pieces 
for Austin publications, when a regional correspondent for NPR urged her to 
offer a few to the network. NPR bit, and so did the listeners. She says up to 
250 people have written to her in response to each of her radio visits, which 
total 40 or so since she went on the air in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "NPR was the magic thing that happened to me," she says. "I love to read my 
stuff. Performing is a like a second avocation for me, on the radio and in 
readings. That seems to be the way to encounter me. I'm certainly not trying to 
be a private person." 
</P>
<P>
 One impressed listener was literary agent Patricia Van der Leun, who contacted 
Winik and sold the book to Villard. The publishing house is supporting its 
10,000-copy printing, ambitious for a first collection of essays, by putting 
the author on a reading tour.  
</P>
<P>
 This is standard enough for a newly launched writer, but a requisite step here 
considering Winik's link to her audience is as much aural as cerebral. Winik 
will read at 7 p.m. March 9 at Dutton's Brentwood bookstore. On Tuesday, she 
sits down with Bryant Gumbel on the "Today" show, a major invitation for a 
newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's certainly a huge market for NPR essayists that we recognize as 
publishers," says Katy Barrett, director of publicity at Vintage Books, which 
paid Winik a reported $75,000 to publish a trade-paperback edition of "Telling" 
that will come out next year. (Vintage also plans to reissue Bailey White's 
bestseller, "Mama Makes Up Her Mind," in time for Mother's Day in May.) 
</P>
<P>
 Those who cozy up to a voice on the radio can feel they know the speaker -- 
but still want to know more. The familiarity may prompt the book purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the most successful books by radio personalities bring their radio 
voices to the printed page in such a seamless manner that we can hear them as 
we read them. Witness Garrison Keillor's "Lake Wobegon Days"; Bailey's book, 
which gives her small world in Georgia universal appeal, and mega-selling 
titles by Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh.

 On the Racks: The logo of Mademoiselle has been realigned on the March issue 
by new Editor-in-Chief Elizabeth Crow, the clearest sign among many that she 
intends a more traditional approach than did her ousted predecessor, Gabe 
Doppelt. The new look of the young woman's magazine is designed to emphasize 
coverage of fashion, beauty and relationships. . . . Folio: The Magazine for 
Magazine Management will point out in its March 1 issue that National Review's 
recent "exclusive" about the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against 
the software colossus Microsoft had been published nearly word for word in the 
December issue of the Washingtonian. But the piece by Business Week 
correspondent Mark Lewyn had different endings: The conservative National

Washingtonian heralded the possibility of a "landmark" antitrust ruling. . . .

BOOK REVIEW / FAMILY MEMOIR; DAUGHTER TELLS THE TRUTH ABOUT A FATHER WHO LIED; 
ANONYMITY: THE SECRET LIFE OF AN AMERICAN FAMILY BY SUSAN BERGMAN ; FARRAR, 
STRAUS AND GIROUX, $20, 198 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL DORRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Heche died of AIDS in 1983, survived by a widow, a son who died in a car 
accident within the year, and three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 His family believed him to be simply a charming loser; a handsome, 
smooth-talking con man always one step away from striking it rich in one 
bizarre scheme or another; a church-going, piano-playing boaster -- exciting, 
unpredictable and romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he had been actively bisexual for years and was a man aswirl in 
contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my father's openhanded praise of me as a girl," poet Susan Bergman 
confides, ". . . fused with his majestic expectations, as though my life were 
invaluable and urgent, that informed my sense of place in the world. Sometimes 
he gave me the sense that what I said provided him a new opportunity to see the 
world from a different, but eminently reasonable, point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 10 years after her father's excruciating, lonely death, Bergman has 
written a dark and complicated meditation on the ripple effects of hypocrisy 
masquerading as discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 With alternating currents of anger, confusion and melancholy, she recounts her 
journey of coming to terms, of being "a tourist of her father's secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 She rejects her "plumbless gullibility" and dares a shocking candor, shining a 
bright and shadowless light, first on her parents, then on each of her siblings 
and, finally, most achingly on herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father's daughter, she too seems to have been caught up in a swamp of 
interpersonal deception from which she, at last her own woman, is determined to 
extricate herself through the exercise of truth-telling. 
</P>
<P>
 Composed in a language both oblique and lyrical, "Anonymity" is a book one 
seems to overhear as much as read. But what comes across to a listener outside 
the tight inner circle of directly involved parties is intensely emotional and 
frequently brilliant.  
</P>
<P>
 Her thoughts are like a raft shooting the rapids, shifting and alternating for 
balance as she encounters each rock of a new idea or perspective: fury, 
sympathy, objectivity, outrage, tenderness, despair, hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, the character who emerges with the greatest clarity is Don Heche 
himself. Despite all his lies, despite all the pain he inflicted, he seems in 
retrospect as much victim as victimizer. "The tangle of faith and sex and music 
in my father's life," Bergman observes, "unraveled back and back until his 
early experiences appeared as single threads in the tight knot of his adult 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 A bright, passionate man positioned by circumstance and convention in the 
wrong life, Don Heche juggled his internal conflicts with maniacal 
determination. The only possible explanation for his remaining with his wife 
and children is a kind of will toward love, a skewed but genuine devotion 
overwhelming in its persistence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even through the lens of his adult daughter's righteous ire -- "The homosexual 
father lives as though his were the only life" -- we get a picture of a man 
both culpably weak and admirably brave, a lonely, desperate scrambler devoted 
to his children even while barred from respectability by the force of his 
desire. 
</P>
<P>
 Without forgiving her father his egregious failings, Susan Bergman allows us 
at least a glimpse of understanding, a recognition of a not-bad man who found 
himself doing bad to those he most loved, a man who deceived but in the end 
could not absolve himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought it would be over with his death," Bergman says, "the whole story. 
He did not account of Nathan's loss and Anne's ingrained mistrust that a man 
could ever prefer her to another man. He didn't play out his widow's long 
nights. I had meant to grab him and shake him. But how stooped he looked. Did I 
really think I could impress our hurts on him more deeply than his 
self-recrimination had? Did I think he's lost his life for nothing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman, her mother and her sisters have struggled with this legacy in their 
personal lives, sometimes wandering in shock, sometimes pretending that nothing 
was wrong, sometimes seeking oblivion or escape from the disappointment of 
their imagined domestic life together. Only the truth, she seems to have 
concluded, will set them free, and she spares no one, including herself, her 
unblinking consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Such unapologetic frankness can make a reader uneasy -- identifying perhaps 
with those people written about but who have no first-person voice in the 
narrative -- but it also vaults "Anonymity" into startling, mesmerizing 
literary territory. Whole passages seem lifted intact from the most private of 
diaries, yet somehow the book as a whole -- by pushing every supposed limit of 
probity -- achieves a universal wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the family is where we first learn about ourselves and others," Bergman 
writes, "it is also often the cradle of misidentity and isolation. Our false 
fronts, the insincere roles we adopt to survive, the ways the 'victims' of loss 
endure and recover, combined with our interpretations (affecting both the 
images that appear to us and how we ourselves are perceived), the early 
influences that give shape to sexuality -- these are the shards that each of us 
sorts and reassembles and, finally, must pour our lives from." 
</P>
<P>
 If the sad, sobering but ultimately affirmative conclusion of Bergman's quest 
for honesty is any indication, her own children will have much for which to be 
grateful.

ON VIEW / MARY LOU LOPER: FROCKS AND FRILLS AT EVERY TURN

<P>
 It's sad the way some traditions fall apart and vanish. But not The Bachelors 
Ball, with a capital T. Nonagenarian next year, the organization staged a 
grandiose "From Russia With Love, a Night in the Winter Palace" in the Beverly 
Hilton Hotel on Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of nearly 600 came frocked in fancy dress, danced with abandon and 
generally overindulged as only the young can. It's something the group has done 
each year for 89 years since a small group of single men collaborated to host a 
party to return social invitations. This was before men cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Mind you, the ball is not a simple costume party. It's fancy -- as in 
Renaissance, swarthy riverboat gambler, Elvis in sequins, King Ferdinand, Queen 
Isabella. Bo Peep and her lost sheep were there -- Megan McKenney and Drew 
Planting -- he kept dropping his fleece (and picking it up) on the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests entered to the Russian anthem, viewed chandeliers brought in for the 
party, supped on borscht and were served mandarin orange parfait with vodka 
sauce by waiters parading to Tchaikovsky's "Waltz of the Flowers." All before 
the Russian dancers performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball chairman Steve Leland as Czar Nicholas, escorting Madalyn Seyer, as 
Alexandra, seemed quietly jubilant.  
</P>
<P>
 "The ball is better than ever," said Robert Carpenter (a mandarin Imperial), 
escorting his wife, Janice (Pocahontas), a ball patroness. He was Bachelors 
president 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Said 1964 ball chairman Tom Kranz, whose wife, Travis, also was invited to be 
a patroness: "It's like Mardi Gras." Kranz noted that the ball was elegant in 
the '50s and '60s, turned minimalist in the '70s and has returned to its old 
grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 The most au courant costumes were a jailbird "Jeff Gillooly" in stripes 
escorting "Nancy Kerrigan" in bandage -- Scott Brittingham and his fiancee, 
Ella McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
 There was power in numbers: Bachelor Michael Flynn brought his table of 
guests, including date Janna Steele, in "Out of Africa" safari outfits. He had 
rented his hat in Queens and his jacket in Soho, before escaping the New York 
blizzard for the party. Hugh Hinton Evans III brought a table of friends -- 
wild in pink bridesmaids dresses. Bachelor Boyd Smith's table was a colorful 
mass of Mardi Gras jesters -- Karen Sundry, Carole Klove and Bro Morris 
included -- with floral plumes and poppers and balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the ball, King Ferdinand/Bachelors President Arthur Hamilton Rasmussen 
Jr., senior associate for CB Commercial, presented white floral bouquets to 
patronesses including Ann Barrett (with husband, Olin, a former Bachelors 
president), Penne (with Bill) Durst and Kacey (with Peter) McCoy at a pre-party 
in a suite at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent during the evening: Bachelors secretary Robert M.L. Baker III, a 
riverboat gambler, with saloon girl Tammy Karpenko; George Hotaling III and his 
fiancee, Bernadette Hartfield; pirates Tony Manos and Sheryl Rados; 
Venetian-masked Bob Forward; royals Tom Blumenthal and Kerry Harker; bee and 
sunflower, Ken Funsten and Stephanie DeQuis; sheriff David Ludwick and Indian 
maiden Julia Coppersmith; Aladdin Mark Kelsey with Joanne Clark; an Alice in 
Wonderland Lucy Hartford with Mad Hatter Derek Bell, and a Swiss pair, Sheryl 
Hadley and Geoff Lands. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2 a.m., the party broke for French onion soup and chocolate chip cookies 
and milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the Bachelors -- Brad Farwell, Al Jarrin and Derek Bell -- couldn't 
get enough. They were catching an early morning flight to New Orleans for Mardi 
Gras.

 Weeping Women: The expressive tortured faces in the exhibition "Picasso and 
the Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar" premiering 
at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, captured the creative attention of 
nearly 1,000 first nighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Said museum curator Stephanie Barron: "This show is a terrific boost" -- 
especially, she pointed out, following on the heels of the recent good news 
that the museum would receive long-term financial support from Los Angeles 
County and the news of the acquisition of the May Company parking lot adjacent 
to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition, which next goes to New York's Metropolitan and the Art 
Institute of Chicago, is made possible by PaineWebber. Said PaineWebber's Mike 
Davis: "The arts provoke creative thinking, which is fundamental to our lives 
and to the way we do business." PaineWebber Chairman and prominent art devotee 
Donald Marron of New York wasn't able to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 William Mingst, who will soon become the L.A. museum's new chairman, 
substituted for chairman Rob Maguire. Mingst said: "Los Angeles County Museum 
finds itself poised to step into the next century as a leading art center." 
</P>
<P>
 Show curator Judi Freeman captured the attention of art-goers in one gallery 
as she analyzed, "Change the word from Sarajevo to Guernica, and essentially 
the same series of events took place." But, she said, there is hope, "because 
show the image -- the victims -- and people will take action." 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent collectors attending included JoAnn and Julian Ganz, Betty Asher, 
Max Palevsky and Marion Smooke.

 Psychiatric Advice: Charles Schulz said, "I love Charlie Brown -- I would have 
liked him as a neighbor." And the Colleagues loved creator-cartoonist Schulz -- 
and Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, et al -- this week at a love-in/Valentine's Day 
luncheon. Good grief! More than five-cents worth of psychiatric advice was 
absorbed by 600 women as Schulz complimented Colleagues (headed by Ann Petroni) 
on their longtime efforts for abused children. Neiman Marcus provided the 
stunning Valentino show of chiffon, lace, oversized straw hats, double ruffled 
skirts, fringe and marcelled hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy with results were luncheon co-chairs Anne Johnson and Betsy 
Bloomingdale. Barbara Davis and Mary Milner, both back from Nancy Davis' $1.5 
million-net Race for MS benefit in Aspen, pronounced the show romantic.

 Ah! Chanel: With the black Coromandel screens and the beige sofas reminiscent 
of her Paris apartment, the late Coco Chanel was almost with the intimate group 
of 70 or so women who clustered around tables set with pale tulips on pink 
damask. 
</P>
<P>
 At the gathering last week in the Parisian Rooftop Salon of the new Chanel 
Boutique in Beverly Hills, guests viewed the spring/summer Karl Lagerfeld 
Chanel collection, whispering about the youthful short and bare look. Barbara 
Cirkva, senior vice president of Chanel in New York, joined Arlette Thebault, 
Chanel executive here.

 Coming on NBC: NBC on Wednesday announced a slate of new programming, 
including an hourlong drama, "Winnetka Road," which premieres March 12 at 10 
p.m. The series focuses on the relationships among an ensemble cast -- 
including Ed Begley Jr., Meg Tilly, Josh Brolin, Paige Turco and Megan Ward -- 
whose roots are predominantly in the "townies," the subculture of working 
people in a wealthy Midwestern suburb. The program temporarily displaces 
"Sisters," which is scheduled to return April 23. "Winnetka Road" is 
co-executive produced by Aaron Spelling, who will be honored March 19 with a 
Media Award from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation/Los Angeles for 
his inclusion of gay characters and themes in such programs as "Dynasty" and 
"Melrose Place." . . . In April, the network will air "Then There Were Giants," 
a four-hour miniseries depicting the relationship among the Allied leaders 
during World War II. John Lithgow stars as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Bob 
Hoskins plays Winston Churchill and Michael Caine tackles the role of Josef 
Stalin. . . . The network has given a seven-episode order to "Roger and Me" 
director Michael Moore's one-hour comedic news magazine "TV Nation" for 
broadcast later this year. . . . And a one-hour special, "Shattered Glory: The 
Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan Story," featuring interviews with both 
skaters, airs this Sunday at 7 p.m. MOVIES

 Spielberg Watch: Steven Spielberg, speaking in Vienna Wednesday at the 
European continental premiere of "Schindler's List," ended speculation as to 
how he would follow a year that has brought him not only the year's most 
critically acclaimed film with "Schindler's List's" 12 Oscar nominations, but 
also the biggest box-office success of all time with "Jurassic Park." "I'm 
taking a year off or more to be with my family . . . I don't want to follow it 
with something I don't have my heart into," Spielberg said, noting that the 
break would be his first in 20 years of filmmaking.

 Spielberg, Part II: Spielberg's success this year apparently doesn't much have 
pull in Sweden, where the national Censorship Board has prohibited viewing of 
"Schindler's List" for Swedes under 15. The board ruled that the 
Holocaust-themed film could cause "psychological damage" in kids because it 
"features a large amount of scenes with gross violence (including) close-ups of 
executions, threats, horror and degradation of people."

 Sheen's Activism: Actor Martin Sheen was among 20 anti-war activists who 
disrupted the federal court trial of veteran peace activist Philip Berrigan in 
North Carolina on Tuesday by turning their backs to the judge, reciting the 
Lord's Prayer and singing "We Shall Overcome." Berrigan and three others are 
charged with pouring blood over and hammering on an Air Force jet. Sheen, 53, 
left when the judge, who later declared a mistrial, threatened to hold the 
demonstrators in contempt. POP/ROCK

 Braxton Takes No. 1: Boosted by her high-profile success last week with double 
wins on the American Music Awards and a guest stint on TV's "Roc," soul diva 
Toni Braxton's self-titled album jumped to the top of the nation's pop chart, 
selling more than 104,000 copies last week. That's a 22% sales leap over the 
previous week for Braxton, whose album has sold more than 2 million copies 
since its release eight months ago. Whitney Houston's sweep at the televised 
awards broadcast also helped push sales of her "Bodyguard" soundtrack album to 
76,000 copies -- nearly double the previous week's sales -- moving it up to No. 
11 on the chart. QUICK TAKES

CLUB REVIEW; ALPHABET THE DEEJAY MAKES A TASTY MARTINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

 After just three weeks, Martini -- the new name for the recently revamped 
T-Room on Melrose Avenue -- is on its way to becoming L.A.'s nightclub of 
choice. Since these trend decisions are made with dizzying speed, the time to 
check out the upscale venue is now, before the lines outside become too grim. 
</P>
<P>
 The '50s-style Pan-Am lounge look and red-paneled walls that defined the 
T-Room are gone. Martini's decor is more subtle, but a close look at the 
whitewashed walls -- with vinyl albums embedded in them -- hints at the club's 
main attraction: its music. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of L.A.'s best deejays are already spinning at Martini, the most 
memorable set currently occurs on Tuesdays, when the deejay known as Alphabet 
starts off his eclectic set with jazz records such as Bob James' "Nautilus," 
taking listeners on an aural tour of the be-bop and cool-jazz records that 
provide so much of the sampled music in rap. 
</P>
<P>
 He then begins a fusion of old school and new school hip-hop, playing such 
songs as Gang Starr's new "Mass Appeal" back to back with Funkadelic's "Knee 
Deep." Maintaining a primarily East Coast flavor, he then highlights Boogie 
Down Productions' "South Bronx" and a Tribe Called Quest's "Electric 
Relaxation" before throwing in one of dancehall's hottest songs, Mega Banton's 
"Sound Boy Killing." 
</P>
<P>
 A word of caution for early risers: Alphabet's skillful, not-by-the-book 
approach to deejaying makes it difficult to exit the dance floor before closing 
time.

MOVIE REVIEW; A WARM LOOK AT A COUNTERCULTURE GURU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allen Ginsberg is a great camera subject, but he's mostly been a subject in 
documentaries about other people, like Jack Kerouac or William Burroughs. "The 
Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg," directed by Jerry Aronson, redresses the 
balance. It's a deeply affectionate portrait of the poet-guru, and the 
affection seems appropriate to Ginsberg's becalmed, hypersensitive presence. 
The paradox of Ginsberg's life, as the movie (at the Nuart) demonstrates, is 
how someone so gentle could still be a major countercultural force. 
</P>
<P>
 The gentility of the '60s countercultural warriors was often a pose -- those 
flower-power types had stems of steel -- but with Ginsberg the peace gestures 
and Buddhist chanting didn't seem faked. Aronson had access to Ginsberg's home 
movies and family photos from adolescence, and one can see the same languid, 
beseeching quality in the young wiry, bespectacled Ginsberg as in the Beat 
visionary and the later, bearded, love-beaded '60s guru. 
</P>
<P>
 The connection to all of these selves lies in Ginsberg's poetry, and it's to 
Aronson's credit that he keeps the poetry front and center. We hear Ginsberg 
reading from "Howl," perhaps the most famous of postwar American poems, and 
"Kaddish," which was Ginsberg's attempt to reclaim the shock of his mother's 
anguish and lay it to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother spent her later years in a sanitarium. As a child, Ginsberg, 
according to his stepmother, "saw more than any little boy should." By his own 
admission, the pain of watching his mother's breakdown preempted the pains that 
followed: Nothing could quite shatter him in the same way, and perhaps this 
helps to explain the unflappable, pacific way he rose up against the 
baton-wielding police during the 1968 Democratic Convention. Despite Ginsberg's 
aestheticism, his confrontations with conservative orthodoxy were always based 
on political principles. If he's a visionary, he's a practical-minded one. He's 
a political activist for the spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronson spent 10 years putting together the footage for the film. Even though 
it's only 83 minutes, it has an epic scope because Ginsberg's life seems to 
take in the most highly charged history of the past 50 years. His progression 
from scrawny Columbia University student to Beat to hippie to Buddhist to Grand 
Old Man is a great American story. His homosexuality links him to a 
Whitmanesque tradition that he revels in. (This is one of the few current films 
where homosexual love is discussed without sniggering or special pleading.) 
</P>
<P>
 Is it also a bit too hero-worshippy toward Ginsberg? Perhaps, but the 
worshipfulness doesn't seem out of place. Aronson recognizes that Ginsberg 
can't be approached as a film subject in half-measures. When we see Ginsberg 
being interviewed by William Buckley in a '60s "Firing Line" show, the high 
comedy of the pairing gives way to something inexplicably touching. Buckley, 
eyebrow raised, lip curled, asks Ginsberg if "hippies are the new order," and 
the poet replies by intoning one of his poems. As the words roll out, the 
sensual imagery takes hold and even Buckley seems entranced. Now that's the 
power of art.

THEATER REVIEW; 'TO CULEBRA': COLONY'S PLAY CAN'T BRIDGE EXPANSIVE GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ferdinand de Lesseps believed he could slice through isthmuses and unite 
oceans. He did it at Suez. Why not in Panama? 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the L.A. earthquake, De Lesseps' hubris seems especially 
audacious. It apparently seemed stage-worthy, too, to playwright Jonathan Bolt. 
</P>
<P>
 His "To Culebra" dramatizes De Lesseps' attempt to cross Panama with a 
sea-level canal in the 1880s. He refused to build locks; he thought they would 
become obsolete with advances in shipping. Instead, he simply planned to level 
all obstacles in his path. 
</P>
<P>
 He failed -- miserably. In the process, thousands died from tropical diseases, 
investors' savings were lost, a government fell. Yes, there was even an 
earthquake. Charles de Lesseps, Ferdinand's son and partner, was finally jailed 
for his role in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fascinating material, but Bolt's play doesn't do it justice. Framed as a 
flashback from the trials at the end of the saga, most of the scenes depict 
people arguing with one another in French drawing rooms. Maps roll down from 
above to show us the geography of Panama, but there is very little sense of 
actually being there, even when a scene is set there. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is better suited for a book (David McCullough's celebrated "The Path 
Between the Seas" is the most obvious), where the writer can go into greater 
detail, or on the screen, where we could glimpse the big picture. Here it's at 
the 99-seat Colony. 
</P>
<P>
 A playwright might have compensated for some of these shortcomings by 
presenting a satirical edge or some other personal perspective on the events. 
But Bolt's attitude is fairly fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
 William Dennis Hunt captures De Lesseps' fire and force (though not quite all 
of his words), but the role is too incessantly noisy to sustain maximum impact 
throughout. Todd Nielsen is superb as the son who's always in his father's 
shadow. Tom Shea and Chris Van Vleet register briefly as young, ambitious 
assistants in De Lesseps' boondoggle. The other actors are limited to stock 
characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Michael David Wadler has been unable to transform this series of 
animated museum dioramas into anything more dynamic.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CONFUSING OVERLOAD IN MACHINES SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Machines of Loving Grace is part of industrial rock's second generation, 
fusing the stark, mechanical genre with the live instrumentation of rock 'n' 
roll. But the Tucson quintet has gone overboard, smothering the traditionally 
stripped-down style with the kind of mainstream rock decadence that it was 
originally a reaction against. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Whisky on Tuesday, singer Scott Benzel ripped out guttural screams and 
paced the stage maniacally, but his efforts failed to steer the band out of the 
confusing mass of noise they buried themselves under. 
</P>
<P>
 The Machines used too much of everything -- too much poppish keyboards, too 
much evil affectation in the vocals, too much plucking, funky bass. The result 
was a confusing overload of insubstantial pop music and directionless noise. 
Recorded samples and beats mingled with the double drums, further corrupting 
the simplicity needed to drive strong industrial or electronic rock hybrids. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-billed Course of Empire started off cold and jerky, but the Dallas 
quintet soon warmed its dark, intense sound into an enticing, if abrasive, 
blend. The hypnotic tribal beat from two drummers and the gentle interludes of 
spacey guitar added dynamics to the density. Though singer Vaughn Stevenson had 
problems matching the intensity of the music with his scratchy vocals, Course 
of Empire's primal, organic approach is clearly full of potential. LORRAINE ALI

ART REVIEW; THERESE OULTON'S PAINTINGS ARE ECHOES FROM THE VOID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Therese Oulton's paintings are relentlessly physical. Yet, many critics 
regularly read them through all manner of allegorical, psychological and/or 
theoretical scrims.Their dense, enfolded surfaces conjure knitting, needlework 
or pleating; on this is hinged a feminist interpretation, wherein Oulton 
rescues painting from its long history of masculine domination. 
</P>
<P>
 The surfaces also recall biological and crystalline structures of cells 
dividing and multiplying, or crenelated heaps of phosphorescent minerals. Thus, 
the paintings are said to style a universe in microcosm, driven by an 
unknowable, internal logic. 
</P>
<P>
 However, succumbing to metaphor's siren-call, her paintings at L.A. Louver 
Gallery can also be seen as a well-crafted essay on art as sublimation: a 
choked thicket of obsessively repetitive marks, deliberately paced to allow for 
no pause, no air, no room. Massive and beautiful, they are not wild. 
</P>
<P>
 They eschew the romantic fantasy of the sublime, with its threat of the 
unknown, echoes from the void and promise of eternity. Every stroke is a trace 
of energy, a unit of matter and a moment in time. Every passage trembles, 
animated by a desperation that is at once alien and uncomfortably familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 In another sense, Oulton's new work feels more familiar than ever. In her 
efforts to engage with the history of abstraction, she has adopted some of the 
signature tics of the New York School, such as Jackson Pollock's all-over 
composition, Barnett Newman's vertical "zips" and Clyfford Still's jagged 
crevasses of raw color. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these quotations, however mutated, feel mannered and self-consciously 
aesthetic. They detract from Oulton's agenda by burdening it with a set of 
pretensions, which throw off its otherwise minutely calibrated balance. * L.A. 
Louver, 55 N. Venice Blvd., Venice, (310) 822-4955, through March 12. Closed

DANCE REVIEW; ACROBATS SHOWCASE ESSENTIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two troupes of Chinese acrobats representing opposite ends of the political 
spectrum are touring the Southland this week. One is from the Mainland, and one 
is from the Republic of Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taiwanese group, the Chinese Golden Dragon Acrobats, appeared Tuesday at 
the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, and almost any act on their 
program could be sampled to find the essential ingredients that make this 
art-form appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 But consider one of the less flashier ones, called "Water Meteors," in which 
small saucers filled with water are suspended at the ends of a rope that is 
spun, tossed into the air and caught again, without a drop being spilled. Well, 
almost without losing a drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the tension, the risk, the grace, the simplicity of means and the 
emotional uplift resulting from defying forces everyone in the audience 
understands and feels bound by, that is common to almost all of the different 
segments, which here show few innovations. Not that that is really a liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the sense of risk is proportionately -- breathtakingly -- higher in the 
sequence in which blindfolded men dive through hoops lined with knives and 
fire. Or when Feng-Hsian Liu bends in half an iron rod leveled at his Adam's 
apple by hurling his body forward against it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the viewer's anxiety level, too, rose a few degrees higher than 
usual in the Pagoda of Chairs because this year, the acrobat who ascended the 
perilous structure (Bin-Chung Poon) did not make use of a safety wire. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on grace, correspondingly, took primary place in the women's 
Ribbon Dance or in any of the many choreographed poses that began and ended 
their appearances, even as assistants to other acrobats. 
</P>
<P>
 But usually there is a mix of all ingredients in varying proportions and 
emphasis, as acrobats manipulate or juggle tea cups, plates, large jars, a 
table or a kind of yo-yo with their feet or heads or even on the backs of their 
necks.

NEWS BITES: THE CADILLAC OF CRIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 New Jersey businessman Arnold Hansen-Sturm was sentenced to 18 months in 
prison Feb. 11, and fined $4,175 plus the costs of his imprisonment, for 
conspiring to buy and sell illicit caviar. His company, Hansen Caviar Co., was 
fined an additional $10,625.  
</P>
<P>
 Washington law limits the amount of caviar that may be taken from the state's 
sturgeon, but Hansen Caviar bought an amount equalling the entire legal take 
(and worth about $2.5 million at retail) from unlicensed Washington fisherman 
Stephen Gale Darnell between 1985 and 1990. Last October Darnell confessed that 
the caviar had been taken illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Zilly rejected Hansen's claim that he didn't 
suspect the caviar might be illegal even though he paid Darnell in cash sent to 
a series of post office boxes. Hansen listed the Washington caviar on his books 
as imported in order to conceal the source, but much of it was actually sold as 
domestic. "What makes this unusual," says National Marine Fisheries Service 
Special Agent Andy Cohen, "is that the usual scam is to pass off osetra (a 
cheaper grade of Russian caviar) as beluga, or sell domestic as imported. 
Illegal harvesting has been rare." 
</P>
<P>
 The scheme was discovered when the manager of a motel in Vancouver, Wash., 
became suspicious of Darnell, who was renting by the month -- paying cash and 
requesting no room service. To her surprise, she found he was processing 
caviar. Special Agent Cohen became involved because it's a federal crime to 
traffic in fish taken in violation of state laws. The Brown Decades

 Gregory Usher, the American-born director of the prestigious Ritz-Escoffier 
cooking school in Paris, died Friday in Paris as a result of complications due 
to AIDS. Usher, who was 43, had guided the school, considered one of the top 
three in France, since the late '80s. In 1989, the French government awarded 
him the Merite Agricole medal, honoring outstanding contributions to French 
gastronomy. CHARLES PERRY

</P>
<P>
 Chateau Latour doesn't have a purple label, it has a white one.A 
purple-labeled bottle of Latour may have been damaged by the liquid from other 
bottles broken in the Jan. 17 earthquake. The label may not be what it should 
be, but the wine inside is probably sound.  
</P>
<P>
 A number of wine shops have such bottles. Some sat in a pool of wine for hours 
and actually lost their labels, or portions of them, and retailers may offer 
them at special prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine Warehouse, Los Angeles-based wholesaler, worried about what you'd think 
if you saw a purple label on Latour, or if you saw a new fresh label pasted 
over the old soiled one. So it has printed up a series of humorous stickers for 
wines so damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the five stickers, though, may actually tempt some wine shop owners to 
charge more for stained wine than for unstained. The sticker says "Quake 
Souvenir." DAN BERGER

 DEAR SOS: Some time ago, a reader, Zelma, asked for a zucchini frittata recipe 
and you replied with a zucchini patty recipe. I believe this is the recipe 
she's looking for. I've had it for years and it's a family favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. G. W. 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR MRS. G. W.: You are so kind. We have several recipes, but yours looks 
easy and sounds good. We added two more eggs to your recipe for a more eggy 
frittata.

 2 tablespoons minced green pepper, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 4 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup shredded American cheese

 DEAR SOS: I belong to a gourmet group that meets once a month. Plans for 1994 
have been completed and I am assigned a French meal for February. I already 
know that I want to start with a French pistou soup. I've checked cookbooks but

 DEAR LINDA: We turned to Volume 1 of Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of 
French Cooking" (Knopf: 1961) and found the recipe for this wonderfully 
satisfying French Provencale vegetable soup. The word pistou , Child explains, 
means a sauce of garlic, basil, tomato and cheese, but the soup always contains 
potatoes, carrots, leeks, dried beans and a handful of pasta enriched with 
seasonal vegetables.

AREPAS; LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD CORN CAKES

<P>
 I smell the corn before I even get out of bed. And on that first Sunday 
morning of my yearly pilgrimage back home to Colombia, I start my quest for the 
perfect arepa.  
</P>
<P>
 A great one is waiting for me when I go downstairs to the breakfast table -- a 
beautiful white corn cake, hot from the grill and, to judge by its girth, 
loaded with cheese. I'm a slave to lean California cuisine, but I don't 
hesitate to slather my arepa with butter, then salt it generously before taking 
my first bite. The crust is crunchy, the inside is creamy, and the cheese 
stretches out for miles.  
</P>
<P>
 "Perfect!" I tell my mother. "Why is it that arepas in L. A. don't taste like 
this?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Because these are your grandmother Julia's," my mother reminds me. "She's the 
only one who uses mozzarella cheese to make arepas ." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course. Arepas can change dramatically according to the hand that shapes 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably the most basic and universal of all Colombian foods, arepas are like 
a cross between American pancakes and biscuits, made entirely from ground dry 
or fresh corn, ranging in shape from something as thin as a tortilla to 
pancakes half an inch thick to little doughnut-shaped dollops. They can be made 
with or without cheese, butter or salt, according to personal taste and the 
food they will accompany. They are at their absolute best when grilled over 
charcoal, although cooking them on a griddle or even baking them will do almost 
as nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A repas can be found in every region of Colombia. They are, after all, the 
equivalent of bread, much like their northern cousin, the Mexican corn 
tortilla, or the more faraway Indian chapati.  
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian arepa originated in Antioquia, the mountainous coffee-growing 
area in the center of the country whose capital is Medellin. According to 
popular lore, the people of Antioquia (pronounced ahn-tee-OH-kee-ah), better 
known as antioquenos or paisas , would tear the forests down (a dubious 
tendency they are still known for) and plant their first crop: corn. And being 
an inventive group of people, they came up with a basic food, destined to 
accompany all other foods, which they could make from fresh or dry corn and 
thus eat all year round. 
</P>
<P>
 Arepas are now found in every household in Colombia and Venezuela (they used 
to be a single country, after all), and every cook claims to make the tastiest 
of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best arepa I've ever had?" says Fidel Gonzales, the driver who has been 
lugging me around my hometown, Cali. "I gotta tell you, they were the ones my 
mother made when I was a boy. We had them every day, and I was in charge of 
hulling the corn." 
</P>
<P>
 "No kidding?" I say, impressed. Hulling the corn kernels by hand, a process 
known as pilar , is tough work. With the advent of hulling machines, 
hand-hulling is hardly ever done anymore, except in remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional way of hulling starts with soaking dry corn kernels with water 
overnight. Then they are placed in a pilon , a partially hollowed-out log. A 
bit of water is added to ease the job, and the corn is beaten with a wooden 
club until the starchy interior of the kernels separates completely from the 
hulls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The object is to clean the corn, to leave it white," Gonzales explains. "Then 
we would boil the corn to soften it. It has to be soft enough that you can 
squish it with your fingers. And only then do you grind it." 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting dough, the corn masa , is then kneaded by hand, and this is when 
you add the cheese, if you want. The best kind available in Los Angeles is a 
hard white Mexican cheese such as ranchero or panela.  
</P>
<P>
 "Once we mixed in the cheese," Gonzales continues, "we would mold the arepa by 
hand, according to what we wanted that day -- a flat arepa , a round one, 
whatever. And we would cook them over the embers in the wood stove and there 
was nothing like it." He sighs. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother still makes arepas every day, but the corn isn't hulled at home any 
more. "Who would do it, now that I'm gone?" he points out. "Now she buys hulled 
corn and grills the arepas over an electric stove. But honest to God, they're 
still the best ones. Not even my wife makes them like that." 
</P>
<P>
 My friend Alvaro Gardner, a journalist from Antioquia who used to teach a 
university class in Colombian folklore, brightens up at the prospect of talking 
arepas.  
</P>
<P>
 "They used the pilon in my grandparents' house," he tells me. "You know, it's 
a horrible job. The hull is called the afrecho , and there's a saying in 
Antioquia, pilar por el afrecho , 'to peel for the hull,' which means to work 
very hard for very little." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, the remaining afrecho was sold by the pound and strained for 
mazamorra , a potent drink made from fermented corn. And if the corn is 
fermented a little bit more, you have the right consistency for a special kind 
of Colombian tamale masa.  
</P>
<P>
 There are many kinds of arepas , depending on whom you talk to, but Gardner 
has narrowed them down to half a dozen. First you have your basic arepa , a bit 
smaller in diameter than a corn tortilla, and usually half an inch to an inch 
thick, depending on whether it has cheese or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the larger flat arepa . "It's so thin it's called de tela , 
('the sheet'), " Gardner says. "I like mine very toasted, then I cover it with 
butter and fold it before eating it," he adds. "I have them for breakfast and 
for the algo , the snack." 
</P>
<P>
 There are also the small round arepas , made without any salt, butter or 
cheese and eaten with main dishes such as beans, steaks and chorizos. "My least 
favorite," I comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, it depends what you eat them with," Gardner replies. "You know, they say 
God's only mistake was to put a big seed inside avocados instead of stuffing 
them with arepas ." 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite: arepas de mote , which are thicker, made from unhulled dried 
corn and cooked in a covered pan under the charcoal embers ( rescoldo ). 
"Wonderful," he says. "But I have to go to Medellin to eat those." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the egg arepa from the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, which is 
stuffed with a raw egg and then fried for the exact amount of time it takes the 
egg to cook inside the dough. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, there are arepas de choclo , made from ripe corn on the cob, 
the kernels ground fresh and unhulled. 
</P>
<P>
 The best ones in Cali, my friends assure me, are made in a little joint in the 
sexta -- Sixth Street, the hippest street in the city. It's called Arepas de 
Choclo el Hornito (The Little Oven Choclo Arepas), and its only distinctive 
feature is a big wood-burning oven that faces the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother and I look skeptically at the two jeans-clad teen-agers in the shop, 
Alvaro Rubio and Carlos Naranjo. But they say they are the ones who make the 
arepas and they would be glad to show us how they do it, right there in the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The "kitchen" is a tiny room, slightly bigger than a broom closet, inside the 
garage. A huge wicker basket full of fresh corn cobs sits by the door, amid a 
dozen oil stains, resting against an old truck. Flies buzz over the corn and 
inside the kitchen as Alvaro dons a dirty apron, sits down on a stool next to 
the basket and proceeds to scrape the corn cobs with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother eyes the big blocks of white cheese and butter on the counter, no 
doubt wondering how many flies have lounged on them during the day. Ah well, I 
figure, if we haven't died yet after a lifetime of eating food from street 
vendors, it certainly isn't going to happen now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio pours the scraped kernels into a small grinding machine. "We add water, 
a little bit of sugar and baking soda so that it will rise," he explains. 
Ground choclo is runny, not kneadable like cooked corn masa. This means the 
arepas are not shaped by hand but poured into small individual baking pans. At 
any rate, Naranjo says, arepas de choclo are good to eat in the afternoon or 
for supper; white arepas are for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we go up to the oven, Rubio points out the butter. "This," he says 
proudly, "is our secret ingredient. We cream the butter with salt and put it 
inside the arepas when they're done, with a slice of cheese." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes just a little over five minutes for a batch of arepas to cook in the 
wood-burning oven. Mom and I get the first two, and the sweet corn combined 
with the salty cheese and butter is delicious. By then we decide that most of 
the germs must have died during the cooking. "It was worth it," Mom says 
approvingly as we head back to the car. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner that evening, my brother samples Rubio's arepas and concedes that 
they are good arepas de choclo . But, he insists, for the very best white 
arepas (made from that laboriously hulled dry corn), we had to go to a place -- 
or rather a chain of places -- called La Areperia. 
</P>
<P>
 Next day, Fidel Gonzales and I go to the nearest La Areperia, where we are 
told that the arepas are made fresh every day in the factory and then delivered 
to the outlets, where they're cooked. We decide to look for the factory. 
</P>
<P>
 We finally find it, 20 minutes away, and after much begging and pleading (the 
owner is absent today) we are allowed inside. La Areperia's manager describes 
the business as a fast-food operation. They buy hulled corn in bulk and do 
everything else there in the factory. Even the cheese and the butter are made 
especially for them.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The secret of their eight years of success, he says, is simple: fresh arepas , 
made with 100% natural ingredients and with toppings, such as meat, chorizo or 
fish, that make them complete meals. Not bad for fast food. In fact, the 
manager proudly claims that they export them to the States. I take half a dozen 
home to sample -- they can be frozen -- and we all agree over lunch that they 
are pretty exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm scheduled to return to Los Angeles the next day, and every goodby call is 
laced with arepa -cooking advice: "Dip your fingers in milk when you shape 
them." "No, dip your fingers in water when you shape them." "Use brown sugar 
for the arepas de choclo ." 
</P>
<P>
 The last call is from my cousin. "Are you taking Areparina with you?" she 
demands. (Areparina is a brand name of ready-to-use arepa meal: precooked white 
corn, finely ground and needing only to be mixed with warm water before being 
shaped.) "Actually, no," I reply. "They sell it in the Latin markets in L. A. 
And anyway," I add proudly, "I plan to grind my own corn." 
</P>
<P>
 On the plane, I wonder how long my resolution will last, and during my layover 
in Bogota, I decide I need inspiration. This is, after all, the home of the 
best arepas I really have ever eaten, from a tiny cafeteria in front of my old 
university. The place is still there and so are the arepas , cooking outside on 
a hot grill. The cheese is still ground with the corn, and they still tasted 
mildly sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you make them?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know," the woman behind the counter replies. "We buy them 
fresh every morning and only cook them here." I head back to my plane no wiser, 
but at least certain that my favorite arepas were made from freshly ground 
corn. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home, I vaguely wonder whether Angeleno arepa -makers are copping out by 
using Areparina instead of the real thing. To deal with my fears, I go to Cali 
Viejo, a Colombian restaurant in Van Nuys that, as its name implies, is owned 
by people from Cali. Not surprisingly, Jorge Restrepo, the man in charge of the 
arepas , is a full-blooded paisa.  
</P>
<P>
 Restrepo assures me that yes, he grinds the corn. "We get the corn in bulk 
from Miami," he explains. "I cook the corn here, for around two hours, and the 
next day I grind it." He says he waits one day to do so, because hot corn masa 
is sticky and hard to handle. "The masa is still a little bit rough after 
grinding," he says, "so I also knead it with my hands until it's soft and 
silky." 
</P>
<P>
 Restrepo fashions two kinds of arepas : the small round ones to serve with the 
main dishes and arepas with cotija cheese, which is kneaded into the dough by 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he's home, he makes a third variety. "I soak my hands and knead the 
masa very, very well. And then I make very wide and thin arepas , pulling each 
with my hands until it can't get any thinner. Then I grill them and have them 
for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're hard to do," he adds. "Sometimes it takes me 10 minutes to do each 
arepa ."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Restrepo has his own grinding machine at home. "All homes in Colombia have a 
grinder. And here in L. A. they should do the same," he says firmly, "for 
tradition's sake." I agree -- guiltily, because I still haven't bought my 
grinder. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," explains my friend Emilia Vinasco over arepas and coffee a couple 
of days later, "my dad was a paisa , and in our house arepas always had to be 
made with fresh corn.  
</P>
<P>
 "And today, when I go to the Latino market to buy the corn, they always ask me 
why I bother, why I don't just use Areparina? And it's not just that they're so 
much better with the fresh corn, but that it's such a joy to grind them and 
knead them myself, and shape the fresh masa with my hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in my own kitchen, I'm still kneading my Areparina dough, but not for 
long. As I prepare to pack my belongings to move into a new home, I've already 
told my Colombian friends what I want as a housewarming gift: a grinder. Who 
knows, maybe the perfect arepa will be as close as my own grill in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The basic ingredients of arepas -- including hulled corn, masarepa (precooked 
corn flour) and ready-made dough for arepas from fresh corn (masa para arepas) 
-- can be found at most Latino markets, including the ones listed in the box at 
left.  
</P>
<P>
 AREPAS WITH CHEESE 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound dry corn kernels, hulled 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart water 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound ranchero or panela cheese 
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
 In pot cover corn with water and bring to boil. Cover and cook over medium 
heat 30 minutes, until you can squish corn with fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 With hand or electric grinder, grind corn and cheese together. Cheese can be 
blended in when kneading dough or ground together. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to knead, knead in softened butter to give moisture to dough. Knead 
until well blended. Then, with wet hands, shape 1/2-cup batches of arepas dough 
into 4-inch patties. Place on hot grill.  
</P>
<P>
 To form arepas, make 2 (1/4-cup) patties and lay thick slices of cheese in 
between. Press edges together. Corn can be cooked in advance. Arepas can be 
frozen individually. Cook on barbecue or on griddle until each side is brown. 
Makes 10 patties.

BACK TO BASICS: CAULIFLOWER: A USER'S MANUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Cabbage flower," the literal translation of the word cauliflower , aptly 
describes this crucifer family member that produces tightly packed florets. 
Most of the cauliflower raised in this country is creamy white, but purple and 
green varieties are gaining in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 If pale ivory florets, or curd, are desired, the plant's leaves must be tied 
over the growing head to block out the sunlight. This labor-intensive procedure 
isn't necessary for the variety with green curd that is a cross of cauliflower 
and broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire head of cauliflower is edible. Leaves may be chopped and added to 
soups or used in stir-fry dishes. Florets can be eaten raw as a crudite or 
cooked, cooled, marinated in vinaigrette dressing and served solo or added to 
green salads. 
</P>
<P>
 Florets and core, when cooked and served hot, team well with cheese sauce but 
can also simply be drizzled with melted lemon-butter. They also may be pureed 
and seasoned with a dash of nutmeg. 
</P>
<P>
 Cauliflower is available year round. Head size is not an indicator of quality, 
but select those with compact curd that are granular in appearance and 
unblemished by rust. The leaves should look fresh and green. 
</P>
<P>
 A medium head yields four servings. After purchase, the vegetable will retain 
its quality up to four days when wrapped or placed in a plastic food bag and 
refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 You can boil or steam cauliflower whole, but it cooks faster and more 
efficiently when prepared as follows: Pull off any leaves that are still 
attached to the bottom (Step 1). Next cut off the stem as close as possible to 
the base (Step 2). 
</P>
<P>
 Either break or cut the florets from the inner core (Step 3), then peel each 
stem (Step 4). Those more than 1/4-inch thick will cook more evenly if split 
(Step 5). 
</P>
<P>
 The inner core of cauliflower should be thinly sliced (Step 6). Once all the 
pieces are prepared, rinse well under cold, running water. 
</P>
<P>
 Place the cauliflower in a saucepan with about an inch of boiling water. 
Cover, bring the water to a boil again over medium heat and cook the vegetable 
about six minutes, just until tender-crisp. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding a teaspoon or two of lemon juice to the cooking water helps retain the 
white color. The green variety maintains its color without the lemon juice and 
requires a little less cooking time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cauliflower may also be steamed over boiling water. Cover and cook 10 to 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering the pan minimizes the strong cabbage odor this vegetable emits while 
cooking. Overcooking any variety causes it to become mushy and develop a 
stronger taste and smell. 
</P>
<P>
 For an attractive presentation, reassemble the cauliflower pieces into a head 
after they are cooked. To do this, butter a bowl (Step 7) slightly smaller than 
the original head of cauliflower. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with the longest florets, place them in the bowl with the stems 
pointing up and toward the center. Add the shorter florets around the sides of 
the bowl (Step 8). Place the cut slices last, in the center (Step 9). 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a serving plate over the bowl, invert both (Step 10), then remove the 
bowl (Step 11). Tuck any stray pieces into place.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: GOIN' BACK TO CALI

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Chinese restaurant revolves around the stir-fry and the old-line French 
place around its heavy sauces, so to many people, South American restaurant 
meals are almost synonymous with humongous platters of beef. In most of the 
Argentine, Chilean and Bolivian places in California, the basic unit of 
currency is the giant mixed grill, the parillada , a megaton of charred protein 
that often comes unadorned by so much as a sprig of parsley or a French fry, an 
epic adventure written in meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hillocks of grilled spinal cord, the mountains of blood sausage, the 
garlic-reeking Alps of short ribs to be found in Los Angeles, none is quite as 
majestic as the picada combination plate served at the restaurant Cali Viejo in 
Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Cali Viejo is a smart, dim-lit red-leather-booth place just down from the 
shuttered General Motors plant -- "For Lease: Up To 2,100,000 Square Feet 
Available" -- and cater-corner from a giant karaoke center that abuts a Latin 
super-store. The restaurant specializes in the cooking of the warm Andean 
valley around the Colombian city of Cali -- Cali pops up every so often in the 
newspaper in a context totally unrelated to food -- and a little souvenir stall 
in back sells Cali-emblazoned soccer pennants, leather boxes and a few 
Colombian canned goods. A television in the restaurant blasts Spanish-language 
news to the carnivores, except when there are merengue music videos that look 
like something MTV might have shown in 1982. The restaurant serves no beer, so 
everybody pounds down milkshakes made from exotic Colombian fruits.  
</P>
<P>
 Big tamales are steamed in banana leaves here, stuffed with potatoes and pork, 
spiced in a manner that might remind you of the world's best tamale pie; flank 
steak is braised in a tomato-onion Creole sauce for the tough sobrebarriga . 
There is a ground-beef dish that is something like a highly spiced Colombian 
salpicon , almost as dry and fine as powder; extremely good pork chops are 
fried in a spicy crust. Bandejas are the traditional combination plates of the 
Colombian mountain regions, massive amounts of rice served with fried eggs, 
under-seasoned beans, plantains and a small steak.  
</P>
<P>
 But we've come for the picada . Come hungry: The picada -- mira, ve! . . . 
picada, it says on the unbashful menu -- is an oval ceramic platter heaped with 
grilled lengths of thumb-width Colombian chorizo , peppery nubs of grilled 
beef, pungent blood sausage (if they're not out of it), crisp chunks of spare 
rib, the peculiar though typical Colombian chicharrones that are more or less 
grids of crisply fried pork-fat anchored to sweet, ultra-chewy pigskin. 
</P>
<P>
 Garnishing the meat are green plantains that have been pounded down to 
approximately the size and thickness of a 3x5 card and fried to a shattering 
crunch, also lengths of slightly riper fried plantain, a few slices of tomato 
and chunks of fried cassava good enough to make you remember why yuca fries 
were so popular a few years ago. The hot salsa served on the side, aji , made 
from fresh chiles and chopped scallions, has an odd astringency that cuts 
through the garlicky richness of the meat. There are a couple of arepas , 
hockey-pucks of barely cooked cornmeal encased in a sort of a cooked-corn 
leather, often dead-cold in the center, that are pretty much inedible -- though 
oddly enough the fresh cheese arepas served as an appetizer here are crisp and 
delicious. And though the picada is ostensibly served for one, the $10 platter 
will probably serve three, perhaps augmented by an order of the wonderful 
corn-crusted empanadas or possibly a batter-fried plantain stuffed with cheese. 
The picada is a formidable plate of food. * Cali Viejo

GARDEN FRESH; THYME IS ON YOUR SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caraway thyme, a housewarming gift from a neighbor's garden, was the first 
thing that went into our soil on this mountain I now live on in Idyllwild. I 
set it by the front door and came out every morning with my coffee and greeted 
it. I'd bend down and gently rub its leaves between my fingers and inhale the 
scent -- true caraway laced with thyme. Caraway thyme's stems are slender as 
broom straws and the color of mahogany, the minuscule leaves forest-green. I 
wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
 Word must have gotten around, because another friend came by with a pot of 
thyme, this one flavored lemon. The specks of leaves are variegated -- 
blue-green bordered with dandelion yellow and moments of sunset pink. The taste 
in golden lemon upright thyme is as sunny as a Meyer lemon.  
</P>
<P>
 I'd grown thyme before, but nothing like these. Now it was thyme time. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, while I was visiting my mother, she dug up some of that very basic thyme 
-- English, it was. English and French are the great culinary garden or common 
thymes. The gray-green leaves are oval, an eighth to a quarter of an inch long 
and half as wide. Of the two, the French have the narrowest leaves. If you tap 
two herb growers, one may say the English is sweeter; the other may prefer the 
French.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping by a nursery, I found a pot of silver garden thyme. An airier shrub 
than the French or English, it has pale-green leaves etched with cream. From a 
distance, it's a tracery of silver verdigris.  
</P>
<P>
 As with so many plants that grow with abandon, there is botanical confusion 
among garden thymes. If I'd found a plant named German or winter thyme, it 
might have been the real thing -- somewhere in between French and English in 
habit -- or it might have been French or English in disguise. But all the 
garden thymes reach eight to 12 inches in soft woody mounds, a touch of the 
moor in your garden. In the soup pot, their tastes are indistinguishable from 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 That spring, each of my plants offered fewer sprigs than I would snip for an 
omelet. In summer, they flowered, starry clusters of rosy pink that drove my 
bees crazy. By summer's end, the plants had grown so much I could have flavored 
a couple of dozen omelets. but I wanted more thyme, more. 
</P>
<P>
 The following winter, in my first garden in snow, I found that thymes are 
evergreen and hardy. While the sages hummed to themselves to keep warm and the 
mints tried not to let me see them shiver, the thymes paid no heed to the cold. 
Often when I picked them, strung along the stems and caught in their tiny 
leaves were glittering crystals of ice. 
</P>
<P>
 The following spring, a friend sent an article about an English nursery that 
sold 40 sorts of thyme. Now I was avid! I wanted the intense tastes of leaves 
from the shrublets called Miniature -- I'd discovered with sage that big flavor 
can come in the dwarf-est cultivars. I wanted to taste the French-like Porlock 
thyme. To add the plain, dark-green-leaved lemon, the low, fuzzy-leaved 
Longwood and the warm gray Britannicus to my lemon collection. To sip a cup 
brewed from Pennsylvania Dutch tea thyme. And from the mountains of the former 
Yugoslavia, I wanted to set the bright pink flowers of Adamovica beside the 
blush pink flowers of the silver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the article, I learned that there are two sorts of thyme: upright, such 
as I had, and creeping. Hugging close or floating six inches over the ground, 
creepers root where they touch the earth and can cover a small patch quickly. 
In bloom (some part of May, June, July or longer), they're a dazzling swatch of 
rosy pink or purple. 
</P>
<P>
 While all creeping thymes are ornamental, not many are as flavorful as the 
uprights. Creeping Dot Wells is. It has shiny green thyme-tasting leaves and is 
as delectable in a stew as edging a border. So is creeping oregano thyme -- 
thyme and oregano are cousins, and this is a felicitous coupling. Nutmeg thyme 
is spicily nutmeg-y and resembles caraway thyme in form. Lemon mother-of-thyme 
is low and dense, the one to set along a path. There's a creeping variegated 
golden lemon, sometimes called Doone Valley. And surely the sweetest of the 
garden thymes is lightly citrus orange balsam. 
</P>
<P>
 I read that a tracery of creepers is shown to best advantage against wood and 
brick and stone. And that thyme and stone are incomparable in the landscape. 
Whether spilling down a stony bank or creeping around stepping stones or 
perched atop a raised stone wall, stone warms thyme and provides a noble 
backdrop for its beauty. Well, my garden is carved from the stone of this 
mountain, so I thought it not unreasonable to start with about 20 kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 By now most of my thymes are venerable. They enjoy full sun and well-draining 
soil that dries out between soakings (thymes are a blessing in drought). I only 
feed them when I give the garden its once- or twice-a-summer spray of kelp and 
fish. Herbal oils are usually more vibrant when the leaves must struggle a bit. 
 
</P>
<P>
 To help plants maintain their vigor, you're supposed to shear them back about 
one-third after flowering. Go ahead; I can't. But what I can do is scratch 
fresh soil into the roots of plants that have been in place a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What draws me to the culinary thymes? The extraordinary blend of forest pines, 
desert sages and meadow grasses, with an aftertaste that I can only describe as 
if the sea made butter.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, when cooking for friends, while some might wrinkle their noses at 
cilantro and savory, everyone likes thyme. When I know a guest is new to the 
world of herbs, I simply roast a chicken with small whole carrots, onions, 
celery, fennel, garlic, leeks, tomatoes, turnips -- whatever vegetables are in 
season -- all nestled in branches of thyme. Before serving, the darkened stems 
will need retrieving and most of the leaves will be charred bits, but there's a 
mist of thyme over everything, and our guest will wonder why it tastes so good. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Garden thymes hold their own among composite flavors. There's nothing like 
thyme in a rich stew -- notably lamb and beef. Thyme is essential to earthy 
Provencal cooking. It's slowly roasted with game and rabbit, and it's tossed 
into pasta the last minute. The French favor wild thyme ( T. serpyllum ) in 
cooking, curiously milder than garden thyme. A creeper, in summer it mantles 
European dry grassland and sandy heaths in deep rose. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this thyme that in Europe has long been sipped as a tisane to relieve 
headaches and other symptoms of stress. In a tall mug, pour boiling water over 
a heaping tablespoon of fresh leaves or heaping teaspoon of dried thyme, cover 
and steep 10 minutes. I add a splash of honey. As members of the mint family, 
all culinary thymes make soothing tea.  
</P>
<P>
 Pairing a forceful herb like thyme with vegetables is a balancing act. You 
must be careful not to let it overwhelm. Try thyme with mushrooms and cream. 
With butter-steamed fresh favas, limas and white beans. With grilled eggplant 
or tiny braised artichokes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The double-flavored thymes are best used in a single-flavored manner. Steam 
fish on a bed of lemon thyme. Roast onions with branches of caraway thyme. 
Sprinkle sliced tomatoes with oregano thyme. Flowers and leaves of orange 
balsam thyme give a pretty finish to peaches. Nutmeg thyme is splendid mixed 
into fresh cheese -- cream or goat or ricotta -- and spread on pears. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they are perennials, you can grow some -- not all -- thymes from seed. 
But since, for the price of a glossy magazine, you can buy a starter plant of 
almost any thyme you've ever heard of by mail from a herb nursery, the waste of 
thyme seems a foolish economy. 
</P>

<P>
 You can harvest thyme the year round. To release the tiny leaves, hold a sprig 
over a saucer and gently pull a thumb nail from the tip down the stem. Break 
apart clusters. I pick out the twiggy bits for company, but not for us.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the most successful uses of thyme's dry -- in the sense of martini-dry 
-- flavor, I think, is with the sweet warmth of carrots. And one of the 
tastiest ways with carrots is grated as salad. Ho hum, you say? The old mayo 
and raisins? Not a bit of it.  
</P>
<P>
 From a refreshing standing-up-in-the-kitchen lunch to carrying it in a glass 
dish to a potluck supper to serving it in small white bowls beside the dinner 
party roast, this is one of my favorite things to eat. For guests, make it in 
the morning for the evening. For yourself, keep a bucket of it in the 
refrigerator and dip into it for days, first stirring in the juices.  
</P>
<P>
 Adding half as much chopped parsley as thyme is a lovely variation. The colors 
are spiffy.

LOW FAT: SKINNY PUFFY: APPLE PANCAKES

 You might think something as thick and puffy as this apple pancake would have 
to be loaded with fat and calories -- something to save for a very special 
occasion breakfast. But this version has just a little more than 200 calories 
and three grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 The pancake batter is made with egg substitute and nonfat milk to keep the fat 
low. The small amount of butter added to the apples along with the brown sugar 
provides enough flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the recipe is easy. Just measure the pancake ingredients into a 
blender and process; then pour the batter over sizzling apples in a hot 
skillet. The most important thing is that the skillet be hot so the pancake 
will puff up nice and high. Also, make sure everything is ready for serving and 
that the guests are on hand when you pop this pancake into the oven because it 
falls fast, like a souffle, not long after being removed from the oven.

GOOD COOKING: FEEDING YOUR OATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many of us, morning oatmeal is a passion as well as a preparation. I 
prefer old-fashioned rolled oats slowly cooked into a thick, flowing 
consistency -- neither thin nor lumpy-thick. Serve it to me steaming hot, 
sprinkled with brown sugar and topped with hot, foamed 1%-milk from a 
cappuccino machine and I'm in heaven. It's also a healthy, satisfying way to 
start the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Oats, the most nutritious of the cereal grasses (an excellent source of 
protein, vitamins and minerals such as iron and calcium), can be found in many 
forms. Whole oats are used as animal fodder, but once cleaned, toasted, hulled 
and cleaned again, they become oat groats, hard, berry-like grains that can be 
cooked and served as cereal or as you would prepare a rice dish. They are 
delicious in casseroles, stuffings and salads. Oat groats can be found in 
health-food stores and some health sections of supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-fashioned rolled oats are oat groats that have been steamed and flattened, 
while quick-cooking rolled oats are groats that have been cut into several 
pieces before being steamed and rolled into thinner flakes. I prefer the taste 
and texture of old-fashioned rolled oats although the two can be used 
interchangeably in most recipes. Instant oats, on the other hand, are 
different. They have been precooked and cannot be safely substituted for the 
old-fashioned or quick-cooking varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for oat talk. The proof is in the recipes that follow. They capitalize 
on the natural, nutty goodness of oats. The mostly oatmeal cookies with 
currants are at least 90% oat flakes; as a result they are chewy and crisp at 
the same time. The rolled-oats yeast bread is a dense loaf that toasts 
perfectly, absolutely delicious spread with preserves. The oatmeal banana 
hotcakes are a quick and tasty way to enjoy rolled oats, a little more creative 
than a bowl of steaming oatmeal but just as easy.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crunchy and chewy at the same time, these cookies are almost all oats. You can 
omit the currants or substitute the same quantity raisins or chopped nuts.  
</P>
<P>
 MOSTLY OATMEAL COOKIES WITH CURRANTS

<P>
 1/2 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup dark-brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup dark corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups rolled oats, quick or old-fashioned 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup cake flour 
</P>

 1/2 cup currants 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon maple flavoring 
</P>
<P>

 When the batter is freshly mixed, these flapjacks have a little crunch to 
them. They can also be held a day or two in the refrigerator; their texture 
becomes softer and moister even though they are thoroughly cooked. I love them 
both ways. The banana complements the oats, just sweetening them a bit without 
adding a distinct banana flavor.  
</P>
<P>
 OAT BANANA HOTCAKES 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium ripe banana 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 cups low-fat buttermilk

 Dense with oats, this mild loaf makes perfect breakfast toast. The allspice 
just brings out the oaty flavor without being dominant.  
</P>
<P>
 OATMEAL BREAD 
</P>
<P>
 1 package dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup dark-brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon warm water (105 to 115 degrees) 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups bread flour  
</P>
<P>
 Rolled oats, quick or old-fashioned 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup nonfat dry milk powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon allspice 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 1 large egg mixed with 1/2 teaspoon salt for glaze 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons rolled oats 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl stir yeast and 1 tablespoon dark-brown sugar into warm water. Let 
stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, put remaining dark brown sugar, bread flour, 1 1/2 cups rolled 
oats, dry milk powder, allspice and salt into processor fitted with metal 
blade. Turn processor on. With processor running, pour yeast mixture through 
feed tube, then butter. Process dough until supple, elastic and sticking 
slightly to sides of work bowl, about 1 minute. If needed, add more water or 
flour by teaspoon if dough is too dry and hard or too soupy. Dough should be 
slightly sticky. Alternately, use mixer fitted with dough hook to knead dough, 
about 8 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer dough to large plastic food bag. Squeeze out air. Seal tightly at top 
of bag so there is enough room for dough to expand. Set bag in bowl and let 
dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour, 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil baking sheet, preferably black steel. Punch dough down. Form ball by 
pinching bottom of dough together. Place, rounded side up, on prepared pan. 
Drape loosely with oiled plastic wrap, oiled side down. Let dough rise in warm 
spot until doubled, about 1 hour, 15 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Brush loaf with egg beaten with salt (remaining glaze will last up to 1 week, 
refrigerated). Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons rolled oats. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake on bottom oven rack at 375 degrees until loaf is deep golden-brown and 
sounds hollow when tapped on bottom, about 35 minutes. Remove from pan and cool 
on wire rack. Makes 1 loaf, or about 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>

IN THE KITCHEN; TOUGH COOKIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 I remember when I was a kid sitting down with my grandfather and watching in 
amazement as he had nothing but coffee and Archway sugar cookies for breakfast. 
Cookies! While we kids were watched over by an ever-vigilant mother as we 
bravely forced down our super-nutritious Lucky Charms, he was eating cookies, 
sipping coffee and reading the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess that still is my reference point for an adult breakfast, though it is 
always a disappointment when I try it myself. Mom was right: Cookies are just 
too sweet for breakfast (as, of course, were 90% of the cereals I ate in their 
place). 
</P>
<P>
 What I want is something buttery with a bit of crispness and a sweetness that 
doesn't overpower every other flavor. Too much sugar and you wind up with a 
one-dimensional cookie with no complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 I found my ideal while wandering through Florence one December. Trying 
desperately to keep warm, my wife and I happened into one of those little 
bakery shop/espresso bars that seem to be clustered three to a block in elegant 
Italian shopping areas. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time I was on a cookie mission, determined to try every variety I could 
find of the little cookies the Italians call brutti ma buoni , "ugly but good." 
While my wife picked out some lapidary little pasticini, I was drawn to these 
little nondescript mounds of dough called rustiche . Technically, they weren't 
brutti ma buoni , though they certainly fit the description. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More candied fruit peel, nuts and raisins than dough, they were tough little 
cookie-cakes, almost like cement scones. But they had a beguiling hint of 
sweetness and a pleasing interplay of flavors that were perfect with a hot, 
slightly bitter cup of cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
 I ate them by breaking off the corners -- I didn't want to attack them head-on 
and wind up having to look for a dentist in a foreign country. Besides, that 
way -- stuffed in my pocket and broken out for emergencies -- they lasted long 
enough to get me through not only the Mercato Centrale but a couple of museums 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they lasted all the way home. A year later I came across a 
napkin-wrapped fragment of rustiche in one of the pockets of my winter coat. I 
popped it into my mouth and crunched down -- the texture was about the same, 
even if the flavor had faded a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, though I looked far and wide, I never succeeded in finding a 
cookie like it. Everything I tried was either too sweet or too simple. Nothing 
had that kind of authoritative austerity. Then I found fisherman's breads -- 
pane del pescatore , actually -- in Franco Galli's fine "The Il Fornaio Baking 
Book" (Chronicle Books: 1993, $19.95). They're richer and a bit softer than my 
old favorite, but I'll forgive them that. In fact, I think I like them better 
-- with their rich crumbly dough, they're no danger to dental work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Galli credits the breads to Genoa, "where fishermen have historically packed 
them for long sea journeys." Well, maybe, but those must be some awfully 
wealthy fishermen. I think it's more likely those guys were lugging something 
closer to my rustiche than these butter-enriched babies. But the flavor is 
right -- buttery dough, tart lemon and orange peel, aromatic fennel, just a tad 
sweet. . . . They're the perfect coffee cookie -- for breakfast or just for 
snacking. 
</P>
<P>
 If grandpa had known about them, they might even have beaten out the sugar 
cookie.

 FISHERMAN'S BREAD 
</P>
<P>
 (Pane del Pescatore) 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
 5 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 whole egg 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg yolk 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup golden raisins 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup diced candied orange peel 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup diced candied lemon peel 
</P>
<P>
 4 teaspoons fennel seeds 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons milk 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons dry Marsala 
</P>
<P>
 Combine butter and sugar in large mixing bowl. Beat until fluffy, light and 
pale in color, 5 to 7 minutes on medium speed of electric mixer. Add whole egg 
and continue to beat, scraping down sides of bowl. Add yolk and beat well, 
scraping down sides of bowl again. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate mixing bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, raisins, candied 
orange and lemon peels and fennel seeds. Add half flour mixture to butter 
mixture and mix until dry ingredients are thoroughly incorporated. Beat in 2 
tablespoons milk and Marsala. Add remaining flour mixture and continue to mix 
just until rough, shaggy dough forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn dough out onto lightly floured board and knead with lightly floured hands 
until dough is soft but still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes. Divide dough 
into 2 equal portions. Shape each portion into ball and then, using palms of 
hands, flatten balls into disks about 1 inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
 Line baking sheet with parchment paper or grease with butter. Place shaped 
loaves on baking sheet. With small serrated knife, cut simple shallow grid 
pattern in top of each loaf. Brush tops with remaining 1 tablespoon milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake loaves at 350 degrees until light golden-brown and wood pick inserted in 
center comes out dry, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool 
completely. Makes 2 (6-inch) loaves, about 8 servings.

 The spinach recipe that you recall ("The Amazing Shrinking Leaf," Feb. 3) has

 Editor's Note:  
</P>
<P>
 It took some sleuthing, but with the help of our resident food historian 
Charles Perry, we finally tracked down the recipe. It has been reprinted many 
times, including all of the above examples. Most notably, in his "Feasts for 
All Seasons," published in 1966, De Groot (who may have been a better writer 
than a historian) reprints the entire recipe in a somewhat heightened version 
of Brillat-Savarin's words before offering an alternative method. The problem 
with authenticating it is that though it is usually credited in a general sort 
of way to Brillat-Savarin, it does not appear in his only book on food, 
"Physiology of Taste." The earliest instance of the story we could find was in 
Elizabeth David's "French Country Cooking," published in England in 1951. 
According to David, the recipe comes from Jeanne Savarin, who published the 
recipe in the weekly magazine La Cuisine des Familles, in August, 1905. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interest of history, here is the original recipe in its entirety, as 
translated by David: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Abbe Chevrier, contemporary of my great-great-uncle (Brillat-Savarin), 
left a reputation in Bresse for being the perfect gourmet; he and 
Brillat-Savarin were the best friends in the world; the Abbe, however, did not 
always disclose his culinary secrets to Brillat-Savarin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amongst other delectable things, Brillat-Savarin was excessively intrigued by 
the spinach cooked in butter of the Abbe Chevrier. 'Nowhere,' he used to say, 
'does one eat spinach, simple spinach cooked in butter, to compare with his. 
What can be the secret?' Brillat-Savarin's mind was finally put at rest; he 
discovered the famous secret. Here it is. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'On Wednesday (for Sunday) choose your spinach, young leaves, neither too 
old nor in flower, of a good green and with their middle ribs. In the afternoon 
clean the spinach, removing the stalks and wash it carefully. When it is 
tender, drain it in an enamel or china colander; drain out as much water as 
possible by pressing the leaves firmly down in the sieve; then chop them 
finely. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Now put them in a pan (enamel or glazed earthenware) with some fine fresh 
butter and put on to a very low fire. For a pound of spinach allow 1/4 pound of 
butter. Let them cook gently for 30 minutes, then take them off the fire and 
let them cool in the same pan. They are not to be served today. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Thursday: Add another 1 1/2 ounces of butter to the spinach, and cook again 
for 10 to 15 minutes over a very low fire; again leave them to get cold; they 
are not to be served yet. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Friday: Exactly the same operation as the previous day; the same quantity 
of butter, the same length of cooking. Do not be tempted. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Saturday: Again the same operation as Thursday and Friday. Beware of 
temptation; the spinach will be giving out a wonderful aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Sunday: At last the day for your expected guests has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'A quarter of an hour before you intend serving the dinner, put the spinach 
again over a low flame, with two good ounces of butter, for 10 to 12 minutes. 
This time, take them out of their pan and put them in a warmed vegetable dish 
and serve them very hot. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'In the course of five daily cookings, your pound of spinach has absorbed 10 
1/2 ounces of butter. Such was the Abbe Chevrier's secret.' " 
</P>
<P>
 David then notes: "As well as the 10 1/2 ounces of butter the spinach has 
absorbed, it has also reduced to practically nothing. It is certain that the 
butter does give the spinach a most delicate flavour, but it is advisable to 
cook at least 2 or 3 pounds if all this performance is to be gone through. The 
recipe is not one to be taken too seriously."

ARE YOU READY FOR THE SUPER COWS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost overnight, the super cows have arrived and are busy producing milk that 
is already being sold -- without any distinguishing marks -- in supermarket 
dairy cases near you. 
</P>
<P>
 On farms throughout the country, dairy cows entering the ninth week of 
lactation, or the peak of their production, are being injected with bovine 
somatotropin, or BST, the first major product of agriculture biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 24 hours of treatment, the animals' milk production can increase as 
much as 20%. The exact number of farmers adopting this high science, according 
to Monsanto Co., the leading manufacturer of the drug, has surpassed 2,000 in 
46 states. Sales of BST, trademarked as Prosilac, began less than two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The dimensions of this event can only be understood when one compares an 
average cow's current milk production of 14,841 pounds a year with the 
projected totals after BST treatments: 16,641 pounds. In other words, the drug 
stimulates the average cow to produce an additional 1,800 pounds of milk 
annually -- that's equivalent to the weight of a small car such as a GEO Metro. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before BST, American dairymen could claim that they were producing more 
milk with fewer animals on fewer farms than ever before. With the advent of 
this drug, current production records could be shattered in a country that is 
already awash in a tax-supported milk surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Clinton Administration Executive Branch report on BST, released last month, 
said that the additional costs to the federal government from implementing the 
animal drug will be substantial. In the first four years of BST usage, the 
federal Treasury will have to invest $510 million, in addition to current 
spending, to purchase excess production under current government milk price 
support regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 This prospect, and the several related health issues, have created all kinds 
of controversy: 
</P>
<P>
 * Consumer advocates are trying to persuade the public that BST is bad science 
and are urging a boycott of the milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Government officials are attempting to reassure everyone that BST is safe 
and that milk from treated cows is no different from any other milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug companies, which invested $1 billion to develop BST, are hoping the 
issue will quickly fade. The glare of publicity can only dampen enthusiasm for 
the drug and slow sales -- a frightening prospect for companies, such as 
Monsanto, that are eager to recoup their huge investment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dairy farmers are torn. They can use BST as a quick way to increase a herd's 
production and the farm's revenue. Or they can delay and await the developing 
public reaction to the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration report on BST endorsed the drug and said that 
government scientists believe that milk and meat from BST-treated cows is safe 
and virtually identical to products from untreated animals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Pure Food Campaign, a Washington-based advocacy group critical of 
biotechnology, recently filed suit in federal court in Madison, Wis., seeking 
to halt sales of BST. The Pure Food Campaign contends that doubts remain about 
the safety of BST and that the government has not conducted several key tests 
on the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Pure Food's chief complaint is that BST's ability to increase production will 
stress cows, causing the animals to develop mastitis, a disease of the udder. 
Any sign of mastitis and dairy farmers would be tempted to increase the 
prescribed levels of antibiotics given cows in order to keep the animals 
healthy. Any rise in antibiotics usage might be reflected in potentially 
harmful levels accumulating in commercial milk. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Food and Drug Administration's approval of BST in late 1993, 
Monsanto must conduct tests of BST-treated cows to determine whether the milk 
contains abnormal or illegal levels of antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, FDA approves BST for use and then they say they will monitor how much 
antibiotics end up in milk or how much mastitis is being caused in cows," 
complained Andrew Kimbrell, an attorney in Washington for the Pure Food 
Campaign. "I have never heard of FDA approving an animal drug first and then 
deciding to do the human safety tests after the approval. . . . The public 
thinks that an FDA approval means that a drug is safe. It doesn't, and the 
courts should make an independent investigation (of BST)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In response to these and other, similar charges, a biotechnology trade group 
issued a statement calling the Pure Food Campaign "extremists" who promote 
"fear." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident that this lawsuit, like the other obstructionist and dilatory 
maneuvers before, will be dismissed," said Carl B. Feldbaum, president of the 
Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington. "When it is, we will no 
longer have our progress held hostage to baseless fears. . . . It is important 
to keep this issue in perspective. BST occurs naturally in all cows, whether 
they have been treated with BST or not. It is the substance that makes them 
grow and produce milk. It is present in trace amounts in all of the milk and 
meat we eat." 
</P>
<P>
 A Monsanto spokesman said BST injection and subsequent increases in milk 
production will not harm cows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cow is capable of producing the additional milk and BST allows the cow to 
do it," said Tom McDermott, Monsanto's director of biotechnology 
communications. "In our field tests of BST, 72% of the farmers reported that 
the cows produced nine additional pounds of milk a day. Similar increases can 
be seen from other animal management techniques such as milking three times a 
day and is not harmful." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's BST report concedes, however, that future sales 
of the product are "uncertain" despite all the assurances about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the FDA approval of BST, dairy firms that do not use the animal 
drug can say so on their product label. If dairies and supermarket companies 
widely adopt anti-BST labeling, there could be a strong consumer backlash 
against the compound. The Pure Food Campaign claims to have enlisted 
commitments from as many as 150 national food companies to reject the use of 
BST or the sale of its byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, for instance, La Habra-based Food 4 Less Supermarkets Inc. 
announced that all milk sold in its 222 California stores will be from cows 
free of Monsanto's BST drug. Food 4 Less operates Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva 
markets, in addition to its name-sake stores. 
</P>
<P>
 California Milk Producers, the cooperative that ships dairy products to Food 4 
Less, announced that virtually all its farmer members have signed affidavits 
pledging not to use BST supplements, according to Gary Korsmeier, chief 
executive officer for the co-op, the state's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 California Milk Producers has also provided similar guarantees, he said, to 
Vons Grocery Co., Stater Bros. Markets and Hughes Markets.

 In fact, some surveys indicate that public concerns about BST may lead to a 
reduction in overall milk consumption of between 4% and 20% a year, which would 
compound the surplus issue and increase government price supports. 
</P>

<P>
 Consumer resistance to BST may also dim prospects for all future applications 
of agriculture biotechnology, the Clinton report stated. While the report found 
that application of biotechnology in the medical sector is robust, the efforts 
in the food industry were described at "fragile and financially vulnerable."

<P>
 One prime example is Calgene Inc.'s Flavr Savr tomato, scheduled to debut last 
fall. The FDA has yet to approve the tomato's implanted gene that resists 
molding and allows vine ripening. Calgene reported last week that it lost $21 
million during the six months ending Dec. 31, almost double its losses from the 
same period in 1992. The company announced that 1994 losses will be even 
greater.

SWAT TEAM RESCUES 4 WOMEN AFTER BOTCHED BANK HOLDUP; CRIME: EMPLOYEES 
APPARENTLY HID IN A VAULT FOR FIVE HOURS AFTER ROBBERY ATTEMPT IN LONG BEACH.

<P>
 Masked police officers with automatic weapons stormed Long Beach Bank late 
Wednesday afternoon and rescued four women who had been hiding in a bank vault 
for nearly five hours since an attempted holdup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Police Department's special weapons and tactics team burst into 
the bank about 4:45 p.m. Moments later, they emerged with four women, who were 
taken immediately to an FBI command post for debriefing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other SWAT members were searching the two-story bank at 1725 Ximeno Ave. for 
three suspects thought to be in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began shortly after noon. Within half an hour, a man who had been 
in the safe deposit box area walked out of the bank unmolested and apparently 
unaware anything unusual was occurring. Police intercepted him and questioned 
him briefly, but he reportedly told them he knew nothing about the holdup 
attempt.  
</P>
<P>
 Witness Bob Richards came upon the scene a few minutes after the drama began. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to the (bank) manager, Steve, and one of his employees, who I know 
very well," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were just stepping out of the bank for a couple of minutes to retrieve 
something from Steve's car, (when they) noticed some suspicious characters in 
there. . . . There happened to be a police officer on a motorcycle nearby, and 
they summoned him down. And then they looked back into the bank and saw these 
(three) suspects jump over the counter."  
</P>
<P>
 Richards said he was told that four women employees fled to the safety of a 
vault and locked it when they realized what was occurring.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the bank manager, who talked to the women by telephone, "calmed them 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 A white, subcompact car parked beside a drive-up window on the side of the 
bank was left unattended throughout the ordeal, with the trunk open.  
</P>
<P>
 Police pulled a chain across one end of the driveway where the car was parked 
and rolled a trash bin across the other end. But it was not immediately clear 
whether the car was connected to the bandits. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokeswoman confirmed that the bank was held up in November by a 
group of men resembling those thought to have been involved in Wednesday's 
attempt.  
</P>
<P>
 But authorities said it was impossible to know whether the two groups were the 
same.

TOM HAYDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Oh, terrific. Tom Hayden has decided on an eleventh-hour whim to run for 
governor as a "messenger" of political reform (Feb. 10).What nonsense. Hayden, 
who has spent the past 12 years in Sacramento, is part of the problem, not part 
of the solution. Hayden is a classic "pol" of the old school; anyone who thinks 
he is a "political reformer" should talk to state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal or 
Cathy O'Neill, Hayden's opponents in the 1992 Democratic state senatorial 
primary, who were the victims of one of the most vicious negative campaigns in 
recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's quixotic decision to run for governor has much less to do with 
"reform" than it does with grandstanding. Those with acute political memories 
may recall Hayden pulling the same stunt in 1976 by waging a sleazy and 
negative campaign against then-U.S. Sen. John V. Tunney. Then, as now, Hayden 
had no realistic chance of winning, but by crippling Tunney in the Democratic 
primary, Hayden paved the way for S.I. Hayakawa to doze through six years in 
the Senate. This time, Hayden's ego trip threatens to turn what already was 
shaping up as a slugfest between state Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi into yet another example of ritualistic Democratic 
Party political suicide.

 * If Tom Hayden is running for governor on a campaign reform platform, I'll 
vote for him. I'd vote for him anyway. He's a spoiler? What's to spoil? All the 
other candidates would run their office according to the sources that filled 
their campaign war chests; probably the same sources.

CITY WATCH; VICTIM OF EVIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amalia C. Sison, a resident of a central city retirement home, used to travel 
across town by bus to work as a volunteer at the Foundation for the Junior 
Blind in Windsor Hills. No longer.On Tuesday the 69-year-old foster-grandmother 
hovered near death, the victim of two teen-age attackers who shot her in the 
eye as she waited at a bus stop behind the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 If we had stronger gun control, would the two youngsters who attacked Sison 
merely have stabbed her?  
</P>
<P>
 The Times favors much tighter limits on private gun ownership, but gun control 
is hardly the whole of the answer, of course, just a crucial part. Because for 
some lawbreakers there is no technical fix, no change in law or regulation or 
practical arrangements, that will suffice. It is the criminals' own fault; they 
are a huge part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If this generous, courageous woman survives, she will survive blinded and 
traumatized. Will her fellow volunteers now fear for their own safety? How can 
they not? Even if her young attackers have not killed her, they have surely 
done their bit to kill the spirit of people who, like her, are willing to take 
risks to help the young, the handicapped, the vulnerable, particularly in parts 
of town for which not enough people volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 The two youths arrested in the case are from Inglewood and Santa Monica, not 
from Windsor Hills itself, but does that help? 
</P>
<P>
 Our neighborhoods are not medieval walled cities. Or they haven't become that 
yet. But we're getting there. We're getting there.

THE FLY THAT'S BUGGING CALIFORNIA; MALATHION GENERALS ON THE BOMBING RUN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The helicopters are back. This time, the pesticide malathion is being sprayed 
on the Riverside County cities of Corona and Norco. It was only four years ago 
that malathion-spewing helicopters flew over communities in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties in an attempt to eradicate the pest, once and for all. But the 
persistent Mediterranean fruit fly has returned to Southern California -- if it 
ever really left. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say they have no plans to resume aerial spraying in Los 
Angeles, Orange or San Bernardino counties, which currently are under 
quarantine and are battling the Medfly with sterile flies in the hope of 
breeding the pest out of existence. But officials say there aren't enough 
sterile Medflies to carry the fight to Riverside County, hence the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks in Corona and Norco understandably are up in arms about the 
spraying. That's because the state is offering no better answers than before to 
the key questions raised by the Medfly issue: Is eradication even possible? Is 
the state even daring to ask itself what happens if the Medfly cannot be 
eliminated as a threat to California's $18-billion agriculture industry? And, 
the question that most concerns most Southern Californians: Is malathion 
spraying safe? 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say it is. A scientific review panel set up by Gov. Pete 
Wilson agreed that malathion was generally safe, but it also called for further 
research. More needs to be known about the pesticide's long-term effects, the 
panel noted, adding that aerial spraying of malathion should be used only as a 
last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 One pregnant Medfly was found in Corona in December. Does that discovery 
really mean it's last-resort time? More than 400 Medflies were found in L.A., 
Orange and San Bernardino counties last year, but so far agriculture proponents 
of spraying have managed to avoid tangling again with vehement anti-spraying 
protesters in those communities. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials, always fearing the spread of the pest into farmlands farther 
north, said the Medfly find in Corona marked a new spread of the pest that must 
be put down. Lucrative foreign markets for California fruit are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, everyone wants the Medfly to go away. Problem is, it won't 
cooperate. And another problem is that state officials, having repeatedly 
declared the Medfly "eradicated," only to later have to spray again, have 
precious little public credibility left. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the best-laid plans, all the anti-Medfly efforts would pay off and the 
bug would be little more than a memory. But the history of the last several 
years doesn't leave much hope for that rosy scenario. Wilson and his top 
science and agriculture advisers must ask themselves: What happens if, soon, 
California must admit that the Medfly has established itself here permanently?

ONCE IS DEFINITELY NOT ENOUGH; N. KOREA'S OK ON A SINGLE NUCLEAR INSPECTION IS 
WELCOME BUT INADEQUATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its abrupt agreement to open seven of its nuclear sites to international 
inspection North Korea has forestalled a looming crisis, while leaving 
unresolved the basic international security problems posed by its secret effort 
to acquire nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 After delaying for a year in meeting its responsibilities under the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty, the Pyongyang regime, facing probable U.N. Security 
Council-ordered economic sanctions within a few weeks, has taken a minimum step 
to satisfy the International Atomic Energy Agency. But apparently IAEA 
inspectors will be granted only one visit. Moreover, and fundamentally, they 
won't be able to see two suspected dumps where wastes from weapons-grade 
plutonium may be stored. Examination of those sites could reveal the extent of 
Pyongyang's weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials believe that the north may already have material for one or two 
nuclear devices. Recent remarks by Defense Secretary William J. Perry and 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher suggest that Washington's aim now is not 
to force North Korea to give up that material but only to prevent it from 
acquiring more. One or two crude devices may not a nuclear power make, but one 
or two such devices, flaunted or not, can give implicit heft to a program of 
political blackmail against neighboring countries, South Korea especially. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of sanctions was the stick used to force North Korea to live up to 
the Non-proliferation Treaty's inspection requirements. The carrot was a U.S. 
offer to upgrade political and economic relations with Kim Il Sung's tottering 
Stalinist regime, in exchange for Pyongyang's agreement to end its nuclear 
program. Verification, by inspections, must be a part of this agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Is North Korea, diplomatically isolated and with its economy stagnating under 
four years of negative growth, finally ready for such a deal? Given its track 
record, the odds have to be seen as less than even. Pyongyang has acted to 
avoid international censure. But it still has to show that it's ready for 
international respectability.

GET THE INFORMATION OUT!; GLENDALE SCHOOL BOARD SHOULD RESTORE CANCELED PLAY ON 
AIDS AND CONDOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For nearly a year, the Parent-Teacher-Student Assn. of Hoover High School in 
Glendale has pursued a reasonable idea. It wanted to co-sponsor a play on the 
dangers of AIDS and educate teen-agers on the use of condoms as a way to help 
prevent the spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not to be an amateurish effort. The play, "Secrets," was produced by 
the Kaiser Permanente health care organization. It already has been seen by 
700,000 California students, including many in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
Hoover High School officials also planned to follow the play with a discussion 
stressing abstinence as the most effective way of preventing AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Glendale school district officials canceled the performances of 
"Secrets," which was scheduled to debut last week. "The philosophy of this 
district is that abstinence is the clear message we send," said a spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing wrong with stressing abstinence, but denying that there is 
any other realistic way to approach AIDS prevention amounts to burying one's 
head in the sand. Teen-agers are sexually active at alarming rates, and the 
most active among them are the least likely to use condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 According to national surveys by the federal Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 40% of ninth-graders and 72% of 12th-graders say they have had sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers who acknowledged having sex with four or more partners ranged from 
a low of 19% and 6.8% of ninth-grade males and females, respectively, to a high 
of 38.5% and 17% of 12th-grade males and females, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the AIDS incubation period, which can last a decade or longer, it 
is likely that many of the people who have come down with the disease in their 
20s contracted the AIDS virus in their teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, Hoover PTSA representatives defended the play before the 
Glendale school board, which took the matter under advisement. That's hardly 
sufficient. The district has a responsibility to disseminate authoritative 
information on ways other than abstinence to prevent the spread of AIDS. The 
play should go on.

FIRED NEWS ANCHOR

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In his "Testimony" (Voices, Feb. 14), former Chinese language news anchor 
Joseph Jinn claims his dismissal from the station was because of an 
unflattering report he did on a recent reception for Taiwanese Premier Chan 
Lien. 
</P>
<P>
 However, any news department, whether ethnic or mainstream, must hold itself 
up to the same standards -- clear and unbiased reporting.Jinn crossed the line 
with his report where, in his own words, he was "a bit critical, a little 
sarcastic." It was this violation of professional standards which led to his 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 We agree with Jinn on one point -- that he was naive in thinking his own 
politics would be accepted by this station as journalistic copy simply because 
we are an ethnic news department. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any other new department, KSCI provides a proper forum for editorial 
comment, but only when it is properly labeled as such, not delivered under the 
guise of objective new report. Jinn's personal opinions, however, were fused 
throughout what should have been a straight news story, a violation of accepted 
news standards and a disservice to our viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 His dismissal may indeed have a "chilling effect" on ethnic news reporting in 
Southern California, but only if we allow politics to get in the way of good 
solid reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 KSCI is a broadcast station that serves more than 5 million households in 
Southern California from Los Angeles to San Diego.

CORONER'S OFFICE BUREAUCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * My 4 1/2-year-old niece, Amy Tyre-Vigil, was killed in the earthquake (Jan. 
18, 23) and my sister and brother-in-law were seriously injured. Fortunately 
and unfortunately, our family learned much about how government services can 
function in such times. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue efforts of the Los Angeles Fire Department and the Los Angeles 
Police Department were of the highest quality and caliber. Not only were the 
individuals involved professionally superb in the way they responded to the 
emergency and effected the extremely difficult rescue of my sister and 
brother-in-law, they proved to be caring and loving individuals. What they did 
on Jan. 17 and what they have done since deserves a separate special letter and 
commendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office did not perform so 
well. As I attempted to get my niece's body released, I ran into government red 
tape and bureaucracy as well as discourteous, insensitive and poorly trained 
employees. More than 48 hours after her death, I was unable to get Amy's body 
released or even get a date when she would be released. We still do not have 
Amy's personal effects, which I believe the coroner's office lost although 
officials deny it. With the exception of one individual named Ron in Personal 
Property, each and every contact with the coroner's office was a horrible and 
unprofessional experience. 
</P>
<P>
 How did we get Amy released? It took a call to Supervisor Ed Edelman's office. 
He and his staff took an immediate interest and acted quickly to help us cut 
through the red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office should be thoroughly investigated, and alternatives for 
the handling of such sensitive matters should be given serious consideration. 
Apparently the coroner is not motivated to provide caring or efficient service 
to his constituents in a time of extreme grief and sorrow.

OFFICERS ACCUSED IN SHOOTING SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Let me see if I get this straight: Two trained Los Angeles police officers, 
who are public servants and role models sworn to "Protect and Serve," got 
drunk, and discharged their weapons at another officer, and at other targets 
(Feb. 10-11). (They have since claimed that they were only shooting at signs, 
and did not see the CHP officer in the line of fire!) 
</P>
<P>
 What the hell is the Los Angeles Police Department using for screening and 
training guidelines? At this rate we would be better off disbanding the 
department altogether, and making an anarchy of our society. It might actually 
be safer, since irresponsible maniacs, such as these two shooters, would not be 
able to conceal their obvious lack of sanity, and/or training, behind a badge.

<P>
 * First, let me say I support law enforcement, but let's examine the last few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 We have had several incidents involving police officers including inebriated 
officers brandishing weapons at Anaheim Stadium, an officer stabbing his lover, 
an LAPD officer convicted of raping women he had pulled over, Lennox area 
sheriff's deputies discharging their weapons while drinking on duty, an Orange 
County Sheriff's deputy shot dead by a fellow officer during an unauthorized 
training exercise, and two LAPD officers shooting at a fellow peace officer 
while drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 While the liberal media, including The Times, believe that only police 
officers should be allowed to possess guns, I believe that the incidents noted 
above clearly show that even they are not capable of the proper use and 
possession of weapons and we need to retain our weapons as a safeguard.

 * How sad a commentary, when two police officers, with eight or more years of 
service to the city, do something dumb and receive the politically expedient 
response of Chief Willie L. Williams and his senior staff that is just as dumb. 
These two men are not criminal from the "hood" who contribute to the carnage of 
the 77th Division where these officers have served the community. These two 
officers have placed their lives on the line to serve the public for a 
collective 17 years of service. Without a doubt what they did was wrong, but 
was it criminal? 
</P>
<P>
 These officers have been under the most stressful assignment LAPD can subject 
a street cop to for many years and on this regrettable day they relieved some 
of their stress by drinking too much, and then firing their guns at freeway 
signs. They were not firing at the CHP officer, or anyone else. How sad that 
law enforcement standards fluctuate so much because of the lack of leadership 
of a department. These officers should be disciplined and counseled, not fired 
and prosecuted for doing something dumb.

 * The LAPD needs a process that really works at identifying, treating, or as a 
last resort, discharging problem officers before they become a threat to the 
general public and themselves. How much can the city afford to continue to 
spend on officers that needlessly expose the city to significant financial 
liability? 
</P>
<P>
 Is there no desire by the Police Department, local government or Police 
Commission to halt the unnecessary payouts and loss of respect by the 
communities the police officers serve because of the wantonly, reckless acts of 
a few officers?

RAIDERS AND COLISEUM

<TEXT>
<P>
 * The taxpayers of Los Angeles and the Coliseum Commission would do well to 
heed Bill Boyarsky's warning about getting flimflammed (again) by Raiders owner 
Al Davis (Feb. 2). 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone wishing to ascertain the level of Davis' corporate citizenship should 
take a drive past the Raiders headquarters, a leased junior high school in El 
Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a neatly manicured and carefully maintained source of pride within the 
community, this facility has been allowed to become a rundown, weed-choked 
embarrassment. Attempts to shame Davis and the Raiders into cleaning up their 
space have been met with thunderous silence and total inaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly this guy has just about worn out his welcome in Southern California. 
So, Al, go ahead -- pack up your attitude and your arrogance and take them to 
Hartford, or Hoboken or wherever.

WASHINGTON DROPS THE BALL ON IMMIGRANT FUNDS; BUDGET: CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE 
COMPENSATED FOR COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING FEDERAL MANDATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY McCARTHY, Larry McCarthy is president of the California Taxpayers' 
Assn. and chairman of the National Taxpayers Conference. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the long run, the costs of illegal immigration in California are 
potentially more damaging to the state's economy than many of the natural 
disasters that have hammered the state in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton deserves praise for his quick response to the Northridge 
earthquake. Unfortunately, the new federal budget proposal does not respond to 
California's ongoing fiscal disaster. The budget proposal for 1994-95 continues 
a federal attitude that over the years has denied states' pleas for funding to 
carry out federal mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 The refusal to include $3.1 billion in direct reimbursement to California for 
illegal-immigrant services required by federal policies is a major blow to a 
state struggling to deal with so many problems over which it has so little 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 Already in critical condition as a result of the lingering recession, defense 
contract cutbacks and a series of natural disasters, California's projected 
1994-95 budget imbalance may be doubled if the federal government fails to meet 
this obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is utterly unfair to stick California taxpayers with the perennial burden 
of paying for health, welfare, education and incarceration costs for more than 
1 million  
</P>
<P>
 illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Inaction on this problem will damage California's economy and its ability to 
compete. It hurts our ability to recover from the recession by forcing 
increases in taxes or further reductions in spending for programs necessary to 
the state's economic future, such as higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 California has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs during a recession that has 
lasted more than three years, and the state Department of Finance estimates 
that it will take the taxes paid by 700,000 working Californians just to cover 
the costs of services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 California's economy cannot absorb several billion dollars year after year to 
pay the costs of programs that are the responsibility of the federal 
government. The drain on California's general fund revenues threatens the 
quality and availability of essential services for the state's legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress must act to amend funding into the budget proposal. In addition, 
California and other states should continue to pursue a lawsuit that would 
force the federal government to meet its obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed budget also underscores the need for a federal law that would 
require Washington to fully compensate states for direct costs incurred in 
compliance with federal mandates. The National Taxpayers Conference, 
representing taxpayer groups in 33 states, called for such a law last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents and governors have reacted quickly to California's natural 
disasters -- earthquakes, floods and fires. Their actions are appreciated, but 
they are virtual slam dunks, politically. Their voter ratings ebb and flow with 
the public perception of conduct when confronted by emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake is deserving of every disaster relief dollar that 
Congress can appropriate. It is of utmost importance to help the most populous 
region of the state get back on its feet. Unfortunately, it will make it 
tougher to persuade Congress to allocate additional dollars to California for 
federally required services to illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of viewing this as an insurmountable challenge, it should be seen as a 
rare opportunity for everyone, from the White House to the statehouse, from the 
public sector and the private sector, to pursue what is fair and equitable. 
California's economic health is at stake.

PERSPECTIVE ON HERITAGE; MICKEY'S MESSING WITH HISTORY; DISNEY'S PLANS FOR A 
VIRGINIA THEME PARK WOULD CHEAPEN HALLOWED GROUND WITH MALLS, FAST FOOD AND 
TRINKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICK KOTZ, Nick Kotz, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his writing on unsanitary 
meat-packing plants and who has written four books on public-affairs issues, 
lives on a farm in the Virginia Piedmont. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the Manassas battlefield to the Blue Ridge Mountains, and from Harper's 
Ferry to Jefferson's Monticello, stretches a unique national treasure of 
American history. Throughout this region of rolling Virginia countryside, the 
nation has lovingly preserved dozens of the sites where American democracy was 
forged and later sorely tested during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 With its pastures and vineyards, farmhouses and villages, orchards and trout 
streams, the gentle countryside would still be recognizable to George 
Washington, who surveyed it for Lord Fairfax, or Thomas Jefferson, who farmed, 
dreamed, wrote and invented here. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this entire area is threatened. It may be overrun, cheapened and 
trivialized by a huge commercial venture called Disney's America -- a plan by 
the Walt Disney Co. to build an amusement theme park that would feature 
Disney's own version of our history. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney plans to build the theme park and a real-estate development on 3,000 
acres in a quiet rural community nestled against the Bull Run Mountains, close 
by the Manassas battlefield. Located 30 miles west of Washington, the theme 
park would include nine history exhibits. Among these would be a re-created 
Indian village, a 1930s state fair, a working farm, a group of automated 
presidential mannequins making speeches and a Civil War exhibit in which a 
Disney spokesman said visitors will "feel what it was like to be a slave." 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney Co. is currently lobbying Prince William County, the Virginia 
Legislature and the U.S. Congress to subsidize this project with several 
hundred-million dollars for highway construction, sewers and water and even 
tourist promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's park would have an extraordinary impact on the metropolitan 
Washington region, increasing traffic congestion and air pollution in an area 
that is already beset with environmental problems. These local concerns are 
being weighed against the tantalizing and perhaps illusory hope of realizing an 
economic boom and increased tax revenue from the Disney development. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost totally ignored up to this point is the impact that this proposed 
entertainment and real-estate venture (2,500 homes and 2 million square feet of 
commercial and office space) will wreak on the wealth of the area's real 
history and natural beauty, which are our shared national heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 That impact would be felt most explosively on the Manassas National 
Battlefield Park, scene of the Civil War's epic battles of First and Second 
Manassas in 1861 and 1862 (also called the battles of Bull Run). It was there 
that Confederate Gen. Thomas J. Jackson earned his famous nickname when a 
fellow officer observed, "There is Jackson, standing like a stone wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Several miles from the scenic overlook marking Stonewall Jackson's resolute 
stand is the site where Disney expects 6.3 million annual visitors to pay $30 
each to tour its own re-creations of the Civil War. Thousands of Disney-bound 
cars will traverse the two public roads that cross this preserved ground of the 
Civil War's first major battle. If Disney comes, a National Park Service plan 
to close these roads to through traffic is likely to go by the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps memory-impaired by the dollar signs of Disneymania, our public 
officials seem to have forgotten that just five years ago, Congress spent $100 
million purchasing land to protect this same battlefield from a far smaller, 
less threatening shopping center development. 
</P>
<P>
 Without any assistance from the Magic Kingdom, 800,000 visitors now flock to 
this 4,500-acre national park each year, walk its battlefields and view 
informative audiovisual presentations and electric maps at the visitors' 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 To appreciate the changes that would be wrought by Disney on the Virginia 
Piedmont and Shenandoah Valley, one only needs to imagine the miles and miles 
of development and commercial sprawl that will inevitably spring up along the 
still-tranquil routes that lead to the proposed theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Approaching the land that would become Disney's America from the north on 
scenic, rural U.S. Route 15, a traveler passes a litany of revered names and 
places: Harper's Ferry, Leesburg, Waterford, Ball's Bluff, White's Ferry, 
Middleburg. Continuing south past the Disney site on Routes 15 and 29 quickly 
brings one past the battlefields of Kelly's Ford, Brandy Station and Cedar 
Mountain, on the way to Jefferson's Monticello and James Monroe's Ash Lawn at 
Charlottesville. Branching southeast on Route 3, one is at the center of 
another national park that preserves the Civil War killing fields of 
Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Wilderness and Spottsylvania Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The miracle is that this magnificent region of historic and natural beauty in 
Virginia has managed so well to preserve its essential character for the 
enjoyment both of its own residents and the visitors who come here from around 
the nation and the world. The last thing this country needs is a Hollywood 
re-creation of history in an area where we still have the real thing.

WESTSIDE WATCH; HAYDEN SAYS OUT DAMNED SPOT TO 30-SECOND TV ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newly announced gubernatorial candidate Tom Hayden took aim at a lot of things 
in his full-page, 1,823-word advertisement in Tuesday's Western Edition of the 
New York Times. Among his targets were 30-second television campaign 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Such spots, the Democratic state senator said, "sell the personalities and 
abbreviated messages of candidates like so many products in the commercial 
marketplace. When television commercials influence more people than the free 
press itself, the democratic process is in deep trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough. But it should be noted that in 1982, Hayden became one of the few 
Los Angeles-area Assembly candidates to use broadcast TV ads -- a strategy 
considered hugely inefficient in such contests. Locked in a tough Westside 
Assembly race against Republican Bill Hawkins, he took to the airwaves with, 
yes, 30-second TV spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded this week about those ads, Hayden said: "I don't mind somebody trying 
to say something in 30 seconds, but it's become the primary vehicle of 
communication and eclipses the free press and I think that's a dangerous 
pattern in a democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he does not intend to use 30-second TV or radio ads this time 
around. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 MOTS JUSTES?: Beverly Hills Mayor Maxwell Salter might have picked a better 
ice-breaker Tuesday, when the City Council honored the mayor of Cannes, France 
-- Beverly Hills' sister city. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannes Mayor Michel Mouillot, accompanied by his new bride, had spoken to the 
council in French, through an interpreter. Then Mayor Salter weighed in. 
</P>
<P>
 "How is it that when you speak French, it sounds like you're making love to a 
beautiful woman?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor of Cannes had no immediate response. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SACRAMENTO STAMPEDE: Hayden isn't the only Democrat with Westside ties angling 
for a statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade is led by West Hollywood-resident Kathleen Brown, the poll-leader 
for governor who once represented part of the Westside on the Los Angeles 
school board. Then there's Controller Gray Davis, a West Hollywood resident 
running unopposed for his party's nomination for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of Westsiders want to become secretary of state -- Assemblywoman Gwen 
Moore (D-Los Angeles) and former Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo, who 
represented Hollywood for eight years before mounting an unsuccessful bid for 
mayor. Moore, incidentally, decided to keep her options open by also filing for 
reelection for her Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) is hoping to become the second 
elected insurance commissioner. And state Board of Equalization Chairman Brad 
Sherman, a Santa Monica resident, is making a bid for controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman has also filed for re-election to his post on the state's elected tax 
commission. Kathleen Connell of Bel-Air, a financial consultant and educator 
who served as housing director under former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, is 
also running for controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys), who represented Hollywood 
for almost a quarter-century before being elected in a San Fernando Valley 
district in 1992, has filed for treasurer, though he may run instead for the 
Board of Equalization seat Sherman currently holds.

UNHAPPY JANITORS CARRY A HEARTFELT MESSAGE TO SONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The janitors came to Sony bearing a plastic foam heart covered in shiny red 
wrapping paper. The message, however, was anything but sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to give them a heart because they are heartless," said Rocio Saenz, 
a union organizer for Local 399 of the Service Employees International Union, 
which represents about 6,000 janitors in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Valentine's Day, about 100 people marched on Sony Pictures in Culver City, 
part of an aggressive, six-year campaign waged by Justice for Janitors to gain 
better wages and working conditions for maintenance workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest marked the latest in a series carried out by union activists, 
whose demonstrations in Century City in 1990 and El Segundo last year resulted 
in several arrests for disorderly conduct. There were no arrests at Monday's 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is calling for Sony to investigate complaints that Diversified 
Maintenance Services, which provides non-union janitorial services to the 
studio, has treated workers unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Diversified Maintenance) don't pay the janitors for overtime, they are 
trained without being paid, and the janitors don't get health benefits," said 
Saenz, who suggested that Sony hire a contractor with union workers. The union 
organizer said Sony has not responded to the group's complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried to talk to them for two months," Saenz said. "So we decided to 
come here and make noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Sony spokesman Don DeMesquita declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Dotts, president of Diversified Maintenance Services, denied the 
janitors are underpaid, saying wages vary by city. Workers in upscale Century 
City, for instance, tend to be paid more than those in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it would be too expensive for the company to provide the workers with 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in green and red T-shirts, the janitors -- one banging a drum -- 
chanted "Union, yes; DMS, no" as they marched along the perimeter of the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators included Jesus Garcia, who said he earns $4.75 an hour as a 
Diversified Maintenance janitor in a Santa Monica office building. Garcia said 
the pay is not enough to support a wife and a toddler, who marched alongside 
him. Not having medical insurance, he said, is his biggest worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Sony) knows people are angry and will do whatever they have to do to get 
better wages," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenz said the group will continue to march on Sony. "We tried it the civil 
way," she said. "We're going to keep coming here until they listen to us."

BRIEFLY: EDUCATION: RENEWAL OF PARCEL TAX DISCUSSED BY SCHOOL OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica-Malibu Unified school officials are weighing whether to renew a 
parcel tax in the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of local residents, business people and teachers are evaluating the 
$58-per-parcel tax, on the books since 1988 and scheduled to expire in June of 
next year. Arthur Cohen, the district's finance director, said the committee 
could recommend increasing the tax or keeping it at the current rate. 
</P>
<P>
 By April of this year, the school board will decide whether to place the 
parcel tax on the November ballot. The tax generates about $1.8 million 
annually, Cohen said. The money helps pay for books, insurance, hiring teachers 
and other operational costs.

TOPICS / SECURITY; THE STORE THAT CAME IN FROM THE COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Worried about being car-jacked? Think your phone or office might be bugged? 
Need a personal body alarm when you go jogging that only you can turn off? 
</P>
<P>
 Gadgets that snoop and protect used to be the private domain of James Bond and 
Cold War spies, but now they're being purchased by parents, teen-agers, store 
owners and anyone else with a hankering for security devices. 
</P>
<P>
 For $100, the Counter Spy Shop of Mayfair London sells a hand-held body alarm 
with an ear-piercing screech. About 20 of those go out the door with customers 
each week, said Lydia Harris, manager of the store at 9557 Wilshire Blvd . 
</P>
<P>
 About $30 will buy the Watchdog, an alarm that hangs from a hotel door and 
will go off if someone even touches the door. 
</P>
<P>
 For $250, the store sells a hand-held device, euphemistically called a 
Security Blanket, that looks like a flashlight but emits a high-intensity burst 
of light that will temporarily blind a would-be carjacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Bug alerts, which warn the owner if there is a listening device nearby, will 
set buyers back a bit more. The portable alerts, which start at about $900, are 
popular among Hollywood executives and bankers involved in top-secret 
discussions of a proprietary nature, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bug alerts come in all sizes and shapes. One looks like a pager and vibrates 
to alert the owner. Another is also pager-size, but features a light that 
switches on when it detects a bugging device. 
</P>
<P>
 What does the Counter Spy shop's presence in Cairo, London, Mexico City, 
Miami, Milan, Moscow, New York, Paris, Prague -- and now Beverly Hills -- say 
about life in the 20th Century? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say whether the level of industrial espionage has increased 
since the 1950s when the store opened," said Hal Kassarjian, a UCLA professor 
of marketing. "Freewheeling behavior has been around in business a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the strongest demand for personal protection devices comes from people 
who consider themselves important.

 "If you're important enough and get to be hotshot enough, you think the world 
is out to get you," said Kassarjian. "Plus, it's all kind of exciting. Part of 
it is the macho need to be James Bond." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Counter Spy Shop was opened in London in 1959 by a group of former 
British security advisers who manufactured and sold security devices to their 
friends in and out of government, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Cold War wound down, the store has catered increasingly to 
corporations and private individuals, she said. The company opened its retail 
store on Wilshire in May after doing business for 14 years in Beverly Hills by 
appointment only, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held London company and CCS Communication Control of New York, 
an affiliated company that also retails under the Counter Spy Shop name, are 
part of a fast-growing $600-million-a-year surveillance and monitoring 
industry, according to Fortune magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many electronics stores and upscale department stores carry protection 
and surveillance devices. While some specialized "spy shops" in the Los Angeles 
area failed during the recession, stores such as The Sharper Image in Beverly 
Hills say the demand for security devices is making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharper Image sells a range of equipment including the night scope, which 
can peer through the darkness and has spy applications. But the popular sellers 
are personal body alarms and video units that allow the homeowner to see who is 
knocking at the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Counter Spy, meanwhile, has sold hand-held metal detectors to schools, 
conducts sweeps of offices for bugging devices and advises businesses on 
security. Kids go for the wristwatches that double as cameras, and homeowners 
snap up the fake books and popcorn cans with hollow centers that can be used to 
hide jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the retail store has given the Counter Spy Shop more visibility, 
corporations still make up 60% of the shop's business, Harris said. Many of 
those clients come in the back door for consultations in private offices behind 
the storefront or receive professional advice at their offices, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Harris, the shop's success stories have included a sweep of an 
oil company executive's office that turned up a bugging device in an aluminum 
cigar tube. The tube was the last in a box of cigars presented as a gift to the 
executive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A jeweler, Harris said, reported that a special briefcase did its magic when a 
thief attempted to steal it as the jeweler was checking in at an airport. The 
jeweler made use of a remote switch on a key chain that sets off a piercing 
siren in the briefcase and administers a strong electrical charge to anyone 
holding the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the over-the-counter availability of ingeniously cloaked cameras and 
sizzling briefcases dull the mystique of James Bond books and movies? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. John Gardner, who succeeded the late Ian Fleming as author of the 
James Bond books, gets a private preview in his home of the latest in spy and 
counterspy devices to keep him a step ahead of his readers, Harris said.

 Citing disruptions caused by the earthquake, Assemblywoman Debra Bowen 
(D-Marina del Rey) is pushing legislation that would allow home-based 
businesses to be licensed in Los Angeles County. 
</P>

 The effort is aimed primarily at the city of Los Angeles, which does not issue 
business licenses to people who want to work out of their homes. Bowen 
spokesman Evan Goldberg said the proposed law would not affect 77 of the 
county's 88 cities, which already permit some types of home-based businesses.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; COMIC-BOOK HERO GETS A SUPER RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like one of the characters who fills the pages of his new comic book series, 
artist Stephen Townsend finds his life taking unexpectedly dramatic turns. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling last May to publish the first issue of his South Central Comics 
series, the 23-year-old Crenshaw native and UCLA graduate is now distributing a 
second issue illustrated by a new partner, has a literary agent, and is 
speaking with show business types about developing his comic book into a film 
or television production. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always figured I would keep pushing, no matter what," said Townsend, who 
seems genuinely taken aback by the flurry of attention. "But I never expected 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The attention enabled Townsend to enlist the help of another artist, Otis 
Parsons School of Design student Rodney Clouden, while he concentrated on 
developing the story line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve had a good cause with this comic book, plus I thought it was a hot idea 
artistically," said Clouden, an Inglewood resident. "It took a lot of time, but 
it's been worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 The series' main character, 19-year-old Anton Peters, is something like 
Townsend: an ordinary man who is inspired to fight crime after his brother, an 
innocent bystander, is killed in gang cross-fire. After the deaths of two 
friends who died in similar situations, Townsend took up his pen and began 
shaping his hero, "The Hood." 
</P>
<P>
 While the first issue recounts the story of how Anton decides to don a mask 
and battle crime by night, the second delves more deeply into Anton personally 
and shows another side of his life: hanging out with buddies, going to parties, 
living day to day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He starts to think about his goals, about exactly how he's going to go about 
fighting crime and not killing people," Townsend said. "I also take a closer 
look at gang members, drug dealers as real people, not as cardboard cutouts. 
It's a lot to include in 24 pages, but I want to bring in as much realism as 
possible without making it too preachy." 
</P>
<P>
 With 2,000 copies of his new issue in hand, Townsend is passing most of them 
on to three national comic book distributors -- Diamond, Capitol City and 
Hero's World -- while he works to get them in local bookstores. The new issue 
is priced at $2, and Townsend expects to have a third issue out by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Levin, a William Morris agent representing Townsend, said "The Hood" is 
an idea whose time has come. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really resonates with a lot of people these days. This is only the 
beginning of what Steve can create. He's one of the most talented and 
enterprising young people I've ever met." 
</P>
<P>
 However successful the venture becomes, Townsend doesn't want to continue "The 
Hood" indefinitely. "I don't want to do 300 issues," he said. "I want this to 
be sort of a historical document. People can look back on this one day and say: 
'Wow, this stuff happened in the '80s and '90s, but thank goodness it's not 
happening anymore." ' ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; POLICE SEEKING KILLER OF MAN FOUND SHOT TO DEATH IN 
ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 33-year-old man was found shot to death this week, slumped over the wheel of 
his van in an alley, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Paul Edward Medina was discovered about 4 a.m. Monday by two 
passers-by, said Detective David Straky of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Pacific Station.Medina was found in a 1985 blue Dodge Caravan pushed into a 
fence at the intersection of California and Electric courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the alley is used as a shortcut by residents and is in a 
high-crime area, although no motive has been established for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe it's a gang-related shooting," Straky said. "As for robbery, 
we just don't know -- the victim's wallet was found in the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Eloisa Medina, the victim's mother, said her son was last seen about 8 p.m. 
Sunday in a Sav-On drug store near the corner of Lincoln Boulevard and Rose 
Avenue, two blocks from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina, married and the father of two children ages 8 and 2, was a Venice High 
School graduate and an ex-Marine. He worked as an aircraft assembler for 
Northrop in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 "All he cared about was work and his family," said Eloisa Medina. "All his 
life we never had a problem with him." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why they killed him," his wife said, sobbing. "There was no 
other man in this world as devoted to his family." 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: LOS ANGELES; ELECTRIC SHUTTLE BUS SERVICE BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles International Airport will introduce today the first of four 
electric shuttle buses for the regular route between remote parking lots and 
the main terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 The battery-powered buses emit 97% less pollution than diesel-powered vehicles 
and carry 32 passengers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of the one bus will eliminate more than 5,000 pounds of smog-forming 
emissions this year, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said. Three more buses are 
scheduled to be added later in the year.

COVER STORY; AIRING THEIR DIFFERENCES; IT'S NOISE. IT'S FREEDOM. IT'S TWO VIEWS 
LIFE AROUND THE RUNWAY IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defenders of Santa Monica Airport ride out neighborhood complaints as calmly 
as they might a patch of bumpy air. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask about last year's fatal crash of a small plane into a nearby apartment 
house, and you risk a lecture on the relative danger of crossing the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Mention complaints about noise and jet exhaust, and prepare for a rousing 
defense of private aviation as America's last bastion of individualism. 
</P>
<P>
 When all else fails, airport backers hit you with the hard facts: The airport 
existed long before the teeming neighborhoods that surround it -- and it's not 
going anywhere soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get over it," advises a waitress at the Spitfire Grill, a popular fliers' 
hangout. "If you're going to live in L.A., get used to noise and smog." 
</P>
<P>
 Things may not be that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years after the signing of an agreement that guarantees the Cessnas and 
Lear jets will swoop overhead until 2015, aviators and neighbors are still 
struggling to live with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Perennially one of the busiest single-runway airports in the nation, it has 
evolved into a gathering place for bohemians, inventors, celebrities and others 
who share a love of flying. 
</P>
<P>
 For residents who share a love of peace and quiet, however, it remains a 
source of exasperation -- a never-ending aerial parade of ear-splitting 
machines over some of the priciest real estate in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Just west of the airfield, Freida Marlin, a resident of the Lincoln Place 
Apartments in Venice, shudders at the sound of low-flying aircraft, many of 
which she said fail to follow prescribed departure routes intended to cut 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've taken away our skies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 East of the airport, Virginia Ernst shows a visitor a home video of private 
jets billowing black exhaust into her West Los Angeles neighborhood along 
Sardis Avenue. The rustic airfield of yore is but a quaint memory against the 
backdrop of ever-escalating jet traffic. "We're eating kerosene," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city-owned airport, which in 1981 dodged an attempt by the City 
Council to close it, maintains an almost bucolic air, belying its ranking as 
the busiest single-runway airport in the nation, according to a 1992 Federal 
Aviation Administration list, the most recent available. 
</P>
<P>
 People who work and play there describe the airport as a hive of creative 
energy where free spirits flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's treated equally," said Barry Schiff, chairman of the Santa Monica 
Airport Assn., a group of pilots and other airport users. "All you need is an 
interest in flying and you're accepted. . . . It's a lovely isolation." 
</P>
<P>
 Many go as far as to portray the 215-acre airfield -- an eclectic clot that 
includes small businesses, manufacturers, inventors, artists, writers and 
restaurants -- as a community in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
 Galvanized by a common technology, a sense of adventure and the hard-fought 
political battles of years past, the airport retains the laid-back, intimate 
feel of its origins as a rural airstrip. People know each other by name -- and 
by aircraft. At the Spitfire Grill, the talk flows as freely as the coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a beautiful life," said artist Ted Kerzie, whose custom-painted 
plane is parked about a hundred feet from his studio, which is in a hangar. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its easygoing air, the place bustles. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year the airport is the site of more than 200,000 takeoffs and landings. 
Traffic has fallen off recently due to construction at the airport and the 
recession, but officials expect it to expand about 5% a year for the 
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers only hint at the dizzying array of airport-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for major tours, big-name rock stars -- including Jimmy Buffet, 
Janet Jackson and Rod Stewart -- have set up their stages and rehearsed in 
cavernous Barker Hangar, a 40,000-square-foot airplane storage shed that 
doubles as a social hub and mini art colony on the airport's south side. 
</P>
<P>
 A conservation-minded attorney stores bush planes there until they can be 
transported to Africa to track poachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year thousands of schoolchildren and others stream through the Museum of 
Flying, which includes one of the nation's largest collections of World War 
II-era fighters, as well as other aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago the builder of an experimental jet, the BD-10, spent a 
Saturday taking prospective buyers for rides at $1,000 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
 On almost any day, one can see doctors, lawyers and other well-heeled 
hobbyists tinkering with their home-built Long-EZs, experimental two-seaters 
shaped like the Klingon warships of "Star Trek" fame. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hundred feet away, private jets whisk corporate and Hollywood elites 
into the blue beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 aircraft are based at the airport, including those of such 
celebrities as Bill Cosby, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kirk Douglas and Kurt 
Russell. Talk show host Jay Leno and comedian Jerry Seinfeld stow car 
collections in hangars there. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a whole wild group of people at the airport," said Judi Barker, owner 
of Barker Hangar. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 professional artists have studio space at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a fearlessness here," said artist Sierra Pecheur, basking in the 
sunlit spaciousness of her airport studio. "People don't seem to be afraid that 
you're going to take their air. There's enough for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Such ethereal musings contrast with the controversies that shadow the airport. 
Opened in 1919 as a dirt strip in a barley field, Clover Field, as it was known 
then, gradually developed into a major aviation center. In its heyday in the 
mid-1940s it was home to Douglas Aircraft, which turned out scores of bombers 
and transport carriers during World War II and, from Santa Monica, orchestrated 
the world's first round-the-world flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Employing 30,000 workers, Douglas fueled a housing boom around the airport. 
But in 1962, after the city refused to let the company expand onto residential 
property, Douglas departed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time a new crop of neighbors harboring no loyalty to the airport moved 
in. By the 1970s, many of them, unhappy with the noise, began urging its 
closure. The Santa Monica City Council in 1981 voted to do just that. But the 
U.S. Justice Department, contending that federal contracts obligated the city 
to keep the airport open, threatened to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 Years of negotiations led to an agreement in 1984 in which the city agreed to 
keep the airport open until 2015, partly in exchange for more control over 
airport policies, including those aimed at noise reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport backers widely contend the agreement launched a new era of cooperation 
in which pilots, the FAA and airport staff have worked hand-in-hand to address 
neighborhood complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport Director Jeff Mathieu estimates that 40% of the facility's 
$1.8-million operating budget goes toward noise reduction, which involves 
educating pilots, maintaining the airport's 24-hour noise monitoring system and 
responding to community complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Added airport manager Tim Walsh: "Noise has been my specialty. Obviously a lot 
of my time is spent dealing with the pilots and the community to make this 
place work." 
</P>
<P>
 Airplane noise can't exceed 95 decibels. (By comparison, a kitchen garbage 
disposal, heard from a distance of 10 feet, emits about 85 decibels.) 
</P>
<P>
 A "Please Fly Quietly" banner hangs outside the main terminal, and a 
15-foot-high blast wall, intended as a noise and debris buffer, is planned for 
the east end of the runway. Construction could start this summer if Congress 
approves funding. 
</P>
<P>
 But fines are rare and relatively light, reflecting officials' preference for 
"extensive outreach and counseling." So-called "transient pilots" who might not 
be familiar with local noise-abatement rules typically escape with a warning, 
as do other first-time offenders. In all, five aircraft were banned outright 
last year for breaking the noise barrier -- a penalty reserved for "willful and 
repetitive violators." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 552 reported noise violations in 1993, the airport handed out 15 fines, 
ranging from $100 to $500. Officials said most of the 552 violations were 
first-time offenses, or, in some cases, the result of weather or safety 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers have fueled skepticism among some neighbors, who contend that 
airport officials aren't tough enough and that some pilots have become adroit 
at evading noise monitoring microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst and her husband, Norm, who have battled the airport since the 1960s, 
said fumes and noise have become unbearable the past two years, mostly because 
of what they contend is a dramatic surge in jet traffic. They are angry that 
the airport has allowed the sale of jet fuel, and hint that a lawsuit to ban 
jets may be in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to get one jet a week. Now we get 15 a day," she said, showing a 
homemade video of jets revving up before takeoff -- a tape she has shown to the 
FAA, the city Airport Commission and a City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials acknowledge that the advent of smaller, quieter corporate 
and personal jets, combined with the airport's location near major business 
centers and movie studios, has caused such traffic to soar. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they've had some success cutting noise by limiting the time jets 
spend revving up on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all agree there's a problem," Ernst added, "but they can't agree on what 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her neighbor, Brookie Westbrook, a former Navy pilot, worries about 
planes coming in so low they sometimes must gun their engines to clear an 
embankment and make it onto the runway -- an observation dismissed by a top 
airport official as "highly unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
 "They just skim the trees," Westbrook said. "They come over the (San Diego) 
freeway and drop down. If they have an engine failure, that's it. They're going 
to wipe out two blocks of houses." 
</P>
<P>
 Such comments make veteran fliers lunge for their airsickness bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principle that the sky is falling because there's an airport in the 
community and it's going to hurt someone is totally unsubstantiated by fact," 
said Donald Brandsen, a longtime airport activist and pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics support that. Santa Monica Airport averages one crash per 200,000 
takeoffs and landings -- about one per year -- compared to a general aviation 
accident rate of five per 100,000, according to airport manager Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, no one on the ground has ever been killed as the result of a 
crash involving the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But luck has been a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, a pilot and his passenger were killed when their small plane 
slammed into a Santa Monica apartment building after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a pilot was killed when his plane hit a utility pole while trying to 
return to the airport. The plane exploded in a residential area near Dewey 
Street and Walgrove Avenue in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, a home-built Wheeler Express plane crashed into two houses in West 
Los Angeles after the pilot reported engine problems. No one was seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 While these and other incidents provide chilling, if infrequent reminders of 
the hazards posed by the airport, aviators as a class exhibit little patience 
for the nervous Nellies on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 With irritation creeping into his voice, entrepreneur Dave Ronneberg, designer 
of a Long EZ spinoff, the Berkut, said the chance of being killed by lightning 
far exceeds the chance of being killed by a falling airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his experimental Berkut, he said, "It's the safest machine I've ever 
owned." 
</P>
<P>
 And as for his neighbors' anxieties? "Ignorance is a terrible thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots and others advocates are thin-skinned about perceptions of the airport 
as a playground for the rich. They contend that the airport serves as a hub of 
commerce for an otherwise struggling region, helps relieve overburdened Los 
Angeles International Airport and employs about 600 people in airport-related 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even Mathieu, the airport director, said, "A small number of people have 
significant, valid concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 And there is general agreement that a few free-spirited fliers disregard the 
people below. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have some stubborn people who won't listen," Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scofflaws have at least until 2015 to learn the rules. After that, the 
future of the airport, located on some of the more desirable land on the 
Westside, clouds up. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, pilots, homeowners and others successfully fought a proposed 
one-million-square-foot office park there. Will those unlikely allies need to 
band together again 20 years from now? 
</P>
<P>
 Aircraft designer Ronneberg said the land could produce more revenue if it 
were used for something other than an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "'But at what cost?" he asked. "There'd be something lost forever."

OUT AND ABOUT / ORRILL'S AUCTION HOUSE: THE BARGAIN HUNTER'S EMPORIUM 
</P>

 Talk about one-stop shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 At Orrill's Auction House, customers from around Los Angeles bid on an 
ever-changing variety of merchandise ranging from refrigerators to plastic 
poinsettias. 
</P>
<P>
 The bidding gets started at 10 a.m. every Tuesday, when 70-year-old auctioneer 
and owner Jack Orrill takes the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 The first items to go are small -- table linens, dishes, knickknacks, antique 
records, costume jewelry and books. Merchandise is moved methodically down a 
series of long display tables. The first bids, which can be as low as $2, are 
called out. Then, the real wheeling and dealing begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a constant explosion of household items from peoples' homes," said Kevin 
Ross, who has worked at the weekly auction for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day progresses, competition for dining room tables, sofas, appliances, 
bed frames, mattresses and other larger items becomes fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace is nonstop -- the auction continues until virtually all items are 
sold. Anywhere from 1,500 to 2,000 pieces move through the store on any given 
day. Items are sold in "as is" condition, and a $20 minimum deposit is required 
to enter the auction. A cash-and-carry policy is also enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Orrill's, which opened in 1925, is a landmark in this West Adams neighborhood. 
Today, it is still family-owned and operated by Orrill, his sons and a 
full-time staff of 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise is acquired from a variety of sources, including private stocks, 
estate sales and abandoned items from storage facilities. A lot of preparation 
is required before each auction. Staff members check-in and tag all items in an 
elaborate processing system. Things that do not sell one week are recycled to 
the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bidders consider the auction a social event, showing up week after week. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of nice people come here," said Culver City resident Carolyn Baxter, a 
collector of Depression-era glass and old linens. "It's fun and interesting and 
you find some neat stuff. . . . It just depends on what you are interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 Orrill's, 1920 W. Adams Blvd., Los Angeles. (310) 277-7373. Preview hours are 
8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. Auctions are held each Tuesday 
beginning at 10 a.m. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

EDUCATION: A CHECKLIST FOR MEETING WITH YOUR CHILD'S TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Report cards will be hitting the kitchen tables of homes throughout the 
Westside in the next few weeks, and some will undoubtedly raise questions. 
</P>
<P>
 If your child brings home poor grades, probably the best way to figure out 
what went wrong -- and how to make it go right next time -- is by meeting with 
your son or daughter's teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 I've noticed that the prospect of meeting with teachers is often as 
frightening for parents as it is for kids. But with a few tips from someone on 
the "other side," you should be able to have a relaxed and productive 
conference with nearly any teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, give the teacher (and any other staff you want present) enough 
notice. Some parents call me just a day -- or even hours -- before they want to 
confer. Bear in mind that teachers have a number of meetings and duties outside 
the classroom, so they most likely need a couple of days to clear a time slot 
for your conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Offer the teacher at least three or four time slots when you are available so 
that you can quickly agree on an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important is that you contact the teacher -- not the principal or 
other administrator -- first. There's no need to go over the teacher's head at 
this point -- and don't expect much sympathy from the teacher if you do. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask the teacher to bring his or her grade book and samples of your child's 
work. You'll have specific items to talk about, and can see for yourself the 
quality of your child's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, call the counseling office to request that a counselor attend the 
conference. This helps to ensure a calm, organized conversation. It also 
ensures that there will be a witness if a confrontation occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 If you'll be late or can't show, call. Teachers generally have more work to do 
than their preparation periods allow, so their time is valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, it's better if the student is not present at the start of 
the conference. Kids tend to act defensively and interrupt constantly. It's 
vital that you and the teacher be free to develop a rapport in an adult 
atmosphere, before the student joins you. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, keep the conference brief. Bringing a list of your questions or 
concerns is a good way to tackle them efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 It must be difficult to listen objectively to criticism of a son or daughter, 
and it must be tempting to become a little defensive. But don't fall into the 
trap of trying to excuse your child's problems by using cliches that generally 
spell "denial" to most teachers, and can make them deaf to the rest of your 
conversation.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, don't blame the problem on a "personality conflict" between 
teacher and student. Teachers are usually committed to, and experienced in, 
getting along with all kinds of personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming that a teacher is simply "out to get" your child is also shaky. 
Believe me, teachers have too many students and responsibilities to launch a 
campaign against one kid. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the Yarber Award for least believable explanation, however, is 
the "My child never lies" defense. There has never been a child who has not 
lied at some point! 
</P>
<P>
 A more effective approach is to keep your mind open to the possibility that 
your child may display at school some sides of his or her personality that are 
not seen at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, ask the teacher to suggest ways you can help the child perform or 
behave better. No matter how angry or embarrassed you may be, don't resort to 
verbal abuse of the teacher. This may seem obvious, but some parents vent their 
parental frustrations by insulting, cursing and even threatening a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that the teacher simply wants to work toward the same goal you do: 
making your child more successful at school.

 FAST COMPANY 
</P>
<P>
 How good is freshman quarter-miler Malika Edmonson of St. Bernard? 
</P>
<P>
 Track promoter Don Franken wrote in a press release that Edmonson "is probably 
the greatest high school track prospect since Marion Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonson will make her debut in the high school portion of the Sunkist 
Invitational track meet Saturday at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. She will 
compete in the 500-yard race. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 students from 300 high schools will compete. In addition to 
Edmonson, Kaaron Conwright of Westchester will be one of the featured sprinters 
in the 50 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonson, 14, has already been impressive, setting a national age-group mark 
of 54.7 for the 400 meters last summer. Her time was better than the winning 
time of 55.45 in last year's State Meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonson's mother is Barbara Ferrell-Edmonson, USC women's track coach and a 
silver medalist in the 100 meters at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games and a 
gold medal winner on the 400-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Warren Edmonson, was the 1972 NCAA 100-meter champion from UCLA. 
NARROWING THE FIELD 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, San Fernando High School, led by Charles White, beat Palisades, 
12-10, to win the Los Angeles City Section football championship. It was the 
last time only one football title was up for grabs in a particular year. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, the Los Angeles Football Coaches Assn. would like to 
return to the days when only one team was crowned champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of LAFCA, which represents high school football coaches in the L.A. 
Unified School District, met last week to discuss revamping the postseason 
playoff format. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current playoff system, 49 teams are divided into the 4-A and 3-A 
divisions. There are six conferences and two leagues within each conference. 
The 16 teams with the best records in each division are selected to the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 This system proved to be inequitable because good teams from more competitive 
leagues were being left out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many problems selecting teams and seeding them in the 
playoffs," Fairfax Coach Terrel Ray said. "Everyone agrees that the Southern 
Pacific Conference is the toughest to play in. But when it comes to the 
playoffs, no one can agree on how many teams to take from that conference." 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches panel is considering a plan to have 49 teams compete for one 
championship. The schools would play a nine-game regular season and the 32 
teams with the best records would qualify for postseason play. The remaining 17 
teams would be invited to compete in a consolation tournament. HIGH MARKS 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard 6-2 forward Olympia Scott grabbed 39 rebounds and scored 16 points 
in a 60-16 win over Harvard-Westlake last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Her rebounding total tied Gina Atkins of Apple Valley Christian for second in 
the Southern Section for most rebounds in a game. Neysa Dunnings of Compton 
Regina Caeli had 45 rebounds to set the Southern Section mark during the 
1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Hake of Los Angeles Wilson had 53 rebounds in 1987 to set the state 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In four years, the Stanford-bound Scott has had 1,308 rebounds to rank seventh 
in the Southern Section. Terri Mann of San Diego Point Loma holds the state 
career rebounding record with 2,256. VIEW FROM THE TOP 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood won Southern Section boys' basketball titles in 1991 and 1992 
despite being a wild-card team. Now the Eagles will try to win a championship 
for the first time as the top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood Coach Bob Ingram was pleased with the seeding but tried to downplay 
its importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the seeding means much past the first round if you do win," 
Ingram said. "After the first round, you lose the home-court advantage and you 
never know whether you're going to be home or on the road four or five hours 
away." WELL-PLANTED SURPRISE 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy Coach Andrew Hunter checked his morning paper to see who the Nobles 
play in the first round of the Division IV-AA playoffs. But he failed to notice 
that his team was seeded fourth in the division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in shock," said Hunter said. "I didn't know until this afternoon when 
other coaches were congratulating me." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy (10-12 overall) finished second to Verbum Dei in the Santa Fe League. 
The Nobles drew last season's finalist St. Bernard, which received an at-large 
bid, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nobles are led by 5-9 senior guard Robert Carrillo, who is averaging 15.5 
points a game, 5-11 junior guard Aaron Zeleya (12 points) and 6-0 junior guard 
Pierre Elize (8 points). 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard proved to be the better team and won, 72-64, Tuesday night. 
OVERCOMING OBSTACLES 
</P>
<P>
 Yeshiva boys' basketball team practices outdoors because it does not have a 
gymnasium. After the third game of the season, the Panthers lost their best 
player to an injury. But that didn't stop the team from winning the Liberty 
League for the first time since it joined in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeshiva (12-10, 11-3) beat Providence, 61-54, Saturday to extend its winning 
streak to five games. Michael Strapp, a 6-2 forward, scored a team-high 27 
points for the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Strapp, who has been averaging 14.5 points and eight rebounds a game, replaced 
5-10 point guard David Perl as the team's leading scorer. Perl dislocated his 
right ankle during the third game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers play South Bay Lutheran in the first round of the Southern 
Section V-AA playoffs Saturday night at the Westside JCC. They won their first 
playoff game in six years last season and hope to reach at least the 
quarterfinals. SEAN WATERS

 The Little tepee is not small. It stands about 18 feet high and towers over 
the white picket fence that borders Edward F. Little's yard at 1170 Indian Hill 
Blvd. in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 The Littles would erect the tepee whenever their nieces and nephews came to 
visit, or for occasional educational field trips for school groups. So for the 
past 30 years, neighbors caught occasional glimpses of children playing in 
front of the buffalo painted on its canvas sides as they pulled into their 
driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Jan. 7, the Littles received a letter from the Community Development 
Department which stated that the tepee "detracted from the character of our 
neighborhoods" and violated the city's land use and development code. 
</P>
<P>
 The department issued an ultimatum: take down the tepee, purchase a $150 
permit for an "unattached accessory structure," or face a fine. The Littles 
complied and removed the tepee, but the incident has sparked a community 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The tepee) doesn't bother a soul except bureaucrats and people who think 
they should run our lives for us," said Conrad Casler, a neighbor who wrote a 
letter to the Claremont Courier to protest the city's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier Publisher Martin Weinberger added that the tepee has been embroiled in 
previous controversies. "In the '60s, we used the tepee in a Fourth of July 
celebration, and city officials told us we had to take it down -- they thought 
it might be interpreted as a Communist protest of the Vietnam War," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the issue is more a matter of codes than politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with whether it's a tepee or a yurt or an igloo," said 
Sharon Wood, director of community development. "It was an accessory structure 
without a permit, and it was up for a month, and it was large and visible from 
the public right of way." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood explained that when one of the Claremont Colleges wanted to erect a yurt 
a few years ago -- a Mongolian tentlike structure -- the students had to apply 
for and buy a $150 special use and development permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had applied for a permit, there would have been no problem. If he had 
left it up for just a weekend, we probably wouldn't have bothered," she said. 
"But it was up for a month, and many of us on staff kept driving by and seeing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Little tepee's big controversy has left family members pondering why the 
community is making such a fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I haven't dealt with it, but at some point I'll go down to 
City Hall and talk to them. So far, it's been a basic laugh for me," said Lance 
Little, who inherited the tepee from his father Edward, who built it. The tepee 
remains at his father's house, but Lance started putting it up and taking it 
down when his father tired of the chore.

YOUTH DRUG STUDY HAS MIXED RESULTS, BUT FEAR OF VIOLENCE IS GROWING; RESEARCH: 
COCAINE AND ALCOHOL USE BY HIGH SCHOOL UPPERCLASSMEN SHOWS DECLINE WHILE 
YOUNGER STUDENTS REPORT INCREASE IN MARIJUANA AND INHALANT USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A recently released survey has given Pasadena Unified School District students 
mixed marks on drug use. The same study sent a somber message on their exposure 
to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 2,800 Pasadena and Altadena students in grades four through 12 
was the second of five annual studies by the USC Institute for Health Promotion 
and Disease Prevention Research. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent results showed alcohol and cocaine to be on the decline with 
upperclassmen. Underclassmen and middle-school students, however, showed signs 
of increasing marijuana and inhalant use. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of grade level, the majority of students reported fear of violence. 
Many said they knew someone who had been shot or otherwise injured by gang 
violence, some fatally. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, conducted last spring, found that slightly more than 36% of 11th- 
and 12th-graders reported alcohol use in the preceding 30 days, down from about 
46% in 1992. The number of students in those grades who said they had consumed 
alcohol during the preceding week declined to 16.5% from 29.5% in 1992. Cocaine 
use among that group declined from 5.2% to 1.7% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Marijuana, however, made a comeback among ninth- and 10th-graders, with 12.6% 
having used that substance in the preceding 30 days, up from 7% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Among younger students, the survey contained both good and bad news. On the 
positive side, there was a 10% decline in the number of seventh- and 
eighth-graders who said they had tried alcohol -- 65.6%, compared with 75.2% in 
1992. But 5% more students sniffed glue, paint, gasoline and other noxious 
substances than in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette-smoking declined among younger students. Of those in grades four 
through six, 5.9% said they had tried cigarettes, compared with 8.8% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual survey is sponsored by Day One, a coalition of Pasadena and 
Altadena businesses, city agencies and nonprofit groups. The goal of the 
five-year study is to assess the effectiveness of drug programs for youths and 
determine ways to improve them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she was "pleasantly surprised" at the sharp drop in alcohol use, Day 
One Executive Director Francisca Neumann did not find the increased use of some 
other substances surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 She attributed the disparity to more focused efforts against alcohol and 
cocaine. "But on marijuana and inhalants, you don't see that message broadcast 
loud and clear as a no-no. They haven't been targeted as strongly," Neumann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Day One survey results were released shortly after the publication of 
national figures on school-age drug use compiled by the University of Michigan 
for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The national study showed that after 
years of steady decline, illicit drug use is making a comeback on some levels, 
particularly involving marijuana, LSD and amphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the national results, 28% of high school seniors admitted having 
had five or more drinks in one sitting during the two weeks preceding the 
survey. The local figure was half that, with 14.2% of Pasadena and Altadena 
upperclassmen reporting they had been drunk within the preceding 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 While the respondents may have sent mixed messages on the use of illicit 
substances, the statistics formed one clear message: An increasing cloud of 
violence hangs over students' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the local survey, 55% of ninth- and 10th-graders said they knew individuals 
injured or killed as a result of gang fights. Fifty-one percent feared being 
shot. Eleven percent carry a gun when they go out. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a third of 11th- and 12th-graders said they have had a firearm pointed 
at them. Two-thirds knew someone who had been shot and nearly half -- 48% -- 
said they knew someone who had died or been injured in a gang fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera J. Vignes, Pasadena Unified School District superintendent, said the 
statistics on violence were among the survey's most jarring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Day One survey, she said, "does not let us forget that we have to come 
together to ensure the safety of our children." Drug Use Survey 
</P>
<P>
 The USC Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research 
surveyed 2,800 Pasadena and Altadena students in grades four through 12 last 
spring. It was the second survey in a five-year annual study. 04,50,07,06,06

TROUBLE IN OLD PASADENA IS THE PRICE OF SUCCESS; REDEVELOPMENT: THE AREA HAS 
BECOME ONE OF THE LOS ANGELES REGION'S HOTTEST NIGHT SPOTS. BUT PUBLIC 
DRUNKENNESS AND YOUTHFUL ROWDINESS HAVE COME ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

<P>
 It's Friday night, and Old Pasadena is alive. Young adults in flannel shirts, 
leather jackets and boots cluster as tightly as racked pool balls, waiting to 
enter Q's billiards parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 The music of the Village People has dancers in a '70s trance at Club Shelter, 
and a lone saxophone player serenades all of Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Paul Carpenter's radio pipes up, tattling on a drunk who is pestering 
the people strolling through Old Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter handcuffs the middle-aged Altadena man on the sidewalk in front of 
La Bamba restaurant, its windows glowing with tiny white lights. A couple at a 
window table stare but quickly return to their Caribbean cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're drunk, and you're going to sleep this off," Carpenter says. 
</P>
<P>
 A while later, the radio blurts out again. Teen-agers are creating a stir at a 
movie house by trying to enter with outdated tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 A security guard chases them away, but Carpenter catches up and talks to one 
of the youths, a 16-year-old, telling him to get smart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police brutality," says one of four teen-age girls who stand by watching. The 
boy mutters an obscenity after his talk with the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a harassed celebrity, Old Pasadena is suffering in ways from its own 
success. The former grunge strip has become one of the Los Angeles area's 
hottest night spots. But public drunkenness and youthful unruliness also have 
come along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Those unwelcome elements could frighten off the older, more affluent visitors 
that the area wants to draw, patrons of restaurants with $25 entrees and art 
galleries that offer $5,900 sculptures. Put the brakes on new bars, nightclubs, 
pool halls and restaurants that serve booze, say some restaurant owners and 
merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 But their buildings' landlords turn surly at the mention of a formal 
moratorium. Don't erect barriers in the marketplace, especially in a struggling 
economy. Empty space could mean unpaid mortgages, which certainly isn't good 
for Old Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greedy landlords. We hear that," said Danny Mellinkoff, who owns a 
building on the corner of Fair Oaks Avenue and Colorado Boulevard. The property 
owner adds, "There are certain restaurants that are looking for protection and 
relief from competition." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has told the restaurateurs, bar operators, merchants and 
building owners to put their heads together and return March 22 with a proposed 
solution to Old Pasadena's ills. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Friday and Saturday nights it gets pretty rowdy and a bit uncontrolled," 
said Vice Mayor Kathryn Nack, whose district encompasses part of Old Pasadena. 
"There has to be a concerted effort to deal with that problem." 
</P>
<P>
 No one in Old Pasadena wants it to become another Westwood, a hot spot that 
cooled off years ago. Youth-related crimes -- a fatal gang shooting and a 
rampage by youths who failed to get into a movie premiere -- contributed to the 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Pasadena spent that same period metamorphosing from caterpillar to 
butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Boulevard, the hub of Old Pasadena, used to be home to dingy bars, 
thrift shops, prostitutes and vagrants, a place that middle-class folk would 
not dare approach after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad just didn't want us coming up here because the area was too bad. There 
were prostitutes all over the place," said Jennine Terzo, who inherited the 
35er bar on Colorado Boulevard from her late father, who took it over from his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 But persistent property owners and merchants, aided by redevelopment dollars 
and tax-motivated city officials, molded Old Pasadena into a smashing success. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that as many as 20,000 people crowd the boulevard and 
surrounding streets on a busy Friday or Saturday night. And though the 
recession and other factors have killed some restaurants and businesses, others 
move in, resulting in overall growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Pasadena generated about $700,000 in sales taxes for the city last year, 
about twice as much as it produced five years ago, according to city 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 But some people drink themselves into a stupor hopping around Old Pasadena's 
50-plus bars, nightclubs and alcohol-serving restaurants. Others, including 
minors, bring their own alcohol, drinking in parking lots and alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey of police calls to the city's bars in 1992 and 1993 points to 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The area had a lock on the three top trouble spots. The Shelter dance club 
drew 87 police responses, while Q's had 72, and the 35er had 56. Police records 
show their responses most frequently involved public drunkenness, but assaults 
with a deadly weapon and other serious crimes brought out police on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department does not keep annual crime statistics for Old Pasadena. 
But a spot check comparing police calls in July and December, 1992, with the 
same months in 1993 indicates the number of calls remains relatively stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Disturbances, including fights, public drunkenness and problems with 
transients, accounted for the majority of calls in each month. A small number 
of calls were for more serious crimes, including assault with a deadly weapon, 
robbery and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokesman said he does not see a major crime problem in Old Pasadena, 
but does see a threat in a changing clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is great concern in the Police Department as to how we're going to 
manage it," Lt. Wayne Hiltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police patrols have been beefed up in recent years. There used to be two cops 
walking foot beats in Old Pasadena on Friday and Saturday nights. Now there are 
10. Plans are under way to improve lighting and spruce up streets and alleys, 
but city officials and business people say more must be done. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A moratorium on businesses that serve alcohol and a police crackdown on public 
drunkenness and youthful loiterers are two suggestions that surfaced during 
recent meetings of the Old Pasadena Business and Professional Assn., whose 
membership includes about 350 property and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreements flare among the association's members, but discussions continue 
toward a delicate consensus. Association officials say they want to come up 
with a solution before one is imposed by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fear that Big Brother is going to come in and try to control 
everything," said Raymond G. Leier, an art gallery owner who is president-elect 
of the association. "All of us created this together. We have demonstrated in 
the past that we have the ability to identify a problem and solve it."

TOPICS / ENVIRONMENT; LANDFILL PERMIT RULED INVALID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court Judge tentatively ruled last week that the county-issued 
operating permit for the Puente Hills Landfill is invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Diane Wayne has so far allowed the landfill's operator, the 
Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County, to continue accepting trash from 
throughout the San Gabriel Valley and the southeastern portion of the county 
while she further studies arguments from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's latest decision involves a group of Hacienda Heights homeowners and 
the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District, who sued the county for 
allegedly approving an operating permit for the landfill last year based on 
inadequate environmental studies. Wayne has ruled that the studies do not 
adequately address the effects a proposed expansion of the landfill would have 
on nearby ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wayne sticks by her tentative ruling, the Sanitation Districts will have to 
complete new environmental studies on the ground water issue and then again ask 
the County Board of Supervisors to approve a permit allowing continued 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill's last operating permit expired in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In a defeat for homeowners, Wayne ruled in October that the landfill can 
remain open while the facility's operators fix the environmental studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Hacienda Heights homeowners and other landfill opponents have vowed to keep 
fighting to close the landfill. Jeffrey Dintzer, an attorney representing the 
homeowners and the school district, said he will be in a better position to 
argue for an immediate closure of the dump if Wayne stands by her tentative 
decision to invalidate the landfill's operating permit.

TOPICS / EDUCATION; LATINO CLUB LEADER QUITS IN BIAS DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of a Latino student group at Mt. San Antonio College resigned 
after a white student filed a grievance against the club, accusing it of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy erupted after Nicole Lemottee approached Valentin Pingarron, 
then president of Movimiento Estudantil Chicano De Aztlan (MEChA), during club 
sign-up day on Feb. 2. Lemottee, an 18-year-old marine biology major, said she 
had been interested in joining the club because she is engaged to a Mexican 
American man. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemottee said, however, she had some misgivings about speakers sponsored by 
the student group who she felt were biased against whites. Lemottee said that 
when she said so to Pingarron, he told her she would not be welcome in the 
group because she was white and couldn't understand the group's background and 
issues. Lemottee filed a grievance against the club with the school's student 
association on Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not welcome in their club and that's reverse discrimination," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pingarron, a second-year journalism major, contended that Lemottee expressed 
views that ran contrary to the group's philosophy of helping the Latino 
community, and demanded explanations for the club's activities.  
</P>
<P>
 Pingarron said he told Lemottee he would not welcome her membership after she 
expressed support for ideas such as increasing militarization of the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 But the grievance spurred a debate within the club over its membership 
policies. According to acting President Anita Sibayan, Pingarron resigned after 
the club refused to support his position that political views should be a test 
of membership and that whites should not be allowed to join. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not a racist or separatist group," Sibayan said.

TOPICS / HEALTH; AIDS PROGRAM DRAWS 200 STUDENTS; EDUCATION: INSPIRED BY A 
TEACHER WHO HAS THE DISEASE, SAN GABRIEL HIGH YOUTHS ATTEND SEMINAR ON HIV AND 
SAFE SEX. THEY WILL TAKE MESSAGE TO THEIR CLASSMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 students at San Gabriel High School in Alhambra gave up their 
scheduled day off Friday to learn more about combatting HIV, the virus that 
causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 They were inspired by English teacher Joe Cornish's public announcement that 
he has AIDS and the AIDS-related death of a school counselor's best friend. 
Sponsored by Pasadena's AIDS Service Center, the program on HIV and AIDS 
awareness included lectures and instruction in safe sex, including the proper 
use of condoms by rolling them onto bananas. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who took part in the session will visit classrooms to discuss safe 
sex during the school's AIDS Awareness Week from March 7-11, said Susan Cohen, 
coordinator of education and training at the service center. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong program concluded in the school's auditorium, where two 
HIV-positive women, Sarah Hart, 29, and Viviana Martinez, 21 -- along with 
Hart's AIDS-diagnosed daughter Jessica, 10 -- discussed how they cope with the 
deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad because even after all these years, people really are not 
listening," said Hart, who told the students she probably was infected with HIV 
in 1982 when she was 17 but was not officially diagnosed until Jessica fell ill 
with pneumonia three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "(People) don't realize that there are choices they can make in their lives 
that can save them from AIDS," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica quieted the audience when she talked about how her elementary-school 
friends reacted when she told them she had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to have a whole handful of good friends," she said in a tiny voice 
that was barely picked up by the microphone. "But then, when I told them (about 
having AIDS), I found out that I didn't have such good friends after all." 
</P>
<P>
 Students said the program had shaken off their "It won't happen to me" 
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that makes an impact is when people with AIDS come and talk about 
it," said junior Carly Sheffer, 16. She added that Cornish, the teacher who 
helped make AIDS awareness an issue at the school, could not make the program 
because of illness.

COMMUNITY NEWS: POMONA; ACCOUNTING FIRM SELECTED TO AUDIT 2 CAL POLY OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal Poly Pomona announced this week that the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche 
has been selected to conduct a comprehensive audit of two campus offices that 
have been embroiled in controversy the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes five months after the California State University chancellor's 
office recommended the review in a report that found numerous policy violations 
in actions related to Cal Poly's continuing education office and its 
educational foundation, which manages campus services such as the bookstores 
and cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the audit has been delayed because of problems in obtaining a 
usable bid. The audit by the Wilton, Conn.-based firm is expected to take six 
weeks, but a Cal Poly spokeswoman said Tuesday she did not know how much the 
audit would cost or when it would begin.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; ST. JOHN'S TO GIVE EX-WORKERS JOB PRIORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After hearing complaints from employees, administrators at St. John's Hospital 
and Health Center have modified their agreement with the 1,750 workers who lost 
their jobs Feb. 7 because of the facility's earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Lamoureux, chief operating officer for St. John's Hospital, told 
employees at a Sunday farewell gathering that they would be given priority for 
available jobs over other applicants when the hospital reopens. Also, he said, 
St. John's employees who are rehired would retain their seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither provision had been part of the employee agreement, according to 
Lamoureux. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was loudly applauded by a crowd of about 300. The crowd included some 
of the 250 employees retained for outpatient services as well as severed 
employees, some of whom have found new jobs and others who have not. 
</P>
<P>
 One who lost her job, Donni Esposti, a care coordinator with the hospital for 
28 years, said she didn't think the hospital had any choice but to do what it 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never going to be the same," she said. "We're going to go down in beds. 
I'm sorry some of us lost our jobs, but we can reapply. I'm starting a new job 
Monday in home care." 
</P>
<P>
 At the employee gathering, where hot dogs, popcorn, nachos, Cokes and cookies 
were served, former colleagues embraced one another and talked about job 
prospects and mulling over the latest conciliatory move by the administrators 
of a hospital most called "a family." 
</P>
<P>
 Another former employee, who was nearly four months pregnant and carried her 
husband on her St. John's health care plan, worried about paying her health 
insurance premium after the hospital stops paying it at the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday employees' gathering came a day after St. John's held another party 
for the public. There, hospital administrators and Santa Monica Mayor Judy Abdo 
assured those in attendance that the hospital would be doing business on an 
outpatient basis immediately and would eventually build a "better" care center 
for the community of Santa Monica. KATHLEEN KELLEHER

COVER STORY; PUTTING A PRICE TAG ON PEACE OF MIND; PASADENA GLEN NEEDS $1.5 
MILLION TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST FLOODS. HOW MUCH SHOULD BE SPENT TO SAVE A SPECIAL 
SLICE OF SUBURBIA FOR 38 FAMILIES? 
</P>

<P>
 Linda Kamb and her neighbors in Pasadena Glen have few doubts about why they 
risk floods and fire to live in a verdant canyon in the foothills above 
Pasadena. They love the thick canopy of California live oaks, the melody of 
birds singing in the mornings, and especially the murmuring creek that lulls 
them to sleep at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, a wave of liquid mud crashed down the creek bed near their 
houses, and onto the street, raising the brook's gentle lullaby to the 
deafening roar of a locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a terrific rumble," said Kamb, a resident in the Glen since 1938. 
"It sounded like a freight train." 
</P>
<P>
 A brief torrent of rain the night of Feb. 7 turned the fire-bared earth of 
Pasadena Glen into a loose mixture of mud and water that cascaded down the 
steep slopes behind the Glen, carrying thousands of cubic yards of logs, rocks 
and sediment along the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 At the intersection of the channel and Pasadena Glen Road, the flow burst 
through sandbag barriers and spilled into the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Awesome as it was, last week's mudflow was only a preview of what could happen 
during heavier storms. The storm, which brought less than an inch and a half of 
rain, was modest for the Glen, where 3 to 6 inches in a 24-hour period is 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 Debris barriers that could have contained the deluge were under construction 
when it hit. But even if the work had been completed, it would have been little 
help in a larger storm, said Bob Dean, district manager for the U.S. Soil 
Conservation Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The unique nature of the flood threat in the Glen has underscored questions 
about what cost is appropriate to save the 38 homes left after October's fire. 
Long-term measures to protect against potentially life-endangering mudflows 
would cost close to $1 million after almost $500,000 has already been spent. 
</P>
<P>
 The county public works department had just finished clearing accumulated 
rocks and tree limbs from a barrier above the Glen when the storm hit. The next 
day, the barrier of six-foot steel posts set several feet apart to catch large 
objects was full again, nearly overflowing with boulders. The bars were bent 
from the force of the onslaught, and one massive boulder, six feet in diameter, 
jutted out between them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those had come through, they would have taken out houses," said Linda 
Williams, president of the Pasadena Glen Improvement Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A mudflow begins when sediment and debris collect in narrow mountain ravines, 
forming a natural dam that traps water, rocks and dirt behind it. When enough 
accumulates, the dam bursts, and a flash flood rips down the canyon at more 
than 50 miles an hour, Dean said. Rocks hurtling along with it create the 
trainlike rumble that residents remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Stripped of vegetation by the Oct. 27 fire, the hills above the Glen are 
especially vulnerable to erosion during storms. Foliage cushions the force of 
the rain, root systems hold soil in place, and trees and chaparral can brake 
tumbling boulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Without these protections the mountain slopes act as a funnel that crumbles in 
on itself. And while other canyon communities face mudslides, Pasadena Glen has 
an unusually large watershed -- 600 acres -- that presses through a 17-foot 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, other canyon areas have debris basins -- large reservoirs to 
collect the mud and rocks. But Pasadena Glen, developed in the early 1900s, was 
built so high that there is no place above it to put such a basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Glen's flood-control system calls for allowing the water to rush 
down channels and through three culverts running under the road, each one to 
five feet in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, the stream of mud and boulders clogged the three pipes, and the 
backed-up mud swept down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Delia was watching the weather report Feb. 7 evening while a light drizzle 
sprinkled his house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly it sounded like they were moving heavy equipment into the Glen, and 
then it sounded louder," he said. "Everything started to shake. I looked out. . 
.and saw two feet of mud just bashing down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Delia's neighbor Pauline Doucet recalled, "It was like an earthquake that 
wouldn't stop. You could really feel the shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the initial surge subsided, viscous mud oozed down the street at 5 to 10 
miles an hour. "It was like warm pudding," Glen resident Jack Brock recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-foot-high barricades, erected by residents as a precautionary measure, 
kept most of the mud off their lawns, but the road was inundated. At that 
point, the residents had to decide whether to remain in their homes or trudge 
through knee-deep sludge to escape the muck. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters helped Doucet and her stepdaughter Dawn Pickard escape, but not 
before Pickard's boots slipped off three times in the mud. Brad Dickason 
carried his frightened, 75-pound golden retriever to high ground. Others like 
Brock, a 26-year resident of the Glen and veteran of the 1969 mudslides, chose 
to stay, assuming that the worst was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd all been preached to here since the fire that gloom and doom is on its 
way," Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
 So why live there at all? 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have street lights, we don't have traffic, we don't have noise," 
said Gala Conrad, watching her 6-year-old son, Kyle, struggle to shovel mud off 
the lawn the day after the storm. "The boys go out collecting tadpoles and 
frogs. . . . We get our own little piece of heaven up here in suburbia." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young grew up in the Glen. He slid down the road in his truck in a 1980 
mudslide, and his home burned down in last year's fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he intends to stay. Young and his father now live in trailers on their 
burnt-out home sites, and are planning to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "You love (this place) for what it is," he said. "You take what it throws back 
at you, but you love it for what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rocks and mud that it threw back last week may have been the result of 
unlucky timing as much as an act of fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean said the bulk of the mess would have been avoided if several construction 
projects had been completed before the rain struck. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, the Soil Conservation Service awarded a nearly $200,000 contract 
to Fontana-based Cunningham-Davis Corp. to build a second barrier, known as a 
trash rack, at the top of the Glen, as well as smaller barriers along a channel 
flowing into the Glen from Winifred Canyon. Dean said these barriers, which 
weren't in place when last week's storm struck, would have held back debris 
that clogged culverts and caused flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor had also begun work to line the Winifred Canyon channel with 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor was nearing completion of the projects when the mud flow struck 
the Glen. The steel support structure for the Winifred channel was completed, 
and the concrete would have been poured that week. The torrent washed away 
nearly two weeks of work, twisting the steel bars into a spaghetti-like jumble 
that collected at the bottom of the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The mud flow also damaged foundation work on the new trash rack under 
construction north of the existing one. 
</P>
<P>
 John O'Neill, Cunningham-Davis' construction superintendent, said his workers 
were moving as fast as they could and had more than a week to go before 
completing the projects. Last week, Soil Conservation Service officials told 
the contractor to work his crews around the clock to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, volunteers working under the direction of the Forest Service continued 
laying straw matting down on a 70-acre portion of the mountainside above the 
Glen. The mats, which the Forest Service purchased for about $180,000, are 
designed to hold the soil in place during rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents said the only way to control the debris flows in the Glen is 
to construct large, boxlike culverts at each of three points where the creek 
flows beneath the road. The existing culverts are small, and large boulders and 
branches clog them, causing the water and debris to jump the channel as it did 
Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Even car-size boulders 8 feet in diameter could roll through the larger 
culverts, which together might cost $900,000 or more to build, according to 
Terry McGough, a Glen resident who lost his home in the Oct. 27 fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean supports the idea. "The culverts would probably solve about 95% of all of 
the problems," he said. "It's a more permanent solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Tizani of the state Office of Emergency Services said his agency and the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency have determined that the Glen may be 
eligible for funding that would help build those culverts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the residents need to find a local sponsor to pick up about 6% of the 
cost. They're still negotiating with the county for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The culverts and other issues affecting the Glen, such as the county's 
insistence that the residents provide turnouts for emergency vehicles, are 
being considered by a task force of homeowners and county officials. Their main 
job is to recommend guidelines for rebuilding in the Glen to the County Board 
of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the October fire that destroyed 27 of the Glen's 65 homes, the Soil 
Conservation Service and the Forest Service have spent close to $500,000 on 
flood-control projects in and around the Glen. Last week, the Soil Conservation 
Service picked up the $50,000 bill for cleaning up the mess of boulders, dirt 
and branches left by the storm. It is unclear, however, who will pay $30,000 or 
more to clean out the Glen's debris barriers after future storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean said it is rare for the federal government to pay 100% of the costs of 
such flood-control projects in disaster areas. Usually, he said, a local agency 
has to help pay. But, in this case, the local agency is the financially 
strapped Kinneloa Irrigation District, which lost many of its ratepayers when 
their homes were burned in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district successfully argued that it suffered from economic 
hardship, clearing the way for federal funding of some of the flood control 
projects under way in the Glen. Also, Dean said, requests for funding were 
shoved along by local lawmakers and President Clinton, who met with Glen 
residents during a recent visit to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most cases we'll come in after a flood and help the community rebuild (its 
flood protection) to existing levels," Dean said. "But in the case of the Glen 
an exception was made because of the extreme danger to life and property. We've 
gone more into the preventive mode." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glen residents have taken prevention into their own hands too, creating an 
emergency neighborhood telephone network and adopting a policy to evacuate 
during rains. But as last week's flood showed, some remained despite the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed county regulation may put the unwritten code of the Glen -- "Live 
here at your own risk" -- in writing. Schindler said the county is creating a 
flood plain map of the Glen that will identify areas most endangered by floods. 
Residents who live on those sites would be required to adhere to stricter 
building codes and a warning would be included in the deed of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Some question the cost of protecting the Glen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess when you get to the bottom line, they should never have allowed 
anyone to build in this Glen. There's just too many problems," resident Paul 
Kolar said. "I suppose it would have been cheaper to just buy everyone out and 
turn this into a glen for hiking."  
</P>
<P>
 Anna McConnell surveyed what was left of her front yard the day after the 
storm. Water flowed in channels through clumps of mud, and a few broken cacti 
-- remnants of her prized garden -- lay strewn on the ground. Although the 
mudflow washed away the cacti, some eight feet tall, she said it won't uproot 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here 42 years and this is the worst I've seen," she said. "But I'm 
not going to move out. My husband and I built this place and I'm staying."

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BEVERLY HILLS: South Beverly Drive shoppers will get valet parking courtesy of 
the city until a city-owned parking structure damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake 
is repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The 240-space parking facility at 216 S. Beverly Drive will require about $1 
million in repairs, which may take up to five months to complete, City Manager 
Mark Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing that much parking for so long will have a "huge impact on businesses on 
South Beverly Drive," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday approved a plan under which the city will pay 
about $5,000 per month for a valet company to park as many as 350 vehicles per 
day in the 200 blocks of El Camino and Reeves drives. The Chamber of Commerce 
and the Southwest Homeowners Assn. approved the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to seek partial reimbursement of the costs from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city has agreed to pay $510,000 for a small parcel owned by the Beverly 
Hills Land Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12,000-square-foot lot is on 3rd Street between Maple Drive and Foothill 
Road, City Manager Mark Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been looking into acquiring additional land in the so-called 
industrial area near the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase is contingent upon an environmental review of the property to 
verify there is no hazardous waste. The city already owns nine acres of 
developable land in the same area, intended for such municipal uses as a 
community center.

COVER STORY; A FLOW OF FUNDS TO KEEP GLEN ON FIRM GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Protecting Pasadena Glen's 38 houses from mud and debris flows is an expensive 
proposition. Here are some of the expenditures approved or pending with the 
federal government.They do not include any federal or state assistance to 
individual homeowners: 
</P>
<P>
 * $200,000 to build a second large debris barrier at the top, or northernmost 
end, of the Glen, and smaller barriers along the stream to contain debris 
during flooding. Also, to line with concrete a 570-foot section of another 
channel that feeds into the Glen from Winifred Canyon. Paid for by the U.S. 
Soil Conservation Service. 
</P>
<P>
 * $50,000 to clean out the existing debris barrier at the top of the Glen from 
rains of years past. The county, Federal Emergency Management Agency and the 
state Office of Emergency Services all chipped in to pay for the January 
cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 * $50,000 to remove sediment, boulders and other debris from the Glen in the 
wake of the Feb. 7 mud flow. The Soil Conservation Service is picking up the 
bill for this, officials said, because it was responsible for ongoing 
construction projects when last week's mud flow hit. 
</P>
<P>
 * $180,000 for straw matting that volunteers are laying down on about 70 acres 
of denuded hillside above the Glen. The Forest Service, which has jurisdiction 
over that portion of the Glen's watershed, is picking up the tab for this 
erosion control effort. 
</P>
<P>
 * An estimated $900,000 proposed to build three large culverts that car-size 
boulders could pass through. Seen as a long-term solution to the mudflow 
problem.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: SUSHI CHEF'S CREATIONS CAN BE A MOVING EXPERIENCE; FOOD: 
FROM 'DANCING SAWDUST' ON PIZZA TO OTHER ONE-OF-A-KIND DISHES, YOSHINOBU 
OKATOMI AIMS TO PLEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his quest to create unforgettable dishes, sushi chef Yoshinobu Okatomi has 
taken his "sushi pizza" to the limit: He tops it with ultra-thin strips of 
dried fish that, once heated, wriggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "My customers think that it's still alive and don't eat until the pieces cool 
down and stop moving," said Okatomi, owner of Sushi Bar Yoshida in Pasadena. "I 
call (the dried fish strips) 'dancing sawdust.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Regulars say the ability of Okatomi to humor them while pleasing their palates 
is what draws them back week after week, despite the tab. The typical customer 
will spend $15 or more for lunch and at least $20 for dinner, Okatomi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated in a small strip mall at Foothill Boulevard and Altadena Drive, 
Yoshida offers a variety of specialty and traditional sushi dishes. The tiny 
restaurant, which can seat about two dozen, is strip-mall in decor: formica 
tables, linoleum-tile floor. Service is friendly and prompt -- Okatomi is the 
lone chef. He employs one waitress and one kitchen helper. 
</P>
<P>
 Okatomi prides himself on customer service: He's willing to mix any 
combination of rice, seaweed, seafood and spices, so long as he has the 
ingredients, which are displayed behind the glass at the sushi bar. 
</P>
<P>
 While working for 10 years at various Japanese restaurants in the Los Angeles 
area, he found his bosses discouraged him from deviating from traditional sushi 
preparation. Even worse, he said, he didn't get to mingle with customers 
because he was usually in the kitchen. Two years ago he got fed up and opened 
Yoshida, bringing more than 100 customers with him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even Okatomi's biggest fans wouldn't keep spending lunch hours at 
Yoshida if the fish weren't fresh. "You know it's fresh when you walk in the 
door and you can't even smell the fish," said one customer. "You don't find 
that at all sushi bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Okatomi said he picks out fresh fish daily at a Downtown Los Angeles market. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular Yoshida dishes include the $8.25 tiger shrimp roll (seaweed and rice 
rolled around shrimp tempura and vegetables) and the $4.50 oyster sundae 
(oysters in the shell, with smelt eggs, green onion, spices and a quail egg). 
And, of course, the $8.25 sushi pizza (chunks of fish and cream cheese, topped 
with strips of dried bonito, atop a blanket of seaweed and rice). 
</P>
<P>
 It's often cheaper to skip the elaborate dishes, such as tiger and California 
rolls, and buy the more traditional and simple sushi dishes, such as yellowtail 
and salmon handrolls (less than $4 apiece). Yoshida's has a $6.75 bargain lunch 
that includes chunks of yellowtail, salmon, shrimp and octopus and a handroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Still a bit leery about eating sushi? Okatomi understands. Until he started 
drinking sake at age 18 in Japan, he would insist his mother cook his seafood, 
even though the rest of the family ate theirs raw. After he began drinking sake 
regularly, he said, his taste buds warmed up to raw fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Sushi Bar Yoshida is at 2525 E. Foothill Blvd. in Pasadena; (818) 793-9944. 
Generally open 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 5 to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday 
(11 p.m. Friday night) and 5 to 11 p.m. Saturday. Closed Sunday.

EX-ATHLETIC DIRECTOR BALAK DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Balak, a former San Clemente High School athletic director who recently 
devoted much time to St. Margaret's Episcopal School, died Monday of an 
apparent heart attack, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 His death at age 52 stunned members of the St. Margaret's school community, 
where Balak was an active and beloved member. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials recalled Wednesday he could be seen nearly every day on 
campus, wearing white overalls as he tirelessly shared his talent as a 
carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dana Point resident and his family, including two young daughters, went to 
almost every sporting event at the school, and Balak had recently agreed to 
coach the school's track team. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anyone who in one way or another wasn't affected by John," Pastor 
Mike Wallens said. "He was always talking with the students. He would always 
strike up a conversation with people. He loved the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Arcadia on May 17, 1941, Balak attended St. Francis School, where he 
played baseball and basketball. He attended St. John's Seminary and later 
graduated from Loyola College. He taught English, Latin and reading at San 
Clemente High School for several years. He also coached several sports and 
served for a time as the school's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Balak started a construction business during his teaching years, which 
eventually became a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife of 12 years, Joyce, a secretary at St. Margaret's; 
daughters Marissa, 11 and Mara, 9; and two step-children, Mark, 29, and Megan, 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held today at 3:30 p.m. in the chapel at St. 
Margaret's Episcopal School, 31641 La Novia in San Juan Capistrano. A memorial 
Mass will be held Friday at 10:30 a.m. at St. Timothy Catholic Church, 25001 
Nueva Vista Drive in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, the family has requested that memorial gifts be made to 
St. Margaret's Episcopal School for "The John Balak Memorial Athletic Fund" and 
"The Balak Family Educational Fund" at 31641 La Novia, San Juan Capistrano, 
Calif. 92675.

PIVOTAL VOTE ON WEDAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The cities of Orange County face a pivotal vote today which will 
significantly affect the residents and businesses of our area. They will at the 
League of Cities meeting decide the future of Hank Wedaa, the current chairman 
of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 During his six years on the board, Wedaa has spearheaded many critical reforms 
and has gained the respect and support of many businesses in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 We have trusted him over the last six years and should continue to do so for 
his last year on the board -- he has decided to retire next year. In December 
we will find a qualified successor to fill his shoes. Until then, let us join 
together as a county and back the individual who has successfully represented 
us in the past.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRIME HITS HOME, ALARMS VOTERS; ELECTIONS: A SERIES OF 
WELL-PUBLICIZED KILLINGS PUTS TORRANCE RESIDENTS ON EDGE. ISSUE DOMINATES 
MAYORAL, COUNCIL CAMPAIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Torrance City Council candidate Marcia Cribbs walks the precincts, she 
often speaks to residents through peepholes, screen doors, intercoms, even 
fences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you cannot even see them," Cribbs said. "They'll say, before they 
open the door, 'Who are you?' They are afraid to open the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates are coming back from precinct walks with similar stories. 
Crime, or at least the fear of it, they say, is No. 1 on the list of voters' 
concerns. As a consequence, the issue has dominated campaigning for the March 8 
City Council and mayoral elections, even though the candidates' stands on the 
issue and solutions to the problem sound much the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will choose among two candidates for mayor, 11 candidates for three 
council seats and three candidates for city clerk. City Treasurer Linda Barnett 
is running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other middle-class communities nationwide, crime has hit home, or at 
least uncomfortably close to home, in Torrance. Well-publicized shootings at 
Del Amo Fashion Center and the Redondo Beach Galleria, followed by the slayings 
of a Manhattan Beach police officer, the daughter of an El Segundo councilman 
and two Palos Verdes Estates police officers, have forced candidates to try to 
come up with solutions, even if their city faces another year of budget 
constraints.  
</P>
<P>
 "More and more, people have heard of or know victims of a crime," said City 
Council candidate Mike Mauno. "Crime is everywhere, and people are realizing it 
is everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance Police Department reports that crime rose 4% last year. Except 
for a 2% drop in 1992, crime in the city has risen 4% every year since 1988, 
according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest percentage increase in violent crime was in the number of 
homicides: from three in 1992 to 10 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But the number of rapes dropped 14%, and robberies dropped 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may just be the perception or fear of crime," said Torrance Police Officer 
Don Sherwood. "But if it is the perception, it may just as well be the real 
thing. We have got to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 One crime that raised the level of fear among residents happened in a shopping 
mall. In March, Michael Ellis, 21, an employee of Aladdin's Castle, was shot to 
death in a robbery at the popular Del Amo Fashion Center arcade. The assailant 
was not caught, and the incident prompted police to beef up patrols at the 
sprawling retail center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, an intruder entered a couple's north Torrance home through 
an unlocked door, tied up Lynn Finzel, 28, and assaulted her. When her husband, 
Joseph Finzel, entered the room, the assailant shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant then shot Lynn Finzel, who survived. Randy Eugene Garcia, 22, of 
Oregon, was arrested and charged in the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 Area residents' nerves had been frayed since April, 1992, when riots in Los 
Angeles spilled over into nearby Inglewood. Since then, gun stores all over the 
South Bay have reported a sharp rise in business. Sharpshooter Range in 
Torrance had trouble keeping guns and ammunition in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents have installed screen doors made of heavy metal, which are 
difficult to punch through. In the Hollywood Riviera, a high-income beachfront 
area of the city, many residents have installed motion detector lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "You walk down the street, and lights follow you," said Glenn Tanner, a member 
of the homeowners association. He said heightened concern about crime is 
prevalent throughout the neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 Torrance residents are not alone. The percentage of Americans who put crime 
issues at the top of the nation's problems jumped from 21% in June to 43% last 
month, a Los Angeles Times poll shows. Violent crime actually dropped by 3% 
nationally in the first six months of 1993, according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Torrance area may be relatively safe, officials still are 
grappling with issues that a decade ago were associated only with urban areas.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was a real concern when people started seeing kids wearing gang attire 
at the mall," said Councilwoman Dee Hardison, who is running for mayor. "It 
made them nervous. . . . We used to think it was (another city's) gangs. But 
that is no longer necessarily the case. They're here." 
</P>
<P>
 Said her opponent, Councilman Bill Applegate: "You have to ask yourself, 'Why 
do we have parks if we can't use them safely, or libraries, or our own homes?' 
If you can't feel safe, nothing else is relevant." Other candidates have spoken 
out on the issue, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate and council candidate Dan Walker were the only candidates endorsed 
by the Torrance Police Officers Assn., although, according to the latest 
campaign finance statements, the group contributed $250 to Joe Martinez, $150 
to Joe Quinones and $250 to Mike Botello -- all of them council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates are promoting expanded Neighborhood Watch programs, police reserves 
and more volunteer help for the department. The additional eyes and ears, 
candidates say, will help spot problems before they get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't hired Wyatt Earp to take care of it, so it means you have to 
expect Neighborhood Watch or community-based policing," Botello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some candidates want to take community-based policing a step farther. At a 
candidates' debate Sunday, Mauno suggested the formation of a Public Safety 
Advisory Committee, and Candidate Burton Fletcher made a similar proposal for a 
police commission. Both bodies would respond to residents' concerns about the 
Police Department and crime in their neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city needs a group totally focused on this issue," said Mauno, who added 
that many residents may feel too intimidated to take their problems to the 
police or City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, in one of the few disagreements the campaign has seen so far on the 
crime issue, called the committee unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need layer upon layer of committees and commissions," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WOMAN'S GENEROSITY MAY HAVE BEEN HER FATAL FLAW IN THE END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tairree Lynne West had always been one to help others. 
</P>
<P>
 When her best friend died several years ago, she adopted the woman's daughter. 
When a troubled high school friend needed a place to stay, she offered her 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Generosity may have been her tragic flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect that those who stabbed and strangled West in her El Segundo 
apartment last week included Erica Olson, 20, a homeless friend to whom West 
had given a house key. The assailants also slashed the throat of West's adopted 
daughter, Ashley, 12, and gagged her 6-month-old daughter, Carlie. Both girls 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson is the friend West chose to style her hair for her wedding in 1992. 
West's husband is in the Army and stationed in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said Olson might have used her key to let herself and three other 
assailants into West's apartment during the early morning hours of Feb. 9.  
</P>
<P>
 West, 25, had allowed Olson, an El Segundo High School dropout, to stay with 
her occasionally "out of the goodness of her own heart," said Alan West, 
Tairree West's father and a city councilman.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of my claims to fame is being able to put myself in somebody else's shoes 
and see things from their point of view," Alan West said, "but (in this case) I 
absolutely can't."  
</P>
<P>
 He said the two young women met years before at school and had kept in touch.  
</P>
<P>
 His daughter "saw people who were down and out and had a strong need to help 
them," West said.  
</P>
<P>
 Tairree West's apartment was ransacked and several compact discs and two 
stereos were stolen and later pawned, police said. A bloodied, eight-inch knife 
was found at the scene -- its blade in one room and handle in another. 
</P>
<P>
 During the attack, Ashley was left with a nine-inch gash from her ear to her 
throat. Ashley and Carlie now will be raised by Allene and Alan West, the 
councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson and her boyfriend, Robert Brendon Foster, 18, were arrested a few hours 
after the attack. Linnette O'Neill Blocker, 18, and Marcus Terral Brewington, 
19, were arrested the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives say Foster was angry with West because West had told him she did 
not want him in her apartment. She suspected him of stealing $100 from her 
car's ashtray, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four are expected to be charged with murdering West and attempting to 
murder Ashley, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Graff Levine. They are scheduled 
to be arraigned March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Tairree West was adopted by Alan and Allene West, who owned an El Segundo auto 
repair shop, when she was 4 or 5. The little girl got into some trouble at 
school, Alan West said, but as she grew older, she settled down and began 
helping others.  
</P>
<P>
 "She once brought home a classmate who had run away from home," he recalled. 
"We had to find out who she was and call her parents and let them know their 
child was doing all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Tairree West graduated from El Segundo High School in 1986 and enrolled the 
next year at El Camino Community College. She was taking an algebra class there 
this semester and had planned to study English or psychology at a four-year 
college in the fall, her family said. 
</P>
<P>
 She met her husband, Karl Davis of Manhattan Beach, at the college, and in 
December, 1992, they married. When Davis was stationed in Georgia with the 
Army, she decided not to join him because they feared he would be sent to 
Somalia, and she would be left alone in an unfamiliar state. 
</P>
<P>
 She stayed with her parents until six months ago, when she moved into the 
apartment on Imperial Avenue. In addition to taking care of her children and 
going to class, she worked part time at her brother Steve's El Segundo cleaning 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister is the epitome of what society should be doing to help the 
homeless," Steve West said. But "she helped and look what happened to her. She 
got burned." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley is doing well, Allene West said. The 30 stitches that closed the gash 
in her neck were removed Monday and the scar likely will be hidden under her 
chin, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Ashley is expected to return to El Segundo Middle School, where she is a 
sixth-grader, and to continue studying dance and acting at a Hollywood studio. 
She visited Disneyland on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo residents were shaken by the slaying and the savage attack on a 
child, but not all of them were surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could happen anywhere," said Bill Davis, 60.  
</P>
<P>
 Sally Mau, 50, owner of a gift shop in downtown El Segundo, said the slaying 
has heightened fears in the secluded community.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure this will give fuel to the people who don't want (outsiders) to be 
here," Mau said. "But you can't just shut people out." 
</P>
<P>
 J.B. Wise, an El Segundo councilman and close friend of the West family, said 
the city might need to bolster its police force. He said he might recommend 
boosting its spending on the department from $8.5 million to $10 million over 
the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sign of the times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members were surprised by the outpouring of support from the community. 
More than 600 friends and community members attended Tairree West's funeral 
Saturday at St. John's Lutheran Church. A trust fund has been established to 
raise money to educate Ashley and Carlie. Information on the fund is available 
at (310) 615-1072. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a renewed respect for the people of El Segundo," said Alan West, a 
two-term councilman who is seeking reelection to his council seat April 12. "I 
just wish it didn't take such a tragedy to bring the (people) together."

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE PLAZA SHOPS AROUND FOR A WAY TO SURVIVE SLUMP; 
RETAIL: THE NUMBER OF STORES AT THE MALL HAS DROPPED FROM 130 A FEW YEARS AGO 
TO JUST 87 LAST MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When the Hawthorne Plaza shopping center opened in 1977, civic leaders hailed 
it as a shopper's paradise. But lately, as stores have pulled out and sales 
have dropped, the mall has seemed more like a developer's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight shops closed in early January, bringing the number of tenants down to 
87. Just a few years ago, the mall had 130 stores. Sales at Hawthorne Plaza, at 
El Segundo and Hawthorne boulevards, fell 3% last year to $27 million, even 
though most local shopping centers posted modest gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, city officials and others are wondering what the future holds for the 
35-acre shopping complex, and what its troubles mean for the city. The mall 
pays nearly $1 million a year to the city in sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The stores that left in 1994 include See's Candies, Woman's World, Regal Shoes 
and B. Dalton Bookseller. 
</P>
<P>
 City and mall officials blamed the mall's woes on layoffs in the aerospace 
industry, the area's major employer, and competition from malls in Culver City, 
Redondo Beach and Torrance.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a trustee appointed by the Los Angeles Superior Court took control 
of the struggling mall because its owner, Larry Faigin, had failed to make more 
than $900,000 in mortgage payments since October. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Bruce L. Goodwin said Monday he doesn't foresee any radical changes at 
the mall, but he added that something must be done to revitalize the shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take a very open-minded look at our options," Goodwin said. 
"The answers aren't always apparent in these situations." 
</P>
<P>
 One solution may be to continue the mall's strategy of attracting small "mom 
and pop" stores in an effort to give Hawthorne Plaza a more distinct, homespun 
identity. So far, the approach has met with some success, according to the 
mall's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed light-rail line might also help bring in customers by the end of 
the decade. Two proposals for the Crenshaw Rail Line proposed by the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority would have trains stopping at the mall.  
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement with the lender, Goodwin has about a year to help bring the 
mall back to financial health.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HARBOR GATEWAY; SUPPORTERS PROTEST TRANSFER OF DIRECTOR AT 
ROSECRANS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neighbors of Rosecrans Recreation Center speak of Park Director John 
Willingham as a miracle worker.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents credit Willingham with turning a former gang hangout into a safe haven 
for children who now flock to the park at Vermont Avenue and 149th Street to 
participate in sports, day camps and after-school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 During his three-year tenure, Willingham also persuaded parents to get 
involved in the park's programs, supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Los Angeles parks officials' decision to move Willingham to a park in 
South-Central has the community fuming. Residents have launched a campaign to 
fight Willingham's transfer, which is effective Sunday. Last Saturday, about 30 
children and parents held a demonstration at the park. Armed with balloons, 
cowbells and hand-painted signs declaring their love for Willingham, the 
protesters chanted, "Let's keep John."  
</P>
<P>
 Parents accuse city parks officials of ignoring the community's needs and 
neglecting the recreation center. They said Willingham devotes his own money 
and time to the park, waiting until every child has left at night and serving 
as a father figure who has counseled and won both youngsters' and gang members' 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "He teaches them not to curse, to respect women," said Rodney Williams, a 
parent who coaches some of the Rosecrans sports teams. "He's a hands-on role 
model." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Willingham, enrollment in the park's programs has more than doubled, 
parents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willingham could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, city officials are standing firm on their decision to move 
Willingham. David Gonzalez, assistant general manager for the Recreation and 
Parks Department's Pacific Region, would not comment on the reasons for the 
transfer, saying only, "There's a need for him in another area. If he has 
served (Rosecrans) well, we're very proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez also said the transfer is not a demotion nor a disciplinary action 
and countered residents' complaints that city officials have neglected them. 
Gonzalez said he has talked at length with concerned neighbors and is committed 
to improving Rosecrans' facilities and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But upset residents said Willingham's work at Rosecrans isn't finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Watkins, a mother of six, summed up their feelings: "He's the 
foundation, and if they snatch him, the house will fall." IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: ARTIST IS IN HIGH GEAR DESIGNING AWARDS; BUSINESS: REDONDO 
BEACH DRIVING FAN'S HOBBY -- MAKING GLASS TROPHIES FOR MOTOR-RACING EVENTS -- 
NOW PAYS HIS BILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Drawing pictures of hot rods and motorcycles used to earn Jim Searcy nothing 
but trouble in his 12th-grade English class 40 years ago. Today, it earns him a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner of a small glass decoration shop in Redondo Beach, Searcy designs 
trophies for automobile and motorcycle races across the country. The awards, 
which sell for as much as $8,000 each, contain intricate, three-dimensional 
images of cars and drivers sandblasted into sheets of glass. 
</P>
<P>
 For Searcy, 57, of Hermosa Beach, pairing his interests in racing and art has 
been profitable. Last year, his one-man workshop, Champ Awards, had sales of 
almost $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Motor racing has always been my love," Searcy said. "So it kind of went 
hand-in-hand with my business." 
</P>
<P>
 While fast cars and motorbikes have always fascinated Searcy, he never 
expected to make much money from his hobby. After a stint in his early 20s 
racing motorcycles, Searcy worked full time as a mechanical engineer in the 
aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1970, he had been laid off and was looking for a change of pace. At 
first, he turned to woodworking, creating carved and sandblasted signs for 
restaurants, bars and condominiums throughout the South Bay. His work includes 
the city limit signs for Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, Searcy began applying woodworking techniques to glass. 
Through trial and error, he began producing small decorations for homes and 
offices. Eventually, he developed a clientele including the American Cancer 
Society, cigarette-producer Philip Morris and a beauty salon in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Searcy's favorite work revolves around the sport he loves. In 1979, he made 
his first trophy for a sprint car race at the now-closed Ascot Park Raceway in 
Gardena. Since then, Searcy has made more than 500 trophies. His latest project 
is a set of awards to be presented to the winners of a competition at this 
year's Long Beach Grand Prix in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a technique that took 10 years to master, Searcy sandblasts finely 
detailed images into the glass with a compressor that generates 100 pounds of 
pressure per square inch. The delicate process involves a good deal of risk -- 
one mistake can ruin a piece, which typically takes 80 to 100 hours to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't have any room for error," Searcy said. "In a painting, if you 
make a mistake, you can just paint over it. With glass, if you cut too far, 
you've ruined it." 
</P>
<P>
 Searcy's customers and recipients of his awards say they value his work for 
its attention to accuracy, which may become apparent only upon close 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really surprised at the depth of detail in his work," said Danny 
Thompson, a race car driver based in Irvine. "If you look at the carving of the 
motorcycle I have, it shows every spoke on the wheel, the gas cap on the tank, 
even the tire tread. It's amazing he can do that in glass."

CITY HALL NEWS: HAWTHORNE; SMOKING TO BE BANNED IN ALL CITY BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smoke-filled rooms at Hawthorne City Hall will be a thing of the past after a 
smoking ban in all enclosed city buildings takes effect next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 3-0 Monday night to approve the ban, which the city 
employees union backed with a petition drive. Council members Steve Andersen 
and Ginny Lambert were absent for the vote because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was pleased with the new ordinance, however, including several 
staff members and residents, who took some of their few remaining indoor smoke 
breaks during recesses at Monday's meeting.

CITY HALL NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; CITY BOOSTS REWARD IN CASE OF SLAIN OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials do not want the public to forget slain Manhattan Beach Police 
Officer Martin Ganz. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week boosted the reward to $250,000 for information 
leading to his killer's arrest. The reward had stood at $100,000, and it will 
revert to that amount March 1, city officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ganz was killed Dec. 27 during a traffic stop in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say it is unlikely that the gunman who killed two Palos Verdes 
Estates police officers this week also killed Ganz, despite early speculation 
that the two slayings were linked. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the slaying is asked to call the Manhattan Beach 
Police Department at (310) 545-5621.

OPINION; CRIME / URBAN SHOOTING RANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting arguments that Inglewood's high crime rate makes the city unsuitable 
for a business that promotes firearms, the City Council decided to allow a 
businessman to open the first firing range and gun club in the city. The 
Redondo Beach police chief, however, 
</P>
<P>
 turned down a request for a private shooting range in his city. Should South 
Bay cities allow indoor shooting ranges? Sam Kash 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood businessman who plans to open an indoor firing range  
</P>
<P>
 Why not? It can't be more harmful than a liquor store. This is for recreation 
-- facilities where people can go to practice safety, learn how to handle and 
respect a gun, and at the same time have fun. They shouldn't have to drive all 
the way to shooting galleries in the desert, Beverly Hills or Torrance, 40 
minutes away. Our gallery will be safe. We're hiring retired, reserve or 
off-duty police officers from the Los Angeles and Inglewood police departments 
as instructors. And I don't see why it would increase guns on the streets. 
Everyone is concerned about gangs, but shooting galleries have nothing to do 
with gangs. Gangs, they can shoot wherever they want. Curren D. Price Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood City Council member  
</P>
<P>
 I say no. I think violence from guns has reached an intolerable level in our 
society. It's become a mentality of death and destruction. Today, even an 
increasing number of gun owners are in agreement that there needs to be some 
sort of control over the acquisition and use of guns. I'm not suggesting that 
if you have a gun club there is an increase in crime. I'm just saying that it 
sends the message to youths and others that gun ownership is OK, and I think 
that contributes to the problem. I understand the kind of entrepreneurial 
spirit of people who want to open a public firing range, but we have a 
responsibility to set a higher standard. Evan Nielsen 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach contractor who wanted a private range  
</P>
<P>
 Under certain conditions, yes. Of course, they would have to comply with the 
National Rifle Assn. guidelines, but why shouldn't someone be able to put a 
shooting range in their own home? The city of Redondo Beach gave me a permit to 
build one in my basement but then took it back. They make it so tough that no 
normal person can get a shooting range unless they have $10 million in the bank 
to fight the bureaucracy. I would also rather see more public shooting ranges. 
Shooting galleries are not for the kooks. They're not going to come down there 
and practice -- they're going to get a semiautomatic and maybe convert it to an 
automatic and go out there and shoot at random. Robert Pinzler 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach City Council member  
</P>
<P>
 Home firing ranges? Absolutely not. There are plenty of public places for 
people to go to try out their weapons and improve their skills. The individual 
firing range is a potential hazard. It doesn't involve just one person. He's 
got friends, colleagues arriving to his house with guns. Firing ranges should 
be left to professional range managers. I do prefer to have people trained in 
the use of guns than not. If guns have to be around, then let's try to make the 
use of them as safe as possible.

COVER STORY; PRESERVING THE BALANCE

<P>
 Thirty feet underwater off the shore of Catalina Island, a diving class opened 
a sea urchin, luring dozens of bright orange Garibaldi to their fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will swim right up and eat from your hand, and then even follow you 
around," said Redondo Beach dive-shop owner Barry Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the rite of passage that Friedman recalls most vividly from his 
inaugural plunge 25 years ago. He went on to become a diving instructor 
himself, and through the years he has made sure that hundreds of students got 
the same experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The trusting and curious Garibaldi are also easy targets for another kind of 
diver: commercial aquarium collectors. Whereas sports divers just sightsee, the 
collectors capture the fish and sell them to aquarium dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman and other divers say that because of overharvesting, Garibaldis have 
dwindled in many of Catalina's most popular reefs and coves. No one knows how 
many Garibaldis used to swim area waters -- or even how many there are now. In 
fact, the state Department of Fish and Game has not studied the Garibaldi 
population. But sports divers are convinced the numbers have plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional collectors, however, call the divers' claims unproven and 
inflammatory. All the evidence to support the claims are anecdotal, they say.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, sports divers have some support from scientists. Paul Sikkel, who was 
doing his doctoral dissertation on the Garibaldi's mating habits, observed 
divers collecting about 40 adult Garibaldi from a reef off Lion Head on 
Catalina Island in the spring of 1990. "This can constitute the entire 
population of resident adults on some reefs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, the reef's population of Garibaldis was not half what it had 
been, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was the biggest eye-opener," said Sikkel, now a researcher at Friday 
Harbor Laboratories in Washington state. "The concern is their vulnerability. 
They are so easy to catch, and (their habitat) is in close proximity to Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Having already won some limits on the collection of Garibaldis, sports divers 
have launched a petition campaign to place a six-year moratorium on the 
practice. The divers and manufacturers of diving equipment formed an 
environmental group called Ocean Futures to curtail the collection of the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a symbolic gesture to one of California's brightest water creatures, 
they also want to declare the Garibaldi the state marine fish. Rep. Bill Morrow 
(R-Carlsbad) introduced the proposal last month.  
</P>
<P>
 The feisty fish, named for an Italian general who wore garish tunics, has been 
such a common site in California waters that many sports fishermen assumed it 
already was the state fish -- and therefore off limits. Even the Cabrillo 
Marine Aquarium once listed it as the state fish in one of its exhibits. (The 
state fish is the golden trout, found in California's fresh waters). 
</P>
<P>
 On Catalina Island, tourists getting off ferries often clog gangways because 
they have spotted Garibaldis in shallow waters at Avalon Bay. But that area is 
a state-designated protected habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Garibaldis can be found from Magdalena Bay in Baja California north to 
Monterey Bay. But Catalina had been a popular collecting spot because it is 
more accessible than other Channel Islands, including Santa Cruz, San Clemente 
and Santa Barbara islands.  
</P>
<P>
 If Ocean Futures succeeds in protecting the Garibaldi in California waters, 
the sports divers plan to do the same for other marine life popular with 
aquarium owners, including the blue-banded Catalina goby and the horn and 
leopard sharks. The effort is part of a larger movement to limit the 
$3-billion-a-year worldwide aquarium trade.  
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to (restrict) fish all over the world," said Lek 
Bunya-ananta, a wholesaler who buys fish from collectors and sells them to 
retail outlets. "But they can't. Too many people make a living at it, and it is 
a pretty large hobby. It would be tough to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 The Garibaldi is still a very small part of the 20,000 types of species 
collected. Fewer than 500 Garibaldis were collected off the California coast 
last year, according to the state Department of Fish and Game. But those 
numbers are considered sketchy because 1993 was the first year that collectors 
were required by the state to report their catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports divers, who make a living by leading underwater tourists down to the 
fish, have pushed for limits on the collection of Garibaldis because they fear 
their business will lose its Technicolor appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we have this tropical-colored fish in temperate waters," said John 
Hardy, owner of a Catalina Island dive shop and president of the Chamber of 
Commerce. "It's well-recognized, seen by everyone. You can't say that this one 
business kills this one animal, but anything that detracts from the environment 
makes it less desirable to go diving." But professional collectors in 
California have been fighting back. And recent state laws, collectors say, 
already severely restrict their business.  
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is not nearly as critical as they make it out to be," said 
Victor La Fontaine, a Granada Hills diver who owns an aquarium-fish collecting 
business. "(The Garibaldi) is an abundant species." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, he and other collectors have an interest in keeping it that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I'm going out there and poking them with a spear gun," he said. 
"It's not like we are taking these and they are being eaten. These are pets." 
</P>
<P>
 On Catalina Island, glass-bottom boat operators have long counted on the 
Garibaldi to wow tourists. In the 1950s, Garibaldis had become popular in 
spearfishing. Island residents credit boat operators, who feared a loss of 
tourism, for successfully lobbying the state to ban the Garibaldi from the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until an accident three years ago, however, that Catalina divers, 
merchants and boat operators discovered that fish were still being taken from 
the waters. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a commercial diver on La Fontaine's boat drowned in Isthmus Cove when 
his air supply ran out 73 feet below the surface. The diver, Kenneth W. Howard, 
made as much as $654 per day capturing infant red-gold Garibaldis, baby sharks 
and other marine life. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then sports divers have blamed collectors for the smaller number of 
Garibaldis near many Catalina reefs, said Harry Pecorelli, a retired engineer 
and former president of Catalina Conservancy Divers, an environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 Records showed that a week before he died, Howard was diving for Garibaldis 
and stingrays, selling them for $5 to $7 each.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was a problem that we thought was only happening in the Third World, but 
it was occurring in our own back yard," said Jim Hall, who is leading the Ocean 
Futures petition drive.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it had been going on for years. California Diving News Editor Dale 
Sheckler, who made a living capturing fish for aquariums in the late 1970s, 
said he used a slurp gun, which would suck a fish into a tube. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could clear out an area the size of a small house," he said. "But there 
were only two collectors doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, collectors started using large, vacuum-like hoses, "which 
suck anything and everything, even the tiny invertebrates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gerald Felando, then an assemblyman from Torrance, and other state 
lawmakers, such anecdotes were enough to persuade them to take action. They 
passed a bill in 1992 requiring collectors and wholesalers to buy special 
licenses, which cost from $330 to $1,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in a bill authored by Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Eureka), Garibaldi 
collection was restricted to November, December and January. In addition, all 
of Catalina Island was declared off limits to aquarium collectors, although the 
back side of the island is scheduled to be opened up again in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors, however, have moved on to San Clemente Island, another of the 
Channel Islands, south of Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state Department of Fish and Game, 108.25 pounds, or 462 
Garibaldis, were caught legally by aquarium collectors in 1993. A total of 104 
aquarium collectors permits were issued in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors still have no limits on how many Garibaldis they may catch, and 
they are free to take both adults and juveniles, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garibaldis are extremely territorial, so if a collector takes a fish from 
one reef, there's no guarantee that another Garibaldi will make the same spot 
home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlimited take of adults and juveniles spells disaster for the population," 
he said. "There's nothing to repopulate the species." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed moratorium until 2000, Hall said, would give Catalina Conservancy 
Divers enough time to come up with money and conduct a thorough study of the 
effects of aquarium collecting on the Garibaldi population. The group envisions 
a $150,000 project that would take up to six years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The new restrictions, wholesalers and aquarium collectors say, could drive 
them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm barely making payments on my truck and my insurance," La Fontaine said. 
"My lawyer owns my boat. Very little by little, they took so many things away 
that I'm struggling." 
</P>
<P>
 La Fontaine declined to say how many fish he collected last year, but disputed 
the notion that he was collecting the fish en masse . 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have 20 in front of me, but I take only two," he said. "If I took 100 
or 200, I would have them for two to three weeks. I got better things to do 
than transport fish. It's a limited market." 
</P>
<P>
 And Garibaldis are not an easy fish to keep in a tank. They can live 10 years 
in the sea, but they require cold water to survive, said Will Borgeson, an 
aquaculture expert at the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory. A Garibaldi needs 
a 100-gallon tank, double or even triple the size of most home aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have more than one Garibaldi in a small tank, one becomes boss, and 
bullies all the other fish," Borgeson said. "That's their nature. They're 
basically pretty rotten aquarium fish." 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, as larger aquariums grew in popularity, more people were 
willing to set up cold-water tanks. Garibaldi-collecting became most popular in 
Japan and China, where enthusiasts wanted to re-create California's marine life 
in their living rooms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an extremely beautiful fish," Borgeson said. ". . in China, their gold 
color means long life." 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas hobbyists, however, are paying a premium. They spend as much as $125 
on one fish, including the cost of shipping, according to Inglewood wholesaler 
Bunya-ananta, owner of Aquatic Depot. 
</P>
<P>
 From his nondescript warehouse, hundreds of tropical and freshwater fish are 
shipped around the world. In 1993 he bought about 150 Garibaldis from 
collectors for $8 to $10 and sold them for $25, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunya-ananta, who started in the retail fish business 27 years ago, doubts the 
Garibaldi population is shrinking. But he acknowledged that the fish have a 
shorter life span in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Live tropical fish, they die pretty fast," he said. "A retail store can make 
good business replacing them. If they last three, four, five years, you're 
lucky." The Garibaldi FAMILY: The Garibaldi is a member of the damsel family, 
which include small, shallow water marine fish that have a round to oval, 
compressed body. Most damsel fish are found in tropical seas, but the Garibaldi 
is one of the few in temperate waters. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRITORY: Monterey Bay to Baja, including the Channel Islands, off the 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 HABITAT: Clear water, often near crevices and small caves, occasionally in 
kelp. 
</P>
<P>
 ORIGIN OF NAME: From Italian general Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-82), who led 
movement to unify the country and wore garish outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 COLOR: Adults are bright orange. Juveniles are reddish orange with electric 
blue spots. The spots -- a signal to adults not to chase their young away -- 
disappear after the juveniles grow to 6 to 8 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
 MATING: A male Garibaldi creates a nest of algae, then invites a female to 
join him. She lays up to 80,000 eggs, and the male fertilizes them. He chases 
her away and stays to guard the nest. 
</P>
<P>
 STATE REGULATIONS: In sportfishing, illegal to spear or retain. Commercial 
divers may catch with a marine aquarium collectors permit. No collecting is 
allowed on the north side of Catalina Island, and the back side is off limits 
until 2000.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: ITALIAN FOOD WITH A FLAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When a friend recently suggested we eat at Alejo's, I thought of the crowd of 
people I have seen there, frequently snaking out onto the sidewalk in front of 
the place. So I quoted that esteemed philosopher, Yogi Berra: "Nobody goes 
there anymore; it's too crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 But we did go to Westchester, endured a brief wait and found out what the 
crowd was there for: Alejo's generous plates of Italian favorites at reasonable 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner is Alejo Castro, a native of Spain, who began his restaurant career 
as a dishwasher at a hotel in Bern, Switzerland. One day, the manager watched 
Alejo prepare himself lunch, rolling out sheets of lasagna with a wine bottle. 
The manager tasted the lasagna and the next day Alejo was made chef's 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Alejo moved on to Los Angeles, where he met Jean Leon, owner of La 
Scala in Beverly Hills. He worked at La Scala Malibu and at La Scala Presto in 
Brentwood before striking out on his own. In 1991, he opened Alejo's in Marina 
Del Rey, and last year, a second, much larger Alejo's in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 A popular dish here is linguine pescatore ($8.95), a heaping portion of pasta 
topped with clams, squid and shrimp sauteed in olive oil, garlic, white wine 
and fresh basil. Alejo is proud of his tri-color ravioli ($6.25), in which each 
individual ravioli is made with three kinds of pasta: green (spinach), red 
(bell pepper), and the common egg variety. The filling choices are veal, 
chicken or vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaghetti carbonara con funghi ($6.25) is a rich dish of pasta coated with 
cream, sprinkled with bacon and topped off with mushrooms and tomatoes. Lighter 
appetites might choose the refreshing angel hair with sauteed vegetables 
($6.25). 
</P>
<P>
 A recent daily special was eggplant mama mia ($7.95), chicken breast and fresh 
Italian mozzarella sandwiched between two discs of eggplant, baked, topped with 
a marinara sauce and served with a side of spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejo's is at 8343 Lincoln Blvd., Westchester. (310) 670-6677. Open Monday 
through Thursday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., and Saturday 
and Sunday 4 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Also at 4002 Lincoln Blvd., Marina Del Rey.

 FRIENDLY FOES 
</P>
<P>
 After Redondo High's basketball team secured a playoff berth Saturday, Coach 
Jim Nielsen got in touch with Artesia Coach Wayne Merino, a close friend. They 
agreed to help each other scout opponents in the postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that was before the pairings were announced Sunday, matching 
Redondo against Artesia in the first round of the Southern Section Division 
II-A playoffs. The teams will meet at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to put (the scouting) on hold, but we're both looking forward to the 
game," Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merino, who was an assistant under Nielsen from 1984-87 at Mira Costa, has 
enjoyed tremendous success at Artesia. The Pioneers won three of the past four 
State Division II titles with teams led by Ed and Charles O'Bannon and Avondre 
Jones. The O'Bannon brothers start for UCLA. Jones is a USC reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Artesia (14-10), the Suburban League champion, doesn't have that kind of 
talent this season and faces a tough challenge from balanced Redondo (19-7). 
The Sea Hawks rebounded from a recent slump to beat Mira Costa, 74-62, and 
Culver City, 61-52, last weekend and secure the third and final playoff spot 
from the Ocean League. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're back to playing the way we should be playing," said Nielsen, whose team 
was considered the league favorite but ended up 4-4, three games behind 
champion Mira Costa. "I honestly thought we should have won the league. It's a 
tribute to Mira Costa and (second-place) Beverly Hills that we didn't, and a 
knock on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen blamed Redondo's disappointing showing on a lack of team play, a 
problem he hopes has been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dribbled too much and played individually too much," he said. "We weren't 
willing to sacrifice individual goals for team goals. I think the players 
finally realized if they are going to do anything, they have to play as a 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo's resurgence has coincided with the improved play of guard Tremayne 
Mayeaux, a talented sophomore who was slowed by a leg injury earlier in the 
season, and the addition of sophomore guard Ryan Stowasser, who was recently 
called up from the junior varsity. Both players come off the bench and have 
given Nielsen more options in substituting for his hot-and-cold starting 
backcourt of seniors Cecil Fletcher, Morgan Ensberg and Damani Washington. 
PLAYOFF PICTURE 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood looks like the South Bay's best bet to win a Southern Section boys' 
basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels (24-3) have a deep and talented team led by 6-foot-6 junior 
forward Paul Pierce, arguably the area's best player, and senior point guard 
Sam Turks. They are seeded second in Division II-AA behind J.W. North High of 
Riverside (25-0) and will play host to Rosemead (14-9) in a first-round game 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The only blemishes on Inglewood's record are two losses to City Section power 
Westchester and a two-point loss to Fontana when Turks was sidelined with an 
injury. Fontana is seeded No. 1 in the Division I-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra isn't as strong as last year's team that won the State Division IV 
title, but the third-seeded Cavaliers should do well in the Division IV-A 
playoffs. Led by Duke-bound guard Ricky Price, Serra (16-9) plays host to 
Bishop (14-8) in a first-round game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Another area team that could make some noise in the playoffs is Chadwick. The 
Dolphins (19-7) set the Southern Section record for most three-point baskets in 
a season and have a prolific scoring duo in senior guard Neil Thakur and junior 
forward Todd Ammons, both averaging more than 20 points. They play host to 
Templeton (12-10) in a Division V-AA opener Friday night. GIRLS' PLAYOFFS 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Peninsula leads a strong field of area teams in the Southern Section 
girls' basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (21-3), led by All-American Mimi McKinney, are seeded second in 
Division I-AA and will play host to a first-round game Saturday night against 
the winner of Wednesday's wild-card game between Apple Valley and Alta Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood (No. 3 in II-AA), Morningside (No. 2 in III-AA) and South Torrance 
(No. 4 in III-AA) are also seeded in their respective divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery, one of the area's best teams, played a wild-card game 
Wednesday against Culver City in Division III-AA after tying St. Bernard for 
second place in the Mission League. St. Bernard, though, was seeded No. 1 in 
IV-AA, a less competitive division. GOING, GOING, GONE 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Ibarra of Loyola Marymount was chosen one of the national players of the 
week by Collegiate Baseball and the West Coast Conference player of the week 
after an outstanding series in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra became the first visiting player to hit two home runs in a game and 
three home runs in a series out of spacious Rainbow Stadium at the University 
of Hawaii. He batted seven for 12 with six RBIs in the three-game series, and 
recorded a save in Loyola's only victory over the Rainbows. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a hitter he is," Hawaii Coach Les Murakami told the Honolulu Advertiser 
after Ibarra hit a solo home run Saturday in the Rainbows' 4-3 victory. "Our 
fences are not long enough for him. He has three home runs in two games and we 
have one home run for the season." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Ibarra hit two home runs in a 14-8 Loyola loss, one left-handed and 
one right-handed. His two-run homer from the left side cleared the 12-foot 
fence in right-center field and was estimated to have traveled 430 feet. The 
stadium's dimensions are 340 feet down the lines, 380 to the power alleys and 
400 to center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this is a big yard, but I hit the ball on the nose and knew it was 
gone," Ibarra said of his tape-measure shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra, a junior third baseman who is also Loyola's top reliever, recorded his 
second save of the season Sunday in a 7-6 victory. It came one day after he 
gave up the game-winning hit in the ninth inning to Hawaii's Corey Ishigo, who 
nonetheless was impressed by the preseason All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ibarra is the best ballplayer I have ever seen," Ishigo said. "Not only can 
he hit, but he can come in and close the game too. He's very tough to hit." 
TOROS ON A ROLL 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Dominguez Hills improved its chances of earning an invitation to the 
NCAA Division II basketball playoffs by beating sixth-ranked Cal State 
Bakersfield, 65-63, and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 86-72, in California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. games last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Joe Bertrand had double-doubles of 10 points and 21 rebounds 
against Bakersfield, the defending national champion, and 10 points and 10 
rebounds against San Luis Obispo. He was named conference player of the week 
for the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros (16-8 overall, 6-4 in the CCAA) extended their winning streak to 
three games Tuesday with a 76-72 nonconference victory over Christian Heritage, 
and play their final conference home game Saturday night against 18th-ranked UC 
Riverside. SOFTBALL OPENER 
</P>
<P>
 The Loyola Marymount softball team will open the season with a new coach when 
it plays host to Santa Clara at 1 p.m. Saturday at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Steve Combs inherits a team that returns eight starters, including 
sophomore outfielder Kim McMullen, a former South Torrance High standout. 
ALL-AMERICANS 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mira Costa senior Sean Nollan has been selected to the All-American High 
School Water Polo team by the American Swimming Coaches Assn. Nollan led the 
Mustangs to the Ocean League title and the Division III quarterfinals last 
season and is being recruited by several four-year colleges, including USC and 
Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former Torrance High standout Jessica Reifer, a sophomore midfielder at the 
University of Hartford, has been named a Division I All-American by the 
National Soccer Coaches Assn. after leading her team with 40 points (16 goals, 
eight assists). THIS AND THAT 
</P>
<P>
 Tino Trujillo of Torrance and John Eberhardt of San Pedro recently recorded 
their first holes-in-one on the 140-yard eighth hole at Harbor Park golf 
course. . . . Several of the area's top prep track athletes will compete in the 
Sunkist Invitational beginning at noon Saturday at the Sports Arena. . . . The 
Palos Verdes-based Southern California Roadrunners track and field team, for 
South Bay boys and girls from age 8 to eighth grade, is conducting registration 
and will begin its season Feb. 28. Information: Barry Sacks at (310) 514-2030. 
. . . Registration is under way for the Hawthorne Kiwanis Youth track meet 
March 5 at Hawthorne High. Information: (310) 970-7230. ROB FERNAS

PEOPLE: COMPETITOR LIVES IN A ONE-HORSE WORLD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Raine has a horse worth $500,000, but no place to call home. Despite 
offers to buy the horse, Raine, 28, refuses to sell at any price. She's worked 
too hard -- and spent most of her earnings -- to make him what he is today: A 
premier grand prix dressage competitor, the equine equivalent of a prima 
ballerina. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff came recently when Raine won a place on the U.S. Equestrian Team. 
She is one of the few people in the country asked to compete at world-class 
events in dressage, an equestrian ballet where the horse performs intricate 
dance steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years ago, Raine's mother, Betsy, purchased Avontuur in Holland for a few 
thousand dollars. Kathleen Raine and her husband, David Wightman, who is also a 
dressage competitor, have spent the last decade preparing Avontuur (it means 
"adventure" in Dutch) for world-class competition. Raine and Wightman return so 
much of their earnings as riding instructors to their sport, "We basically live 
out of our car," Raine said. Part of the week they live at Betsy Raine's house 
in Rolling Hills and the rest with a friend near Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have (much) money at all, so to turn down $500,000 says a lot about 
the bond between the horse and the rider," Raine said. Training and competing 
cost nearly $70,000 a year, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Raine's success so far has helped win sponsorship for supplies and equipment 
from a company in Canada and a grant from the U.S. Olympic Committee and the 
U.S. Equestrian Team to cover expenses incurred for two months of training and 
competing in Europe in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, dressage -- created in the Baroque era of 17th-Century Europe 
-- has been dominated by German and other European riders. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, the United States won a bronze medal, the 
first one in dressage in nearly two decades, focusing attention on the sport as 
never before, Raine said. Raine has been riding seriously since she was 8. But 
until she graduated from high school, she didn't show any more interest in the 
sport than her four brothers and sisters, Betsy Raine said. After graduation, 
Kathleen Raine began working at a ranch in Moorpark owned by Hilda Gurney, a 
six-time national dressage champion.  
</P>
<P>
 "I realized she was different," Betsy Raine said, "when she started getting up 
at 4 in the morning to groom horses and stuck out four years in a demanding 
position as an assistant to Hilda."  
</P>
<P>
 The young rider groomed, exercised and broke horses for little money. In 
return, she received lessons from Gurney.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you work that hard," Raine said, "you're mainly doing it for the 
experience.' 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Raine began training with a new coach, who helped prepare her and 
Avontuur for world-class competition. They entered their first international 
show in 1991. Since then, Raine has placed in several contests and was chosen 
as the only U.S. rider to compete in dressage at the World Cup in Sweden in 
April.  
</P>
<P>
 Under U.S. Equestrian Team rules, Raine must qualify for every major event she 
enters -- including the Olympic trials in the spring of 1996 -- to stay on the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to make it," she said. "But a lot can happen between now and then."

DR. J. VERNON LUCK; PIONEERED REATTACHMENT OF LIMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. J. Vernon Luck, an orthopedic surgeon who invented the Luck Bone Saw, 
wrote the definitive textbook on bone pathology and pioneered the reattachment 
of limbs, has died. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck, who was medical director of Orthopaedic Hospital from 1955 to 1968 and 
lived in Hancock Park, died Monday in Los Angeles of cancer, the hospital 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 24, 1961, Robert Orona had his left arm almost completely severed in a 
freeway construction accident -- a situation that at the time called for 
complete amputation. But Luck decided to reattach the mangled arm -- bone, 
blood vessels, nerves, muscles and all -- in one of the first successful limb 
reattachments in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Three and a half years later, when Orona demonstrated the functional, healthy 
arm for news media by lifting a coffee cup, Luck said modestly, "Yes, we would 
certainly call it a success." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only one of the doctor's many successful endeavors during more than six 
decades in orthopedic surgery and research. He invented his bone saw in 1941 
and many other pieces of equipment over the years, including the Luck Cup, used 
in hip replacement surgery. During World War II he wrote a history of 
orthopedic surgery that won him the Legion of Merit from the U.S. surgeon 
general in 1947, and in 1950 he published his widely used textbook "Bone and 
Joint Disease." 
</P>
<P>
 In surgery, he not only reattached Orona's arm but also performed the first 
elective surgery (a total hip replacement) on a hemophiliac. 
</P>
<P>
 Greatly admired by his peers, Luck was elected in 1961 as president of the 
American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in life, although he had abandoned surgery, Luck bristled at the idea of 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not retired," he told The Times in 1986. "I have changed direction to 
orthopedic research, but I still work a nine- or 10-hour day." 
</P>
<P>
 Orthopaedic Hospital honored his dedication in 1987 by naming its research 
facility the J. Vernon Luck M.D. Orthopaedic Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Orthopaedic Hospital, Luck worked on the staffs of the Hospital 
of the Good Samaritan, Childrens Hospital, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical 
Center and County-USC Medical Center. He wrote more than 75 scientific papers. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Hannibal, Mo., Luck became interested in orthopedics at age 4 when 
his mother's leg was amputated because of an abscess in her knee. He studied 
medicine at the University of Missouri, which years later awarded him its 
Citation of Merit for his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck is survived by a son, Dr. James V. Luck Jr., medical director and chief 
executive officer of Orthopaedic Hospital of Glendale; a daughter, Diane Luck 
Carter of Manhattan Beach; a sister, Mary Frances Davis of Ottawa, Kan., and 
six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Saturday at First Congregational Church, 
6th Street and Commonwealth Avenue in Los Angeles, with interment at Forest 
Lawn Memorial Park-Glendale. Visitation hours are 1 to 9 p.m. today and 9 a.m. 
to 9 p.m. Friday at Forest Lawn Mortuary in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has requested that any memorial donations be made to the J. Vernon 
Luck M.D. Research Fund at Orthopaedic Hospital, 2400 S. Flower St., Los 
Angeles, Calif. 90007.

JUDGE BLOCKS PART OF PENNSYLVANIA'S ABORTION LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge delayed implementation Wednesday of part of the state's new 
restrictive abortion law, which had been in effect just two days after years of 
court battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Commonwealth Court Judge Dan Pellegrini said sections of the law requiring a 
woman's informed consent cannot take effect until 10 days after informational 
booklets are published. The materials will explain fetal development, the 
abortion procedure and its risks. 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires that women seeking abortions be told about the availability 
of the booklets 24 hours before the procedure. It also requires unmarried women 
under age 18 to get permission for an abortion from a parent or judge. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Department of Health sent 15,000 informational booklets to 128 
of the state's 142 registered abortion providers, spokeswoman Kathy Liebler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue will soon be resolved because the booklets have been distributed, 
state Atty. Gen. Ernie Preate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Kolbert, an attorney representing a number of clinics, asked Tuesday 
for an injunction against the law because the clinics had not received the 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors are subject to criminal penalties, license suspension and revocation, 
and it is very important they know not only when the act takes effect but what 
is expected of them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pellegrini scheduled a hearing for next Tuesday so the two sides can present 
arguments on when the 10-day period to review the information booklets is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolbert said the clinics will ask the court to delay the law until the 
materials are published in the state's official journal, the Pennsylvania 
Bulletin, and that 30 days of comment be required. 
</P>
<P>
 The state believes the limit will be over next week, 10 days from Tuesday's 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Daniel H. Huyett III lifted the five-year ban on the law 
late Monday, a week after U.S. Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter rejected 
an appeal by abortion providers.

NEIGHBORS PROTEST FOR REMOVAL OF RADAR TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the shadow of the giant radar tower they have dubbed "the Black Orb," about 
70 angry Ojai Valley residents protested the station's operation Wednesday and 
demanded its removal. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally came only hours after private researchers hired by the National 
Weather Service conducted a series of tests that they said initially show that 
energy emissions from the Sulphur Mountain tower are minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were conducted specifically to ease residents' fears of exposure to 
radiation, weather service officials said. Homeowners were invited to observe 
the tests but refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked the residents if we could test from their homes and they said no," 
said Lori Arquelles, director of public relations for the National 
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's protest is the latest in a series of battles, including a recent 
lawsuit filed by homeowners, that have raged over the 98-foot-tall radar tower, 
which will track storms and wind conditions for the government.  
</P>
<P>
 Arquelles said the tower is fully operational, although its data will not be 
used by the weather service until the station is commissioned by the federal 
government, which is "down the road a couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
 The tower is one of 165 new Doppler radar systems the government is 
constructing across the country. The Ojai Valley tower will replace a 
50-year-old system on a federal building in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's rally, homeowners who live near the tower said they simply 
don't trust the weather service or its tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want them on our property," said Virginia Loy, an upper valley 
resident. "You don't come to people after shoving something down their throats 
and say, 'Here, learn about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was staged on property owned by nearby resident Kenny Fuller. "If 
their word is no good coming in, why should we trust their test?" Fuller asked. 
"How good is their word if we can't believe a damn thing they say?" 
</P>
<P>
 However, some local residents believe homeowners are overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not as scared as most people are. From what I've read, it is not that 
harmful," said Chris Harter, who lives near the radar tower. Harter said 
residents were acting "ostrich-like" by refusing to observe the testing. "It 
sounds kind of stupid, like they don't want to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Weather service officials said residents could have benefited from being 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure they've received the true facts about this radar," said weather 
service meteorologist Todd Morris. Pointing to a computer monitor and other 
equipment, Morris said, "I think anybody who would have come out here would 
have seen the numbers are low." 
</P>
<P>
 Weather service officials based their early findings that emissions from the 
tower were low on preliminary figures, but said they need to evaluate the data 
before releasing their final conclusions on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Martin, one of the two researchers from the Illinois Institute of 
Technology Research Institute conducting the tests, said they will be 
collecting data from about half a dozen locations near the tower, from as close 
as 2,000 feet and as far away as Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said the radiation emitted by the tower is equal to the amount 
released by three microwave ovens. But residents were not comforted by that 
analogy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that inside the oven or outside?" said upper valley resident Richard 
Scribner, a professor of preventive medicine at USC. "We want to know where the 
studies are that show that chronic exposure to high energy pulses of microwave 
radiation are safe. There aren't any. You can't expect to jack up the power and 
not expect something to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents, who have formed two activist groups to fight the radar tower's 
operation, lost a lawsuit filed last month against the federal government 
requesting additional environmental studies. Residents said they intend to 
appeal the decision and are meeting with attorneys Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists have already won the support of local and state politicians, 
including U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.

CAMARILLO PANEL APPROVES FACTORY OUTLET MALL; DEVELOPMENT: BUILDER HOPES TO 
BREAK GROUND ON THE 22-ACRE SITE IN LATE SPRING AND HAVE FACILITY OPEN BY 
NOVEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo Planning Commission has given final approval to a 22-acre 
factory outlet mall that is expected to generate an estimated $400,000 in sales 
tax revenues annually for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Following nearly two hours of staff and consultant reports on the proposal, 
the commission voted unanimously to approve the 250,000-square-foot mall. City 
Council approval is not required. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Meridith, Planning Commission chairman, called the project a boon for 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this mall will be good for the community in ways that are not just 
economic," Meridith said. The environmental work "has been quite well done and 
documented." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's Planning Commission vote was the second on the project planned for 
the long-vacant Koll-Leonard property, which is south of the Ventura Freeway 
between Los Posas Road and Carmen Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, after the Planning Commission and City Council approved the 
mall proposal, the effort was stalled by a lawsuit filed by an Oxnard developer 
and a retired Camarillo businessman. In response to the lawsuit, a Ventura 
County Superior Court judge ruled that the city's development deal for the 
mall, which would have rebated about $500,000 to Koll-Leonard, amounted to a 
gift of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also ruled that the city's cursory environmental approval of the 
site was inadequate and that a full environmental impact report was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 But even without the rebate, Koll Co. officials in Los Angeles said Wednesday 
that they will build the mall and have it open to the public by November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are prepared to go ahead with this project," company spokesman Peter 
Tilton said. "Even without the incentives of the old deal, we still feel that 
Camarillo is a very viable site." 
</P>
<P>
 Tilton said that after receiving building permits, the company is prepared to 
break ground on the site by late spring. He said construction on the first 
phase of the mall should by complete by November. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to name the tenants that will occupy the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the negotiation stage with several companies, and I can't really 
tell you yet who they are," Tilton said. "But, like all successful factory 
outlets, you'll see some recognizable names there." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Davis, Camarillo's assistant city manager, said the mall is expected to 
generate about $400,000 in sales tax revenues annually for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited about this getting approval," Davis said. "There are a lot 
of things we can do with that revenue to make things better for the entire 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental review done for the mall concluded that the project would 
increase noise, traffic, and construction and traffic-related air pollution. 
The report recommended solutions to those problems, including the installation 
of sound walls, road-widening projects, employee trip-reduction plans, and 
tie-ins to bus and shuttle lines. 
</P>
<P>
 As Koll officials line up prospective tenants for the mall, construction crews 
a few miles up the Ventura Freeway in Oxnard have already broken ground on 
another factory outlet mall south of the Ventura Freeway between Rice and Rose 
avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kinney, president of the Greater Oxnard Economic Development Corp., a 
nonprofit organization funded by the city of Oxnard, said he believes that 
there is room enough for two factory outlet malls in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I think will happen is that both malls will initially develop only their 
first phases," Kinney said. "It will be like one mall -- only with two halves 
that are separated by a few miles. I'm confident that both will do well, 
though."

VENTURA TOLD MORE WATER NOT NEEDED; RESOURCES: REPORT COULD AFFECT WHETHER THE 
CITY COUNCIL DECIDES TO BUILD THE DESALINATION PLANT THAT RESIDENTS BACKED IN A 
1992 ADVISORY MEASURE. 
</P>

 Consultants told Ventura city leaders on Wednesday that the city could get by 
without an additional water source for at least 16 years -- a contradiction 
from an earlier study that had concluded the city's wells would be dry by then 
without more water. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest study, which was released two weeks ago by Boyle Engineering, 
concludes that the city has more water available than was originally estimated 
three years ago. Even in a severe drought, an additional water source will not 
be needed until at least 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Boyle Engineering made a formal presentation to a subcommittee 
of the Ventura City Council to explain the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have changed," said engineer Glenn McPherson, who headed the study. 
</P>
<P>
 McPherson told the committee that because of conservation, an increased supply 
from Lake Casitas and more water banking, a supplemental source won't be 
immediately necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The report could affect whether the City Council decides to build the 
desalination plant that residents backed in an advisory measure in November, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A project manager, a desalination expert and a public relations firm already 
have been hired for the desalination project. To date, the city has spent more 
than $400,000 on studies for the proposed plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Desalination proponents challenged the new findings Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle, who remembers Boyle Engineering's dire warnings 
several years ago, said he was "amazed to find out we were out of the water 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle, who favors building a desalination plant, said he does not understand 
the findings of the latest study. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, we paid a lot of money to Boyle Engineering for them to tell 
us that we were running out of water," Tuttle said. "And now the message is we 
don't have a water problem. I find that hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, water consumption by Ventura residents was not as 
high as anticipated because people conserved more than experts had expected. 
Another significant factor that changed estimates of the city's water supply is 
the fact that the city can now buy more water from Lake Casitas and conserve 
more of its ground water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura gets its water from Lake Casitas, the Ventura River and underground 
aquifers. All three sources were partly depleted during the drought, causing 
the council to pass a strict conservation ordinance and look for another water 
source. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study released in 1991, Boyle Engineering had predicted that an 
additional source of water must be found before 2010 or the city's wells would 
run dry. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, city officials were told they could not buy as much water from 
Lake Casitas, so the city had to rely more on ground water, McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, the city has also made repairs and additions to its water system 
that allow the city to draw more heavily from the Ventura River and store more 
water for emergencies, McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservoirs have been replaced, pump stations have been added and new wells 
have been drilled. About half a year's supply of water has been stored in the 
Fox Canyon reservoir. All those would delay the need for a new water source, 
McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not suggesting that we don't need a supplemental water supply," McPherson 
said. "It just delays the need for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The question of what should be the city's long-term water source -- 
desalination or importing water from Northern California -- has historically 
been a thorny issue for city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council has authorized spending money for studies on the 
desalination project, council members are divided on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members looking to either scrap the desalination project or avoid 
choosing one option over the other could use the findings from Boyle 
Engineering's latest study to argue their cases in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Monahan, a strong proponent of a state water pipeline, said he 
doesn't think the council needs to make a decision in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a drought, no doubt about it," Monahan said. "But we were never in 
dire need. Boyle Engineering was projecting that the drought would continue. We 
have time now to really analyze our options." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said he would do his best to push the council to make a 
decision on desalination versus state water, despite the additional time Boyle 
Engineering has given city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The city now has time to save money to build either a pipeline or a 
desalination plant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should take advantage of that," Buford said. "I think the council as a 
whole could duck it pretty easily . . . but we need to make a decision."

OXNARD SCHOOL WILL GET CITY WATER; UTILITIES: LAFCO REVERSES EARLIER VOTE AND 
APPROVES ANNEXATION TO CALLEGUAS DISTRICT. CONCERN OVER GROUND SUPPLIES CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Swayed by concerns about preserving ground-water supplies, a state agency on 
Wednesday reversed an earlier vote and decided to allow the new Oxnard High 
School to hook up to city water. 
</P>
<P>
 The Local Agency Formation Commission voted 4 to 1 in favor of annexing the 
new school site to Calleguas Municipal Water District, which supplies water to 
the city of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision overturned LAFCO's 3-2 vote in November, when a majority of 
commissioners rejected the annexation request because the school is being built 
in the center of an agricultural area west of the Oxnard city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Commissioners Maria VanderKolk and Robert N. McKinney changed 
their earlier votes to join John K. Flynn and Alex Fiore in the majority 
supporting the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Only LAFCO Chairman Larry Rose held fast to his previous vote against pumping 
city water to the new school, which is on Gonzalez Road near Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the vote, Fiore exhorted his fellow commissioners not to force the 
Oxnard Union High School District to drill a well to supply the new school's 
water as a punishment for building in an agricultural area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did what they did," Fiore said. "The school is there. Are we going to 
stand here and be ridiculous and say 'Tear down this school and we'll give you 
a purified source of water?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In their initial decision in November, commissioners said they were concerned 
that piping city water to the new school would encourage further development on 
the agricultural fields surrounding the site. To avoid this possibility, the 
board ruled Wednesday that no other property owner can get water from the pipes 
that will hook the school to Calleguas. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, commissioners required that the pipes to the school site be no 
larger than what is required to serve the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas gets its water from the Metropolitan Water District, which buys 
water from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard school officials had argued that well water would be a less reliable 
and lower-quality water source for the school, which is scheduled to open in 
January to replace the existing Oxnard High School on 5th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have also said they believe that piping in city water would 
be cheaper than operating their own well, although some LAFCO commissioners say 
ground water may be far cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't primarily arguments about finances, water quality or the 
reliability of well water that prompted McKinney and VanderKolk to reverse 
their earlier decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, both commissioners said they had changed their votes after hearing 
comments from the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency, which regulates 
ground water supplies in the Oxnard Plain. Fox Canyon officials told 
commissioners that they strongly recommend annexing the school to Calleguas to 
avoid an additional drain on the area's ground-water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite changing his vote, McKinney said he is still upset that school 
officials applied for the hookup to Calleguas after they had already begun 
building on the 50-acre school site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't like the process the school district followed any more than I 
did the last time we talked about this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And VanderKolk said after the meeting that she felt she had no choice but to 
reverse her earlier decision. "We really do want to try to protect our 
ground-water reserves as much as possible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said he also sympathizes with Fox Canyon's concerns about ground-water 
supplies, but he said LAFCO's primary duty is to enforce county planning 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ground-water management agency has its directives of conserving water and 
we have ours to preserve the agricultural land," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rose said he opposed the Calleguas annexation because he believes the 
school could save money by drilling water from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't really have the numbers there to convince me that the 
ground-water solution wasn't the right way to go," Rose said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 To hook up to Calleguas, Rose said, the school district will have to pay about 
$1.2 million upfront, which is $900,000 more than the estimated cost for the 
district to drill a well and install a purification system with water tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 After paying these one-time charges, the yearly fees for Calleguas water would 
cost the district about $70,000 a year, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the annual charges for drawing well water would run up to $22,000 
per year, although this amount could increase if the Fox Canyon Groundwater 
Management Agency raised its surcharges.

HEAVY RAINFALL EXPECTED FROM ALASKAN STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forecasters expected a storm moving south from the Gulf of Alaska to hit the 
area early today, bringing up to two inches of rain along the coast and up to 
four inches in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be one of the most significant rain producers of the season," said 
Clint Simpson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. "Whenever you 
have a cold front bumping into a moist flow of air like this you're going to 
get a lot of rain." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the cold front moving with the storm could drop temperatures 
by 10 degrees or more, with nighttime lows falling to the low 40s and daytime 
highs to the low 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Warm air from the southwest will prevent temperatures from dipping any lower, 
but will contribute to the amount of rainfall expected, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather service has a flash flood watch in effect, and forecasters said 
the rains could pose a problem in the areas where the November fires burned 
away vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk is that the ground will become saturated, and that's when you get 
the mud flows like they had in Malibu during the last rains," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although county officials said they were not anticipating any major flood 
problems, they were keeping a close eye on the fire-scorched areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made sure that the people living in those areas have been made aware 
of the problems that can occur after a major brush fire," said John Weikel, a 
senior engineer for the Ventura County Flood Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, officials from the mountains to the sea geared up for the winter 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just telling people to come up here prepared for the worst," said Don 
Trammell, recreation officer for the Mt. Pinos Ranger District. "We've got some 
nice cross-country skiing up here, but be careful on your drive up. When the 
rain and snow hit, it tends to get slick." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the snow level could drop as low as 4,000 feet and a fresh 
blanket of up to two feet of snow could fall by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Trammell said visitors to the mountains should wait a few days for the snow to 
settle so maintenance crews can clear the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "This storm probably won't interfere with traffic on Interstate 5, but the 
roads up to campsites and the recreation area on Mt. Pinos take two to three 
days to clear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, area stores have received calls from skiers looking to rent 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sport Chalet sporting goods store in Oxnard, Chuck Dawley said he was 
anxious to hit the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any extra snow we get (from this storm) is just a bonus," said Dawley, who is 
heading to Mammoth Mountain with his two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as park officials were calling for caution on mountain roads, the U.S. 
Coast Guard was warning boaters to avoid stormy seas. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the wind gets up over 15 m.p.h. the seas become very uncomfortable," 
said Petty Officer Roger Fuller. "When they get up over 20 m.p.h. it gets 
downright dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Winds, which are expected to be between 20 and 30 m.p.h., make waves steep 
enough to capsize small boats, he said, adding that the greatest danger is that 
the weather can turn on boaters with a sudden ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
 "One minute you're out there having a fine time and the next minute the seas 
are kicking up all around you," he said. "The best thing to do is stay away 
when storms like this are expected." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said a storm like the one expected today has been long 
overdue, as rainfall levels have remained well below the 30-year average. 
</P>
<P>
 To date this rain season, Ventura should have received about 10 inches of 
rain, but has had only 5.27 inches. Thousand Oaks normally has nine inches of 
rain by this time, but has had only 4.53 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the bulk of this storm's rain will drop today, leaving a 
chance of scattered showers for Friday and the weekend.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 2 AGENTS ARRESTED IN INSURANCE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mother-daughter team of Thousand Oaks insurance agents have been arrested by 
Ventura County sheriff's detectives for alleged sales of bogus car insurance 
policies in California and Washington, detectives said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby Isley, 47, of Beverly Hills and Suzette Lassiter, 26, of Phoenix were 
arrested Monday in Ventura County Municipal Court as they arrived to defend 
themselves against a small claims suit filed by one of their policyholders, 
said Sheriff's Sgt. Kitty Hoberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were handcuffed and booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of 
grand theft and later released on $5,000 bond each, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were accepting premiums for insurance policies that were never written," 
and are believed to have swindled at least 21 motorists in the counties of Los 
Angeles, Orange and Kern, and as far away as Washington, Hoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Isley and Lassiter sold motorists insurance policies from a Westlake Village 
mail drop office using the fictitious name California Auto Plan and the name of 
a real firm -- the California Indemnity Co., which only writes policies for 
workers' compensation insurance, Hoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims discovered their policies were worthless when "they send in claims 
but they are never paid, or they are paid and the check bounces," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Isley and Lassiter closed their office in December, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are quite a few people that have been sending money, and there's no 
insurance," Hoberg said.  
</P>
<P>
 Detectives learned of the alleged scam after policyholders complained to the 
California Department of Insurance, which referred complaints to the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department, Hoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is asking other policyholders who bought insurance from 
Lassiter and Isley to call detectives at (805) 494-8201 any time between 7 a.m. 
and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PARISHIONERS OBSERVE START OF LENT 
SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Catholics across Ventura County on Wednesday observed the traditional 
beginning of the Lenten season, a time designated for fasting, prayer and 
increased charity. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the ritual for Ash Wednesday, Catholic parishioners received ashes 
on their foreheads in the shape of a cross to signify their intent to 
participate in self-reflection and discipline that are part of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come from dust and we go to dust," said Anthony Kiskis, a parishioner at 
St. Rose of Lima Church in Simi Valley. "This is the day to think about leaving 
something good before you leave" the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Protestants and members of other Western churches also observe Ash Wednesday, 
but most do not follow the ash-marking ritual or strict rules on fasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Michael Bunny at St. Rose said the tradition of marking the forehead 
with ash grew from the historical practice of covering sinners with ash when 
they repented and promised to follow the teachings of the church. The ashes are 
the remains of palm fronds that were burned on Palm Sunday of the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ashes on the forehead are an indication of a person's willingness to turn 
away from sin and follow the Gospel," Bunny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholics traditionally fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday and abstain from 
eating meat on Fridays during the 40 days of Lent, Bunny said. But fasting does 
not necessarily apply only to food, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have a loose tongue might try to fast from that," Bunny said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to focus on self-improvement and helping others as a way to become 
closer to the ideals of Christ's life, Bunny said. The observance of Lent ends 
with Good Friday, commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus. BRENDA DAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; ACCOUNTANT TESTIFIES IN PIROLI TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An accountant testified Wednesday he found no evidence of wrongdoing by Father 
David Dean Piroli in an analysis of cash records at the priest's two former 
parishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination by Piroli's attorney, accountant Daniel McCarthy 
admitted he found no proof that the priest had mishandled money at St. Peter 
Claver Church in Simi Valley and Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli, 47, was indicted on two counts of grand theft after police found 
$10,000 in cash in his church car and parishioners found another $50,000 in 
cash, checks and collection envelopes in his bedroom and office at St. Peter 
Claver. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection money "could have been stolen by anyone who had access" to 
places where cash was kept at the Simi Valley church, McCarthy testified in 
Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The parish had risky security for collection money and unusual bookkeeping 
practices when Piroli was assistant pastor there from 1990 to 1992, McCarthy 
told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy had already testified that Piroli's bank accounts swelled and the 
churches' cash deposits shrank while he was serving at each parish. 
</P>
<P>
 But under questioning by defense attorney Douglas Levinson, McCarthy conceded 
that he never saw ledgers or conventional cash records other than bank 
statements while doing his analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy also admitted that his analysis could be thrown into doubt if large 
amounts of cash were taken from collection money before it was counted and 
deposited in the bank.  
</P>
<P>
 Father James McKeon, former pastor and supervisor of Piroli at St. Peter 
Claver, testified that he would sometimes take more than $150 at a time out of 
collection money to pay for expenses and notify the parish money-counters. 
</P>
<P>
 But under further questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace, McCarthy said 
the drop in cash deposits at the bank would not reflect someone taking 
collection money before it had been counted. MACK REED

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; WORK BEGINS ON COLLEGE SOCCER FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers and volunteers at Oxnard College spread about 800 tons of mushroom 
compost across a field early Wednesday in preparation for the laying of sod 
next month and the transformation of rough ground into a lush, world-class 
soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of like an empty space next to an existing soccer field, so by 
the time we get finished getting the sod in, we're going to have one slightly 
older field and one brand new field," said college spokeswoman Cathy 
Garnica."It will be behind a brand new P. E. complex that we're building right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 The compost material was donated by Pictsweet Mushroom Farms in Ventura and 
was hauled for free by Conejo Ready Mix in Moorpark, Garnica said. "We just had 
to provide the elbow grease and the bodies to get it moving and get it spread 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past few weeks, college ground crews and volunteers have spread 
mulch and dug irrigation lines in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Once completed, the Oxnard field will be used by one of the World Cup soccer 
teams for training this spring, Garnica said, and later by the college and 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials are planning to lay the sod early next month and are looking 
for volunteers to lend a hand to the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to need dozens of folks, maybe more than 100 to get that sod 
out," Garnica said. 
</P>
<P>
 To volunteer, call Barbara Gilmore in the Institutional Advancement Office at 
986-5864. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

 Police arrested three men Wednesday on suspicion of stabbing an Oxnard man who 
remained in critical condition at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuan Le, 24, was attacked in the parking lot of a convenience store at the 
corner of 1st Street and Rose Avenue in Oxnard at 10:45 p.m. Tuesday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Le and an unidentified friend stopped at the store to buy cigarettes, police 
said. While Le waited in the car for his friend to go in the store, three men 
approached him, demanded his money and stabbed him at least four times before 
running away, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Le's friend took him to the hospital and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, police arrested Victor Ramirez, 20, Victor Manuel Magana-Pizano, 
18, and Luciano Quiroz, 18, all of Oxnard. CHRISTINA LIMA

NBA ROUNDUP; HORNETS LOOK UP AT ROCKETS, THEN BEAT THEM, 102-97 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlotte had lost eight in a row and was without its starting front line -- 
center Alonzo Mourning and forwards Larry Johnson and Scott Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston has perhaps the best big man in basketball in Hakeem Olajuwon and had 
beaten the Hornets 12 times in 13 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 102, Houston 97. 
</P>
<P>
 Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersey Hawkins had 25 points and a career-high 14 rebounds for the Hornets on 
Wednesday at Charlotte, where Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich wasn't happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlotte is still very hard to defend, even without their big guns," 
Tomjanovich said. "Muggsy (Bogues, who had 17 points and 13 assists) played a 
great game, and Hawkins seemed to have a dagger for use every time he was left 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out very unaggressive and dug a big hole for ourselves. Charlotte 
shot the heck out of the ball and we couldn't stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon finished with 30 points and 12 rebounds to lead Houston, but 
he missed a three-pointer with less than 10 seconds to play that would have 
tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Suns 126, Trail Blazers 100 -- Charles Barkley scored 20 points in 29 minutes 
in his first game since Jan. 7. His replacement, Cedric Ceballos, had 30 points 
at Phoenix, which was 8-9 in Barkley's absence because of a torn tendon in his 
right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 A.C. Green had 10 of his 15 rebounds and nine of his 16 points in the third 
quarter, which started with Portland ahead 50-45 and ended with the Suns 
leading, 86-70. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 107, Milwaukee 95 -- Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf scored 21 points and Dikembe 
Mutombo grabbed 16 rebounds at Milwaukee, where the Nuggets snapped a 
three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Williams scored 18 points and LaPhonso Ellis 15 for Denver, which never 
trailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Barry scored 17 points for the Bucks, 6-19 at home and 8-17 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 109, Chicago 101 -- Steve Smith capped a rally from a 21-point deficit 
with 14 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter at Chicago, where the Heat ended 
the Bulls' home-court winning streak at 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls had not lost at home since Nov. 13 and are 18-3 there, but 0-2 
against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 94, Philadelphia 92 -- Mitch Richmond sank a three-pointer from the 
right wing with nine seconds to play in overtime at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Richmond finished with 31 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for the second 
triple-double of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Weatherspoon scored 20 points for the 76ers but blew a chance to win 
the game in regulation by missing two free throws with 21 seconds to play.

SACCO'S 2 GOALS, SPEED HELP DUCKS STOP FLYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Joe Sacco can skate like the wind. But like the wind that blows, Sacco has 
sometimes blown his chances. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't missed many opportunities lately. Sacco scored two goals for the 
second consecutive game Wednesday and added two assists as the Mighty Ducks 
beat the Philadelphia Flyers, 6-3, before a sellout crowd of 17,174 at Anaheim 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to see Joe score on some of his chances, because his speed creates 
so many," Duck Coach Ron Wilson said. "Joe's been playing great since he got 
wind of the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco played for the U.S. Olympic team himself in 1992 along with Duck 
teammates Tim Sweeney and Sean Hill. Now it is his brother David's turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he can get a couple for the U.S. (today) against Canada," Sacco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco, who also scored twice in a victory at Edmonton Sunday, broke open a 3-2 
game with two third-period goals. 
</P>
<P>
 On his first, he took a shot from the right wing and swooped in for the 
rebound after Dominic Roussel stopped the shot with his pads. Sacco pounced on 
it and lifted the puck high to score at 1:24 of the third. 
</P>
<P>
 His speed was the key to the second, and he lifted it high, too, for his 11th 
goal of the season and his sixth in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "You give a guy with Joe's speed and talent consistent chances and he's going 
to score," said captain Troy Loney, who skated with Sacco on a line centered by 
Shaun Van Allen that contributed four goals. Van Allen had three points on a 
goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Sacco) was snakebit earlier," Loney said. "He was hitting posts and things. 
But his speed opens up so much for all of us, even when he doesn't score." 
</P>
<P>
 With little fanfare, the Ducks reached a milestone. Their 23rd victory matched 
Tampa Bay's season-victory total in the Lightning's first season last year. 
That mark was the best by a recent expansion team until Florida (25-21-10) 
surpassed it last week. Now the Panthers and Ducks are chasing the 31-32-11 
mark by the 1967-68 Flyers, who had the best first-year record in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks jumped ahead of the weary Flyers early and led, 2-0, only 4:26 into 
the game after goals by Van Allen and Bob Corkum. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum, 26, started the season as the team's checking center but his goal made 
him the first Duck to reach 20 goals. He now has twice as many goals this 
season as he did in his NHL career, which consisted of 96 games with the 
Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flyers, who have an ugly 2-9-1 record since the All-Star break, were not 
playing well but got a goal back three minutes into the second period on Eric 
Lindros' power-play goal on a shot from high in the slot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks made it 3-1 at 6:45 when defenseman Alexei Kasatonov took the puck 
off the boards and skated across the slot for a slap shot. The goal was his 
fourth of the season, and his first since Dec. 12 against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 But only 20 seconds later, the lead was back to one. Mikael Renberg took a 
pass from Dimitri Yushkevich and put the puck in from right in front of the 
net. The goal was reviewed, but stood, and Renberg took over the rookie 
goal-scoring lead from Ottawa's Alexei Yashin with his 26th goal.

FORGET DOGHOUSE: HARPER WANTS OUT OF JAIL; PRO BASKETBALL: HE RIPS TEAM BEFORE 
LOSS TO JAZZ. STOCKTON GETS 9,000TH ASSIST.

 Ron Harper can't wait to be paroled from the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 A free agent at the end of the season, Harper is counting the days until his 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just doing my jail time," Harper said. "In about 65 or 70 more days my 
time is up and I'll be out on GB, good behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 But how can someone who earns $4 million a year compare it to being 
incarcerated? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still jail time," Harper said. "Jail time is jail time no matter how 
much you're getting, right? It's still jail time." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper and Danny Manning, the Clippers' leading scorers, returned to the 
lineup for Wednesday's 103-99 loss to the Utah Jazz before 9,733 at the Sports 
Arena after being benched for Tuesday night's 100-89 victory over the Lakers 
because they missed Monday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning scored 16 points before fouling out, but Harper struggled, missing six 
of seven shots and scoring only four points as the Clippers squandered a 
15-point third-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stockton had 15 points and 12 assists, giving him 9,009 assists for his 
career. Only Magic Johnson (9,921) and Oscar Robertson (9,887) are ahead of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Malone scored a season-high 27 points, 15 in the third quarter, and Karl 
Malone had 23 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Jazz (32-18). 
</P>
<P>
 Utah, which trailed 94-89, outscored the Clippers 14-5 in the final 3:13. The 
Clippers, who shot only 38% in the final quarter, scored only one basket in the 
final 3:13. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Jazz trailing, 99-98, after Tom Tolbert, who had a season-high 17 
points made a three-pointer with 20.9 seconds remaining, Stockton sank a 
three-pointer with 5.2 seconds remaining to give the Jazz a 101-99 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't looking for a three," Stockton said. "It just kind of happened. 
There wasn't much thought, it just went in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers had a chance to tie it after Tyrone Corbin fouled guard Mark 
Jackson with 0.2 seconds remaining, but Jackson missed the first free throw and 
intentionally missed the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just missed the first one," said Jackson, who had a season-high 26 points 
and 10 assists. "There's no explanation, I just missed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a long night for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper didn't feel that he was punished by being benched against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't make me no difference," said Harper, who played only 20 minutes 
against the Jazz, none in the fourth quarter. "It didn't hurt me, it's the fans 
who came to the game last night and paid to see the game (who were cheated). 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good time last night. I needed that extra day off. It just meant that 
instead of five days off with not doing anything I had six. " 
</P>
<P>
 Did Harper feel that Weiss tried to make an example of them? 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever," Harper said. "What Coach Weiss wanted to do he did, so I hope he 
felt good about it. He just changed the rule, that's all he did. The rule now 
is if you miss practice and nobody died in your family, you can't play the next 
day. I don't care if you're sick, you've got to bring your (butt) in. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Harper sick? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I was healthy," Harper said. "I just missed my flight and I don't feel 
sorry I missed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper thinks the Clippers got a glimpse of the future when they beat the 
Lakers without him and Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it says is they better face reality and take a good look at last night, 
because next season that's what it's going to look like," Harper said. "If 
that's what they want to put on the court next year, God bless 'em."

 These are not quite the Greenpeace Games, but give Norwegians credit for 
trying to take the eco-route in the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The bobsled run is made of wood, not metal, and is tucked into a forest, 
invisible from the road. The Viking Ship, the speedskating arena, is already a 
landmark. The hockey rink blasted out of a mountain is a huge energy-saver. The 
Olympic torch burns "bio-gas" produced from rotting vegetation. A smoke-free 
environment is encouraged. Signs are made of recyclable cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Get this: Officials even plan to send volunteers into the woods to gather the 
bullets fired in the biathlon.  
</P>
<P>
 Someone, obviously with too much time to kill, even came up with the notion of 
eating the plates. No kidding. In Lillehammer, you eat the meal and what it is 
served on -- the plates of dull white with a blue ring around the edge made of 
potato starch. John Eisenberg of the Baltimore Sun, who dined on the trendy 
cuisine, broke off pieces and tried his with sugar, salt and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 It gave new meaning to the phrase "blue plate special." It also reminded 
people of the Albertville Games in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The French basically put a jackhammer to their beautiful Savoie region, 
bulldozing acres of forest, building a highway across wetlands and erecting a 
bobsled run cooled by poisonous gas," Eisenberg wrote. "It was the first Winter 
Olympics with coughing as a medal event."

 Aw, the Veeck with it: Imagine a Veeck being against a publicity windfall such 
as Michael Jordan signing with the Chicago White Sox. But that is what has 
happened, with Michael Veeck, the 42-year-old son of Bill Veeck, the late 
legendary owner of the same team, angry at the hypocrisy of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (current owner) Jerry Reinsdorf bought the team from my dad, he said, 
'Now we're going to bring style to the South Side. The circus is over.' When he 
calls my lineage into question, I can't ever forget that. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a Veeck, I'd kill for this type of ink, but it just doesn't feel right. 
The game is the crown jewel. Here you have the greatest team player in sports 
being put in position as a team-breaker. 
</P>

 "My dad devoted his life to the game with the idea that baseball is 
entertainment. But Michael Jordan, he's only a money-making machine to these 
guys."

 Garden party: The Boston Celtics probably should have warned rookie Dino 
Radja. They should have told him the other 26 arenas in the NBA aren't like 
Boston Garden, that he shouldn't necessarily turn around and go back to play in 
Europe. Instead, he found out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Boston Garden) is a bad place," said Radja, the Croatian star who had spent 
the last three seasons playing in Italy after the Celtics drafted him in 1989. 
"Bad place, bad place. It's great history, like playing in a museum. When you 
enter inside, it's like a special feeling when you step on the court. That was 
the first place I step in. But after, when I step in other places, I see what

NHL ROUNDUP; HAWERCHUK JOINS ELITE ASSIST LEADERS AS SABRES WIN, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dale Hawerchuk had the best of both worlds Wednesday in Hartford, where he had 
two assists to become the 14th player in NHL history to reach 800 in his career 
and help the Buffalo Sabres beat the Whalers, 5-3, to get a little breathing 
space in the playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo has 62 points, good for sixth in the East and two points ahead of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every night is a battle and because it's do or die, that's really good for 
us," Hawerchuk said. "The last couple of years we've had a playoff berth locked 
up with a month or so to go, but this year, you have to be at the top of your 
game every night." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawerchuk assisted on Yuri Khmylev's goal, which snapped a 2-2 tie at 6:30 of 
the second period. The milestone came on Donald Audette's power-play goal that 
completed the scoring with 7:45 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawerchuk has 1,273 points in 1,006 games. Boston 3, Dallas 0 -- Jon Casey 
turned aside 26 shots by his former teammates at Dallas to earn his third 
shutout in his last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cam Neely, playing in his 37th game, scored his 42nd goal of the season and 
the Bruins, 4-0-1 in their last five games, moved into sole possession of first 
place in the Northeast Division, two points ahead of idle Montreal. Detroit 7, 
Florida 3 -- Ray Sheppard and Steve Chiasson scored two goals apiece for the 
Red Wings in Florida's first trip to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's Eldon Reddick made his first start in goal since the 1990-91 season, 
facing 34 shots.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm glad the NHL has more guts than the U.S. Olympic Committee. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 King winger Tony Granato got what he deserved when he was suspended 15 games 
for his wood chop to the head of Chicago Blackhawk defenseman Neil Wilkinson. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The problem facing the Kings is that without Granato and the two forwards sent 
to Pittsburgh in the Marty McSorley deal -- Tomas Sandstrom and Shawn McEachern 
-- they're extremely thin up front. 
</P>
<P>
 However, McSorley's return Friday against the Philadelphia Flyers should lift 
the sagging spirits of his teammates and the Forum fans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Marty! Marty! Marty!" will be the chant of a capacity crowd. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings have had 21 sellouts, but the fans, normally among the most 
vociferous in the NHL, have been as lifeless as the team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Paek, who also was acquired in the deal, is the only Korean-born player in 
the league. The 6-foot-1, 195-pound, 26-year-old defenseman, whose name is 
pronounced "Pack," has returned to his native country the last two summers to 
conduct hockey camps. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Those who worry that the Lakers are going to blow another opportunity for a 
lottery pick should have been heartened by Tuesday night's 100-89 loss to the 
Danny Manning- and Ron Harper-less Clippers at the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There is the feeling of a cross-town NBA rivalry only when the teams play at 
the Sports Arena. The crowds usually are larger and split in their allegiance. 
The pro-Laker gathering of 11,954 Tuesday night was so quiet that you could 
hear the racket from the Inglewood public library. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' two McSorley trades bring to mind the time the Cleveland Indians 
traded catcher Harry Chiti to the New York Mets for a player to be named, who 
turned out to be Chiti. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky's comeback from 31 points down to beat Louisiana State showed what a 
difference great three-point shooting and lousy one-point shooting can make. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 It is important for UCLA to win enough of its remaining games to stay in the 
West during the NCAA tournament. The first- and second-round games are at 
Sacramento, the regional at the Sports Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins' final home game is March 6 against Louisville, the team USC Coach 
George Raveling now is picking to win the NCAA championship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 USC opens spring football practice on March 9, UCLA on April 4. . . . 
</P>

REMEMBER SUTTON? HE'S BACK; GOLF: PLAYER ONCE HAILED AS 'THE NEXT JACK 
NICKLAUS' SHOOTS A 63 FOR ONE-STROKE LEAD IN BOB HOPE CLASSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time when Hal Sutton would not have been especially excited about 
shooting a nine-under-par 63 in the first round of a 90-hole tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, everybody lights up the leader board in the Bob Hope Chrysler 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite shot 35 under par to win it last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Sutton's round Wednesday at Indian Wells, considered the easiest of 
the four desert courses used in this tournament, left him with only a 
one-stroke lead over Ronnie Black, who shot a 64 at La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
 But being in the lead any day is encouraging for Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time since I have done anything," said Sutton, who was being 
hailed as "the next Jack Nicklaus" more than 10 years ago, after he had won a 
PGA Championship and the Tournament Players Championship at 25. "That was my 
best round in at least three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton, golf's leading money winner in 1983 and among the top 10 the next two 
years, has almost fallen off the charts. He finished 185th on the money list in 
1992 and 161st last year. The 10-year exemption from his 1983 PGA Championship 
ran out last year, and the only reason he can play this year is that he has 
taken a one-time exemption for being in the top 50 on the all-time money list. 
He was 32nd at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people kept asking how I felt taking that exemption," Sutton said. 
"They act like I ought to give it back. I used to play pretty good, so I guess 
I earned it. I'd rather do that than go back to qualifying school." 
</P>
<P>
 The way Sutton has played the last two years, getting back on the tour through 
qualifying school would have been a longshot. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what did happen to Sutton's bright future? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know exactly what happened," Sutton said. "I started listening to too many 
people. I was trying to get better. You know, it's not just a Hal Sutton thing. 
Everybody wants to get better. I listened to everybody and tried everything and 
proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that I couldn't do anything that they told 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton finally realized that he had earned $3.3 million playing golf his way 
and $100,000 in two years of taking everybody's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "For two years, I just threw all of my knowledge in a waste basket," he said. 
"I just let everybody do with me what they wanted. I've played this game for 25 
years and I quit relying on the knowledge I had." 
</P>
<P>
 When Sutton was at his peak, he was one of the game's best ball-strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time I was putting well, I felt I had a chance to win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the past two years, his ball-striking has been the missing link in 
his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shell-shocked because I hit so many drives off line," he said. "I used 
to hit it straight, on a line. Then, not only was I off line by 50 or 60 yards, 
I didn't even know which way I was going to miss." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton finally went back to Jimmy Ballard, his original instructor, and asked 
for some videotape of what he should be working on. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw that tape, I was so far off, I told Jimmy I would come and see him 
when I was closer," Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's close. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting there," Sutton said. "I'll tell you one thing: My patience has 
been stretched to its limit. If I had any suicidal tendencies, I'd have taken 
them by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton isn't convinced he's over the hump yet. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least it feels good again to hit the ball and see it fly in the 
intended direction. Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Delsing, Donnie Hammond and Clark Dennis share third place at 65. All of 
their rounds were played at La Quinta. . . . Jodie Mudd, Tom Sieckmann, John 
Huston and Guy Boros each shot a 66 to share the low round at Bermuda Dunes and 
are among 10 players tied for sixth. . . . Payne Stewart, John Wilson and 
Andrew Magee, at 67, shared the low round on the Palmer Course at PGA West, 
where the celebrities were also playing.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; NOTEBOOK; RACE-OFF ELIMINATES WILL FROM 
BOBSLED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a three-way, two-heat race-off for the two U.S. positions in two-man 
bobsled competition beginning Saturday, drivers Jim Herberich and Brian Shimer 
eliminated Randy Will. 
</P>
<P>
 Herberich's Bo-Dyn sled will be designated USA I, since he and pusher Chip 
Minton won the race-off with a time of 1:46.93 for the two heats.Shimer's 
Bo-Dyn will be USA II. He and pusher Randy Jones did 1:47.17, edging Will and 
Jeff Woodard by eight one-hundredths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer, in his third Olympics, wasn't pleased to merely stay alive in two-man. 
He is hampered by what he says is a very sore left hamstring strain, which 
affects his start times, and said his Bo-Dyn still needs tuning on the Olympic 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping to be in the 52s by now," he said of his 53.28 and 53.89 heats. 
"Other countries are running pretty fast, and we're not where we should be. I'm 
not excited just making the team. I'm here to win a medal." 
</P>
<P>
 One distraction was removed for Shimer and teammates when driver Bruce 
Rosselli dropped the suit he had filed in an Indianapolis federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli had charged the U.S. bobsled federation with a conspiracy against him 
in the Olympic trials and said Shimer had been a part of it. Rosselli was also 
asking the court to order new trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe . . . we should not continue that fight when it threatens to throw 
a cloud over the many innocent American bobsled athletes who are competing in 
Norway," Rosselli said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would continue to ask the U.S. Olympic Committee to investigate his 
charges, but a USOC spokesman said there is no investigation pending. ROSS

 Russia's assistant hockey coach, Igor Dmitriev, defused German press reports 
claiming that Coach Viktor Tikhonov had been replaced by a third coach who 
appeared behind the bench for the final period of Monday's 5-0 loss to Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional coach is Vladimir Yurzinov, who coaches a team in Turku in the 
Finnish League. He joined Tikhonov and Dmitriev behind the bench again 
Wednesday, for Russia's 9-1 rout of Austria, but Dmitriev said Yurzinov's 
presence does not signal Tikhonov's exit.

 Canada's scouting report for tonight's game against the United States should 
be especially insightful. Canadian winger Paul Kariya played at the University 
of Maine with U.S. goalies Mike Dunham and Garth Snow, defenseman Matt Martin 
and forward Peter Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough seeing them go down the ice when you're used to cheering for them 
and for Dunny and Snowy," Kariya said. "In practice I could tell you where 
everyone shoots on them or where I shoot on them. But it's not like situations 
like that will come up in a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Canadian assistant coach Dany Dube: "We expect them to play tough on him. 
(Brett Hauer) is always all over Paul. They'll probably play really dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian right wing Chris Kontos, who counts the Kings among his NHL stops, 
compared Kariya to another King. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very Gretzky-like," Kontos said. "He sees the ice very well and does 
amazing things with the puck. I've really enjoyed playing with him and with 
Petr (Nedved). They've given our team a lot more dimensions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Lazaro provided an unexpected moment of mirth during practice when he 
crashed through the protective plexiglass at Kristin Hall. He had difficulty 
getting back onto his feet, but only because he was laughing uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just going to bounce off the boards," he said. "I didn't bounce, it 
gave way." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Snow: "It must be awful weak glass because I know he's not that strong. 
Or else, he should lose some weight." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Finland's 3-0 start, Russia's 2-1 record and Sweden's 1-0-1 performance have 
made the hockey seedings nearly irrelevant, says Chuck Grillo, vice president 
and director of player personnel for the San Jose Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen it happen too many times, that the Russians started off badly and 
ended up playing for the gold, but maybe this is the year that it won't 
happen," he said. "From all things I've seen, it looks like they could have big 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it does is, it throws the tournament open to the emotional efforts of 
everyone else. The game is still played with emotion. You can X and O the hell 
out of it, but it's still played with emotion, and the team that realizes that 
could end up winning the whole thing." HELENE ELLIOTT

 Two Italian journalists lost their credentials Wednesday for two days because 
they had carried a video camera into Tuesday's five-kilometer women's 
cross-country ski race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee said the credentials had been 
picked up because only rights-holders -- CBS, Eurosport and other organizations 
that paid to televise the Games -- were allowed to use video cams at the 
venues. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 From Hugin, the official newspaper of the Lillehammer Games: 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire stations in the Olympic region have received several false alarms in the 
last few days. The reason for this is that too many people in the region are 
taking showers with the door open and the steam activates the fire alarm. 
Johnny Haarberg, duty officer at Lillehammer's fire station, urges everybody 
taking a shower to shut the bathroom door to prevent steam reaching the 
alarms." MIKE KUPPER

 Now, here's a cause you can get behind: Some U.S. mogul skiers wore gold 
armbands during the finals, protesting that freestyle ballet has not been made 
an Olympic sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a shame that some of the world's best athletes are not able to compete 
in the Olympics," said Liz McIntyre, the silver-medal winner in moguls. 
</P>
<P>
 But McIntyre was not among the skiers wearing an armband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't wear mine, frankly, because I forgot," she said.

 Add McIntyre: Her parents came to Lillehammer to watch her in the Olympics. 
McIntyre, who grew up in New Hampshire but now lives in Winter Park, Colo.,

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; DISAPPOINTING END FOR U.S. MOGUL SKIER; 
FREESTYLE: DEFENDING CHAMPION WEINBRECHT IS SEVENTH. TEAMMATE MCINTYRE WINS 
SILVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wednesday's mogul final at the Kanthaugen Freestyle Arena was as much about 
the loser as the winner, as much about seventh place as first. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about Donna Weinbrecht, the Bambino of Bumps, defending Olympic 
champion, the winner of 30 World Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
 The best mogul skier ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht has been on the podium so many times she didn't know how to react 
to seventh place. Where should she stand? Were there parting gifts? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never been down that far before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht, inexperienced in such things, was gracious enough in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Stine Lise Hattestad, who, like the rest, had long skied in Weinbrecht's 
shadow, at last could bask as she claimed the gold medal on home snow, as 
jubilant Norwegians waved flags and sang choruses of their anthem, "Victory Is 
Ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Hattestad claimed the gold with a winning score of 25.97, enough to defeat Liz 
McIntyre, the American veteran who managed to wait out Weinbrecht long enough 
to earn the silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's Elizaveta Kojevnikova, who finished second to Weinbrecht at 
Albertville, earned the bronze. Sensing it might never get any better, 
Hattestad announced her retirement afterward. Defeating Weinbrecht brought 
bewilderment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I quite understand what I've done yet," Hattestad said.  
</P>
<P>
 Added McIntyre: "I don't think it's really hit me." 
</P>
<P>
 For McIntyre, a Dartmouth graduate, skiing behind Weinbrecht certainly has 
been an education. In seven years on the U.S. team, McIntyre has won two World 
Cup events. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight fewer than Weinbrecht. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, when it counted, it was McIntyre who raced like a champion. There was 
some argument, in fact, whether hers was the gold-medal run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very well prepared," McIntyre said. "I had a lot of fun. I'm a happy 
camper in Norway. I tried to stay pretty calm about the whole thing and treat 
it like a World Cup. The fact I'm at the Olympics really hasn't crossed my mind 
yet. I think tomorrow I'll start enjoying the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht, on a comeback quest to defend her Olympic gold after tearing knee 
ligaments in 1992, was not her usual self, despite winning the first six World 
Cup competitions this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A week before the Olympics, Hattestad defeated her at a World Cup event at 
Salen, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, in the elimination round, Weinbrecht bobbled after one of her jumps 
and finished sixth. Although first-day scores don't carry over, the starting 
order for finals is arranged in reverse order, from worst to best. It is 
generally agreed that impressing the judges is more difficult from the middle 
of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Weinbrecht deserved to win. She said she felt numb in the starting 
gate, "like an out-of-body experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht clearly had been spooked by Tuesday's error. Later that night, in 
her room, she cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up in the middle of the night and I kept seeing the mistake I made," 
she said. "I kept playing that over and over in my head." 
</P>
<P>
 She can admit now that standing in the starting gate has been hell all season 
with those doubts in her head and that heavy brace protecting her right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as she was winning World Cup races, Weinbrecht would call her mother and 
say, "Pray for me. I can't do it. I can't get down the course." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht was losing her mental edge. Maybe it was the injury. Or 
indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, she wanted to see the comeback through. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'd regret it more if I was on the couch watching the Olympics," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 28, there are no more moguls left to conquer, though. Retirement appears 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like that right now," Weinbrecht said. "I gave it my best shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Before, her best shot was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be very thankful for all the accomplishments I've had," she said. 
"I have a gold medal and I've been a champion. It's all right. I wish things 
could have gone better. But it just didn't happen and I've got to be a champion 
without the gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, surrounded by her family in the freestyle coral, Weinbrecht thanked 
supporters who made the trip. She hugged her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want you to be disappointed," said her mother, Caroline. "I thought 
you did great." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, Weinbrecht was elated for McIntyre, calling her performance 
"awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht said she thought McIntrye had won. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the U.S. men, Troy Benson, who made the Olympic team only because of an 
injury to a teammate, finished eighth in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all I could have really hoped for," he said. "I was right where I 
deserved to be." 
</P>
<P>
 American Sean Smith finished 13th in the event, won by Canada's Jean-Luc 
Brassard. Serguei Shoupletsov of Russia took the silver, with Edgar Grospiron 
of France winning the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson had mixed feelings about the day. His own joy and elation for McIntyre 
was tempered by Weinbrecht's finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," Benson said, "sometimes somebody has to step down before somebody 
else can step up."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; CHANEY ABSENT, DEFENSE THERE IN TEMPLE VICTORY

 Though he scored 24 points in No. 13 Temple's 65-56 Atlantic 10 victory over 
St. Bonaventure on Wednesday night, Eddie Jones couldn't wait for the game to 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his teammates are tired of hearing questions about Coach John Chaney, 
who missed the game at Olean, N.Y., while he served a one-game suspension 
imposed by the school after he charged Massachusetts Coach John Calipari after 
Temple's 56-55 loss Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't wait until this whole thing blows over," Jones said. "It'll be nice 
to have coach back." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney is expected to return when Temple plays No. 5 Louisville on Sunday in 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chaney's absence, his trademark zone defense was the key to Temple's 
victory. "He's irreplaceable," assistant Jim Maloney said, "but there's a John 
Chaney stamp on this team that followed without him." 
</P>
<P>
 Temple (18-4, 11-3) beat the Bonnies (9-12, 3-8) for the 23rd time in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 Arkansas 102, Alabama 81 -- Corliss Williamson scored 10 points in the 
first four minutes of the second half at Fayetteville, Ark., as the Razorbacks 
(19-2, 9-2) avenged a Southeastern Conference loss to Alabama (13-8, 8-4) that 
had knocked them from the No. 1 spot earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma St. 63, No. 4 Kansas 59 -- Brooks Thompson forced overtime with a 
jump shot with 10 seconds to play, then sank two free throws with 10 seconds 
left in overtime to seal the upset victory for the Cowboys (17-7, 6-3 Big 
Eight) over Kansas (21-4, 6-3) in Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Duke 84, Virginia 54 -- Grant Hill and Antonio Lang scored 15 points 
each in the first half at Durham, N.C., for the Blue Devils (18-3, 9-3 Atlantic 
Coast). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7 Michigan 89, Iowa 76 -- Juwan Howard scored 24 points at Ann Arbor, 
Mich., and the Wolverines (18-4, 10-2 Big Ten) won their seventh game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Purdue 67, No. 24 Wisconsin 64 -- Glenn Robinson, the Division I scoring 
leader, had 27 points and 16 rebounds at West Lafayette, Ind., where the 
Boilermakers (21-3, 9-3 Big Ten) withstood a late three-point assault by 
Wisconsin (15-6, 6-6). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 Missouri 79, Iowa St. 72 -- Jevon Crudup scored eight of their 14 
points in overtime as the Tigers (19-2, 10-0 Big Eight) escaped with a victory 
at Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulane 66, No. 21 Alabama-Birmingham 60 -- LeVeldro Simmons scored 16 points,

Wave (13-9) upset Alabama-Birmingham (18-5) at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Florida 91, Georgia 79 -- Craig Brown and Dan Cross each scored 21

5-6) at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 23 Cincinnati 78, No. 18 Saint Louis 73 -- Curtis Bostic scored 11 of his 
15 points in the second half at Cincinnati where the Bearcats (17-7, 5-4 Great 
Midwest) beat the Billikens (19-3, 5-3). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 20 Minnesota 94, Penn St. 66 -- Voshon Lenard scored 30 points for the

SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS; ESTANCIA GETS BEST OF COLLISION AROUND 
THE GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Estancia broke a scoreless tie with two minutes left and defeated Garden 
Grove, 1-0, in a Division III wild-card boys' soccer game Wednesday at Garden 
Grove High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (9-8-5) advance to play Whittier La Serna, the first-place team 
from the Del Rio League, on Tuesday at La Serna. 
</P>
<P>
 The key play began uneventfully when the Estancia defense cleared the ball 
from its end high in the air. It landed in front of a Garden Grove defender, 
but the ball took a wild bounce over his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia midfielder Eric Espinoza then fielded the ball, made a move on 
another Argonaut defender and found himself one on one with Garden Grove 
goalkeeper Hector Rivas. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at a tough angle, Espinoza passed the ball across the middle to a 
charging Greg Dill, the Eagles' leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dill and Rivas got to the pass at the same time, but only Dill was still on 
his feet after the collision, and he put the ball into the open net for his 
16th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I scored, Eric told me he passed up the shot because he never makes 
those tough angle shots," Dill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dill, who led the Pacific Coast League in scoring this season after being 
named all-league his junior year, showed the wear of a long game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Rivas) cut me up on my legs," Dill said. "But it doesn't hurt when you 
score." 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia Coach Rich Llopis was not on hand to see his team advance because he 
had to attend class at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (Llopis) had already missed his class a couple times and he couldn't 
miss another one," Dill said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Garden Grove Coach Ryan Hill, this was a game that typified the Argonauts' 
9-9-3 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the story of our year," he said. "We outshoot the team and lose the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division III wild-card game: 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 2, Walnut 1 (2 OT) -- Junior Juan Lopez scored the winning goal with 
two minutes left in the second overtime period for Anaheim. Lopez, who has 25 
goals for the season, also scored the first goal on an assist from Jose 
Sanchez. The Colonists (19-6-2) will meet Bell Gardens at Bell Gardens in 
first-round play. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division I: 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 8, Redondo Union 1 -- The Chargers scored at will: Bryan Bagby had two 
and Darrin Urabe, Jerry Jimenez, Travis Clutter, Jason Trout, Todd Marcus and 
Matt Dutton each scored one. Edison (18-5-3) advances to play at top-seeded 
Simi Valley Royal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division V: 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Poly 1, Whittier Christian 0 (2OT) -- The Heralds finished 11-7-5.

SOUTHERN SECTION WRESTLING; LAGUNA HILLS DOMINATES IRVINE IN THE SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No fancy explanation needed here. Irvine simply ran out of gas and Laguna 
Hills had fuel -- lots of it -- to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the semifinals of the Division III Southern Section dual meet wrestling 
championships, No. 3 Laguna Hills defeated sixth-ranked Irvine, 36-17, at 
Laguna Hills Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Irvine Coach John Phillips could explain the score, it still took him 
by surprise: "They're not a bad team," he said, "but I didn't expect to lose by 
this much." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said a tie against University in the Sea View League early in the 
season put the pinch on the Vaqueros to do well the rest of the season, 
especially in the league finals last week, which Irvine won. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of pressure to perform, and to keep that up every match was 
hard," Phillips said. "But we still got this far." 
</P>
<P>
 To earn the semifinal berth against Laguna Hills, Irvine defeated Ontario 
Chaffey, 42-29, and Walnut, 37-17. Laguna Hills handled Corona Centennial, 
31-20, and eighth-ranked Sunny Hills, 36-22. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks made it look that easy all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one lost to anyone they should have beaten," said Laguna Hills' Mike 
Greco, who wrestled at 135 and 140 pounds and was 3-0 on the day. "We seemed to 
gain momentum as the day went on." 
</P>
<P>
 At least Sunny Hills made it a contest for a while. The Lancers won three of 
the first four weight classes before the Hawks swept the next seven. They 
forfeited 189 pounds and the heavyweight class. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's Peter Hamilton, with a 15-0 victory at 112 pounds, was the only 
Vaquero to win a match against Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches had voiced concern that dual-team play and individual championships, 
which begin Friday, are scheduled too close together and as a result, wrestlers 
don't have sufficient time to rest. But Hawks' Coach Cliff Jarmie isn't worried 
about the readiness of his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to forfeit some of the heavier weight classes, which helps, and 
the lower weight guys are in such great shape, they'll be fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory earned the Hawks the opportunity to meet Calvary Chapel in the 
Division III dual team final Feb. 24. They look forward to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to dethrone the State champion," Greco said with a smile. 
"In reality, I think they're too tough. But we'll do our best and see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division III semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel 41, Riverside Norte Vista 19 -- The defending State champion 
and top-ranked team in the state breezed through its semifinal after rolling 
over first and second-round opponents, Downey, 50-13, and Elsinore, 59-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of Calvary Chapel's top-ranked wrestlers: Joe Calavitta (103), Shane 
Valdez (119), Dane Valdez (125), Mauricio Mora (135), Josh Holiday (145) and Ed 
Mosley (152) were 3-0 for the day and won each of their matches by a pin or a 
technical fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Norte Vista, 171 pounder Matt Van Hook trailed 13-12, then won on a 
takedown with 10 seconds remaining. Van Hook also was 3-0 during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division I: 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 30, Santa Ana 25 -- Despite winning three of the last five matches, 
Santa Ana could not overcome Joe Camarillo's loss at the 145-pound spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo dislocated his elbow in overtime, losing the match, 7-5. The 
following match was delayed for 30 minutes while Camarillo was attended to. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Santa Ana gave Ventura a run with consecutive victories by David 
Serratos at 152 pounds, Alphonzo Perez at 160 pounds and Brian Schwarlm at 171 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana beat Goleta Dos Pueblos, 38-20, and El Monte Arroyo, 35-24, to get 
to the semifinal.

MISSION'S RECRUITS NO SECRET; COLLEGE BASEBALL: WORD GETS OUT AND SCOUTS FLOCK 
TOO SEE CUBAN DEFECTORS PLAY IN 4-2 LOSS TO HARBOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harbor College has one of the state's best junior college baseball programs so 
professional scouts are no strangers to the Seahawks' field. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, there was an unusual flock of scouts to watch Harbor 
play Mission in a semifinal game of the Harbor-El Camino tournament that was 
rained out earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, look at all of them," said Harbor public information officer Gary Wood 
as he entered the press box. "I don't think I've ever seen so many." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently word got around that Mission has two new players, both recent 
defectors from Cuba and both former national team members in their native 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The scouts watched closely and took notes but wouldn't comment on 24-year-old 
Luis Alvarez and 23-year-old Osvaldo Fernandez. Alvarez is a powerful 6-foot-3, 
220-pound left-hander who plays outfield and first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez is a 6-1, 190-pound left-handed pitcher. Most of the attention was 
focused on him since he made his American debut against Harbor. He went four 
innings and gave up four hits and two runs in Mission's 4-2 loss. He struck out 
four and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez, who was the designated hitter on Wednesday, went one for three. 
</P>
<P>
 One scout, who asked that his name not be used, said both athletes have the 
tools to play major league baseball. He clocked Fernandez's fastball at 84 
m.p.h., considerably slower than most major league pitchers, but says that will 
improve with time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has good potential and he has a great curveball," the scout said. "But 
it's obvious he hasn't pitched competitively in a while. Luis is not in form 
either. Come back and watch them in four weeks and they'll be completely 
different than they are now."  
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez and Fernandez were inactive for more than six months while they 
defected from Cuba. The process began during a road trip to Curacao with their 
Cuban baseball team.  
</P>
<P>
 They never returned home after the game and hid in the Caribbean island for 
about four months before stowing away to Puerto Rico where they were granted 
political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Cuba, a San Juan-based group of Cuban Exiles, paid for the athletes' 
plane fare to Los Angeles, where they eventually joined other former Cuban 
national team members who had defected. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez and Fernandez share a house in Sylmar with five other Cuban baseball 
players. They enrolled at Mission because it's close to their home and they 
needed a place to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can help us out big-time," Mission coach John Klitsner said. "They can 
step in and play a high caliber of ball. Luis is a powerful man and Osvaldo has 
some real good stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 And what does a group of young athletes not far removed from high school think 
of these national-caliber players invading their team? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is excited to have them," said third baseman Rene Rodriguez, a 
Cuban-American. "I know these guys are studs and they are so confident and 
relaxed that it really helps the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Mission's players are Latino so Alvarez and Fernandez can communicate 
with most team members.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing because English is really difficult," Alvarez said, shaking 
his head. "But we have to learn it. We have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men have the same goal, one which they claim many baseball players in 
their country dream of daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to play in the big leagues," Fernandez said. "That's why we came 
here."

ALL QUIET AS CANYONS BEATS VALLEY; WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: COUGARS WIN DIVISION 
TITLE, 67-60; HERRICK DECISION EXPECTED TODAY.

 Two and a half weeks after their last game ended amid controversy, the College 
of the Canyons and Valley women's basketball teams met Wednesday night without 
incident in a Western State Conference South Division game won by Canyons, 
67-60. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons (17-12, 9-0 in division play) clinched the South title with the 
victory.Valley dropped to 5-4, 13-18. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, played at North Hollywood High because the Valley gym was damaged 
during the Jan. 17 earthquake, was closely watched by uniformed security 
personnel and administrators from both schools. Everyone in attendance was 
checked with metal detectors at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 It was part of precautionary steps taken by both schools in the wake of 
charges by Valley that Canyons Coach Greg Herrick used a racial slur against 
Monarch players after their game at Canyons on Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Coach John Taylor also said then that Herrick refused to shake hands 
after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick has adamantly denied allegations that he made a racial slur. The 
results of an internal investigation into the incident by Canyons officials 
will be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams and coaches shook hands after Wednesday night's game, a hard-fought 
contest in which the lead changed hands several times in the final minutes 
before Canyons pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Van Mourik scored 21 points, Wendy Wiggins added 15 and Rebekah Cunnan 
had 13 for the Cougars. Nikki Hamilton scored 18 points and Cicely Brewster had 
14 for Valley.

CAL LUTHERAN RALLIES, FALLS IN OVERTIME; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AFTER LATE CHARGE, 
KINGSMEN GO COLD IN EXTRA PERIOD AS FIVE-GAME WINNING STREAK ENDS AGAINST 
POMONA, 85-76. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After battling to a tie after the first 40 minutes of play in Wednesday 
night's Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference men's 
basketball game against host Pomona-Pitzer, Cal Lutheran struggled to do 
anything right in overtime of an 85-76 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen (20-2, 9-2 in conference play) had won five games in a row, but 
the loss put a serious damper on their chances of winning a third consecutive 
SCIAC title as Pomona (17-5, 10-1) has a one-game lead with three to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not play well under duress in overtime so I'm extremely disappointed 
in that aspect," Cal Lutheran Coach Mike Dunlap said. "That's not typical of a 
Cal Lutheran team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen trailed by 11 points early in the second half and were down, 
62-54, with 5 minutes 18 seconds left in regulation before going on a 13-5 run 
over the next four minutes to tie the score at 67-67 with 1:20 remaining. 
Neither team scored again until overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Clark (21 points) scored eight consecutive points during the run to 
draw Cal Lutheran to within 65-64 with 2:39 remaining, and after Travis Greer 
hit a pair of free throws for the Sagehens, Dave Ulloa made a three-pointer 
from the left corner to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen struggled offensively after that, failing to score on each of 
their final four possessions in regulation and totaling two points during their 
first six possessions in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball didn't drop for us on some good-quality shots," Dunlap said. "But we 
had an opportunity to win the game before overtime, but couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark had a chance to give Cal Lutheran a two-point lead with 45 seconds left 
in regulation, but his short bank shot went in and out. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Ridley got free on the break shortly thereafter, but with a Pomona 
defender bearing down on him and time running out, his layup failed to fall, as 
did Clark's follow shot with three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball went out of bounds to the Kingsmen, but Clark was unable to control 
an inbounds pass and Rupert Sapwell's follow missed the mark as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The overtime was all Pomona as the Sagehens scored on their first four 
possessions -- while Cal Lutheran turned the ball over three of the first four 
times it touched the ball -- to take a 75-69 lead with 2:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Pomona's baskets came on second or third shots as Cal Lutheran was 
unable to keep the taller Sagehens off the offensive glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did have a very good game in overtime," Pomona Coach Charles Katsiaficas 
said. "But it wasn't due to any adjustment we made. I wish I could say it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Down by six, the Kingsmen were forced to foul and as they did, Ulloa, Clark, 
Sapwell and Tapp went to the bench with their fifth fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 "All things aside, the ball was not put in the hole when we had it in the 
crease at the end of (regulation)," Dunlap said. "We had our chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Cover scored a career-high 24 points -- including 20 after halftime -- 
for Pomona and Greer added 21 off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran made only 27 of 75 shots from the field compared to Pomona's 29 
of 51. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran trailed, 26-21, with 4:17 left in the half before going on a 7-2 
run to enter the locker room with the score tied, 28-28. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen made only 11 of 32 shots in the first 20-minute period, but they 
hit three of four during the run, including a three-pointer by Ulloa with five 
seconds left on the clock.

O.C. POP BEAT / JIM WASHBURN: ISAAK SERVES MIX OF MEATY, CHEESY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I just don't get Chris Isaak. To me, he's like Velveeta wrapped in shiny 
aluminum foil." 
</P>
<P>
 So opined a friend in the industry (the music industry, not the processed 
cheese spread industry) when I mentioned to her that I'd be seeing Isaak at the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano this week. And even though Isaak is one of 
my favorite performers on Earth, I can kind of see her point. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, his performance Tuesday (he also played Wednesday and finishes up 
tonight) was a marvelous mix of mirth and melancholy. When it comes to writing 
and singing sad, obsessive love songs, there is only a handful of folks in the 
whole history of rock who could best him (Roy Orbison, Del Shannon, Richard 
Thompson and a very few others come to mind). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the same performance, Isaak will reel off snippets of such 
schlock classics as "Delilah" and "Spinning Wheel" while affecting pompous 
Elvis karate moves. And his between-song patter is giddily surreal. 
</P>
<P>
 This contrast has disturbed some (shall we say lesser ) critics who have 
suggested that Isaak needs to choose between being an artist and being an 
entertainer. Harry Connick has had the same criticism leveled at him, and as he 
has pointed out, Louis Armstrong got by just fine without having to make that 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 But, that said, there was something a mite cheesy about Isaak's performance 
Tuesday. It wasn't the plastic tiki lights he'd hung above the stage or the 
bevy of "party nurses" he had, as usual, pulled onstage to dance with the band 
during his first encore. Rather, it was the nagging feeling that, good as he 
is, Isaak isn't taking his artistry quite as deep as it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 See him perform if you possibly can: Compared to most of the music out there, 
his shows are an avalanche of emotion. It's just that, compared to the 
emotional reaches where some of his own best shows have ventured, his current 
course can seem glib and tame. 
</P>
<P>
 Take his 1990 New Year's Eve show at the Coach House where, even amid massive 
"party nurse" action and surf-toned versions of "Auld Lang Syne," he introduced 
a bunch of new songs and sang like his life depended on it. 
</P>
<P>
 He's got a voice that can shade from Elvis' baritone to Orbison's peaks, and 
his control of it is remarkable. What's lacking, though, is a relinquishing of 
that control. He just doesn't often venture into the abandon where passion and 
immediacy take over the controls. 
</P>
<P>
 There were wild moments Tuesday, such as when he was clowning with his 
remarkable band, Silvertone, on a medley that teetered from "California Sun" to 
"Goldfinger." If he could allow similar open-ended risk to creep into his 
serious material, Isaak well could be one of the giants of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That major quibble aside, it was a delightful show that he and Silvertone 
delivered. They didn't delve much into their early material during their 90 
minutes on stage, but they did pluck the best numbers (except for the missing 
semi-hit "Can't Do a Thing") off the sometimes-lackluster "San Francisco Days" 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 These, including the title track, "Two Hearts" and "Except the New Girl," on 
which guitarist Greg Arreguin did a remarkable job of reproducing the record's 
hovering Tom Brumley steel guitar lines. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last year, Arreguin has had the unenviable job of replacing Isaak's 
longtime guitarist James Calvin Wilsey, whose thoroughly distinctive 
echo-shimmered lines were essential to the architecture of Isaak's musical 
lonely towns. Arreguin generally did a fine job Tuesday of mimicking Wilsey's 
style, only revealing a less deft touch on Isaak's breakthrough "Wicked Game." 
When he could inject his own style, Arreguin proved an incisive, muscular 
player, able to hold up his end of the band's fine interplay. 
</P>
<P>
 As ever, bassist Rowland Salley and drummer Kenney Dale Johnson asserted 
themselves as one of the tightest, most fiery rhythm sections around. Johnson 
(who also provides vocal harmonies) is practically a Texas version of Ringo, 
accompanying ballads perfectly and driving rockers ahead of him like cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a number of solo breaks leading into "Wild Love," including a quote 
from Mitch Mitchell's intro to Hendrix's "I Don't Live Today." After one 
exceptional outburst, Isaak was prompted to declare to the crowd: "And you 
shall be his apostles!" 
</P>
<P>
 The set also included an incendiary version of "Heart Shaped World," Isaak's 
splendid rave-up of "Diddley Daddy," a surf medley, and "Vaya Con Dios," which 
Johnson translated as meaning "Where's my mini-bar?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Wild Colonials, a Los Angeles band that opened, is musically ambitious but 
showed more promise than payoff. The largely acoustic outfit (instrumentation 
includes violin, cello, African talking drum and Australian digeradoo ) sounds 
at times like at least several hundred of 10,000 Maniacs. Scottish-born singer 
Angela McCluskey particularly seems to get some of her vocal Celtic-isms via 
the Maniacs' Natalie Merchant. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, the sextet sounds more distinctive than most new outfits. But 
it has yet to make that distinctive sound matter. Each of the seven songs (from 
a debut album, "Fruit of Life," due in March) seemed to last about two minutes 
longer than the band's inspiration did; they were padded with neoclassical 
violin and cello workouts at odds with the songs' own moods. 
</P>
<P>
 Mono-monikered guitarist Shark played some atmospheric vibratoed lines. He 
also made a fine leap off the drum riser. But, like a gymnast who falters on 
the dismount, he gets points taken off for landing on the singer.

DIVISION II-AA GIRLS' BASKETBALL; HATCH IS BACK, MUSTANGS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After watching -- and hearing -- shot after shot clank off the rim during her 
last few games of the regular season, Trabuco Hills forward Dyanna Hatch 
finally figured out what might remedy her ailment: more shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch, who possesses a deft touch from three-point range, worked relentlessly 
during the days leading to Wednesday night's Southern Section Division II-AA 
wild-card game against Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad break for Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejuvenated Hatch scorched Garden Grove for a game-high 25 points in 
leading the Mustangs to a 66-47 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was struggling, so I worked on my 'threes' a lot in practice," Hatch said. 
"I was kind of up and down the last few games, but I felt really good tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mustang Coach Howard Stephens: "Her offense was definitely working." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch made two consecutive three-pointers to open the scoring, connecting on 
seven of 10. She broke her school single-game record of five, which she set 
earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills (14-12), which finished third in the Pacific Coast League, will 
play Woodbridge in the opening round Saturday. Sea View League champion 
Woodbridge (25-0) is ranked second by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens on playing Woodbridge: "I've seen them play twice this year and they 
don't seem to have any weaknesses. Their athleticism is going to be difficult 
for us to handle, but we're going to give it our best shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we're still trying to prove our worth to the (section). We 
weren't too happy with having to get in on a wild card, and now we have to play 
the (top-seeded) team, but I guess that's where the chips fall sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove (11-13) finished fourth in the Garden Grove League. The Argonauts 
were hurt by the absence of point Janine Shaw, who was academically ineligible 
for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to use (not having Shaw) as an excuse, but we did miss her," 
Garden Grove Coach Marcia Foster said. "But they played a great game and hit 
their shots . . . especially (Hatch); she had a great game." 
</P>
<P>
 After a relatively close first half, Trabuco Hills took control in the third 
quarter. The Mustangs turned a 28-19 halftime lead into a 34-19 advantage with 
3 minutes 3 seconds left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argonauts cut the lead to six twice but could get no closer because of 
Hatch. Her three-pointer with 1:30 left in the third gave Trabuco Hills a 39-29 
lead and it was not challenged again.

DIVISION I-A GIRLS' BASKETBALL; BAD WEEK DOESN'T HOLD BACK MARINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an Excedrin kind of week for Marina Coach Pete Bonny. 
</P>
<P>
 He was grousing Monday about the Division I-A pairings, about winning the 
Sunset League title and having to play a team of Dana Hills' caliber in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he simulated Dana Hills' Karun Grossman at Tuesday's practice and, 
shooting from three-point range, lit up his team, which prompted him to get in 
Shandy Robbins' face about her defense: "Shandy, this girl's better than me!" 
</P>
<P>
 And early Wednesday, starting point guard Traci Nakamura didn't even show up 
at school because of a 103-degree fever. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marina showed no ill effects of any of that. The Vikings instead hounded 
Grossman, got a terrific performance from Nakamura and dispatched Dana Hills, 
56-40, Wednesday to advance to the second round of the playoffs against Corona, 
a 62-61 winner over University, at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a couple of more horses to pull the wagon with than we do," said 
Dana Hills Coach Mike Chapman. "They shot well from the floor and we were a 
little sluggish from the beginning and let them get ahead, and that was a huge 
deficit to come back from." 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (20-6) scored the game's first 10 points and, after Nakamura's 
replacement, Norie Nakase, made a three-point basket to open the second 
quarter, the Vikings had a commanding 23-9 lead. The closest the Dolphins 
(17-8) got after that was eight points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakase had only five points, but did a nice job of getting the ball to 
Robbins, Martita Emde and Sonya Bryant. Robbins had 19 points, and Emde and 
Bryant each had 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonny conceded that, in hindsight, the Vikings are better off having won a big 
game without Nakamura than coasting against a much lesser opponent. And, he 
knew he wouldn't have to worry about his team getting up to play Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins made her first five shots and Marina made 11 of its first 14. The 
Vikings finished 25 of 53 from the field (47%). 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins and Bryant switched off on guarding Grossman, who was averaging 23.4 
points. She finished with 21 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stopping Grossman in the second half was a big difference," Bonny said. "We 
didn't expect to hold her under her average. The idea was to have a fresh 
person on her the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman shot 37% from the arc this season, making 62 three-pointers; against 
Marina, she was zero for three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a little tired," Grossman said, "but that's just basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't the only player fatigued. Guarding Grossman took a toll on Robbins' 
shot in the second half. After making six of nine from the field, she was three 
of 13 in the final 16 minutes. Bryant, three of five in the first half, was two 
of seven in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills is clearly Grossman's team, and she finished her career by leading 
the Dolphins to a school-record 17 victories. She also finished as the school's 
career leading scorer (1,082 points), as well as the single-season scoring (585 
points) and rebound (272) leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy with what the girls accomplished this year," said Chapman, who 
coached his final game for the Dolphins and finishes with a 59-36 record though 
four years. "The last thing I'm going to do is dwell on this." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division I-A first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Channel Islands 48, Irvine 36 -- Shawnee Stevens scored 26 points for 
Irvine (10-14), which could not hold off second-seeded Channel Islands (23-3). 
Oxnard held a 23-19 lead at halftime, but Irvine's defense fell apart in the 
third and the offense didn't help much; the Vaqueros were outscored, 14-0. 
Stevens was the only Irvine player to score more than two points. The Vaqueros 
reached the playoffs after going 2-19 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 70, Westminster 40 -- Guard Melody Peterson scored 21 points, 
including four three-pointers, and had six assists to lead third-seeded Mater 
Dei (21-3). Leticia Oseguera had 20 points and 13 rebounds. Lisa Tamamasui had 
a team-high nine points and Amber Farroux had seven for at-large Westminster 
(10-16). Mater Dei plays Moreno Valley Canyon Springs Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chino 48, Edison 36 -- Chino (17-8) outscored visiting Edison, 16-4, in the 
fourth quarter to knock the Chargers out of the playoffs. Chino got 12 points 
from Amy Chard and did a nice job of defending Edison's Marie Philman, who was 
held to 18 points, nine under her average. The loss marked a disappointing end 
for Edison (17-9), which reached the quarterfinal round last year. Kerry O'Bric 
added nine points for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 56, Century 46 -- San Clemente's press bothered the Centurions 
and the Tritons never trailed. The Tritons led by as many as 15, but held a 
10-point lead most of the night. Century made a fourth-quarter run to pull to 
within six points with 2 1/2 minutes left, but Michelle Macintyre's 10-footer 
made it an eight-point game and the Centurions (12-12) never threatened again. 
Macintyre finished with a game-high 21 points and nine rebounds. San Clemente 
(19-5) plays Chino Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona 62, University 61 -- Shawna James' 10-foot baseline jumper with less 
than 10 seconds gave Corona (21-3) the victory. Jennifer Stanley (24 points) 
had a chance to give University (13-10) the lead with three seconds left, but 
her shot was partially blocked. Corona plays Marina Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley 58, Ontario 50 -- Capistrano Valley (13-13) outscored 
Ontario, 19-5, in the third quarter. The Cougars, who will play host to Perris 
Saturday, trailed at halftime, 26-24, despite Susan Scott's 16 points. She 
finished with 25 points. However, after its third quarter run, Capistrano 
Valley took a 43-31 lead to the fourth quarter, led by Holly Lowe and Jennifer 
Garrett. Lowe finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds and Garrett had 12 points 
and nine rebounds

 Gina Ybarra's strong defensive performance in the final two minutes of the 
game helped Fountain Valley to a 62-58 victory over Esperanza in a Southern 
Section Division I-AA wild-card game Wednesday at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 After Erin Avila made a three-point shot to give the Barons a 57-56 lead with 
1 minute 41 seconds left in the game, Ybarra stole an Aztec pass, setting up a 
basket by Lisa Feng. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's Kimberly Hayashi made two free throws with 17 seconds left to cut 
the margin to one and Hayashi's quick foul put Jen Ludwicki on the free-throw 
line with 16 seconds remaining. She made the first free throw to give Fountain 
Valley a 60-58 lead. She missed the second, but Ybarra got the offensive 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 She was fouled and made both free throws to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gina worked hard without the ball all game and the effort paid off in the 
end," Fountain Valley Coach Carol Strausburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons (17-9) advance to a first-round game at San Gabriel Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley got out to a 17-10 lead in the first quarter, but Esperanza 
bounced back to take the lead with five minutes left in the first half. The 
teams were tied at the half, 27-27. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza (15-10) built a seven-point lead early in the fourth quarter before 
Fountain Valley rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs' second-half attack was led by Lindsay Foss, who scored nine points 
off six offensive rebounds, and Jodie Howard, who made three of her four 
three-pointers in the third quarter. Howard finished with 17 points and Foss 
and Kristy Kierulff each had 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Two baskets after offensive rebounds by Foss gave Esperanza its final lead of 
the game, 56-54. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwicki scored 21 points, Nicole Strange had 14 and Feng had 11 for Fountain 
Valley. Strange scored eight in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley stopped a three-game losing streak.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK; AT DAYTONA, TALK IS ABOUT THE BRICKYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never before had a NASCAR Winston Cup season been so eagerly anticipated, only 
to have the enthusiasm dampened before the season began because of the deaths 
of two drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of veteran Neil Bonnett and rookie Rodney Orr in single-car crashes 
while practicing for Sunday's Daytona 500 is on everyone's mind. But as racing 
resumes, there is a feeling -- albeit subdued -- in the garages, along pit row, 
in the grandstands and wherever racing fans gather that something special is 
about to happen in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't because Dale Earnhardt is going for a seventh championship, which 
would pull him even with stock car racing's king, Richard Petty. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't because Rusty Wallace, winner of 10 races last year, has switched 
from Pontiac to Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't because drivers will be competing for a record $30 million in prize 
money in 31 races. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't because Hoosier has returned to revive the tire war of the late 1980s 
with Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
 And it isn't because all the racing world wonders whether Earnhardt, winner of 
59 races, six championships and $19.5 million, will win his first Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all of that, but the one thing that sets 1994 apart is a race in August, 
the Brickyard 400, at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It will be the first time 
anything other than Indy cars have raced on the 2 1/2-mile track, and that has 
not been lost on the stock car set. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daytona 500, which will open the season Sunday, has always been the Super 
Bowl of NASCAR, but this year the Brickyard 400 is hogging attention. As 
drivers and crews prepare for the Twin 125-mile qualifying races today, hardly 
a conversation in the pits, garages and grandstand doesn't begin or end with 
the question, "Hey, what do you think about Indy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, like Earnhardt still looking for a first Daytona 500 victory, did not 
mince words when asked about the Brickyard 400. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want that one real bad, and so does Roger Penske (co-owner of Wallace's 
car)," Wallace said. "Roger wants it real, real bad, I mean real bad. If I had 
to choose between winning Indy and winning Daytona, I'd choose Indy this year. 
No kidding." 
</P>
<P>
 Penske's cars have won the Indianapolis 500 nine times. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the Aug. 6 race has reached heights never approached in racing, 
even for the Indy 500, the Memorial Day weekend race that is the largest 
one-day sporting event in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could accommodate every ticket request, it would be the biggest race 
crowd we've ever had, by far," said Bob Walters, public relations director of 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. "We sold every seat (more than 250,000) almost as 
soon as the race was announced, and we have sent back three checks for every 
one we accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 All the drivers know that the winner of the inaugural race will be remembered 
forever, much as Ray Harroun is for winning the first Indianapolis 500. There 
will be other winners, but only one "first." 
</P>
<P>
 A few, like Ken Schrader, like to downplay the Brickyard 400's importance, 
claiming as he did, that "it's only 1/31st of the Winston Cup season, and 
that's what we're all racing for." But no one is talking about Rockingham, 
Bristol or even Charlotte or Darlington this week as much as they are about the 
Brickyard 400. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Loy Allen Jr., a rookie, and Earnhardt assured themselves of 
front-row starting positions in Sunday's race during qualifying, the season 
more or less starts today with the Gatorade Twin 125s. The field behind the 
front two will be determined by the finishing order of the two heat races. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt and Wallace are the drivers most likely to contend for the season 
championship, but if either or both should falter, Mark Martin, Ernie Irvan, 
Bill Elliott and defending Daytona 500 champion Dale Jarrett could move to the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin won four consecutive races last year in the Jack Roush-prepared Ford to 
finish third in points. Irvan took over for the late Davey Allison in midseason 
in the Texaco-Havoline Ford and finished the season with two victories in the 
final six races. Elliott will be in the last year of his contract with Junior 
Johnson's team and wants to go out a winner. Jarrett is back in Joe Gibbs' 
Chevrolet, hoping for a repeat victory in Sunday's 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major confrontations attracting attention are Chevrolet vs. Ford and 
Goodyear vs. Hoosier. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevrolet, led by Earnhardt, edged Ford, 191-190, with Pontiac another point 
back last year in the closest manufacturers' race ever. Ford has strengthened 
its position by adding Wallace, a move expected to knock Pontiac from 
contention. He had all of Pontiac's 10 victories last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoosier, which dropped out of Winston Cup racing after the tire war of 
1988-89, has returned and scored a coup when Allen won the pole at 190.158 
m.p.h. on a set of tires from the small company in Lakeville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodyear, however, will probably have a majority of the 40-plus starters. 
About 65% of the cars in the garages are on Goodyears. 
</P>
<P>
 Tire rules have been changed since 1989, when teams could switch brands during 
a race, choosing the compound that seemed to be working better that day. This 
year, teams must use the same brand on which they qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnett and Orr were using Hoosier tires at the time of their fatal accidents, 
but NASCAR officials said there was no indication that it was anything more 
than coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Waltrip won the 1989 Daytona 500 on Hoosiers, and the upstart brand 
had 11 winners in 38 races before abruptly pulling out of Winston Cup racing in 
mid-1989 after Goodyear introduced a much superior radial tire. Bob Newton, 
president of Hoosier, which builds tires for other types of stock cars, spent 
the next three years developing his own radial tire before again challenging 
the tire giant from Akron, Ohio, on the Winston Cup circuit. Motor Racing Notes

COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; RIVERSIDE BEATS RANCHO SANTIAGO IN DOUBLE 
OVERTIME, 136-125 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Riverside remained in a first-place tie in the Orange Empire Conference men's 
basketball race, but the Tigers had to win a stunning double-overtime game at 
Rancho Santiago to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago had possibly its most determined performance of the season, 
but four starters fouled out and the Dons lost, 136-125. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside (25-6, 11-2 in conference) outscored Rancho Santiago, 19-8, in the 
second overtime, going on a 9-0 run after falling behind by four in the first 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 With one game remaining in the conference season, Riverside remains tied with 
Saddleback. Riverside plays host to Cypress at 7 p.m. and Saddleback plays 
Irvine Valley at Capistrano Valley at 8 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago forced the second overtime when Matt Kordik made a 10-footer 
with two Riverside defenders leaning on him as time ran out. The basket tied it 
at 117. 
</P>
<P>
 But the game, which included 113 free throws, never should have reached 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago led by nine twice during the first half and was up, 49-48, at 
the break. Riverside rallied to go up by 10 with about 15 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago went to a trapping press defense with about 10 minutes left 
and Riverside wilted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons (19-11, 7-6) led by eight points, 101-93, with 1 minute 52 seconds 
left in regulation but managed to let that slip away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons had the ball and a 106-103 lead with 20 seconds left when Riverside's 
Darryle Flicking missed a three-pointer. Sean Amos got the rebound and the Dons 
broke the Riverside press with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago forward Matt Kordik broke to the basket and got a pass. He 
tried to shoot but stumbled going up and missed with about 12 seconds left. 
Teammate Sean Amos got the rebound but also missed a short shot two seconds 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a scramble for the ball and Riverside came up with it and got it 
upcourt to Flicking, who made a three-pointer with three seconds left to tie 
it, 106-106. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside's Raimonds Miglinieks had a career-high 39 points, including seven 
in overtime. He had four three-pointers, was 11 of 14 on free throws, and had 
12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Flicking scored 37, including five three-pointers and eight of nine free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos had 32 points, including 10 of 14 free throws, and 14 rebounds. He fouled 
out 17 seconds into the second overtime. Kordik had 28 points, including four 
three-pointers, but also fouled out in the second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange Empire Conference men's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback 104, Orange Coast 79 -- Derrick Walsh had a career-high 25 points 
and Tes Whitlock had 21 points for host Saddleback (21-7, 11-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Damion Mobley led Orange Coast (13-15, 3-10) with 19 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 82, Fullerton 79 -- Matt Kenney had 26 points, including six 
three-pointers, and Jim Falletta had 12 points and 10 rebounds for Cypress 
(15-17, 6-7), which won its fourth consecutive game. Eddie Cochran had 17 
points for Fullerton (22-10, 7-6) before fouling out. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West 96, Irvine Valley 85 -- Gerald Rhoden had 38 points, including 
five three-pointers, and Chris Reiff had 15 points for Golden West (9-20, 
2-11). Rashad Wilson had 27 points for Irvine Valley (17-14, 5-8).

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / MIKE DIGIOVANNA: OLSEN PUNCHES BACK INTO LINEUP 
WITH LONG SMASH 
</P>

 George Horton has seen balls hit longer, but the Titan associate head baseball 
coach said he had never seen a ball hit harder than the one Fullerton first 
baseman D.C. Olsen sent over the left-field wall at Texas Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was phenomenal," Horton said. "It might have gone 500 feet if the wind 
wasn't blowing in. It probably would have went through the scoreboard if it hit 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton estimates Olsen's homer, which came in the seventh inning of 
Fullerton's 11-6 victory, traveled 400 to 410 feet. But a stiff wind blowing in 
prevented it from being a tape-measure home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen will remember it, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit the sweetest part of the bat and I hardly felt it when I hit it," 
Olsen said. "I knew if I hit the ball in the air it would just die in wind, but 
this one stayed low, like a line drive. It was solid." 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen's homer was one of the highlights of a three-game series in which the 
Titans swept the Longhorns and Olsen won his starting job back. The junior went 
four for nine with six runs batted in to improve his season totals to .400 with 
two homers, nine RBIs and nine runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen, who took over as starting first baseman during the 1992 postseason, 
when Fullerton advanced to the College World Series championship game, and 
spent all of 1993 as the starter, had been reduced to a platoon player in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a matter of consistency," said Olsen, a former Fullerton High 
standout. "I was worried about losing my job (in the preseason), I started 
pressing in practice and got frustrated. But I just felt relaxed all weekend 
because I knew I had nothing to lose. The ball looked like a grapefruit." 
</P>
<P>
 With all the depth at Fullerton (10-1), Olsen knows his hold on the starting 
job is tenuous, but Horton said Olsen is the team's full-time first baseman for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going from a starter to platoon player can devastate a lot of guys, but the 
encouraging thing was D.C. never complained or moped around," Horton said. "He 
took it upon himself to take extra batting practice, and now he's swinging the 
bat better than he ever has since he's been a Titan." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tables turning: Joey Franchino, a midfielder from Damien High in La Verne, has 
signed a letter of intent to play for the Fullerton men's soccer team. Nothing 
unusual about that, right? Titan Coach Al Mistri, a former Damien coach, said 
he has signed 25 to 30 Damien players in his 13 years at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 But this signing marks the first time in at least 25 tries Mistri has gone 
head-to-head in a recruiting battle against national power UCLA -- and won. 
Never before has a player with scholarship offers from both schools picked the 
Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, never before had Fullerton reached the NCAA final four, which it 
did last fall, and never before 1992 could Fullerton boast of having one of the 
finest soccer stadiums in the nation, the 10,000-seat Titan Sports Complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very significant," Mistri said. "Obviously the run we had last season 
and beating UCLA didn't hurt, plus we have a significantly better facility. I 
really believe we've been even with UCLA recently. It will be interesting to 
see what happens now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add soccer: Martin Palos, a midfielder from Montclair High, and Krista 
Broughton, a midfielder from Canyon, have signed letters of intent to play 
soccer at Fullerton. Broughton, the Century League offensive player of the year 
in 1992-93, is the first women's player to receive a scholarship at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan goalie Mike Ammann, a third-team All-American selection by Soccer 
America last fall, has been invited to the U.S. under-23 national team workouts 
Feb. 25-March 5 at Orlando, Fla. The under-23 team probably will feed players 
to the 1996 Olympic team. 
</P>

<P>
 Rich Man, Poor Man: Former Titan volleyball Coach Jim Huffman had just been 
awarded $1.35 million in his wrongful termination suit against the school Feb. 
8, but there were no "I'm going to Disneyland" proclamations. That's because 
Huffman wasn't going anywhere anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 As Huffman tried to leave the Orange County Superior Court parking garage that 
afternoon, he realized he didn't have enough money to pay the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to turn around, park the car, go back to the courthouse and get some 
money from the ATM machine," Huffman said. Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball coaches Augie Garrido (Fullerton), Danny Hill (Georgia Tech), Larry 
Cochell (Oklahoma) and John Cunningham (San Diego) will be featured in a youth 
baseball clinic, Feb. 26 at Titan Field. The clinic, for boys and girls ages 
8-12, is part of the Anaheim Hilton & Towers Classic weekend and will be held 
from 9 a.m.-noon. Reservations for the free clinic are required and may be made 
by calling the Orange County Sports Assn. at 254-3050.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: BORDERS DISCOVERS FAME ISN'T FLEETING 
</P>

 The day after Ila Borders became the first woman to pitch in a college 
baseball game life returned to normal on the Southern California College 
baseball field . . . for about a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of infielders came to practice early to take extra ground balls. The 
rest of the team showed up soon after and started stretching in the outfield, 
preparing for a routine workout. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time SCC Coach Charlie Phillips gathered the team in the dugout for 
a talk before practice, a national television crew had set up on the 
right-field foul line. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Borders' presence has changed things around SCC. Borders, a freshman 
from Whittier Christian High, sat in a folding chair for a half-hour before a 
live three-minute interview on the ESPN2 cable network. 
</P>
<P>
 In the background, her teammates practiced, and Borders was obviously eager to 
get back on the field. But after handling questions from Keith Olbermann, 
Borders had to return a message to "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno," which 
would like to have her on as a guest in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The college also fielded calls from radio shows from throughout the country, a 
national news magazine, the New York Times and a movie studio. 
</P>
<P>
 There was even a message from someone claiming to be Yankee Hall of Famer 
Whitey Ford and a phone interview with Borders' favorite radio station, 
KNAC-FM. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't what Borders had in mind for the day after beating Claremont-Mudd, 
12-1, in her first official college baseball appearance. Her thoughts were more 
on getting onto the track to help her body recuperate from the complete-game 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can run at least seven miles, my arm will feel great tomorrow," she 
said. "If I don't, it will hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Borders, who is handling the attention with aplomb, said she is more worried 
about what the rest of the Vanguards are thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only concern is my teammates," Borders said. "And if they are fine with 
it, then nothing can bug me." 
</P>
<P>
 David Black, the pitching coach, said some players were upset with the 
attention she was receiving, but a team meeting held last week seemed to ease 
hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Homutoff, a right-handed pitcher, said Borders proved her mettle with the 
five-hit victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, they rose to the occasion yesterday," Black said. "The cameras pumped 
everyone up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Giant Bryant: Danin Bryant continues to be a bright spot in a sub-par season 
for the Southern California College men's basketball team. Bryant, who is third 
in the Golden State Athletic Conference in scoring average (16.8) and second in 
assists (six), was named conference player of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, a 5-foot-9 guard from Fairfield, Calif., averaged 23.7 points and 6.7 
assists in SCC's three games, including 35 in a 98-86 nonconference victory 
over Christian Heritage. The Vanguards are 13-14 and 2-7 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer league: Concordia's Gitte Mejer was named GSAC women's player of the 
week for the fourth time this season. Mejer, a 6-2 center from Denmark, 
averaged 31 points and 14 rebounds as Concordia beat Azusa Pacific and lost to 
Point Loma Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer leads the conference in scoring (25.4 points) and field-goal percentage 
(63.5), and is second in rebounding (9.5). 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia (15-10, 4-4), with two conference games remaining, probably will 
finish in third or fourth place, giving the Eagles a first-round home game in 
the conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC (21-6, 4-3), with three conference games left, plays host to first-place 
Fresno Pacific (18-6, 7-1) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 With an upset, the Vanguards would have a chance to tie for second with Azusa 
Pacific (18-8, 6-3). Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman announced the hiring of two assistant football coaches this week. Dave 
Bishop, who was hired as director of intramurals, will coach the defensive 
backs. Gregg Schammel, who will also coach the golf team, will be the offensive 
coordinator.

LONEY LINE WARMS UP TO TASK OF LEADING DUCKS; HOCKEY: THREESOME CONTINUES 
STRONG PLAY WITH NINE POINTS IN A 6-3 VICTORY OVER THE FLYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Troy Loney offers experience and reliability, Shaun Van Allen a subtle touch 
and Joe Sacco the raw power of explosive skating speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Three different players playing to three different strengths carried the 
Mighty Ducks to a 6-3 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers Wednesday at Anaheim 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot streaks go in cycles and at the moment Loney, Van Allen and Sacco are 
scalding. 
</P>
<P>
 "That line over the last four or five games has just been unbelievable," Coach 
Ron Wilson said after they combined for nine points (four goals and five 
assists) Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Loney, Duck captain and acknowledged dressing-room leader, has emerged the 
past two games as a force on the ice. Each game is beginning to carry more 
significance as the Ducks fight for the eighth and final playoff berth in the 
Western Conference, and Loney needs to make more of a statement on the ice, 
according to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely important to get some offensive output from the people who 
are leaders in the dressing room," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 No complaints, mind you. But Loney's actions in consecutive, 6-3, victories 
over Edmonton on Sunday and Philadelphia on Wednesday were loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't lead the line in scoring. That honor went to Sacco, who scored two 
goals in each victory. He didn't make the pretty assists. Van Allen, who had 
two Wednesday and one Sunday, did. 
</P>
<P>
 But he made an impact, in the form of a goal and an assist Wednesday and a 
goal Sunday, and that's what counts, according to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a bull down low near the net," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nothing new, Loney said. Only the results have been different recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been playing real well the last five games," he said. "Before that, we 
were playing well, but weren't finishing (scoring chances)." 
</P>
<P>
 He also had his own take on the line's strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe's got the speed, Van Allen's a good passer and I just sort of schlump 
along," said Loney, who helped the Pittsburgh Penguins to Stanley Cup victories 
in 1990-91 and 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just go to the net and open things up for those guys. It goes to show you 
that there can be three guys doing different things to have a successful line." 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, talk turned to the playoff race and Loney's role as a veteran in 
such situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in these situations before and I've seen what guys try to do to win 
games," he said. "A big goal, a big defensive play . . . anything that elevates 
the team. Seeing what I do rubs off on everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Loney is just happy he's able to contribute. A knee injury required 
arthroscopic surgery on Nov. 17 and he missed 17 games. It took a while, but 
Wilson said Loney is back to full skating strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, that's been obvious. Loney scored his third goal in the past four 
games Wednesday and has at least one point in seven of the past 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony (Semenov's) line carried us for a while," Loney said of the line of 
Semenov, Peter Douris and Garry Valk. "Bob Corkum carried us for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it has fallen to Loney, Van Allen and Sacco.

DRAWN TO NATURE; ILLUSTRATORS DETAIL WONDERS OF THE 'RAINFOREST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her job as a graphic illustrator for the city of Glendale, Norma Smallbone 
has been busy designing posters and brochures to help residents cope with the 
aftermath of the recent earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallbone's first love, however, has more to do with natural wonders than 
natural disasters. She considers herself foremost a natural history 
illustrator, a job she pursues in her free time, creating drawings that aim to 
represent plants and animals with as much accuracy and detail as possible for 
scientific journals and textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the advent of photography, then computers, illustrating wildlife by 
hand has survived and is still preferred in many cases. It continues to be 
practiced in much the same way as it has been for centuries, since the time of 
famed bird illustrator John James Audubon and long before. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of contemporary work from around Southern California are on display 
at the Beckman Center of the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering in 
Irvine. The exhibit, "Rainforests of the World," features 97 paintings and 
drawings by 21 members of the Southern California Chapter of the Guild of 
Natural History Illustrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Creatures from Chinese liverflukes to Sumatran tigers, along with multicolored 
butterflies and frogs, monkeys, apes, fishes, birds and also plants adorn walls 
throughout the center's first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are surprised by the detail and how beautiful they are," said 
Smallbone, of La Crescenta. She credits the creatures rather than artistic 
license: "Many of the species are just that beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 While beauty is often a byproduct, the primary goal is always accuracy 
(drawings are preferred to photographs because it is much easier to emphasize 
and articulate detail). 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be interested enough in the science of the subject to override 
your feelings of wanting to create a pretty picture," said Sharon Belkin, who 
with Smallbone is one of the organizers of the exhibition. The details have to 
be right, she said, everything from "the number of toes on a frog to the veins 
on a butterfly's wing." 
</P>
<P>
 That means studying the subject in the wild, if possible, along with studying 
photographs, museum specimens, the notes of researchers and other sources. Jeff 
Preston of Huntington Beach, one of the illustrators represented in the show, 
spent about a month researching his two exhibit entries: a green basilisk (a 
Central American lizard) and a long-tongued bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is accuracy a general concern in the field, but displaying the works 
in the Beckman facility adds pressure. "The technical accuracy is more 
uppermost here than in a lot of other shows, because that's what the scientists 
want," Preston said. "If it's wrong, the audience in this case will catch it." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the subject right is half the battle, but it's equally important to 
get the setting right. With a butterfly, for instance, "if you get them on the 
wrong tree, the wrong leaf, it's no longer scientifically accurate," Belkin 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Belkin, a resident of West L.A., got a degree in biological illustration at 
UCLA. "I put myself through college drawing mosquitoes for a professor," she 
said. Until recently, she produced graphics for the psychiatry department at 
UCLA while working on natural history projects on her own time. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the things that I've done are things that I've seen," said Belkin, who 
has traveled to the Amazon six times in the past decade. She specializes in 
entomological drawings, but her works in the exhibit include frogs, 
butterflies, a large moth and one of the largest freshwater fishes in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I work on something with a researcher, I learn more," Belkin said. 
"I find it a really satisfying field." 
</P>
<P>
 Smallbone started as a biologist, working as a research assistant in 
oceanography and fisheries research at Oregon State University. "At that time, 
the art was a secondary thing for me. I just did the art to fill out the 
reports," she said. Since then, illustration has consumed more and more of her 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 She is represented in the show by a series of paintings and drawings of 
gorillas, among other works. In 1993 she traveled to the Amazon, sketching and 
taking thousands of slides. She says she may have found a new species of 
praying mantis and is working on a book about varieties of the insect from 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a possible new species conjures for her something of what the 
naturalist-illustrators of the past must have felt. "I would have loved to be 
on the voyages of discovery, when they had naturalists along to illustrate the 
new plants and animals they found," she said. "They had a very hard life, but 
they had a wonderful time, seeing things for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Rainforests of the World." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Continues through Sept. 9. Hours are weekdays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Beckman Center, 100 Academy Drive, Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Follow the Corona del Mar (73) Freeway to its southern end (where 
it merges with MacArthur Boulevard) and exit at University Drive, going east. 
Turn right on California Avenue and right again on Academy Drive.

TOGETHER AGAIN; CARLENE CARTER AND COUNTRY MUSIC FIND EACH OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carlene Carter plunks herself down for a lunch appointment and cheerfully 
announces that she has just left the scene of a "domestic crisis," the domicile 
in question being her own. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis has to do with diet supplements, boxing trunks and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The body-slimming supplements -- for which this slender, fine-boned, Dove 
bar-loving country singer would make a very good advertisement -- have been 
ordered in quantity. The credit-card limit has been reached. And, therefore, 
the Everlast trunks (the ones most prizefighters wear) cannot be ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated at a Beverly Hills hamburger joint, Carter says this does not sit well 
with Howie Epstein, her record producer and sweetheart of five years. He wanted 
the world-class boxing trunks, but it's impossible to charge them, and now 
he'll have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 While this inside tidbit may not put Carter's money-management skills in the 
best light, it does illustrate what a good country performer does in reaching 
out to the public. It's a funny little tale of everydayness that shows Carter 
as just-folks, willing to open up about the small intimacies of ordinary 
living. At the same time, she is enough of a show woman to invest it with a bit 
of drama by casting it as a domestic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Take those elements -- openness, humor, the folksy touch, a sense of drama 
rising from the every day -- and you have some prime ingredients for the 
creation and winning presentation of country songs. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't hurt that this story and many others spill from Carter in the most 
natural way, flowing in a friendly Tennessee twang that can be a little smokey 
and rough but also delightfully musical. It may be the Platonic ideal of a 
Southern accent, and you can't help being charmed, just as you can't help being 
taken by her singing, which is founded on a comparable duality. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, 38, possesses one of the sassiest female voices in pop, one that fits 
well with her longstanding stage image as a robust fun lover with a wild streak 
as long as her skirts are short.  
</P>
<P>
 She is also a ballad singer of great tenderness. Listening to "Unbreakable 
Heart," from her current album, "Little Love Letters," one hears some of the 
sweetness, vocal purity and vulnerability of a Karen Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who plays Monday at the Crazy Horse Steak House, benefits from a 
special confluence of nature and nurture.  
</P>
<P>
 She is a third-generation member of what was literally the first family of 
country music. The original Carter Family featured Carlene's grandmother, 
Maybelle Carter, her great-uncle, A. P. Carter, and his wife, Sara. Emerging 
from Poor Valley, Va., in 1927, the trio served as a bridge between the old 
Appalachian folk tradition and modern country music. Its repertoire included 
such standards as "Wabash Cannonball," "Wildwood Flower" and "Will the Circle 
Be Unbroken." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlene's father, Carl Smith, was a honky-tonk singer who scored dozens of 
country hits in the 1950s and '60s. (She was raised Smith but took the Carter 
name when she started recording.) Her mother, June Carter, continued the Carter 
Family tradition with her two sisters. June Carter also co-wrote, with Merle 
Kilgore, one of country music's greatest songs, "Ring of Fire," and since 1968 
has been Johnny Cash's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 While Carlene grew up singing with the family group, and toured for a time 
with Johnny Cash and the Carter Family, by her early 20s she had struck out on 
her own, both in pursuit of a musical style and in taking her own hard-knocks 
route through life. 
</P>
<P>
 Her arrival as a strong presence on the country scene came belatedly, in 1990. 
She had spent most of her previous recording years based in London, working 
with some of Britain's best rock musicians, including guitarist Dave Edmunds, 
Graham Parker's band, the Rumour, and then-husband Nick Lowe.  
</P>
<P>
 From 1978 to 1983, Carter made five albums, which for the most part fully 
revealed her country roots yet were marketed as rock releases. Unable to get 
past cult-artist status and confused about her musical direction, she dropped 
out of the recording scene for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her career revival began in 1988, when she hooked up with Epstein, best known 
as the bassist of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. They began working on songs 
at Epstein's house in Beverly Hills. The result was her 1990 comeback album, "I 
Fell in Love." 
</P>
<P>
 The record was a critical success that yielded two country radio hits, "I Fell 
in Love" and "Come on Back," and established Carter as a mainstream country 
contender. She was nominated for a Grammy as best female country singer and for 
an Academy of Country Music award as best new female vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
 The story line at the time was that the prodigal daughter had returned to her 
family roots after years carousing with those British rock 'n' rollers (and 
Carter had established a reputation as a willing carouser). But Carter says it 
was less a case of her music changing than of the Nashville Establishment 
broadening its own definition of what country music could be. 
</P>
<P>
 If you took the odd, fuzz-bass riff and E-bow guitar synthesizer groan out of 
the mix, Carter's 1980 album, "Musical Shapes," a critics' favorite, would fit 
with today's commercially successful hybridization of country with rock and 
pop, albeit with fuller-blooded performances and better songwriting than almost 
all of the current competition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, though, Carter didn't consider herself country. Actually, she 
didn't consider herself anything but a singer-songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely wasn't country enough for the country market then," she said. 
"If you listened to country radio then, nothing I did fit in." By the late 
'80s, though, "I started listening to it and familiarizing myself with what was 
going on. I felt, 'It's not that different from what I do. Maybe there's a 
place for me now. I don't have to compromise myself to fit in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 If Carter was born to be country, she was taught to be eclectic. She cites mom 
June Carter as her most important early musical influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "She taught me my first things on the guitar and the piano, and she exposed me 
to so many different kinds of music growing up. She taught me my first 
boogie-woogie thing on the piano when I was 5 years old and instigated my love 
of music." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter recalls her mother bringing home Bob Dylan's first album in the early 
'60s and announcing, "This young man is really special." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she was 12, she says, Johnny Cash had bought her her first 
electric guitar and amplifier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was slogging away to the Yardbirds." 
</P>
<P>
 At 15, Carter got married to her high school sweetheart, and at 16 she was a 
mother. This was not the result of a wild streak or a rebellious attitude, she 
says, but a way of reconciling surging hormones with the traditional morality 
of her upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very religious," she said. "No way did we believe in having sex before 
marriage. So when I started having these normal teen-age tendencies, I got 
married real quick." 
</P>
<P>
 She was racing through adolescence, having left high school after her 
sophomore year, taken an equivalency degree, then quickly enrolled as a music 
major at Belmont College in Nashville. By age 20 Carter had been divorced, 
remarried and had her second child. She was working while pursuing her studies, 
giving piano lessons to children at $5 per hour. But she was also writing songs 
and performing, which led, in 1977, to a record deal with Warner Bros.  
</P>
<P>
 Carter left college a semester short of earning her degree in classical piano. 
Soon after, she married Lowe, the respected British rocker who produced her 
early albums. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always in a hurry," Carter said. "I grew up quick because my family was 
away a lot, and I took care of my sister. Then in my 20s, I went through my 
teens, with these wild abandon things." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Carter rolls her eyes at the thought of having been thrice married and 
a mother of two before she had reached her mid-20s. She says she brought her 
children up not to follow her own rushed timetable in growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Just know this: Birth control only works if you use it.' I think 
they both saw how hard it was to raise kids and be so young." 
</P>
<P>
 Daughter Tiffany, 22, is about to put her graphics degree to use with a Los 
Angeles video company. Jackson, 18, plans to begin pre-med studies at 
Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter learned the value of a lively stage style by watching her grandmother, 
her mother and her aunts at work in the Carter Family band. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom is a great entertainer. She said she made a great career out of not 
being able to sing very well. They always conducted themselves with grace and a 
lot of energy, and a real lot of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter says she never had much trouble with the energy part.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just had this horror of standing there on stage in a high-neck granny 
dress. I always wanted to jump around the stage and sing loud." 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls receiving only one explicit bit of familial advice about 
stagecraft: June Carter and Johnny Cash told her not to cuss in front of an 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I (heed it) now, but I didn't used to," Carter says blithely. "They said, 'It 
would embarrass your grandmother,' because they knew that would work on me. 
I've made so many faux pas in front of my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes a club date years ago when she was mortified to have June Carter 
turn up unexpectedly on a night she had gone onstage in a T-shirt that read 
"Picasso Sucks." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God she didn't have her glasses on. I don't think she could read it." 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1980s, Carter was having a hard time reading her own musical 
direction.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, she had put out a synth-pop album called "C'est C Bon" that she 
regards as her worst, although she says it was fun at the time to dabble with 
lots of keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can imagine that after doing that album I was really lost," she said. "I 
thought, 'This is not me.' It was cool to find out I could do something like 
that, and Epic (her label at the time) wanted me to start another album. But I 
bailed. I didn't know what I wanted to do. But I had the sense to know I was at 
the end of my experimenting." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Carter spent a year playing the part of diner owner Purdie Cupp in a 
London production of the musical "Pump Boys and Dinettes." 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a good thing in my life," she said of going through an 
eight-show-a-week regimen. "I was reckless as hell, and I learned discipline 
from doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Carter spent two years performing with her mother and aunts Helen and 
Anita in the Carter Family act. She felt her prospects for a recording career 
dimming and bought property in Tennessee with the idea of starting a horse 
ranch. She would write songs to pitch to other performers, maybe do more 
theater and breed horses. 
</P>
<P>
 She says that K. T. Oslin's rise in 1987-88 helped her change her thinking. 
Here was a woman in her mid-40s who sang twangy pop songs that reflected her 
maturity and experience, and she was succeeding in the country market with a 
hybridized style and unconventional themes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at the point in my life where I felt I was too old to start over 
again," Carter explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter began working with Epstein, an old acquaintance she had met in the 
early '80s when Nick Lowe toured as opening act for Tom Petty and the 
Heartbreakers. What started as a musical partnership turned into a romantic 
one.  
</P>
<P>
 One of its first fruits was the song "I Fell in Love," a wry but exuberant 
song that Carter wrote to celebrate the blossoming romance. It turned into the 
hit that established her in the country market. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the couple share Epstein's house in Beverly Hills, a modest-sized home 
in a spectacular ridge-side spot. The colorful cacti that Carter enjoys growing 
blend well with the Native American artifacts that Epstein has collected for 
years. Two fluffy cats and a young German shepherd serve as company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Old photos of A. P. Carter and the rest of the Carter family adorn the living 
room bookshelf. At one end of the house is a recording studio the size of a 
small bedroom. It is there, not in the usual Nashville setting, that Carter's 
career resurgence has taken shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's current album, "Little Love Letters," didn't take shape quickly or 
easily. She embarked on the most exhaustive touring of her career after the 
release of "I Fell in Love" and found she was unable to write songs on the 
road. So she and Epstein spent a year on the follow-up, recording more than 30 
songs in search of material that was strong enough.  
</P>
<P>
 This album, like "I Fell in Love," has been a moderate success. Its first 
single, "Every Little Thing," hit No. 3 on the Billboard country singles chart 
last year, but the follow-up, the ballad "Unbreakable Heart," failed to crack 
the Top 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just don't want ballads from me," Carter lamented. "They want me to do 
up-tempo, happy." 
</P>
<P>
 She has obliged with the just-released new single "I Love You 'Cause I Want 
To," which finds her at her sassiest, augmented by an R&B-style horn section. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in her career, Carter will turn to Nashville for guidance 
on her next record. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Epstein agree that, after doing two homemade albums together, a change 
of producer would be healthy. Carter and her record company, Giant, don't want 
a repeat of the three-year gap between "I Fell in Love" and "Little Love 
Letters," and Epstein is too heavily booked with production work for John Prine 
and a summer Petty tour to produce another record for her at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of excited to see what kind of record I'll make with someone who's 
in the wheel in Nashville," Carter said, although she admits to a bit of 
apprehension at not having Epstein -- "my security blanket" -- on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Love Letters" is off the chart, having peaked at No. 35 last year. But 
Carter still harbors ambitions that one more hit single can spur it past the 
gold (500,000 sales) mark. And she cheerfully admits being "real mad" that the 
album has been passed over for awards nominations. At the same time, Carter, 
who was ready not so long ago to abandon her recording career, maintains a 
sense of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Her primary motivation, she said, is "to be an entertainer, not somebody who 
topped the charts or won female vocalist of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have a big hit and not get rich. I would just like to be able to pay 
my bills, get my kids through college."

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: THE MIGHTY CLOUDS OF JOY, "THE BEST OF THE MIGHTY CLOUDS 
OF JOY, VOL. I AND II" (1973) MCA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The best gospel music doesn't just sing the praises of the kingdom of heaven 
-- through heavenly harmonies and soul-stirring expressions of faith it can 
bring a glimpse of that kingdom to Earth. The Mighty Clouds of Joy have been 
providing such a musical portal for more than three decades now, and as anyone 
who's seen them live can attest, when they're on, they're as good as gospel 
ensemble singing gets. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the veteran group has recently released a mostly live 10-song 
retrospective ("Memory Lane -- Best of the Mighty Clouds of Joy"), these 
earlier collections offer a better overview of their peak performances. (They 
are officially available only on cassette nowadays, but if you poke around you 
might luck out and run across them on CD in the bargain bins.) Among the 20 
songs on these two CDs (three from Volume I are repeated on Volume II) are such 
traditionals as "Family Circle" (their version of "Will the Circle Be 
Unbroken"), "Go Tell It on the Mountain" and "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" as well 
as more recent originals including Elmeo Franklin's "Nobody Can Turn Me 
Around." 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to lead singer Joe Ligon's fiery vocals, it's instantly clear why 
gospel music gave birth to so many of the great soul singers. It's also easy to 
hear the influence rock and R&B had on gospel, both in the Clouds' arrangements 
and in use of electric guitars and drums. His raspy growl, both in the songs 
and several sermon-like introductions and interludes, is balanced by the 
gossamer high harmonies from the other Clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gospels are often described as "good news," a term that also applies 
beautifully to the group's appearance tonight at the Irvine Barclay Theatre 
(see Country, Folk & Traditional listings, Page 14). RANDY LEWIS

WANNA DANCE?: A ROCKIN' COUNTRY SPOT

 Thank the good Lord for country music. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does it understand an aching heart, but it's also been a boon to 
nightclubs in these parts during an otherwise bleak time for the entertainment 
industry. While clubs of all styles continue to fold or hold on by offering a 
safe, mediocre program, country music venues have thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, the Hop -- that golden oldies dance and concert hall in 
Lake Forest. Since the building reopened last fall as the Country Rock Cafe, 
couples have forgone East Coast swing for West Coast steps on its 
2,200-square-foot dance floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Kudos to the folks in charge of the reported $500,000 face lift. It looks like 
they spent three times that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Mood-setting sunset murals cover the walls, and over the bar a 
three-dimensional sculpture of cowboys riding horses stampedes toward you. A 
jewel in CRC's cowboy hat is the large mirrored saddle that hangs from the 
ceiling, a fabulous alternative to the ubiquitous ball. Every inch of the club 
is branded by Western details. 
</P>
<P>
 Hailed as one of the more attractive and glitzier country music nightclubs in 
the county, CRC is also one of the only clubs of its kind here that always 
charges a cover. But with few other options in South County as gorgeous, 
well-managed and chock-full of activities as CRC, the few bucks required for 
entry isn't too painful. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverage prices, on the other hand, can bleed your wallet. So cash in on the 
nightly drink specials whenever possible. Domestic brews are $3, while bottles 
of Heineken, Zima and Corona are $3.50, as are glasses of wine. Wells start at 
$3.25 and go up to $4.75. Sodas, juices and mineral water sell for $1.75. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tex-Mex menu is reasonable, with prices from $3.50 to $10. There are 
appetizers such as Texas nachos and quesadillas, salads, sandwiches and entrees 
such as rattlesnake steak and fajitas. The weekday "Western round-up" happy 
hour, from 5 to 8 p.m., features half-price appetizers and drink specials. 
Friday's "spaghetti Western" happy hour offers all the spaghetti, Caesar salad 
and garlic bread you can eat for $3. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason CRC regularly reaches its capacity of 532 is the good times. Events 
are scheduled nightly, from dance contests to auctions of Western duds. Even 
Monday night rages with live acts, from local bands to national performers (MCA 
recording artists the Mavericks will be featured this Monday). 
</P>
<P>
 Dance lessons are offered nightly from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m., except during 
Sunday's family day when they begin at 2 p.m. and are scattered throughout the 
day. Both Saturday and Sunday are designated family days until 7 p.m. and 
attract many a young urban cowpoke revved up to two-step or do some of such 
trendier dances as the tush push and the electric slide.

SURFING / ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE: DEFFENBAUGH AIMS FOR NEXT LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Fignetti and David Reyes, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two weeks of pleasure surfing in Hawaii, Jeff Deffenbaugh returned to 
Orange County in time to pack his bags again and head north for last week's 
start of the U.S. Bud Tour in the chilly waters off Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old Huntington Beach resident placed fourth on the pro tour last 
year and has a strong shot at a 1994 Bud Tour crown, said Rockin' Fig. In Santa 
Cruz, Deffenbaugh beat Hawaiian Sunny Garcia in the first heat and placed first 
in the quarterfinals. But he was stopped by Richie Collins of Newport Beach and 
Joey Jenkins of North Hollywood from making the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fig: He had a real prestigious high school career and paid his dues in 
amateur surfing. He was on the world amateur team that went to Japan, and it 
seems like all those surfers, including Pat O'Connell and Kelly Slater, are 
getting hot as pros.  
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh is the latest among a talented crew of amateur surfers to come out 
of Huntington Beach High School. He won the Sunset League individual 
championship and led the Oilers to a 10-0 record in 1991. He turned pro after a 
second-place finish at the 1991 Op Junior amateur contest and joined the U.S. 
pro tour full time in 1992, the year he graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh and his older brother, Barry, 22, anchored Huntington High's 
national championship squad. It has only taken him a couple of years on the Bud 
Tour to find himself in the Top 5.  
</P>
<P>
 We asked Deffenbaugh, also known as JD, what he thought of this year's tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tour is definitely getting stronger," he said. "There's a lot more guys 
coming from the ASP (Assn. of Surfing Professionals) tour and picking off 
contests they want to on the Bud Tour. We also have guys who want to make it on 
the qualifying tour and who want to make it on the world tour, and that 
definitely brings the level of competition up." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to be satisfied with just letting me paddle around them 
during heats looking for waves," he said, adding that he'd be pleased to make 
the Top 4 again. But he isn't stopping there: "My goal is to be the Bud Tour 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh has never taken a first place on the tour, but he finished strong 
at the end of last season with a second place at the Bud tour's contest in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you get nervous when you hear people saying you're a contender for the 
tour's title? 
</P>
<P>
 "Naw, it doesn't make me nervous at all," JD said. "It gives me more 
confidence that people believe that I'm at their level of surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh handles the fame well, Figgy said. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't walk around with a big attitude. It just looks like he's having fun 
when he's surfing in a heat. As far as style, he's quick and snappy and he can 
go vertical, too. And he can surf in small and big waves.  
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh enjoys travel and surfing in Hawaii. But he also is happy just 
surfing near Huntington's pier with his brother and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh said he has few heroes and has developed his surfing style by 
taking "bits and pieces off of other people." 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to fit several different styles of people surfing and use what can fit 
for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His best fan? His 2-year-old son, Justin. Then, his mom, Becky, who as a 
single parent, like Jeff, spent hours driving him and Barry to surfing meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom was and is a big influence on whatever we do. She was always there to 
take us to our contests and would video us when she could." 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't Barry lose a video camera recently when a rogue 25-foot Todos Santos 
wave flipped an inflatable boat he was in? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yup, that was Barry," Deffenbaugh said. "It was my mom's brand-new camera. 
The only thing Barry held on to were the keys to the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Contests: Australian Todd Prestage won $4,000 at the Billabong contest in 
Santa Cruz. Prestage was ahead of Chris Brown, Collins and Jenkins. O.C. pro 
long-boarders had a better showing at Santa Cruz: Joey Hawkins of Huntington 
Beach took second; Jeff Krammer and Josh Baxter, both of San Clemente, were 
third and fourth, respectively. Ted Robinson of Manhattan Beach was first. 
</P>
<P>
 TV: Jim Trenton of Newport Beach, also known as TV's Poor Man from Fox's 
Channel 11, taped local surfers paddling out in the rain at Huntington Beach 
last week. Then he visited the Sugar Shack cafe on Main Street, which had 
11-cent breakfasts as one of Poor Man's extra-value deals.

 Rarely mentioned in the same breath, eating and exercise seem to have been 
banished to opposite ends of the social spectrum. One group, however, proves on 
a regular basis that the two activities are not mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Wheelmen, the county's biggest bicycle club, has a number of 
regular ride-and-eat events in the evenings and mornings. One of the 
longer-running (about 10 years now) morning events is the Wednesday lunch 
brunch, leaving at 9:30 a.m. each week from Mile Square Regional Park in 
Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Rides are generally from 35 to 50 miles round trip, but occasionally the group 
will go 100 miles, including yesterday's trot to Lake Elsinore. Most 
destinations are not so ambitious. Long Beach, Brea and Yorba Linda are popular 
spots, given the range of food stops and quality of ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually go to a coffee shop or a restaurant," said ride leader Franz 
Friesenhan. The trips vary weekly, and Friesenhan prefers eateries with outdoor 
dining -- so riders can watch their bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 An average of 15 to 25 riders take part in the Wednesday morning treks. 
Because of the weekday time, the ride attracts a wide age range, from young 
adults who work odd schedules to retirees. Some are in their 70s, but 
Friesenhan cautioned against assuming they can't hold their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have young kids who can't keep up with them," said Friesenhan, 65 and 
retired after working inside a machine shop. "I'm enjoying the outdoors now." 
</P>
<P>
 There are usually two groups of riders, divided by riding level, some taking a 
moderate pace (12 to 15 m.p.h.) and others moving at a faster clip (18 to 20 
m.p.h.). 
</P>
<P>
 He also leads a ride-and-eat event each Friday, leaving at 9 a.m. from 
Deerfield Park in Irvine and usually going to Dana Point, but this group 
generally moves at a quicker clip (even the slower riders keep a pace of 15 to 
18 m.p.h.). 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday marks the 14th running of the Los Alamitos 10K/5K Run and 5K Health 
Walk. All told, the event drew almost 2,000 runners and walkers last year. The 
5K run begins at 8 a.m., the 5K walk at 8:05 a.m. and the 10K run at 8:45 a.m. 
Race-day registration opens at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost for the running events is $17 with T-shirt, $13 without. There is only 
one option for walk entry: $7 (T-shirt included). The event will begin and end 
at the Los Alamitos Recreation and Community Center, 10911 Oak St. Information: 
(310) 430-1073.

KID STUFF: HANG ON EIGHT SECONDS . . .; BULLS, NOT DUCKS, ARE RUNNING THE 
ANAHEIM ARENA THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sung to the tune of "Streets of Laredo": 
</P>
<P>
 I see by your outfit/that you are a cowboy.  
</P>
<P>
 You see by my outfit/that I'm a cowboy, too.  
</P>
<P>
 We see by our outfits/that we are both cowboys.  
</P>
<P>
 Why don't you get an outfit/and be a cowboy, too? -- Author unknown Residents 
of Orange County know what it is to be suburban cowboys. We strew our spankin' 
new houses with artificially bleached skulls for an "Old West" look, and we buy 
studly, four-wheel-drive trucks in which we'll climb nothing steeper or dirtier 
than parking lot speed bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 But this weekend, two separate events will allow local residents to get a 
little closer to the classic cowboy experience: In Anaheim, the Flying U Rodeo 
checks into the Anaheim Arena Saturday and Sunday. And in Newport Beach, the 
historic Buffalo Ranch bids by-by to its bison with the Last Round-up, a 
community festival with petting zoos, balloon rides and bison photo ops (see 
accompanying story, this page). 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are probably plenty of gen-yoo-ine cowboys who laugh it up at 
our expense, Flying U president and former Long Beach boy Cotton Rosser takes a 
more empathetic view, and not just because it sells tickets to his rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be more city slicker cowboys around Orange County than just about 
anywhere else," observed Rosser in a phone conversation from his company's 
headquarters in Marysville. "It's so congested down there, it makes sense that 
people would want to get out with their families and go to rodeos." 
</P>
<P>
 As a source of family entertainment, rodeo combines the thrills and chills of 
a live sporting event with the spectacle of a big stage show, said Rosser, a 
37-year veteran of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rodeo has something for everyone," he added. "You have clowns, pretty girls 
in the barrel race, the big, tough, 2,000-pound bulls with young men trying to 
match their wits against them . . . everything you could want." 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, Rosser will try out a new format that he calls the Flying U Rodeo 
Classic. Traditional events like bareback bronc riding, in which a rider must 
stay on a bucking horse for eight seconds while holding on with one hand to a 
strap around the animal's girth, and the most dangerous of rodeo sports, bull 
riding (same idea, only this time with a bigger, meaner and possibly more 
vengeance-minded animal), will be featured. But, in a response to concerns from 
animal rights activists (Rosser has a more colorful word for them), events like 
calf roping and team roping will not. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowgirls will get their kicks in women's bull riding and bareback riding 
events. Competitors will include Melissa Phillips, 1993 Professional Women's 
Rodeo Assn. World Champion Bull Rider, and Jan Vouren, a former world champion 
bareback bronc rider. Women's barrel racing, in which a rider on a galloping 
horse must maneuver a clover-leaf pattern of barrels, will also be featured, as 
will "mutton busting," a novelty event in which children ages 4 to 8 try to 
keep their seat atop an uncooperative female sheep. (Locals interested in 
competing in this event should call Flying U at (916) 742-8249.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the program will be a handful of specialty acts, headlined by the 
comedy horse act of Gaylord Maynard, a veteran trainer who coordinated the 
popular Royal Lipizzan stallions shows, as well as a splashy opening number and 
a performing black stallion named Darth Vader. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Flying U show marks the first rodeo to be held at the new Anaheim 
Arena (a bull-riding competition was there in August), the company should be 
familiar to local rodeo buffs, having coordinated past events in San Juan 
Capistrano, Rancho Santa Margarita and Coto de Caza. More than 900 tons of dirt 
will be trucked in to cover the arena ice (the Ducks play Friday night), and a 
post-rodeo Western dance will be held on the arena floor at 10 p.m. Saturday. A 
planned pre-show festival at noon on Sunday features mariachi music, hay rides 
and close-up views of some of the Flying U livestock. And at intermission on 
both days, ponies will be brought into the arena for children in the audience 
to pet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will Rogers said 'The outside of a horse is good for the inside of a child,' 
" noted Rosser. "I believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 What: Flying U Rodeo. 
</P>
<P>

LAST CHANCE TO ROAM WITH THE BUFFALO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Fess up, now, hasn't there been at least one time in your solid, suburban 
existence that you've longed to ditch the car pool and roam with the buffalo? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes? Then the folks at Buffalo Ranch have a weekend planned for you. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday and Sunday, a trio of young bison celebrities will receive a grand 
send-off at an event that may well leave some longtime residents reaching for 
their hankies and, it is hoped, their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals -- Happy, Lucky and Rainbow -- are the last of a small herd 
maintained on the site of the former Buffalo Ranch amusement park by the 
current tenants, a commercial and residential real estate marketing firm called 
the Lange Group of Companies. At the end of this month, president William Lange 
and his employees will move from their compound of ranch-style buildings to new 
digs in Fashion Island, which, in all fairness, is a lousy place for buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1955, Buffalo Ranch once spanned some 150 acres near the 
intersection of what is now MacArthur Boulevard and Ford Road. More than 100 
bison roamed the range then; other attractions included Native American 
storytelling, a miniature train and even (easy now, Rainbow. . .) buffalo 
burgers. 
</P>
<P>
 The park was short-lived, however, and the land, which is owned by the Irvine 
Co., was leased to architect William Pereira, whose credits include planning 
the city of Irvine and UCI. In 1976, Lange's company moved in as Pereira's 
tenants and later purchased the buildings. Lange said he will deed the 
buildings to the Irvine Co. in hopes that local preservationists will be able 
to work with the landholder to preserve the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The move signals the end of an era, said Lange, and to mark the occasion, his 
firm and First Republic Escrow are underwriting the Last Roundup, featuring 
pony and hot-air balloon rides, a petting zoo, children's crafts and Western 
entertainment. The event ends Sunday at 3 p.m. with a live auction of the 
bison. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential buyers must submit an application stating what, if any, experience 
they have with buffalo, said Lange, and where they expect to keep them 
(underline keep; these animals are not intended for slaughter). 
</P>
<P>
 If the kids have been clamoring for a bison, and you find yourself weakening, 
be forewarned: an adult bull may weigh up to 2,400 pounds. Proceeds from the 
auction and ticket sales will benefit Children's Home Society of California, 
Discovery Museum of Orange County and HomeAidof Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Buffalo Ranch's Last Roundup. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday and Sunday, Feb. 19 and 20, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Auction 
begins Sunday at 3 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Buffalo Ranch, 2418 MacArthur Blvd., Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, take the Corona del Mar (73) 
Freeway south to its end; it turns into MacArthur Boulevard. The ranch is at 
MacArthur Boulevard and Ford Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $5 for children 12 and under, $10 for adults, $25 for families of 
four or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (714) 640-2388. CORINNE FLOCKEN

SPECIAL SCREENING: DAPPER 'TROUBLE' IS GOLDEN AGE GEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernst Lubitsch didn't start out as the champagne cocktail of comedy directors. 
His work in Europe during the silent era resulted in dramas such as "Madame 
Dubarry" and "Anne Boleyn," both historical epics known for their sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lubitsch turned to humor later in his career, especially after he came to 
the States and began an association with Paramount. In 1932, Lubitsch made 
"Trouble in Paradise" for the studio. It was the best in a string of fine 
comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trouble in Paradise," which screens Friday as part of UC Irvine's "Tragedy 
and Comedy" series, wasn't the first film that had them talking about "the 
Lubitsch touch," but it came to be known as the most recognizable example of 
his style. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexy elegance, sophisticated talk, shimmering irony and artistic brevity are 
the features of that style. There were Gable's ears, Garbo's mystery and 
Lubitsch's touch, all symbols of Hollywood's so-called Golden Age. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble in this particular paradise comes in the dapper forms of Gaston 
(Herbert Marshall) and Lily (Miriam Hopkins), a pair of slick jewel thieves who 
practice their trade among Europe's elite. The picture starts out with Gaston 
and Lily meeting under typical circumstances. She has lifted his watch and 
wallet, and he has pick-pocketed her pin and garters. 
</P>
<P>
 After discovering they have similarly larcenous souls and are more than a 
little attracted to each other, Gaston and Lily team up. They pick a target 
almost immediately. She's pretty Mariette (Kay Francis), a widow who runs a 
perfume company and just happens to need a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston smooth-talks his way into the job and Mariette's life, hoping to slip 
away with a sizable portion of her money. He doesn't plan on falling for her, 
though, and that just adds to the trouble, especially where Lily is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a light fizz to almost every scene that can be attributed to 
Lubitsch's easy merging of many cinematic elements from sound to camera 
movement to editing to set design. The dialogue by screenwriters Grover Jones 
and Samson Raphaelson has verve, but Lubitsch's main talent is in implying a 
feeling or explaining a situation without overstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond creating witty entertainment, Lubitsch is credited with helping bridge 
the difficult gap between silents and talkies. In particular, his use of music 
to create mood is considered important in that evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubitsch, as with his contemporaries, directors such as King Vidor and Rene 
Clair, realized that the soundtrack could be more than just an empty space 
reserved for gab. His use of music -- at times insistent, other times subtle 
and cajoling, but always true to the scene's flavor -- gave his movies a 
certain refinement. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Ernst Lubitsch's "Trouble in Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, Feb. 18, at 7 and 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The UC Irvine Student Center Crystal Cove Auditorium, Campus Drive and 
Bridge Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to Jamboree Road and head south 
to Campus Drive and take a left. Turn right on Bridge Road and head onto the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $2 and $4.

KIDS ON FILM: 'BLANK CHECK' CASHES IN ON HOME-ALONE-TYPE FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Blank Check," a boy receives a blank check from a crook who accidentally 
crashed into him, cashes it for $1 million, purchases a fantasy life, fends off 
by himself the crooks' pursuit and learns that money can't buy him love. (Rated 
PG)  
</P>
<P>
 He's alone. He's misunderstood. He's pursued by evil men who are not as smart 
as he is. He lives in the suburbs. He comes into a tremendous amount of money. 
He triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 He's about 11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like a kid's dream," said Crystal Vigal, 11.  
</P>
<P>
 But isn't it also becoming a little familiar?  
</P>
<P>
 Crystal and her twin, Candace, thought so. The Disney film reminded them both 
of "Home Alone II," in which MacCauley Culkin leads the two burglars on a merry 
chase through Manhattan using their money. But so what?  
</P>
<P>
 "This was more exciting," Candace said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I always daydream abut having a lot of money," Crystal added. "You could get 
everything you ever wanted."  
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention, added their friend Ashley Casas, 10, "Not having your parents 
bother you about what to buy."  
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, said Kelly Orosz, 10, is that "You're in charge. You get to 
order people around."  
</P>
<P>
 The boy in the film is alienated from his friends and neglected by his father, 
who has high expectations for his children. When the boy gets the money, he 
hires a limo and a driver, buys a house built like a castle and fills the back 
yard with toys: a water slide, gigantic overstuffed chairs and a soft boxing 
ring, a batting cage. On his birthday, he throws a $100,000 party but has to 
pretend it's for the fictional Mr. MacIntosh -- his cover.  
</P>
<P>
 Most kids said they'd do the same thing with $1 million. But some had other 
ideas.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd put it in the bank," said Dana Barnie, 10. "Everybody at the bank would 
love you because you're the biggest spender." 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Fodor, 11, said generously she would give some to her family. How much? 
</P>
<P>
 "One dollar," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kids loved the parts where the boy, in "Home Alone"-style, bashes the 
crooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Leonard, 5, doubled over in imitation of the crook being pummeled in 
the batting cage. "I liked it when the boy said, 'That must have hurt!' " he 
said, still chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the part where he locked the bad guy up in that rolling ball and he 
pushed it into the pool," said Kyle Titterud, 7.  
</P>
<P>
 The kids had a good laugh at the pranks, which were not as nasty as in "Home 
Alone." But they didn't think the movie held many surprises. Especially for 
those who had seen TV commercials with the funniest scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put all the good parts in the previews," said Sierra Christian, 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then it wasn't as good," added Erica Maluf, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you don't really need to go see it," chimed in Kali Feltz, 11.  
</P>
<P>
 I wondered what they thought about the boy after he spent all his money and 
still didn't have any friends his own age.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather not have a million dollars and have friends," Dana said.

NO PASSPORT NEEDED FOR TASTES OF THAI AND JERUSALEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an ever-growing breed of small ethnic restaurant, midway between 
formica-top and tablecloth places: the glass table-tops. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they're as shiny as a big crystal structure, but at least they're 
functional. Glass table-tops are easy to wipe clean and save on linen costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet, modest Thai Cuisine in Seal Beach has taken over for the posher 
Rangthong Thai, which closed a few months ago. The dining room retains a veneer 
of elegance: soft, coffee-colored paint, diffuse lighting and an aesthetic 
selection of embroidered wall art. Fresh anthurium and shiny stainless cutlery 
make the settings more appealing, and the service is punctuated with frequent 
smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owners come from Siam Thai Cuisine in Mission Viejo, and they've 
brought a team of good chefs along. Now, the majority of our Thai restaurants 
do it sweet, rather than hot, unless you instruct them otherwise. Thai Cuisine 
will make your food as you say; on our first visit, we told the waitress we 
wanted it hot, and we got a parade of spicy salads and fragrant curries. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the place is busy, it apparently defaults to sweet mode. We returned 
when the place was bustling, and this time we didn't really get the chance to 
explain our wishes. As a result, almost every dish we got was sugary. 
</P>
<P>
 At least you'll never have that problem with the spectacular hors d'oeuvres 
plate. Starting with the familiar, we find the following terrific Thai finger 
foods: dense little egg rolls with a subtle minced chicken filling ( poh pia ); 
beef satay, skewers of grilled beef eaten with fresh cucumbers and peanut 
sauce; spicy shrimp in noodle wrappers, deep fried ( koong kabok ), and pun 
krib , which are in effect Thai samosas, tiny pastry triangles with a curried 
potato and onion filling. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Thai restaurant serves the barbecued chicken entree called kai yang , 
but Thai Cuisine goes its competitors one better with something called yang jim 
. It's chicken with a ginger, coriander and garlic marinade, the boneless meat 
cut into thin strips. The famous Thai beef salad, num nuea , is not on the 
menu, but the kitchen will make it at the drop of a hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Kang keaw whan and panang are a couple of curries flavored with mint, lemon 
grass and galangal root. The first is fiery green, made with bamboo shoots, 
green beans and a choice of meats. Panang , a red curry beef thickened with 
coconut milk, may be the most opulent dish in the Thai Cuisine firmament. It's 
certainly the most filling. 
</P>
<P>
 Thai Cuisine is inexpensive to moderate. Appetizers are $4.50 to $6.50. 
Entrees are $5.95 to $11.95. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Ramadan, the month during which people of the Islamic faith fast from 
sunup to sundown. Anaheim's Jerusalem Restaurant and Bakery is a wonderful new 
Middle Eastern restaurant where you'll be tempted to eat as if you've been 
fasting, even if you've had a big lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 You may already have surmised that this is another glass table-top restaurant, 
but you might not have guessed that this room is airy and downright woodsy. 
It's quite pleasant in here, sitting at rustic wooden booths under plant-filled 
trellises. For decor we have a plastering of poster art depicting Jerusalem's 
Arab Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the range, a native Palestinian named Shadra Issa prepares some of the 
most appealing Middle Eastern cuisine I've tasted. Before you decide what you 
will have, she plies you with a complimentary plateful of hummus, olives, 
turnip pickles and hot pita bread. 
</P>
<P>
 The hummus, in particular, is great -- a garlicky sesame-garbanzo dip dusted 
with paprika and chopped parsley. It's pressed out flat on a dish, with a small 
depression in the surface filled in by a pool of greenish-yellow olive oil. 
Mmmm. I was half full before I even got a chance to order anything. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to fill up fast is to order a bowl of frikeh , a cracked-wheat soup as 
thick as quicksand. There are wonderfully soft and fragrant grape leaves 
stuffed with a rice and pine nut filling here, and great balls of kibbeh , too 
-- little oval lamb and cracked wheat meatballs with a meat and pine nut 
stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Issa's stuffed falafel is a new version on me. The feather-light deep-fried 
balls of garbanzo flour and spices, normally stuffed into pita pockets as a 
meat substitute, come in unique fashion. Issa stuffs the falafel themselves -- 
with a pinch of tart dried sumac berries. A winning idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the main entrees are familiar and fine: grilled kebabs, stewed lamb 
shank, a splendid stuffed chicken (stuffed with rice, ground beef, pine nuts, 
almonds and an abundance of cardamom). There are usually two specials daily, 
affording the chef a chance to show off a little. One day she might do a dense 
cauliflower and meat preparation that evokes a non-vegetarian version of the 
Indian staple alu gobi . On another, she'll stuff an entire leg of lamb. 
</P>
<P>
 This brings me to the most irresistible of her efforts, the bakery part of the 
equation, featuring an array of cookies and pastries. Before you try the 
delicious, multilayered baklava, try ghreibeh , a grainy white mound that 
crumbles in your mouth, or mana'ish , a flat, sesame-studded cookie with the 
texture of a prize-winning shortbread. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusalem Restaurant and Bakery is inexpensive. Main entrees are $5.99 to 
$7.99.

SCOTT HARRIS: CAL STATE SCHOOLS: NOT GLAMOROUS, JUST INVALUABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't that Salma Khan lacked options. Coming out of Cleveland High School 
in Reseda, she had the kind of academic record that earned her acceptance to UC 
Santa Barbara and UC Riverside. But her parents didn't want her to leave home, 
and Salma wasn't sure she wanted to either. 
</P>
<P>
 So Khan went straight from her neighborhood high school to her neighborhood 
university, never suspecting that her senior year would be threatened by an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan and thousands of other students who returned to Cal State Northridge this 
week find themselves and their campus engaged in a spunky, gallant struggle. At 
every turn there is evidence of destruction: the crumbling ruins of a parking 
garage, cracked facades, cyclone fences forbidding entry into danger zones. 
Students trudge into dusty fields, searching for classes relocated to the rows 
of portable classrooms that resemble barracks for oil roughnecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan, a 21-year-old health administration major, couldn't find one of her 
classes. But if she is typical, students are reacting with the proper pioneer 
spirit. There is even a sporting tolerance about the school's new motto: "Not 
Just Back . . . Better!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Khan says with a grin, "I don't know about that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's understood that this slogan, conceived by university President Blenda 
Wilson, is an exercise in bravado. Cal State Northridge, jury-rigged to 
compensate for $350 million in earthquake damage, is practicing educational 
triage. There are computer classes that lack computers. University officials 
talk gamely of getting the "bugs" out, but these are big, ugly tomato worms. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to see Cal State Northridge this way, to witness its resilience, is to be 
reminded just how important and valuable the Cal State system is. 
</P>
<P>
 In normal times, we Californians tend to take our neighborhood universities 
for granted. Imagine the Angst that would be inspired, the odes that would be 
written, if $350 million in damage hit USC or UCLA. Unlike private colleges or 
storied public research institutions, the Cal States don't inspire sentimental 
attachments. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is the nature of their students. Cal State students are a rich mix. 
Many, such as Salma Khan, are fairly traditional. But Khan knows several people 
in her major who are in their late 20s and early 30s and have returned to 
enhance their career options. Northridge is fairly typical of the Cal State 
system at large, which has more than 325,000 students enrolled at 20 campuses. 
The average age is 27. Two-thirds work more than 30 hours per week. 
</P>
<P>
 For high school students applying to college, the Cal States are often the 
relatively inexpensive Plan B for those rejected by more exclusive 
institutions. And so, as Khan attests, some people looked down on them as kind 
of glorified, bargain-basement community colleges that resemble hospitals and 
yet offer bachelor's and master's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm with friends who go to UCs, it's like 'Oh, well, you're going to Cal 
State,' " Khan says, imitating their patronizing tone. "But I guess we do that 
to the students at Pierce." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, it isn't just snobs who look down on the Cal States. Too often, so do 
their own students and alumni. As a graduate of Cal State Fullerton -- my own 
Plan B -- I am guiltily qualified to say so. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Munitz, chancellor of the Cal State system, understands that the 
middle-brow, pragmatic nature of these campuses.  
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, big urban commuter campuses with older students don't generate 
that kind of emotion," Munitz says. "Most of our people don't get teary-eyed 
when they hear the alma mater. Most don't know the alma mater." 
</P>
<P>
 He's right. I can't hum Fullerton's. 
</P>
<P>
 Hell, I didn't even attend my own graduation -- something I now regret. My 
parents would have enjoyed it. They didn't attend college, but they are proud 
that three children all graduated from Cal State Fullerton, and that their 
daughter earned a master's as well. 
</P>
<P>
 This fits another role of the Cal States: very often, their students are the 
first in their families to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The UCs may be admirable monuments to pure research, to learning for its own 
sake. Yet it is the Cal States that produce three of four teachers in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Joni Mitchell who sang: "You don't know what you've got 'til it's 
gone." The specter of almost losing Cal State Northridge calls to mind the 
value of these universities that lack ivy-covered walls and ivory towers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge is planning to send fund-raising letters to 130,000 
alumni worldwide, hoping that an earthquake will make us Cal State grads a 
little less hard-hearted for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 It's more than just a good cause. We owe them. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a full-time student pays $1,440 per year in tuition. In my day, it was 
$144.

 GOOD CHANGE: It's been a rough year for San Clemente High School, with two 
students killed in separate off-campus incidents. But students expect to set 
aside the tensions that arose from those tragedies at today's annual Cultural 
Fair. . . . It's live entertainment, ethnic food and a chance for the students 
to exhibit the many different cultural backgrounds at their school. Says Krisy 
Lewis, the school's ethnic relations commissioner: "It's the one activity that 
everyone looks forward to." 
</P>
<P>
 BORDERS PATROL: Southern California College was inundated by media requests 
Wednesday, the day after Ila Borders' history-making performance as the first 
woman to pitch in a college baseball game. . . . The Costa Mesa school received 
inquiries from radio, newspapers and television -- even from a movie studio 
(C12). Maybe the ultimate measure of Borders' newfound fame: After a cable-TV 
interview, she learned that "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" wants her to be a 
guest soon. 
</P>
<P>
 MUSICAL GENES: It's hardly a wonder that Carlene Carter, who sings at the 
Crazy Horse in Santa Ana on Monday night (OC Live!), chose a musical career. 
Her father is country legend Carl Smith, her mother is June Carter, and her 
stepdad is Johnny Cash. But she was also influenced by her grandmother, the 
late Mother Maybelle, the matriarch of the Carter clan. . . . "She taught me to 
play the guitar," Carter says. Carter still lives in her grandmother's house 
when she's back in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 BRAGGING LIGHTS: When county transportation officials asked the public to list 
complaints about street lights or traffic problems in their city, they were 
deluged. Someone from just about every city in the county brought in a 
complaint about something . . . except La Palma. It may be small, but it does 
have traffic lights -- just no complaints about them. The city's Public Works 
Director, Ismile H. Noorbaksh, told his staff: "We must be doing something 
right."

 THE REAL STORY: We like to pride ourselves on responsible journalism, but we 
goofed. We failed to give the readers all the facts about the Jan. 17 quake. . 
. . So, permit us to steal the story from that bastion of truth -- the Weekly 
World News, a tabloid based in Florida. Its headline: "L.A. Quake Opens Gates 
of Hell! . . . Demons escape from crack in California freeway!" We promise to 
get it right next time. 
</P>
<P>
 SAFE BASEBALL: Women found a new pioneer this week -- Ila Borders, a freshman 
at Southern California College in Costa Mesa, who became the first woman to 
pitch in a college baseball game. And she won! . . . But before her gender gets 
too excited, Janet Sherman, CSUN's assistant softball coach, cautioned: "I 
don't know of a woman who can block the plate against a guy. They'll get 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
 HELPING OUT: Isaac Sanchez, above, lived in Guadalajara, Mexico, when the town 
was hit by a devastating quake more than 20 years ago. So with other students 
at San Pedro-Narbonne Community Adult School, Sanchez donated supplies, 
including canned vegetables and stuffed animals, to quake victims at Granada 
Hills' Kennedy High School. (B3) 
</P>
<P>
 HOLD THE SALAMI: Vice presidents don't get any breaks. Bill Clinton stuffs his 
stomach at every photo op, but Al Gore, who toured quake damage in the Valley 
on Wednesday (B1), doesn't always get the same benefits. . . . Gore was offered 
a sandwich by Giovanni Roberto, owner of San Carlo Italian Import in 
Chatsworth. But, later, Gore's aides carted away the 50 sandwiches made by the 
deli. Roberto may never know if the veep got a bite. 
</P>
<P>
 REBOUNDING: Monroe High's Dimara Haymond, 18, plays tough under the basket, 
acting as if rebounds should be her exclusive property. . . . But that's 
nothing compared to how she has rebounded from adversities off the court. Her 
father is in prison. Her mom is paralyzed. (C10) Michael Arkush

 BUFFER ZONE: After allowing a new high school to tap into Oxnard's water 
supply (B1), state planners signed off on an agreement to shield 4,575 acres of 
farmland from development. . . . But the approval kills a push to add another 
1,200 acres to the greenbelt between Ventura and Oxnard. . . . "I'm 
disappointed," said Jean Harris, who with other environmentalists asked that 
the greenbelt be expanded to include an agricultural strip surrounding the new 
Oxnard High School. "I just hope the land that was left out doesn't become 
vulnerable."

 TOP DOG: Simi Valley Police Officer Sterling Johnson and his canine partner 
Charly took top honors over the weekend at the Bakersfield Canine Trials. The 
team beat out more than 50 competitors from across the state. . . . "It says 
more about the skills of the handler than it does about the dog," Lt. Tony 
Harper said. Charly follows in the footsteps of Atlas, a back-to-back world 
champion also handled by Johnson, a 12-year police veteran.

 POSTER PRODUCE: California Strawberry Festival officials Wednesday unveiled 
the art that will grace posters and T-shirts promoting the annual event. For 
the second year in a row, San Ramon artist Penny Soto has designed the 
festival's official artwork: a silver bowl crowned with the berries. . . . 
Hidden within the piece are balloons, a clown's face and other items. "When 
people discover or rediscover something hidden in the shadows, it's a 
revelation that makes them feel good," Soto said. . . . The strawberry festival 
will be held May 21 and 22 at College Park near Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 FAB FIVE: Bringing college basketball mania to a normally placid beach town, 
the Ventura College Pirates are one of the hottest tickets in town (Ventura 
Life, Page 24). . . . The men's basketball team is ranked No. 1 among 
California community colleges and is one of the top ones in the nation. . . . 
Beaten only twice in 31 games this season, it draws the largest crowds in the 
county for an indoor event.

SACRAMENTO FILE: BILL WOULD RECOGNIZE RIGHTS OF UNMARRIED DOMESTIC PARTNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unmarried couples could officially register their relationships, affirming 
their right to will each other property and allowing them to participate in 
family-only hospital visits, under legislation that has been introduced in the 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill (AB 2810) would apply to unmarried couples who are living together, 
including same-sex domestic partners, provided they qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible to register with the secretary of state, a couple would have to 
be over the age of 18, not be related by blood, agree to share joint living 
expenses, and not have been part of another domestic partnership for six months 
before registering. The measure is sponsored by the gay and lesbian support 
group Life AIDS Lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are thousands of couples who live together and for one reason or 
another choose not to be married," author Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) 
said. "It's about time the state of California acknowledges these family 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 A related measure (AB 2811) also introduced by Katz would allow extension of 
health care coverage to registered unmarried couples employed by public 
agencies that contract with the state retirement system. ASSEMBLY

 * Illegal Immigrants: AB 54X by Assemblywoman Margaret Snyder (D-Modesto) 
would make it a felony to manufacture or sell false government documents to 
illegal immigrants for the purpose of concealing their true status. The penalty

ATTORNEY REINSTATED BY THE STATE BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura attorney whose conviction for possession of LSD was overturned on 
appeal has been reinstated to practice law, the State Bar of California 
confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas A. Palaschak was arrested in 1991, along with his secretary, for 
participating in an LSD party at the attorney's office on Telephone Road after 
a co-worker informed authorities.The secretary, Jessica Jobin, had 46 doses of 
LSD in her purse when police raided the office and later pleaded guilty to 
possession of the hallucinogenic drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Palaschak was convicted in 1992 of a single misdemeanor count of possession 
and sentenced to three years probation and 90 days in jail. The sentence was 
suspended pending his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney was acquitted of furnishing LSD to a minor -- the 17-year-old 
employee who alerted police -- and conspiracy to possess LSD. 
</P>
<P>
 In appealing his conviction, Palaschak admitted taking 1 1/2 doses of LSD but 
successfully argued that he had no additional drugs in his possession and that 
being under the influence of LSD is not a crime in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Court of Appeal reversed his conviction Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Bar, which had issued an interim suspension of Palaschak's license 
after his conviction, reinstated the attorney as of Tuesday, spokeswoman Kim 
McCready said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palaschak, who had contended that the suspension was improper while he 
appealed his case, on Wednesday described the series of events as challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a family, I probably would have changed my profession," he said. 
"Since I don't have a family, I was able to stay focused on the legal battle."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; RESIDENTS MEET WITH MAYOR ON MALL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of about 40 residents who live near the Buenaventura Mall met with 
Ventura Mayor Tom Buford to request that the city install pedestrian bridges 
over streets and keep parking structures away from homes if a proposal to 
double the size of the mall is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling themselves "Venturans By Design," the group has submitted a list of 15 
suggestions regarding the mall and demanded that Buford respond within 30 days. 
Most of the suggestions concern noise, traffic and architectural issues. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting Tuesday, Buford told residents he would respond to their 
concerns within a month. But he warned them that he would not jeopardize 
negotiations with mall developer MaceRich Co., which is based in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, city officials began preliminary negotiations with MaceRich 
executives to write a development agreement stipulating that the city expects 
MaceRich to find ways to minimize additional traffic, noise and other impacts 
from the proposed expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford assured residents that the proposed mall expansion would not be rushed 
through the city's permitting process, and would be carefully reviewed by many 
residents and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of the environmental impacts estimates that the expanded mall would 
attract more than 14,000 additional cars to the area every day, causing traffic 
and pollution problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, three department stores would be added to the two large 
stores already at the site. A second floor of shops would be added, as well as 
two multilevel parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents' suggestions included proposals to widen Mills Road and Dean Drive, 
close off Ocean and Central avenues, build two pedestrian bridges over Mills 
Road and move parking garages away from residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has hired former Mayor Richard Francis, a civil litigation attorney, 
to be its spokesman. Coincidentally, Francis and Buford share office space, but 
own separate legal practices. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY CHANGES RULES ON PUBLIC COMMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council has reduced from four to two the number of times 
individuals may address the council on its meeting days, but turned aside a 
proposal that would have barred residents from addressing council members more 
than once a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 to consolidate the public comment period and consent 
agenda for the Housing Authority, Redevelopment Agency and City Council, the 
three legislative bodies on which council members sit. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the change affects only open comment periods. Individuals may still 
address the council on any specific agenda item. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the previous rules, the public could speak during a public comment 
period before each of the three bodies. In addition to the five council 
members, the seven-member Housing Authority also has two members from the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Tuesday also increased the amount of time allotted to speakers 
from two minutes to three, and gave the presiding officer the authority, with 
the council's approval, to grant additional time. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez opposed the measure, saying the presiding officer does not 
need council approval to make other discretionary rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to complaints from council members about rude behavior by the 
public, City Atty. Gary Gillig said California's revised public meeting law 
gives the public the right to criticize public officials but prohibits slander, 
cursing or abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizar (Al) Hernandez, who frequently speaks to the council on a variety of 
topics, suggested that the council's interest in controlling public behavior 
stemmed from the raucous behavior at a hearing on a merger between the city's 
police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a public hearing, you get a lot of people who don't usually 
attend meetings," Hernandez said. "They care about the city, and they will boo 
and say a lot of things you don't expect to hear. An elected councilman has to 
be able to take that kind of heat." PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL TOUGHENS ANTI-GRAFFITI LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Private property owners in Oxnard will be required to remove graffiti from 
their property or face criminal penalties under tough new amendments to the 
city's anti-graffiti ordinance approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendments, first proposed by the advisory Anti-Graffiti Task Force, and 
approved on Tuesday, broaden the scope of the city's anti-graffiti regulations 
and clarify some of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the amended ordinance, adults as well as minors will be barred from 
possessing objects that could be used for graffiti, including spray-paint cans 
and engraving instruments. Previously, the ordinance prevented only minors from 
possessing graffiti tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance also extends the prohibition against the possession of 
spray-paint cans in parks to include the possession of such objects on any 
public property or in any public vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the ordinance now gives the courts the flexibility to waive 
the financial penalties assessed against individuals convicted of graffiti 
vandalism if the person can prove undue financial hardship.  
</P>
<P>
 The fines help pay the city and property owners for the expense of removing 
the graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The council passed the measure on a 5-0 vote. PATRICK McCARTNEY

ELECTIONS / PORT HUENEME BALLOT MEASURE; CITY TO LET VOTERS RULE ON FATE OF 
POLICE FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Port Hueneme City Council on Wednesday agreed to place a $500,000 special 
property tax measure on the June ballot, allowing voters to decide on a tax 
increase that would enable the city to retain its Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless two-thirds of those voting approve the measure, officials say the 
financially beleaguered city would probably have to contract for police 
services with the county sheriff's or Oxnard police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the measure by a 4-0 vote. City Councilman Dorill Wright 
was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed tax, which would be added to property tax bills, would nearly 
equal the cost savings to Port Hueneme of contracting with the other agencies, 
and would restore two police positions lost to budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's simply not enough money to pay for the police," Mayor Orvene 
Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed tax measure, Port Hueneme homeowners would pay an extra $56 
a year in property taxes, apartment owners $47 per unit and commercial property 
owners 2.5 cents per square foot of property. 
</P>
<P>
 That would amount to an average tax increase of 5.5% for single-family homes, 
11.5% for apartments, 13% for commercial properties and 50% for vacant 
properties. The amount of tax for each property category was determined by 
estimating the cost of providing police protection, Community Development 
Director Tom Figg said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the property tax bill for Casa Via Mar Motel, which is on a 
125,453-square-foot parcel, would rise by $3,141 a year, a 12.5% increase over 
its current tax bill of $25,134, a city report said. A small store such as the 
Anacapa Market, which is on a 7,750-square-foot parcel, would pay $194 more 
each year, a tax hike of 30.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 If the special tax receives less than the amount needed for approval, but more 
than 50% of the vote, City Manager John R. (Dick) Velthoen said the council 
would consider a utility tax as a last chance to retain the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who support the special tax told the council Wednesday that they are 
willing to pay the extra tax to retain a local Police Department they describe 
as more responsive than larger departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am for saving our Police Department," said Port Hueneme resident Victoria 
Carter, one of several residents who attended the meeting wearing T-shirts that 
said "Save Our Police." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the measure said Port Hueneme officers routinely respond to all 
medical emergencies and other calls that larger departments often overlook. And 
if the city contracted with the sheriff's or Oxnard departments, they noted, 
the police station at City Hall would be closed during nighttime hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Velthoen blamed the city's financial bind on the state 
Legislature's raid on local taxes -- which he estimated has led to a permanent 
loss of $600,000 a year -- and the weak local economy. Over the past two years, 
the council has pared nearly $900,000, or 12%, from the city's budget, laid off 
a dozen employees and closed the city's cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster the city's bottom line, the council created three special 
assessment districts that last year raised $594,000 to help maintain the city's 
beach, parks and street medians. The beach and park maintenance districts have 
since been merged into a single district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a city proposal to build an RV resort on the beach to raise an 
estimated $400,000 annually has encountered stiff opposition from nearby 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 With further claims by the state on local taxes anticipated again this year, 
Velthoen said the city would face a general fund deficit of $285,315 by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting squeeze on the city's finances prompted the city to explore 
contracting for police services with other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an additional revenue source is not available relatively soon, it is 
staff's opinion that the city should not continue to provide local police 
service," Velthoen said.

GREENBELT BETWEEN 2 CITIES OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The agency that regulates city and county boundaries ratified an agreement 
Wednesday that establishes a greenbelt of undeveloped land between Oxnard and 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The Local Agency Formation Commission voted unanimously to approve an 
agreement that stipulates no development will be permitted in 4,575 acres along 
the coast between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
 LAFCO's agreement was the final step in establishing the greenbelt agreement, 
which will be up for review in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 During public hearings in front of the Oxnard and Ventura city councils last 
fall, many landowners and developers opposed the agreement while 
environmentalists pushed for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The land is already protected from development by zoning laws that designate 
it only for agriculture, but the agreement is seen as a way to reinforce a 
commitment by Ventura and Oxnard to protect the rural character of the area.

PROBLEMS COMPLICATE SKYLINE AREA PLANS; GROWTH: THOUSAND OAKS WANTS TO CONTROL 
DEVELOPMENT, BUT IS HINDERED BY FINANCES AND A DEFUNCT REAL ESTATE VENTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fallout from a defunct real estate venture and Thousand Oaks' continuing 
budget crunch have complicated the city's plans to control development in the 
isolated -- but highly visible -- pocket known as the Skyline Area. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders have long sought ways to bring the 144-acre patch east of Conejo 
Ridge Avenue and west of Foothill Drive to current design and safety standards 
without sacrificing the region's remote, rural ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, the council unanimously approved several proposals: to consider 
merging tiny lots -- some as small as 5,000 square feet -- to prevent excessive 
development; to look at purchasing ridgeline parcels for preservation as open 
space, and to start evaluating the costs of bringing water and sewer service to 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But it remains unclear whether the city will have the means, or the money, to 
implement those ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing budget concerns, a three-member council majority turned down a chance 
to buy nearly a dozen hilltop acres for $46,750. 
</P>
<P>
 And the council's objective of consolidating some of the Skyline Area's 
cramped parcels also foundered Tuesday night. Most of the area's 253 parcels 
are considered too small for development under current standards. Lots slope up 
steep hills, and some lack access to roads. 
</P>
<P>
 By consolidating lots owned by the same person, the council hopes to limit 
development -- allowing, for example, just one house where five or six separate 
parcels now lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at least 56 of the Skyline Area lots, including dozens considered prime 
candidates for merger, have become entangled in complex legal proceedings that 
could limit the council's options. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were told Tuesday that a Santa Monica mortgage broker 
purchased scores of Skyline Area lots in the late 1980s. Jennifer Shaw, an 
attorney for a court-appointed receiver sorting out the broker's land holdings, 
said the broker attached up to three mortgages on each lot by persuading 
investors to lend her cash. 
</P>
<P>
 On each lot, the mortgages were worth way more than the property itself, Shaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The financing scheme collapsed when the broker stopped making interest 
payments to her investors, "and they concluded that they had been bamboozled," 
Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, the broker pleaded guilty to grand theft and was sentenced to 
seven years in state prison. Now, the Los Angeles Superior Court receiver is 
trying to repay the mortgage holders by selling the broker's many land 
holdings, including those in the Skyline Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The court would block any city action to consolidate or rezone the parcels, 
Shaw told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an interview, Shaw expressed frustration that the council would even 
consider merging the lots, a move that would drive down their value. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing can happen to those lots without the approval of a judge sitting in 
downtown L. A.," she said. "But merely by their saber-rattling about merging 
the lots, the council is killing the value of the property and making it nearly 
impossible to sell them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks may be unable to merge lots tied up in the legal 
wrangling, the City Council will look into consolidating other parcels within 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a simplified way to reduce the impact of development in a very sensitive 
and difficult area," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some property owners, however, do not share her enthusiasm. Instead of merging 
their parcels, they are asking the city to consider building the infrastructure 
-- wider roads, a water tank and sewer service -- that would allow them to make 
use of their long-vacant land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many property owners are looking forward to developing this land and putting 
homes on it," said Michael Li-Paz, who owns three lots in the area. "How long 
will it be until the city might get involved and send tractors in to build a 
water tank?" 
</P>
<P>
 In response to his plea, the council directed city staff to estimate the cost 
of preliminary engineering studies, which would be necessary before any 
infrastructure improvements could begin. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 lots in the Skyline Area are developed, and some vacant parcels 
already have the infrastructure necessary for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council Tuesday approved construction of a 99-bed convalescent home on one 
ready-to-develop lot at the northeast corner of Fairview Road and Foothill 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Two residents who own property in the Skyline Area complained that the council 
should withhold approval of the convalescent center until the city comes up 
with a comprehensive plan for dealing with surrounding lots. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a 4-1 vote, with Mayor Elois Zeanah dissenting, the council decided to 
allow developer Orlando Clarizio to go ahead with the convalescent home. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 30 years on the council, this (Skyline Area development plan) is 
probably one of the most complicated issues the city has ever dealt with," 
Councilman Alex Fiore said. "We're fooling ourselves if we think we can get it 
resolved within a six-month period or a two-year period. It's going to be a 
long, long process."

COST ESTIMATES REQUESTED ON REPAIRS FOR FORMER CIVIC CENTER; THOUSAND OAKS: 
PLANS CALL FOR SELLING THE HILLCREST DRIVE PROPERTY AND USING PROCEEDS TO HELP 
FUND CONSTRUCTION OF THE CIVIC ARTS PLAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Agreeing that few tenants would jump to rent a gutted building with a leaky 
roof and broken windows, the Thousand Oaks City Council has requested cost 
estimates on fixing up the former civic center at 401 W. Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members will solicit estimates from contractors and engineers and 
return to the council with a report on various options, from simply replacing 
the shattered glass to revamping the air conditioning and repaving the parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a crap shoot -- we don't know how much this is going to cost," City 
Manager Grant Brimhall told the council late Tuesday. "We're asking you to let 
us find out what it will cost to make the building available to rent." 
</P>
<P>
 Requesting estimates from contractors will take only a few hours of staff 
time, Brimhall said. Evaluating the proposals could prove more laborious -- and 
therefore more expensive. But Brimhall did not know how much the process would 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 City plans call for selling the Hillcrest Drive property for at least $11 
million and using the proceeds to help fund construction of the Civic Arts 
Plaza, which will open in the fall as a performing arts center and government 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than auction off the Hillcrest Drive property now, when land prices are 
depressed, the City Council has decided to hold onto the land until the real 
estate market rebounds. In the meantime, the council hopes to lease the 
property, perhaps to a corporation or educational institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Several executives based in the San Fernando Valley looked at the property 
after last month's earthquake, Brimhall said, but "the interest evaporated" 
after they learned of the building's dilapidated condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacant eight years, the former civic center needs repairs on the heating and 
air-conditioning system, the roof, parking lot, the electrical wiring, the 
restrooms and more, according to Assistant City Manager MaryJane Lazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to compete actively in the marketplace, we feel we need to bring the 
building up to a certain minimum standard," Lazz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council members unanimously agreed to assess the costs of 
sprucing up the old civic center, their pre-vote debate laid bare bitter 
divisions and longstanding rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than focusing on the repair issue, all five council members served up 
fiery speeches on the still-controversial Civic Arts Plaza. In half an hour of 
blistering debate, they accused one another of misleading the public, rewriting 
history and obscuring money trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski, consistent critics of the 
Civic Arts Plaza's cost and scale, came under the sharpest attacks after they 
questioned the city's plan to finance the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you that two plus two equals four for the next 5,000 years, and if 
you still don't understand that, there's nothing I can do about it," Councilman 
Alex Fiore told them. "You and your cohorts and your groupies just don't 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the debate, an exasperated Fiore had turned to Zeanah with a 
challenge: "When all is said and done, if we fall flat on our faces -- or any 
other body part you want to talk about -- I will be the first to apologize. But 
if we are successful, I expect you to be the first to apologize and say you 
were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to Zeanah, Zukowski and a few residents who frequent the council 
chambers to criticize the Civic Arts Plaza, Fiore added: "Too many people are 
hoping we'll go sour, hoping against hope we'll fall flat. But, by God, we're 
going to be right." 
</P>
<P>
 With the air of a teacher stepping into a schoolyard scuffle, City Manager 
Brimhall tried to steer the council members back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zeanah and Zukowski ensured that the debate will flare again at future 
council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Brusquely, they demanded brief summaries of Civic Arts Plaza finances, 
including cash flow from various sources and total land costs for the project. 
Finance Director Robert Biery promised to have the reports in two weeks, and 
Zeanah said she would put discussion of the financial program at the top of a 
forthcoming agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 After concluding the heated debate Tuesday night, the council moved on to a 
related action, agreeing to solicit cost estimates on improving unleased space 
in the government portion of the Civic Arts Plaza.  
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Recreation and Park District had been expected to move into -- and 
pay for -- the 10,000 square feet of office space, but last year pulled out of 
the deal, citing budget constraints. Now, however, park district directors are 
again considering moving into the Civic Arts Plaza, according to Assistant City 
Manager Lazz. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Transportation officials are also interested in 
renting a few suites for a telecommuting center, which would house computers 
capable of establishing teleconference network links around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than offer the park district and Caltrans unfinished space, the council 
will consider installing restrooms, water and sewer lines and other basic 
amenities.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: THEY SHORTEN THE GAMES, A FOOT AT A TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to speed up baseball games, the NCAA adopted a new rule this 
season, wherein players are required to keep one foot in the batter's box 
during an at-bat. The rule is designed to keep batters from fiddling between 
pitches and slowing the pace of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cal State Northridge shortstop Chad Thornhill says the sport already has a 
timepiece. It's been that way for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball has its own clock," Thornhill said. "It's called 27 outs." 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few exceptions -- the batter is allowed to leave the box during 
pickoff throws or whenever the pitcher leaves the dirt area of the mound, for 
instance -- but a batter leaving the box without requesting and receiving a 
timeout from the umpire is penalized a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 In a preseason scrimmage, several Northridge players learned quickly that the 
rule will be enforced with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I got called on it about four times," freshman Eric Gillespie said. 
"It cured me fast." 
</P>
<P>
 While Gillespie and Thornhill agreed that the rule might accelerate play 
slightly, they believe it leaves hitters at a disadvantage once the pitcher has 
a two-strike count. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm battling . . . with two strikes, I need time to regroup," Thornhill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gillespie: "I give it a thumbs down. The hitter's at a disadvantage, 
though the umps have been pretty good so far about (granting time)." 
</P>
<P>
 Batters must remain more alert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps me stay more focused," said Thornhill, who entered the week with a 
team-high average of .350. "But I think the consensus is that it's a pretty 
useless rule." CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Not So Fast, Guys 
</P>
<P>
 It ended with a bang. It started the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge scored three runs in the 11th inning to defeat UCLA on Sunday, 
10-7, in a thriller that featured a half-dozen big plays. Three hours earlier, 
the day began with a little excitement too, in what seemed a carryover from a 
previous game. 
</P>
<P>
 When Northridge played UCLA on Friday, the Matadors stormed onto the field 
moments after the Bruins had completed taking infield practice. Well, they were 
almost finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to take over the field, even when we're on the road," Thornhill said. 
"(Friday), we ran out there when they were finishing their last popup." 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody must have taken offense. Sunday, UCLA completed its infield drills 
and the Northridge players again bolted onto the field. Trouble, was, UCLA's 
players then walked back to their positions and began fielding more ground 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few awkward moments with players from both teams standing at the same 
positions, Northridge's players trudged back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kind of set us up for that one," Thornhill said, laughing. "But all it 
really did was fire us up for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge plays its next eight games against teams ranked in Collegiate 
Baseball's Division I top 30 poll, beginning with a three-game series this 
weekend with third-ranked Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Fullerton are games against USC (ranked 13th), Oklahoma State 
(sixth), Florida (27th) and a doubleheader against Ohio State (18th). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie, relegated to designated hitter because of a sore throwing shoulder, 
could return to his position behind the plate this weekend against Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie threw on the sideline before Sunday's victory over UCLA and still 
experienced soreness. UCLA stole a school-record nine bases in as many attempts 
against backup catcher Josh Smaler and starting pitcher Keven Kempton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those steals weren't (Smaler's) fault," Coach Bill Kernen said. "He 
did have some problems, but he's better than that. He's pretty much been shoved 
into this." 
</P>
<P>
 Smaler was an outfielder and the backup catcher to Adam Pearlman last season 
at Pierce College. Before he was thrust into duty behind the plate for 
Northridge, Smaler was starting in the outfield.

 Quotebook: Guard Brooklyn McLinn on the small gathering of fans that watched 
the Matadors play their first basketball game at Northridge in six weeks: "At 
the start of the game, I thought it was just going to be us and (players from) 
Grand Canyon in there."

</P>
<P>
 Brent Lofton has scored 83 points and grabbed 35 rebounds off the bench in 
Northridge's past six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lofton has scored almost a point per minute in the past two games. Against 
Southern Utah, he poured in a career-high 19 points in 26 minutes. Against 
Grand Canyon, he had 16 points in 20 minutes, boosting his season average to 
9.4 points in an average of 18 minutes. JUNIOR COLLEGES

 It might take some time for Jerry Dunlap to adjust to life without running an 
athletic department but he is willing to give it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, who recently resigned after 19 years as the Ventura College athletic 
director, is looking forward to evenings and weekends spent in places other 
than noisy gyms and playing fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, he'll still attend some games, but it will be for pleasure instead of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family and I have never had a real life," he said. "Ever since I started 
coaching in high school 40 years ago, I have done nothing but go to ballgames 
on weekends and at nights." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap will remain at Ventura and work on special projects and teach three 
physical education classes, which means he still will be around many of the 
coaches he brought to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are involved in the hiring of good employees, that's a good 
feeling," Dunlap said. "A successful (sports) program is only as good as the 
coach." Around the Campuses . . .

DIGEST: WALL DAMAGE NOTWITHSTANDING, CSUN TO PLAY FIRST HOME GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite damage to the outfield wall at Matador Field, Cal State Northridge 
will play its first home baseball game of the season, meeting third-ranked Cal 
State Fullerton on Saturday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall, which is made of concrete brick, is lower at some places than others 
because several top pieces were dislodged during the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Smith, Northridge's sports information director, said the umpires and 
coaches must agree on ground rules before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall is expected to be either repaired or replaced by a chain-link fence 
before Northridge's next home game, March 11 against Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a list of priorities on campus for fixing," Smith said, "but (the 
baseball field) is not high on the list." Basketball

 Stanley Roberts, injured center for the Clippers, is spearheading a 
fund-raising effort to help John Flowers, a former Northridge recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, Joshua Hay, an 11-year-old Northridge ball boy, helped organize 
a charity free-throw event at halftime of a Northridge game against St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers have agreed to sponsor a similar fund-raising effort on March 31, 
at halftime of their game against the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 At a tip-off event Tuesday at the El Matador Restaurant in Northridge, Roberts 
will outline a three-pronged plan that has been devised to raise money for the 
Flowers family to pay medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers, who lives in Glendale, Ariz., near Phoenix, lost both legs in a car 
accident in August, 1992, only a few days before he was scheduled to fly to 
Northridge and enroll in school.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: THOMAS STAYS BUSY STACKING THE DISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years removed from a high school career marked by high scoring, Nevada 
Las Vegas point guard Dedan Thomas is better known these days for spreading the 
wealth. He ranks second in the Big West Conference with 7.2 assists per game 
while he has de-emphasized shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a 6-foot senior, averages 9.2 points per game, lowest among starters 
and sixth highest on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 As a three-year starter at Taft High, Thomas averaged 19.4 points and nine 
assists an outing. Playing one season at Antelope Valley College, he averaged 
12.4 points and 9.5 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 But his defense, ballhandling and leadership as the Rebel team captain have 
become more crucial to a once-powerful program that has edged toward mediocrity 
since the NCAA placed it on a three-year probation last fall.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels are 10-10, 6-6 in conference play. Thomas is shooting only 34.8% 
from the field (38.3% from three-point range) and 59.1% from the free-throw 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, however, has had two double-doubles this season: 11 points and 11 
assists against Eastern Kentucky and 16 points and 10 assists against Utah 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 He also ranks fifth among the school's career assist leaders and sixth among 
steal leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest disappointment for UNLV was a 66-65 defeat at New Mexico State on 
Monday in which former Antelope Valley College standout D.J. Jackson (11 
points) nailed two three-point shots in the second half and iced the game with 
a free throw in the final moments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A recent ankle sprain hasn't slowed Oregon's Sara Wilson (Hart). 
</P>
<P>
 She has maintained her Pacific 10 Conference scoring average of 14.6 points 
per game and leads the conference in shooting percentage (56.8%). 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a senior majoring in psychology, also maintains a 3.41 grade-point 
average and has been named to the GTE Academic All-District 8 team, qualifying 
her for academic All-American status.  
</P>
<P>
 She was one of five female basketball players chosen out of Washington, 
Oregon, California, Hawaii, Alaska, British Columbia, Nevada, Arizona, Idaho 
and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Curry (Ventura College), who was named player of the year last season 
by the California Community College Basketball Coaches Assn. after averaging 
21.8 points, is starting to find his shooting range at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-7 junior averages 13.1 points for the Sooners but has scored 64 in 
his past two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Curry, who is nicknamed "Radar" because he likes to shoot from long distances, 
made six of 12 three-point shots and finished with a Division I personal-high 
31 last week against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 He topped that with 33 in a 115-111 victory over Nebraska on Monday. Curry 
made 13 of 22 three-point attempts and added 19 rebounds in the two games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans guard Tony Madison (Antelope Valley College) started cold but his 
shooting has warmed up the past five games, in which he hit 20 of 34 shots from 
the field (58.8%) and 10 of 21 from beyond the three-point stripe (47.6%). 
Madison, who averages 11.9 points, is an 84.1% free-throw shooter, which ranks 
him 35th in that category among Division I guards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Loll (Thousand Oaks), a 6-4 junior forward playing on an Air Force team 
that has nobody taller than 6-8 in its starting lineup, leads the Falcons in 
assists and rebounds with 2.8 and 6.6 per game. He is tied for second in 
scoring at 11.7 per game. He leads Air Force in free-throw percentage at 84.6%, 
second-highest in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a Western Athletic Conference career-high 19 points and seven assists 
against Texas El Paso on Jan. 10. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 UC Santa Barbara sophomore Lauren Goldstine (Westlake) averages 6.1 points per 
game off the bench. . . . Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's Suzanne Carey (Santa 
Paula) averages 7.6 points and a team-high 9.5 rebounds. She leads the team 
with 22 blocked shots and is second with 22 steals. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A backup at Washington, junior forward Trent Cornelius (Cleveland) had six 
points and four rebounds coming off the bench against Cal. . . . Arizona junior 
guard Jacinda Sweet (North Hollywood) averages nine points, 3.9 rebounds and 
three assists per game. . . . Senior forward Reggie Bell (Canyons) and junior 
forward Rasaan Hall (Crespi) average 19.6 and 11.3 points per game at Quincy 
University. . . . Adam Jacobsen (Crescenta Valley) of University of the Pacific 
averages 9.3 points and has made 23 of 49 three-point attempts (46.9%). He has 
broken the school record for most three-point field goals in a season and 
became one of only two UOP freshmen to reach 20 points in a game by posting 23 
against UC Santa Barbara on Feb. 12.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CHEVALIER NEARING TWO CSUN RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Chevalier, a senior guard at Cal State Northridge, must average 18 
points in the Matadors' final four games to break the school career scoring 
record of 1,301 points set by Jim Malkin from 1959-62. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier has 118 assists, 11 shy of the school season record set by Darren 
Matsubara during the 1988-89 season.Chevalier already is Northridge's career 
leader with 464 assists, 171 steals and 377 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier came within three points of matching his career high with 25 points 
against Grand Canyon on Tuesday night. He also equaled career highs with 11 
assists and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little more cooperation from teammates, the senior from Cleveland High 
might have challenged the single-game assist record of 15 set by Keith Gibbs in 
1990. On several occasions, Chevalier came bolting through the lane and zipped 
a pass to an open teammate, only to watch the ball slip away and bounce out of 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Grand Canyon, Chevalier scored or assisted on nine of Northridge's 
last 11 points in the final 1 minute 24 seconds as the Matadors held on to win, 
95-84. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said Chevalier "took over" when the team needed 
it. Asked about it, Chevalier responded, "I didn't want to lose. I just did 
what I could for us to win."

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: COACH FINDS SUCCESS ON COURT AND IN CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a week when winning, losing and alpine sweaters are on our minds and 
television sets, as we succumb to that worldwide epidemic known as the Winter 
Olympics. We are all familiar with the symptoms: Sudden, yet passing interest 
in the luge, a case of instant expertise in triple salchows and a tolerance for 
watching 15-hour-old "live" sports broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, fans are also consumed by thoughts of winning and losing, though not 
much losing is going on, and sweaters are nowhere in the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 These fans are flocking to the Ventura College gym, delirious with an 
altogether different condition: Pirate Frenzy. They spend their days and nights 
rooting for the nearly unbeatable Ventura College men's basketball team, which 
is now ranked No. 1 among California community colleges and considered to be 
one of the top jaycee teams in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into last night's game, they were 29 and 2, and are drawing the largest 
crowds in the county for a regular indoor event. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is truly the only big-time sports we have in the county," said staff 
writer Jeff Meyers, who wrote this week's cover story. "There may be 
individuals -- kayakers, surfers or runners -- who do well, but this is the 
only team like it around. Ventura College may be just a little junior college, 
but the team is playing the best in the country at that level." 
</P>
<P>
 So how to account for such success? Most players, fans and school 
administrators interviewed for this story said it is no coincidence that a 
nine-season losing streak ended when coach Phil Mathews arrived on the scene in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to Meyers, Mathews is responsible for more than just promoting 
success on the court, he also wants his players to excel in the classroom. And 
Matthews knows that good players are not in junior college by choice, they 
didn't make the grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say to these kids, 'You're a big-time player out of high school, but 
you're here because you're not big-time in the classroom,' " he said. " 'We're 
going to turn that around.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In other exciting sports news around the county, Jane Hulse reports in the For 
the Kids column on the marble craze that has recently rolled into Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Marbles, it seems, were so hot at Loma Vista School in Ventura that Principal 
Rich Kirby had to ban them because they had become a disturbance.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: PARAMOUNT; PENS DRAW CRITICISM FROM COUNCIL MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council regularly pens laws to deal with problems such as gangs and 
graffiti. But at a recent meeting, the hottest topic was pens themselves: the 
blue-and-silver promotional pens that council members give residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members criticized Councilwoman Esther Corona Caldwell for 
distributing 760 of the pens over four years, at a cost of about $2.75 per pen. 
"We know for a fact she's using those (pens) to promote herself and further the 
candidates she supports," said Mayor Manuel E. Guillen, who has gone through 
200 pens since 1990. Councilman Gerald A. Mulrooney, who has distributed 200 
pens in the last four years, has threatened to propose limits on the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell said she doesn't understand all the fuss. "They're made to give away 
to our constituents," she said. "And they've got all our names on them." The 
pens are inscribed with each council member's name, and are updated and 
reordered every year. A total of 1,955 pens have been issued since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell said she learned recently that since 1990, more than 1,000 pens have 
gone unused. "If I had known there were this many unassigned pens, I would have 
gone back for more," she said. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: HUNTINGTON PARK; 3% UTILITY TAX KEPT TO FUND ADDITIONAL 
POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted to continue a 3% utility tax that has been used 
largely to pay for additional police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax, added to water, electric and telephone bills, has helped stabilize 
the city's general fund, officials said, and has allowed the Police Department 
to hire one sergeant, six officers, five jailers and two clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident and business owner Sergio Palos said the tax has been a small price 
to pay for the protection of his family. Although Palos has moved his business, 
Clockwork Printing Co., out of the city, his wife still owns a wedding 
invitation shop in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the City Council initiated the tax in October, 1992, to keep the Police 
Department fully staffed, crime has dropped, Mayor Ric Loya said. 
</P>
<P>
 To thwart vehicle thefts and curtail fake-document vendors, the Police 
Department used tax revenues to institute a bicycle patrol in the central 
business district, said Police Chief Frank Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the funds also were used to open a substation at Salt Lake Park last 
month, he said. Although the police chief said it is difficult to track drug 
dealers, transients and gang activities, he has declared the park "clean."

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; CITY TO PICK UP TRAIL OF UNLICENSED DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The manager of the city's Animal Control Bureau has a bone to pick with 
thousands of residents here. And he's about to bring in some out-of-town muscle 
to help him do it. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Roger Hatakeyama says, is unlicensed dogs. According to 
Hatakeyama's records, there were 40,000 licensed dogs in Long Beach eight years 
ago. Now, there are only about 25,000 -- and he doesn't believe all those pets 
simply left town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guesstimate there might be up to 60,000 dogs in the city and we're seeing a 
lot more strange and abandoned animals lately," Hatakeyama said. "And 
unlicensed dogs are a liability to the community because we can't tell if 
they've had rabies shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the City Council approved Hatakeyama's proposal to hire a 
County Animal Control team specializing in finding and licensing dogs. About 30 
people from the county's team will be going door-to-door, Hatakeyama said, 
trying to license pets and issuing citations to scofflaw owners. Those who 
decline to buy a $10 or $20 license will receive a citation that can carry $130 
in fines, Hatakeyama said. The lower license fee is offered for spayed or 
neutered dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the City Council's decision Feb. 1 to have the county team canvass 
neighborhoods, dog-license sales jumped dramatically, Hatakeyama said. The 
city's animal control office has sold about $1,000 worth of licenses a day, up 
from the normal $200 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement with the county, the animal control team will keep the 
first $61,000 it collects in licensing fees. After that, the city and county 
will split the revenue evenly. EMILY ADAMS

SIGHTS; BORROWING OF IMAGES ADDS TO UNIQUENESS; JANE SINCLAIR'S VENTURA COLLEGE 
SHOW COMBINES PAINTING AND PHOTOCOPIES WITH ART HISTORY DETAILS AND SNAPSHOTS 
WHILE TOYING WITH DEPTH PERCEPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the collage era, when borrowing and/or pillaging from every 
conceivable nook and cranny of the image bank -- from advertising to art 
history -- is not only acceptable practice, but fashion-mandated. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the term appropriation was anointed, it was in the very cultural 
air we breathed. Art has always nourished itself through larceny -- or by 
whatever other euphemistic name -- particularly in the 20th Century, when ideas 
and trends rage, then burn out. 
</P>
<P>
 But movements have beginnings and endings, and "appropriationism" has already 
lost much of its sting. 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't disappeared. The unassuming work of Jane Sinclair, showing at 
the New Media Gallery at Ventura College, makes no attempt to disguise its 
allegiance to the A-word. Sinclair cleverly blends Xerography and painting, 
flinging together details from art history, snapshots and other visual non 
sequiturs, while also toying with depth perception. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives her pilfered images a personal touch is her graceful, wry stitching 
process, through which her art investigates ways of seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 The currency of her show -- as suggested by its title, "Image Scavenging" -- 
doesn't detract from the emotional resonance or distinctiveness of her art. 
Hers is not a willy-nilly scavenging, but an expression of personalized visual 
data and obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, pieces of disconnected information collide, as in a dream. "Window of 
Morning/Mourning" combines a desert scene with a jail cell window, afloat in 
the outer space cosmic debris that underscores many of the pieces here. 
</P>
<P>
 Torn edges take on metaphorical weight, as evidence of the artist's almost 
improvisational, unfussy assembly. But the fact remains that Sinclair's work is 
processed, its surfaces reduced to a smooth detached sheen that denies the 
tactility of paint on canvas or the rough cut-and-paste surface of the 
collagist. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the works have a trompe l'oeil element -- usually art tools -- that 
appear to sit on top of the images. At play here is an ironic art riddle: She 
knows that we know that she knows that nobody's being fooled here. But the 
being fooled is a great tradition in art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bitter Pill," on a backdrop resembling a Currier and Ives winter scene, has a 
compositional scheme with a series of echoing ovals -- faces of inert dolls and 
art historical icons, and a spoon with a pill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinclair's seemingly casual assortments yield hints of meaning without giving 
away easy, one-shot readings. More than making coherent statements, her art 
embodies a search as she sorts through personal mementos and collective memory, 
intercut, torn and pasted. She's a scavenger with a good eye and a controlled 
palette of images. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in the college's Gallery 2, Sally Warner shows her charcoal landscapes 
from the Hudson River Valley and Ojai -- two legendary artist havens. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner's pieces, almost photo-realistic seen from a distance, have a beguiling 
simplicity with a mystery that's all in the cropping. Fragmentation and editing 
make their mark on her works, which, despite the fine detail, lean toward the 
atmospheric. 
</P>
<P>
 Thickets, river side vistas or visions of clouded sky aspire to an appealingly 
deadpan poetry. MEANWHILE, IN OJAI PROPER 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ojai Center for the Arts, Yoshihiro Youkee Nishida's show of work 
colors the main gallery with a tasteful flamboyance. 
</P>
<P>
 Festive, large, ceremonial-like paintings on burlap accent the thick, rough 
surface of the material. Biomorphic blobs, bacterial imagery and sweeping 
abstract gestures prevail, but are contained within formal devices such as 
multiple panels or underlying grids. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, subtlety is the end result. Nishida creates a happy marriage of 
control and abandon. NUDE/NAKED 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the Ojai Center are the nude studies of Elizabeth Ranelagh's show, 
"The View Outside." Her small, likably whimsical works show puffy, bulbous 
nudes lounging in natural -- but dream-like -- settings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentle sexual allegories are the general rule, with one rare polemical note in 
"Second Fiddle," in which a man plays a nude woman like a violin. 
</P>
<P>
 For further studies outside the realm of being clothed, head out to Ojai's 
Artist's Gallery, where you can find "Entirely Nude." Following hot on the 
heels of the gallery's successful erotic art show, they've decided to continue 
the trend and make clothing optional. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable works in this show include Bill Back's bizarre cartoony scenes of 
extra-human figures, and Jacquelyn Cavish's "Multiple Figures," a twisted 
tangle of breasts and other body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Whitman, normally fond of landscapes or interiors, shows an impressive, 
warm-hued portrait of a nude woman on a couch. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 3-D camp, Bryan Yancey's relief sculpture "Big Red" cagily evokes a 
nude woman in chaps, and Frank Lauran's "Standing Figure" is a cowboy 
constructivist figure that achieves a stone-like appearance from wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Christie's porcelain piece, "Divine Decadence," is an ode to an ample 
red-headed model, reclining on pillows and entirely naked to the world, and 
loving it. Details

LISTENING TO THE PAST; BLIND TWINS SHARE A SPECIAL VISION OF THE GLORY DAYS OF 
RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CARLSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John and Larry Gassman have never seen a picture of Superman. They can't. They 
were born more than two months premature, and their optic nerves never matured 
enough to allow them to see anything. 
</P>
<P>
 So they listen instead. Since childhood, the 39-year-old identical twins have 
been hooked on radio dramas, listening to shows that allow them to use their 
imaginations to follow the red-caped Man of Steel as he leaped tall buildings 
in a single bound. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our earliest memories is hearing a radio drama when we were 5 or 6," 
said John, who along with his brother has developed a zealous determination to 
never let the recordings of old-time radio dramas such as "Superman," 
"Gunsmoke" and "The Green Hornet" vanish from the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Their collection of nearly 20,000 reel-to-reel tapes of vintage shows lines 
the walls and spreads onto the floor of the family room-turned-studio in 
Whittier, from which the Gassmans produce a weekly show of classic radio drama 
for KPCC-FM (89.3) in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 John walks slowly among the stacks of tapes on the floor, some recently 
deposited on the carpet of their home by the Northridge earthquake. He puts on 
headphones as he nears a table covered in reel-to-reel tape machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, great, now I can't hear where I'm going," he mumbles, reaching his hands 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's never stopped you before," said Larry, who is already seated in 
front of his microphone. Their fingers dance deftly across the dials of their 
tape recorders and then the two launch into the introduction to their show, 
"Same Time, Same Channel" (heard Sundays from 5 to 7 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 "Got a lot of variety on the show this week," John says. He adds that the 
herniated disc that was pinching the nerves in Larry's neck has been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've found you can't play the disc (on a turntable) with acupuncture 
needles after all," John says. "So stop calling." 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a lot of nerve mentioning that," Larry quips. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is timed using a talking clock that quietly rattles off 10-second 
increments in a canned digital voice out of range of the microphones, and their 
talking watches have a crowing-rooster alarm to stop them from running over. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers still make their tapes on reel-to-reel recorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder to use the new tape recorders," Larry says. "We've always had to 
do everything by feel and sound, and the new buttons don't make any noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of their collection is taped from records donated by radio drama stars, 
such as the late Vincent Price, John Gassman says. The 16-inch discs captured 
about 15 minutes of performance on each side of an aluminum-based record. 
During World War II, such records were made on glass to save the metal for the 
war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put ads in the papers when we started collecting, and word spread from 
word of mouth that we wanted the recordings," John says. "People are usually 
glad to give (the records) to us because we have the turntables to play them 
and the equipment to preserve the discs," which are very fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 KPCC is a public radio station broadcasting from Pasadena City College, so the 
brothers do their show for free. They get by on Social Security and a little 
money they make from singing with a local barbershop quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gassmans started playing records at Rio Hondo College in the early 1970s. 
After earning degrees in communications from Cal Poly Pomona, they got their 
chance to fill the radio drama slot at KPCC in 1980 after an announcer moved to 
Arizona. They've been spinning stacks of old records ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're remarkable guys, and their knowledge and love of radio as an art form 
is just very special" said KPCC Program and news director Larry Mantle, who has 
worked with the Gassmans for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Gassmans) appreciate a lot of things that made radio exciting before 
market-driven companies got into it," Mantle said. "So much of what we hear 
today on radio is commercialized and dull." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that radio drama is making it big-time. Arbitron ratings show that they 
attract about 15,000 listeners during their two-hour broadcasts. By comparison, 
KLSX's Howard Stern pulls in about 1.2 million listeners each morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gassmans continued to break new ground when they covered the Rose Parade 
for KPCC from 1987 to 1989. Their broadcasts, which won an advertising industry 
award, were the result of tours of the floats in which they were allowed to 
clamber all over the petal-covered creations and literally feel their sizes, 
shapes and textures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really popular because we described all the floats in detail, and 
nobody does that anymore on TV," John said.

COMPTON MAYOR WANTS HIS JOB, COUNCIL POSTS CONVERTED TO FULL TIME; POLITICS: 
BRADLEY SAYS PART-TIME WORK WON'T FIX CITY PROBLEMS. HE LOBBIES FOR MORE POWER, 
HEFTY PAY RAISES.

<P>
 Compton Mayor Omar Bradley is tired of getting part-time pay for a job he said 
is full-time work and more. 
</P>
<P>
 So with a little help from voters, he wants to remake city government, giving 
the mayor more power and making the mayor and council jobs full time, with 
hefty pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley proposed Tuesday night that city staff draw up an ordinance for the 
June 7 ballot that would reorganize the City Council, removing the mayor as one 
of the five council members and creating another council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor would set the council agenda -- now the responsibility of the city 
manager -- and would have strong veto powers. It would take a vote of four of 
the five council members to override a mayoral veto. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Bradley's proposal, the mayor's salary would more than double, from 
$32,000 to $75,000, and council salaries would jump to $40,000 from $22,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided to hold a workshop Monday to discuss the plan, but Bradley 
said he is confident it will be approved for the June 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are swamped with problems here," said Bradley, an English teacher at 
Lynwood High School. "And those problems need a full-time council to correct 
them. I can't be leaving my classroom every time there's a fire . . . to be put 
out." Bradley was elected mayor seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Marcine B. Shaw and Yvonne Arceneaux stressed they were voting 
only in favor of discussing the proposal further. "I have some questions on 
this," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Compton mayors run for office and hold one of the five council seats. Although 
mayoral campaigns are often bitter, the position is largely ceremonial. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 riots, council members concluded that then-Mayor Walter R. 
Tucker III was attracting too much attention and banned the mayor from holding 
news conferences or issuing news releases on his own. Tucker later was elected 
to the U.S. House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In most other area cities the mayor is picked from among council members, who 
pass around the title every year.

CITY FUNDING FOR CAMPAIGNS PUT ON BALLOT; POLITICS: A DIVIDED LONG BEACH 
COUNCIL APPROVES THE PROPOSAL DESIGNED TO LIMIT ELECTION SPENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach voters will decide in June if they want to help finance campaigns 
and limit spending in city elections, which backers say would help level the 
playing field in local races. 
</P>
<P>
 A divided City Council approved the campaign reform proposal, sponsored 
chiefly by Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal. The measure, similar to a reform plan 
enacted in Los Angeles, would provide matching funds and limit contributions 
from individuals, corporations or political action committees. Candidates' 
participation would be voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ecstatic the council agreed to this," Lowenthal said after Tuesday's 5-4 
vote. "It's very hard for them, with their great advantage as incumbents, to 
limit themselves as to when and how they could raise money." 
</P>
<P>
 The reform plan would have to be approved by a majority of voters June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Council hopefuls could spend no more than $40,000 during a primary campaign 
and $20,000 in a runoff. Contenders for other citywide offices, such as 
prosecutor or auditor, would be limited to $100,000 for primaries and $50,000 
in runoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral candidates face primary limits of $200,000, and would be limited to 
$100,000 for a runoff. The new limits would be a fraction of what Mayor Ernie 
Kell spent to win reelection in 1990. In that election, in which he edged 
Councilman Thomas J. Clark, Kell spent $580,000, a record for a city election. 
He outspent his opponent 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed measure, individual contributions would be limited to $500 
in the mayor's race and $250 in council races, forcing candidates to reach out 
to a wider network of supporters rather than relying on a few wealthy 
contributors, Lowenthal reasoned. Large contributors presumably would have less 
influence on city government as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, candidates would not be allowed to begin raising money until 15 months 
before an election. The time limit is aimed at cutting down on campaign war 
chests. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide matching funds for qualified candidates, the reform act would 
create a separate Clean Government Fund and solicit donations from citizens in 
monthly utility bills. If voluntary contributions fell short, the city's 
general fund would make up the difference, Lowenthal said.  
</P>
<P>
 According to estimates from City Auditor Gary L. Burroughs, the city would 
need about $228,000 a year to offer matching funds to all candidates in a 
four-year election cycle. The fund would also pay for a full-time administrator 
in the City Clerk's office to oversee the program. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lowenthal and his supporters lauded their decision as an opportunity to 
control campaign spending, detractors blasted the act, saying the city couldn't 
afford to subsidize politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the people will support this," said Councilwoman Doris 
Topsy-Elvord.  
</P>
<P>
 "They won't even tax themselves to get additional police officers, and I 
certainly don't think they will want to pay for this," Topsy-Elvord said, 
referring to the 1992 defeat of a ballot measure to raise property taxes in 
order to hire 100 additional police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Others opposing the ballot measure were Vice Mayor Jeffrey A. Kellogg and 
Councilmen Douglas S. Drummond and Les Robbins. Councilmen Clark, Warren 
Harwood, Evan Anderson Braude and Ray Grabinski joined Lowenthal in supporting 
the measure. Mayor Ernie Kell, who doesn't have a vote on the council, also 
expressed support. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral candidates would have to raise at least $20,000 and City Council 
candidates $5,000 to qualify for matching funds. Candidates for other city 
offices would have to raise at least $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who meet the requirements would receive $1 for every $2 they raise, up 
to one-third of the spending ceiling. In runoff elections, the city would match 
every $1, up to half of the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 In primary elections, for example, mayoral contenders could receive as much as 
$66,666 in matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance also carries penalties for candidates who break the 
rules. Violators could be charged with a misdemeanor, fined up to $500 and 
sentenced to six months in jail.  
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would not affect candidates who refuse matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone doesn't take public money, we can't control their spending," 
Lowenthal said. "That's the law."

NIGHT LIFE: L.A. BAND RE-CREATING OWN 'STONED AGE ROCK' SOUND; I LOVE YOU WILL 
GIVE ITS DEBUT PERFORMANCE FRIDAY AT THE METRO BAY CLUB IN VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Among those three little words that count are "Pass the spuds," "Gimme a beer" 
and "Just shut up," along with other half-witticisms from when brevity was 
king. At Geffen records, the important three little words come in triplicate: 
Guns N' Roses, Teenage Fan Club and I Love You. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Orlando, Fla., I Love You relocated to L.A. in 1987 and got signed 
within six months. That's probably because they're smarter than most bands. I 
Love You has toured incessantly, mostly without the benefit of label support. 
</P>
<P>
 Their third album, "All of Us," is out on Geffen. I Love You, who probably 
should have played on Valentine's Day, will instead make their Poinsettia City 
debut Friday night at the Metro Bay Club. Slam Alice will open. 
</P>
<P>
 The I Love You boys include singer Chris Palmer, guitarist Jeff Nolan, bassist 
Mike Kossler and drummer Tom Sweet. Together, they play a lot of songs about 
smoking illegal substances and getting in touch with those vibes that are near 
and dear to the groovy among us. The bio calls it "Stoned Age rock for the 
'90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer discussed his favorite band during a recent phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 How's "All Of Us" doing? 
</P>
<P>
 It's doing OK, I guess. It just came out a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there an L.A. scene these days? 
</P>
<P>
 It's kinda scattered right now. I don't think there's really been a scene here 
since Jane's Addiction. When we play in L.A., it's usually for our label, and 
so the first three rows are industry people staring at us, and talking among 
themselves about how the earthquake knocked over their computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you remember your first L.A. gig? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, we played at Madame Wong's. We had a couple of different guys in the 
band then and played a lot of different songs that we don't do now. I'd try and 
act like Jim Morrison and be cool and sexy. But really, I'm a writer, then a 
performer and, last, a singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think bands have to play L.A. to get signed? 
</P>
<P>
 We did, but I don't think you have to anymore. I think a band in a smaller 
city needs to develop their own scene where everyone goes to see each other's 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Florida rock? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, before we came out here in 1987, we used to call Orlando "Borelando" or 
"Snorelando." Florida is actually very strange. There's a lot of cover bands. 
We were the only band that didn't sound like Journey. 
</P>
<P>
 How did your musical career get going? 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff and I have known each other since seventh grade, or about 16 years. We 
just started jamming in my garage trying to play Led Zeppelin and Blue Oyster 
Cult songs without freaking out the parents or the neighbors. We were just a 
total woodshed band, a pretty hard-core thrash band. We thought if it was fast, 
it was good. At first we were the Sinful Pigeons before we became I Love You. 
We got both names out of a single Blue Oyster Cult song. 
</P>
<P>
 How did I Love you get signed? 
</P>
<P>
 We had a song on an SST (label) compilation, a cover of "Burning Love" by 
Elvis. There was this SST showcase, and one of the bands, Trotsky's Icepick, 
couldn't make it, so they called us. A guy from Geffen was there and six months 
later, we got signed. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Southern Rock and how does I Love You fit into all that? 
</P>
<P>
 We're psychedelic Southern Rock, I guess, but I'm hoping for the day when 
music will just be called music again. 
</P>
<P>
 You have a song named after a "Star Trek" episode and lots of songs about 
getting high. Do you guys have that groovy, hippie, peace-love vibe? 
</P>
<P>
 There is a new spirituality going on in the '90s, but all the terms from the 
'60s like hippies and freaks don't apply anymore. Someone needs to invent a new 
term. There's a gigantic weed leaf on our T-shirts, but my parents don't think 
I smoke anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the songwriting process for I Love You? 
</P>
<P>
 The guys will improvise something, for example, in the key of E. It'll have 
maybe six parts and they'll arrange it into a song. I write the words and use 
total wordplay, which probably makes no sense unless you listen to a song about 
60 times. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you get the Chili Peppers tour? 
</P>
<P>
 We heard the Chili Peppers were gonna do this two-week tour and end up in 
Florida to play spring break. We heard about the tour first and called all the 
promoters and told them we'd save them money by bringing the equipment. We told 
them we were great friends of the Chili Peppers and would open for five hundred 
bucks. We didn't even know those guys, but it worked with nine out of 10 of the 
promoters. So every night we kept showing up and they kept using our gear. We 
just totally scammed the whole thing. We've done eight tours and have only been 
a signed band on one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 You guys had a song on a "Married With Children" episode. Did you get to meet 
Christina Applegate? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, long story. Back in 1989 or 1990 when she was still underage, one of our 
friends used to go out with one of her girlfriends who asked us if we wanted 
her autograph. Instead, Christina ended up with one of our tapes and invited us 
to the show. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't see her much anymore. Now we just go hang out with Pearl Jam because 
everyone hangs out with them, too. Winona Ryder and Christina are always there. 
</P>
<P>
 You guys used to play with Pearl Jam? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, lots of times. We were with them on their first tour when they used to 
play to about 20 people per show, and Eddie (Vedder) used to come up and sing 
about half our songs. We had to beg Geffen to let us go out with them. 
</P>
<P>

 Do a lot of touring, get back on the road. Details

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: CARLENE CARTER BRINGING HER 'LITTLE LOVE LETTERS' TO VENTURA; 
APPEARANCE WILL KICK OFF THE WELL-KNOWN SINGER'S TOUR TO PROMOTE HER LATEST 
ALBUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura Concert Theatre should be movin' and a-shakin' Saturday night when 
Carlene Carter, 1991 Academy of Country Music best female vocalist nominee, 
brings her infectious rock-a-billy sound to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the success of her first solo country album, "I Fell in Love," in 
1990, Carter's debut appearance in Ventura County will kick off her tour for 
"Little Love Letters," produced by Howie Epstein (of Tom Petty and the 
Heartbreakers) on the Giant label. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter wrote or collaborated on all but "Unbreakable Heart" on this record, 
which has generated several hit singles. But this "overnight success" is the 
hard-won result of a recording career that began in the '70s, and was seasoned 
by a teen-age marriage, motherhood and an apprenticeship in the 1980s British 
progressive country-rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old singer and third-generation member of the legendary Carter 
family has augmented her reputation as a fashion plate with new respect as a 
songwriter. And Carter and country have finally met in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's part of what we discussed when Carter called me from her home in Los 
Angeles last week. 
</P>
<P>
 With your mountain music heritage, why the delay in returning to those musical 
roots? 
</P>
<P>
 There's an energy level in my records, which women in country were always 
supposed to shy away from. And I've always enjoyed performing because I had the 
freedom to portray a song the way I feel. And I couldn't be one of these ladies 
who stood still in the middle of the stage behind the microphone wearing a 
high-necked granny dress and singin' about how her man had left her and she was 
never gonna get over it. I never believed that -- you can get over it. And it 
took country a long time to come around to my way of thinking -- that girls can 
have fun too. That's why I can be feisty on stage. We basically can hold our 
own with men in the performance arena. 
</P>
<P>
 You said that seeing K. T. Oslin perform in Nashville had a lot to do with 
your decision to pursue a country career. Explain. 
</P>
<P>
 She had such a handle on women. I thought, "I can understand that and write 
about that." Maybe there is a place for me in this. So I hooked up with Howie 
to collaborate on songs and to try to get a record deal together. We were the 
perfect pairing. He knew how to get me across on recordings as I really was. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the collaboration, you said the message in the lyrics comes from 
you. How does that apply to the new album, which has been called a 
"quintessential country-rock love album?" 
</P>
<P>
 Most of "Little Love Letters" is a roller-coaster of emotion. You're 
over-the-top happy or a little peeved at your sweetheart and trying to 
straighten him up. Or it deals with the ending of past relationships -- not 
what is happening now, because I'm really happy. But you can't write a whole 
album about how happy you are. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think that your style has helped to attract younger listeners and a 
wider audience to country? 
</P>
<P>
 I like to think so. But I do what pleases myself and hopefully it's gonna 
please everyone else. Radios like what I do. But sometimes there is resistance 
that it's too "pop." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you do seem to enjoy projecting a contrary, in-your-face image in 
everything from your clothes to music. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been wearing the same things since the '60s. I always liked the miniskirt 
routine and I never wavered. Even when people said, "That's not in," I felt 
comfortable in that and I looked at it as my uniform. Now I've got a lot of 
young fans -- 5-year-olds whose parents show up at my concerts with little 
girls dressed like me and with their hair done like mine. I love it. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'd actually like to be on "Sesame Street" because I love kids. And 'cuz 
everyone who's been on it is really a huge star. Then I'd think I've finally 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 As a singer-songwriter-musician, which aspect of the business do you enjoy the 
most? 
</P>
<P>
 It varies from day to day. I enjoy the writing because it gives me something 
to perform. I like performing because I get to do my songs. One thing I love 
about performing is I can see the reactions on people's faces. And I can tell 
if I'm doing my job right.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LYNWOOD; CHAVEZ REELECTED TO SCHOOL BOARD POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynwood Unified school board member Rachel Chavez won a second term this week, 
defeating board President Joe T. Battle in a special runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, 55, a homemaker and the only Latina on the board, outpolled Battle, 
403 to 334, for a seat on the five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomer Laura M. Byrd won a seat in the Nov. 2 election when she emerged as 
the top vote-getter in the race for two seats, but Battle and Chavez were 
forced into a runoff when each received 1,281 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both incumbents continued to serve after the Nov. 2 deadlock, creating a 
six-member board. Battle, who has served three terms, was not available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The election garnered little attention among Lynwood voters.

 Blamed in Pet Store Fire 
</P>
<P>
 An accumulation of cardboard boxes and other paper materials near an 
electrical panel caused a weekend fire that killed more than 150 animals at a 
pet store, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals died from smoke inhalation after the small blaze started at Pet 
City, 7804 Florence Ave. The flames were extinguished quickly by firefighters, 
but it was too late to save seven puppies, a cat, an Amazon parrot, nearly 40 
hamsters, about 50 mice, and various other birds, snakes and fish. Only a few 
puppies and a kitten at the front of the store survived.

 Compton school officials ordered round-the-clock security and scrambled to 
find space for students at Whaley Middle School this week after a fire damaged 
two rooms and destroyed scores of textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire early Sunday was the fourth at Whaley this school year, and all 
apparently were set deliberately, school and fire officials said.The four fires 
have damaged 11 classrooms, causing about $1.3 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Security guards will patrol the school around the clock the rest of the school 
year, Principal W. Chas. Littles said.  
</P>
<P>
 Students were sent home at midday Monday so that officials could inspect the 
damage and air out four smoke-filled classrooms. Classes resumed Tuesday, but 
some students were reassigned to other rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 Two portable units will be added to the campus later this month, Littles said. 
The school district had set up four portable classrooms at Whaley to replace 
rooms damaged in the other three fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Charles Bradley said the fires have damaged two of his classrooms this 
year. "I have to pray from the time I leave my house to the parking lot," he 
said. "I never know what to expect when I get here." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to an 
arrest in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The last school year at Whaley was marred by a series of student clashes and 
parent protests over what they termed deplorable conditions. PSYCHE PASCUAL

 More than half a century ago, when movies were glamorous fantasies, the good 
guys always triumphed and lovers lived happily ever after, Buddy Ebsen, hoofer 
and actor, began his career in show business. 
</P>
<P>
 Following roles on Broadway, Ebsen worked in dozens of Hollywood films and is 
famous for his character leads in two television series, "The Beverly 
Hillbillies" and "Barnaby Jones." He also did character parts early in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the videos I pop into my VCR occasionally is the 1938 musical, "Girl of 
the Golden West," starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, which features a 
winning performance by Ebsen. 
</P>
<P>
 In his autobiography, "The Other Side of Oz," just released by Donovan 
Publishing, the 85-year-old actor tells the story of his extraordinary career 
and gives a behind-the-glitter look at Hollywood. Ebsen will be at the Phantom 
Bookshop, 451 E. Main St., Ventura, from 1 to 4 p.m. Friday. It is only one of 
three appearances he will make in Southern California.

 It doesn't attract screaming crowds or lots of press coverage, but it is alive 
and well and infiltrating many local schools. It's California Poets in the 
Schools, a joint project of the Artists-in-the-Schools Program (of the National 
Endowment for the Arts) and the California Arts Council, which has been in 
place since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Savren coordinates the program for Ventura County. Her task is to find 
professional, published poets who will conduct workshops in public and private 
schools and for youngsters incarcerated in juvenile halls. 
</P>
<P>
 The poet/teachers are given special training for 10 weeks. Savren seeks ethnic 
diversity and is eager to hear from published African-American, Latino, Native 
American and Asian poets who are interested in teaching youngsters to read and 
write poetry. Contact her at 986-5800, Ext. 1951 or 644-8724.

COVER STORY; SCRAPPING HISTORY; PRESERVATIONISTS FIGHT TO KEEP A VESTIGE OF 
CITY'S PAST AS MORE BUILDINGS FACE QUAKE RETROFITTING DEADLINES 
</P>

 When the Barker Brothers furniture company decided to open a main branch in 
Long Beach, the company erected a solid, eight-story Art Deco hulk that was 
made to last. The 78-year-old building, a local historic landmark with 
understated accents of zigzags and octagons, sits empty now, boarded up, 
lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The furniture store went out of business years ago. The downtown building, a 
relic from a golden age of prosperity and architecture in Long Beach, faces 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure is one of at least seven landmark buildings that may tumble 
because they don't comply with the city's seismic-safety ordinance, one of the 
toughest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 These buildings generally weathered the devastating 1933 Long Beach earthquake 
-- and later quakes -- with little or no damage.  
</P>
<P>
 But they weren't built to comply with modern building codes. Most of the 
buildings are under a June deadline to be "retrofitted," that is, strengthened 
to withstand a powerful earthquake. Otherwise, the buildings must be torn down. 
City officials said they would like tosave all the old buildings, but that it 
is more important to save lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the buildings come down, they will join a long list of local landmarks 
that remain only in residents' memories or as images in faded black-and-white 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a terrible crisis," said Kaye Briegel, a local historian. "If they tear 
down all of those buildings, downtown Long Beach is going to look like the area 
around the Los Angeles airport -- just a whole bunch of new buildings that 
don't have much character." 
</P>
<P>
 "All these buildings can be saved," she added. "I don't know what the rush 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents and preservationists see these landmarks as vestiges of a 
glorious era, from about 1915 to 1935, when Long Beach was a vibrant boom town 
fueled by the lure of wide, sparkling beaches and an oil strike in nearby 
Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 A mini-metropolis grew up around beachside resort hotels and oil company 
headquarters. Developers built office and apartment building condominiums, a 
pioneering concept on the West Coast. The office buildings included locker 
rooms where businessmen could shower and change for lunchtime ocean swims 
before returning to their boardrooms. The middle class strolled along the Pike, 
a beachside amusement park, and patronized vaudeville and movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The boom coincided with a highly regarded period in American architecture. The 
downtown became an interwoven fabric of whimsical Renaissance revival 
structures, bold Art Deco buildings and later, Depression-era art moderne. 
Noted architects left their mark not only on schools, veterans memorials and 
auditoriums, but also on bathhouses, automobile showrooms, dance halls and even 
skating rinks. Julia Morgan, the famed architect who designed the Hearst 
Castle, designed the local YWCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Many notable buildings, like the YWCA, fell victim to later development. 
Preservationists want to save what's left, including buildings threatened by 
seismic-safety concerns, such as the Barker Brothers building on the Promenade, 
the S. H. Kress building on Pine Avenue, and the Masonic Temple on Locust 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barker Brothers building was doomed when its owners decided that 
demolition was a better alternative, financially, than preservation. The city 
has already issued a demolition permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kress building probably has been saved, thanks to city assistance and a 
creative owner with an interest in preserving history. 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old Masonic Temple faces destruction because its cash-strapped 
owner cannot afford the required repairs. Jack Simmons needs about $100,000 to 
strengthen his 120,000-square-foot building. The problem is persuading anyone 
that he could repay the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, a retired actor-producer-investor, has already missed a Feb. 2 
deadline for submitting to the city retrofitting plans for his monolith -- a 
block-shaped building with seven stories above ground and two stories below. 
Simmons, who is battling cancer, can't even keep up with changing all the light 
bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Shattered bulbs sit in their sockets under the frayed red canopy where he 
greets visitors near the once-grand entrance. The imposing facade is studded 
with six granite columns that rise 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Two rows of columns line the three-story lobby, with its doors and door frames 
of Honduran mahogany. Brass trimming is built into the floor. The building 
contains seven massive ballroom-theaters, each covering at least 7,000 square 
feet; each with a different theme. In one ballroom, a mural of a South American 
village covers all four walls. Another room has Art Deco styling, a third is 
more Roman in flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-floor theater could accommodate a full-scale production, with a loft 
that rises at least 30 feet above the stage. A pipe organ is in the balcony. 
Its massive pipes rise from the floor to the ceiling in two anterooms on each 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first bought the building, my engineer went down below and checked the 
foundation," Simmons said. "When he came out he says, 'Damn, the Masons must 
have thought they would live 10,000 years, because this building will last 
10,000 years." 
</P>
<P>
 After the decline of the local Masonic movement, the building became home to a 
succession of dance halls, dance schools and catering operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons purchased the property in 1976 with the dream of creating a nonprofit 
community arts center dedicated to the memory of actor James Dean. Simmons, 60, 
played a small role alongside Dean in the 1955 film "Rebel Without a Cause." 
</P>
<P>
 But Simmons has rarely unlocked the boarded-up front entrance the last two 
decades, except for when movie producers call. Simmons estimates that 70 to 80 
films, mostly low-budget productions, have been shot there. 
</P>
<P>
 The basement theater still features the bandstand and Egyptian-style facade 
used for the dance-hall scenes in the 1985 movie "Swing Shift." In the corner 
of another ballroom is a movie set draped entirely with brown and black plastic 
garbage bags, one director's notion of hell. 
</P>
<P>
 When vandals began to hit the building, Simmons arranged for around-the-clock 
security. But he concedes that the building has received little care in other 
respects. 
</P>
<P>
 "This building could be used for a college, an elementary school, an 
undertaking parlor, swap meet, antique mall, movie theaters or playhouses. I 
have a list of 40 uses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His fear is that the building could become a pile of rubble.  
</P>
<P>
 Developer Peter Janopaul has probably saved the building he owns, the old S. 
H. Kress department store, at the southwest corner of Pine Avenue and 5th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Janopaul has begun an $8-million renovation of the 107,000-square-foot 
building into 49 condominium lofts, the first such conversion of an old 
commercial building in the city. The lofts will be priced from about $150,000 
to $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The 71-year-old Kress building was facing imminent demolition when Janopaul 
acquired it in November, 1992. The building had no windows and no roof. Most of 
the partitions were down. A 1957 "modernization" had stripped the terra-cotta 
statues, columns and other prized architectural details from the first three 
floors. In the late 1980s, a different owner virtually gutted the building 
during an aborted renovation.  
</P>
<P>
 And the superstructure needed more than $1 million of seismic retrofitting. 
That process required building a steel-reinforced, basement-to-ceiling support 
wall and providing horizontal bracing on each floor for the brick side walls.  
</P>
<P>
 Janopaul thought the Kress could and should join the list of Pine Avenue 
landmarks that have been saved, including the Farmers and Merchants Bank 
building (1922), and the Enloe Building (1906), where seismic bracing has been 
incorporated into the design of a ground-floor restaurant.  
</P>
<P>
 Janopaul's track record for successful historical renovation in Denver finally 
persuaded Long Beach officials to help him. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the city allotted Janopaul $1.4 million from $20.5 million in bonds 
issued to help Long Beach building owners retrofit their properties. The bond 
money must be repaid like a loan, but such a loan would have been nearly 
impossible to obtain from private lenders, Janopaul said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a fee, the city also was willing to insure 30% of Janopaul's construction 
loan, making the investment less risky for a private lender. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all investors have found a formula to save their structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for the Barker Brothers building is the wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The building never particularly impressed property manager Richard F. Brewer. 
Its simple Art Deco lines seem too plain and the building bears the scars of an 
ill-conceived first-floor modernization and the removal of a rooftop cornice.  
</P>
<P>
 But economics, not aesthetics, is the driving consideration for Brewer, who 
manages the property for Long Beach Plaza Associates, a Switzerland-based 
investment group. Plaza Associates purchased the property 12 years ago at the 
end of a real-estate boom, but was never able to develop the site.  
</P>
<P>
 With his investors unwilling to pay for retrofitting, Brewer has to tear down 
the building or face criminal charges. Brewer estimates that the seismic 
retrofitting would cost about $250,000. The city's latest estimate is $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In cities with less-stringent seismic standards, the Barker Brothers building 
might pass muster, city officials said. It is made of steel-reinforced concrete 
-- much sturdier than unreinforced masonry buildings that have been the main 
targets for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1990 engineer's report said that the building needed only "minimal 
strengthening": cleaning and patching cracks in the concrete and installing 
support walls on the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It rode through the 1933 earthquake in Long Beach beautifully," Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
 That earthquake killed more than 100 people and caused more than $40 million 
in damage. It also prompted Long Beach and other cities to adopt sweeping 
seismic safety standards for new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s, the Long Beach building department used the building code to 
strengthen older buildings by citing them as substandard, said Building and 
Safety Supt. Eugene Zeller. This practice became official city policy in 1971 
with passage of the city's seismic-safety ordinance. The ordinance was modified 
later to apply to all buildings completed prior to 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations established a 20-year timetable to strengthen or tear down 936 
buildings with seismic deficiencies. To date, 467 buildings have been 
strengthened and 353 demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a heroic effort," Zeller said. "After an earthquake, interest in 
seismic safety decays over time. And to put buildings out of service is costly 
and sometimes politically sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fully expect the Barker Brothers building is going to be demolished," 
Zeller added. The seismic safety program "is causing the owner to make a 
decision because he's under a mandate to do so. Without the program, the owner 
may have let the building sit for an extended period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Promenade from Barker Brothers sits the Insurance Exchange, a 
landmark of a similar size and age. The building has terra-cotta sculpturing on 
two sides, including a treatment of children playing sports. The Middoughs 
family, which erected the building, were sports enthusiasts who installed a gym 
on the top floor. The Middoughs operated their men's and boys' clothing store 
on the ground floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of its own seismic-safety problems, the Insurance Exchange also is 
nearly empty, save for basement and ground-floor tenants. The seven-story 
building also faces demolition unless its owners can secure financing to 
strengthen it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Insurance Exchange and Barker Brothers buildings stand at the intersection 
of the Promenade and Broadway like portals to an earlier era. Broadway and 
nearby Pine Avenue were once the heart of a thriving commercial center. Barker 
Brothers needed not only its eight floors, but a basement and an annex across 
the street to hold its merchandise. Banks erected high-rise monuments to 
commerce while department stores and five-and-dimes constructed expansive, 
multilevel showrooms. And everyone thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the buildings from that era have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1933 earthquake rattled many to the ground, but perhaps the greatest loss 
of landmarks occurred between the late 1960s and the mid-1980s. City leaders 
razed some structures to make way for civic buildings that critics describe as 
functional but less striking. To revive a slumbering downtown, officials 
allowed developers to clear away old buildings to make way for new projects 
including a convention center, an expanded harbor and a modern, high-rise 
skyline of hotels and office buildings along Ocean Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all the plans panned out. The Barker Brothers and Insurance Exchange 
buildings loom like lonely sentinels over an intersection with all the life of 
a ghost town. Parking lots occupy most of the surrounding parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Barker Brothers is demolished, that land too will become a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect worries Ruthann Lehrer, the city's historic preservation officer. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "The more vacant lots you have, the more desolate and abandoned your downtown 
looks," she said. "When you have an existing building, you can put something in 
it in a year or two if you have the money. Once you have a vacant lot, it takes 
an awful long time to put something on it." 
</P>
<P>
 But her concern is more than economic. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an architectural guide to Southern California, printed in the mid-1970s, 
almost all of the buildings identified as architecturally significant in Long 
Beach are gone today.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a critical point. If we were to lose these buildings now, we'd lose 
a sense of the city's development over time. We'd lose our roots, our history."

LAVA AND THE HOT ROCKS READY TO ERUPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Gonzalezes were tired of waiting for fame and fortune to arrive for their 
family band. So tired that they decided to create their own fame using their 
own fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 After refinancing their Maywood home and taking the money that Hector Gonzalez 
received from a company buyout, the family independently produced Lava and the 
Hot Rocks' first commercial album last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Their gamble may have paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated with being denied by several record labels, Hector, 40, his wife, 
Miroslava (Lava), 38, and their son, Alex, 18, changed the band's eclectic 
style to alternative adult contemporary. And with their first, 
soon-to-be-released album, "You Damn Mexicans Are Too Loud," the band has found 
its niche. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard to get into the Mexican market because they don't consider us 
Latin. Even being of Mexican American heritage, we weren't recognized because 
we aren't immigrants," Hector Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The band began its tumultuous journey through the Los Angeles music scene 13 
years ago after Hector Gonzalez's barber introduced him to an attorney who 
recommended their demo album to former concert promoter Jerry Rissmiller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Musically they knocked me out," said Rissmiller, who agreed to become their 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 He said their blend of Latin elements and big-band sound leads to a bluesy 
jazz beat that is commercial and unique in a world where it is "very difficult 
to get air play on any radio station, regardless of ethnicity." 
</P>
<P>
 With Hector on bass, Alex on drums and Lava on vocals, the group also features 
Mel Steinberg, 44, on saxophone, Alfred Ortiz, 23, on percussion and Karl 
Carrasco, 41, on keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The family writes songs by improvisation. Hector Gonzalez said he comes up 
with a rhythm and runs it by his son, who adds his ideas. Then they tape the 
piece and give it to Lava Gonzalez to write the melody and the lyrics.  
</P>
<P>
 Hector Gonzales describes themes for the band's songs as "home-grown." Lava 
Gonzalez said the bluesy songs she sings offer a unique way to discuss life: 
tales of love, war, pain and relationships. Many of their songs are inspired by 
her heritage -- she was born in Chinipas, Mexico, and moved to the United 
States when she was 1 -- and by the family's attempts to make it to the big 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Gonzalez, who won an Emmy Award as a sound engineer for his work on the 
1984 Olympic Games coverage, said his connections at ABC and CBS allowed the 
band to make money while it looked for its niche. Those contacts and some 
late-night club gigs gave the band exposure during an Academy Awards wrap party 
and other industry get-togethers. 
</P>
<P>
 The band has a busy summer schedule, starting in June with the Troubadours of 
Folk festival at UCLA. As part of the festival, the band will travel with 35 
other acts to Scandinavia and the Virgin Islands. And in August, Lava and the 
Hot Rocks will join five other groups on a three-month, 30-city tour. One of 
the band's upcoming local outings will be Friday at a Red Cross earthquake 
relief benefit at the Reseda Country Club.

JAUNTS; WALK ON THE WILD SIDE FOR THE DISABLED, BLIND; FINAL TOUCHES ARE BEING 
PUT ON SPECIAL QUARTER-MILE TRAIL IN THOUSAND OAKS. IT'S ALSO IDEAL FOR 
STROLLERS AND YOUNG HIKERS TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For wheelchair users and the blind, a simple walk in the woods is usually out 
of the question. But a special trail in Thousand Oaks is changing all that. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of setbacks and delays, the Oak Creek Canyon Whole Access Trail 
is getting its final touches. Sixteen signs in Braille are expected to be in 
place along the quarter-mile trail this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, it will be in time for a docent-led hike on the trail Monday, 
Presidents' Day, from 9 to 10 a.m. The group will meet at the trail head, near 
the Arts Council Center, at the end of Greenmeadow Drive off Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't a jaunt just for wheelchair users or the blind. The trail is ideal 
for strollers or for little hikers who get tuckered easily. Nor is it a 
hands-off experience. Along the way, the group will touch the acorns of the 
scrub oak tree, for instance, or smell the leaves of the black sage bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail is like a shady glen, canopied by big oak trees that let the sun 
peek through. Here, grass and bushes thrive between the canyon walls. Birds 
sing and animals skitter through the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail is designed to give disabled people a sense of independence in a 
kind of mini-wilderness setting. The four-foot-wide trail looks and feels like 
a hard, dirt path, but actually it's a special kind of granite that gives 
wheelchair users a smooth, stable ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't appreciate this unless you're in a wheelchair," said Mike Taylor of 
Thousand Oaks, who relies on one because of a spinal problem. Without such a 
trail, there is no way for wheelchair users to go into the woods, he said. 
Here, "you feel like you are in the wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
 Bordering the trail is a split-rail fence. Just below the top rail is a guide 
cable for blind people to grasp as they walk. Along the way are Braille signs 
that tell hikers what trees, plants and animals inhabit the area. They even 
tell hikers how many feet they must walk to reach out and touch an oak tree -- 
or where they should not reach out because of poison oak. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two picnic tables -- wide enough for wheelchairs -- on the trail. A 
restroom for wheelchair users is at the trail head, along with a special 
drinking fountain and four slots for handicapped parking. 
</P>
<P>
 People with disabilities and organizations that assist them participated in 
design of the trail, which ultimately cost $80,000 to construct, said Mark 
Towne, an assistant planner with the Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency. 
COSCA, which developed the trail, is a joint powers agency of the Conejo 
Recreation and Park District and the city of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a challenge, but we're happy with the final product," Towne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenge is an understatement. First, 300 feet of the vinyl-wrapped steel 
guide cable for the blind walkers was stolen in April and had to be replaced. 
Then the restroom was sent back because it wasn't suitably equipped for the 
handicapped. Heavy rain last spring further delayed opening of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Green Meadow fire late last year blistered the restroom and scorched 
some of the trees at the bottom of the trail. Finally, the Braille signs had to 
be redone because the dots were flaking off. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the trail has been open to hikers for months. Horseback riders 
and bicyclists are permitted to use the trail, but they must stay on the 
unimproved side of the fence. The trail links up with Los Robles Trail, which 
stretches from Newbury Park on the west almost to Westlake Village on the east.

 ON THE RUN 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly High, which won its second consecutive CIF state girls track 
and field title last season, will have eight individuals and three relay teams 
competing in the high school portion of the 35th Sunkist Invitational indoor 
meet at 12:15 p.m. Saturday at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly is one of 15 schools from the Southeast/Long Beach area that will compete 
in the meet, which features many of the nation's top performers.

 The Jackrabbits are expected to be led by Pam Simpson in the 500-yard run and 
the long jump. Other Poly athletes competing include Andrea Anderson in the 
50-meter run, Aminah Haddad in the 500, Sherron Rhetta and Shanda McGinest in 
the 880, Erin O'Keefe in the rated mile and Savant Williams in the high jump.

 Before arriving at Long Beach, Radakovich was athletic business manager at the 
University of Miami from 1983-85.

 Long Beach Athletic Director Dave O'Brien said Radakovich will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past five years, no one has contributed more to the success of the

FREEDOMS: THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE ACLU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The letter from Andrea Saenz (Times, Feb. 3) was very impressive.It is 
encouraging to know that there are such young people who are aware of their 
freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution and are courageous enough to be 
outspoken about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenz may be interested to know that there exists an organization called the 
American Civil Liberties Union. One purpose of the ACLU is to offer legal 
assistance, when possible, to those who are willing to defend our Bill of 
Rights.

BAR ATTIRE: ON DEHUMANIZING WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The purpose of this letter is to inform you of an unhealthy trend that I have 
observed in Long Beach bars and establishments. The trend is for the barmaids 
to be forced to wear costumes that are extremely revealing and 
exploitative.Male bartenders are never forced to wear such revealing attire; 
this points out a double standard between the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 There is considerable empirical evidence in the psychological literature that 
indicates when women are dehumanized and viewed more as an object than as a 
person with feelings, needs, and desires there is a greater potential for 
violence against women by men. Thus, women come to be viewed as less human and 
as objects for male pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't help but think that this trend reinforces negative societal values 
about attitudes and beliefs about women and sexuality. I do not believe that 
this is productive or healthy for men, women and children. If our society is to 
eradicate violence against women, we need to address these issues. Having 
worked at a battered women's shelter for over six years I can tell you that 
violence against women is epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 I encourage other men and women to boycott establishments where barmaids are 
forced to wear revealing costumes. Both sexes should be accorded the same 
amount of dignity and respect.

REWIND; THE JOKES COME THICK AND FAST IN ROBIN WILLIAMS VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Everybody's doing cocaine," observes Robin Williams. "Baseball players have 
to go in front of a grand jury and say, 'Yeah, I did cocaine, but can you blame 
me? It's a goddamn slow game! Come on, Jack! I'm standing out in left field for 
seven innings and there's a white line going down to home plate!' " 
</P>
<P>
 During "Robin Williams Live" -- a video presentation of his 1986 HBO comedy 
concert -- Williams spits out one hilarious joke after another like a seasoned 
poker dealer rifling out cards at a Las Vegas casino. At times the words come 
tumbling out of his mouth so fast that even an alert viewer may feel compelled 
to keep a finger on the rewind button. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams isn't the type of laid-back comedian who is simply going to hold a 
microphone and recite jokes. With a face bursting with animation and limbs that 
never seem to stop, this manic performer puts his entire body into his stand-up 
routines. On stage, Williams isn't just a comedian, he's also a hip, modern-day 
clown and an impressionist who imitates everyone from Moammar Kadafi to Jerry 
Falwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' hyperactive persona and over-the-top imitations help bring an 
undeniable silliness to "Robin Williams Live." Yet the humor often reflects an 
underlying social concern and a keen understanding of the world as it was in 
1986. His observations regarding such issues as the nuclear arms race and U. S. 
intervention in Nicaragua also serve to remind us how much the global political 
landscape has changed in the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most of "Robin Williams Live" is very applicable today. In regard to 
the proliferation of guns in America, Williams cracks: "Everybody here knows 
we're armed and it's escalating. It's going to get to the point when we're 
going to come home one day and people across the street will be going, 'I've 
built a cruise missile to stop those kids from playing ZZ Top!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The most memorable segment of "Robin Williams Live" arrives when our 
irrepressible host gives us a knowing and uncensored look at sex, childbirth 
and parenthood. "(You dream) about your kid," says Williams. "Dreams that one 
day your kid will be up there going, 'I'd like to thank the Nobel Academy.' 
Then you have this other dream where your kid's going, 'Would you like fries 
with this?' You don't know. It's a crapshoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand-up comedy doesn't get much better than this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robin Williams Live" (1986), directed by Bruce Gowers. 65 minutes. Rated R.

PEOPLE: SONS DIED IN GANG GUNFIRE, BUT SHE HAS MESSAGE OF PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lorna Hawkins' son Joe, 21, was killed in a drive-by shooting in 1988, about a 
block from the Lynwood home where the family has lived for more than 15 years. 
Then Gerald, 22, was shot four times in the back and killed as he ran from 
suspected gang members in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 But Hawkins doesn't want pity. She wants the violence to stop, and she's on a 
crusade to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, she created "Drive-by Agony," a talk show on a 
community-access cable television channel. She invites parents to vent their 
anger, frustration and sadness about the violence that has killed their 
children. Sometimes, the parents share the set with police officers, city 
officials and former gang members.  
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, the nonprofit California Wellness Foundation awarded Hawkins a 
$25,000 grant to expand the programming and promote her work to stop violent 
crime. Her goal is to produce a new episode weekly, instead of the current 
schedule of creating one or two new shows monthly and repeating them several 
times. Currently, the show airs three times a week at various times. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant comes at an opportune time for Hawkins. Without it, she has no idea 
how she would have continued. "From gas money to doing my hair and clothes, 
I've paid out of my pocket without sponsorship," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also has started a support group for victims of violence, and has created 
educational videotapes that she gives away to schools. Two years ago, she quit 
her sales job to devote all of her time to the show and related activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, 42, said she started her crusade out of frustration that a local 
newspaper wouldn't write a story about the 1988 slaying of Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me they couldn't put anything in the newspaper because they have so 
many killings. There was nobody I could talk to about it," she said. "If I felt 
that way, I knew there were other mothers who felt the same way. So I started 
the show to make people listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the first shooting, Hawkins said, she felt safe in the Lynwood home she 
shared with her husband, Frank, a construction foreman, and four children.  
</P>
<P>
 "After my oldest son was shot, I realized it wasn't that safe," she said. In 
addition to starting the TV program, she also formed a neighborhood block watch 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to get out in the street and carry signs," she said. "They have 
to take back the streets. That's exactly what we're doing here."

MUSIC; ROCKING TO THE WAILING OF BABY HUEY; 'BOLD AND BOISTEROUS' BAND TO TAKE 
PART IN FUND-RAISING BENEFIT FOR SURFRIDER FOUNDATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year's finhead fandango, Long May You Ride 4, which is a benefit for the 
Surfrider Foundation at Toes Tavern in Santa Barbara, promises to be more fun 
than six-foot tubes. The five-buck cover charge goes directly to the Surfrider 
Foundation, which, among other things, wants a cleaner ocean, more public 
access and free parking at our own beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a two-night extravaganza, and the musical lineup's Cowabunga Quotient is 
certifiably higher than the surf always is 10 minutes before you get there. On 
the bill is Baby Huey, much more than a fat duck, and also one of the few 
original Santa Barbara bands that believes serious rock 'n' roll probably isn't 
much fun. "Bold and Boisterous," said the chalkboard outside Toes Tavern last 
week. Truth in advertising for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of pretty boys playing la-la music that they think is rock 'n' 
roll -- but it's not," said the imposing lead singer, Matt (Baby Huey) 
McLaughlin. "Baby Huey plays old-time rock 'n' roll that I think is 
particularly needed in this town." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-foot-4 and 310 pounds, McLaughlin could brush most other bands (and 
bouncers) aside as though they were matchsticks. The other band dudes who play 
up a storm even as they stay out of his way include Mark (The Shark) Bennett on 
guitar, Bobby (Dirty) Shampine on drums and Ed (Papa) Wada on bass. McLaughlin, 
when he's not roaring and romping onstage, is one of the local Santa Barbara 
movers and shakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, man, I move pianos -- about 20 hours a week," the big guy said. "I get 
OK money and the rest of the time I'm in the band. What could be better? I've 
delivered pianos to Bernie Taupin, Gregg Allman and lots of famous people. We 
undercut the moving companies, so UCSB and Westmont use us; we work a lot in L. 
A. too. It's a lot of responsibility -- some of the pianos cost 70 grand." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that they have no pianos to move, Toes Tavern seems a good 
place for Baby Huey, which is sort of a beer and T-shirt kind of band. Toes has 
25 different kinds of beer, and usually free peanuts. Surfboards hang from the 
ceiling like developers from oak trees in an environmentalist's good dream. 
Don't go to Toes to watch the Kings -- the screens show continuous vintage surf 
flicks from the days when California was cool. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in a particularly inspired double bill at Toes, Baby Huey opened for 
the Beat Farmers a few months ago. The fat duck band does in fact have some 
surf influences, playing something akin to ZZ Top-at-the beach boogie music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of between a Jackie Gleason show and Aerosmith," according to 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 But make no mistake about it, the mover wants to be as big as the stuff he 
moves or even the truck he may or may not need. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanna be known," McLaughlin said. "I don't want to just wait around to be 
signed, but if the day happened, I'd go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Baby Huey's tape is called "Hard Act to Follow," and has songs such as "She 
Licked It Up," "Sticky Love Song" and "Rotten" -- well, you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the tape has an incredible sound," said the biased singer, who also 
claims that he spent a lot of his time and money putting it together. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby Huey practices a couple of times a week and plays about once a month. 
Their Ventura debut is set March 3 at the Midnight Hour. You'll have to find 
out about their gigs from the press. Baby Huey flyers are as scarce as kinder, 
gentler bouncers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flyers? No way, man; I'm sick of flyers," the singer said. "In Santa Barbara, 
there's this homeless guy that tears all the band flyers down about three times 
a day. Then he puts up some hieroglyphic computer printout that only he can 
make sense of. Then again, if you tell your friends about a gig, then if they 
show up, they think they're doing you a favor." 
</P>
<P>
 The night following the Surfrider Foundation fund-raiser will feature the best 
band in Carpinteria, the Upbeat, along with Brad Is Sex, the Haskells and 
Ella's Umbrella. Details

SANTA BARBARA COMPANY GETS RIGHTS TO WASSERMAN MUSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Philip Brandes 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera has corralled the first performance rights 
to "Western Star," a new musical by Dale Wasserman, company representatives 
announced at a news conference yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Western Star," Wasserman, who wrote "Man of La Mancha" and the stage 
adaptation of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," brandishes his signature 
themes of rebellion, idealism and the search for identity amid the birth of a 
new town in the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of "Western Star" in February, 1995, will mark a trailblazing 
world premiere for the Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera, which has specialized 
in revivals of popular Broadway musicals.

 Yes, yes, Nanette. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera's production of the Roaring '20s musical "No, 
No, Nanette" officially opens at the Granada Theatre on Friday night. And for 
that one night only, anyone who can prove that she (or he, we suppose) is named 
Nanette will be given two free tickets to the show, and will be invited to a 
post-performance reception. If you are a Nanette, call 962-1922. 
</P>
<P>
 The production itself will run through March 13. Show times are 8 p.m. 
Wednesdays through Saturdays and 7 p.m. Sundays, with Saturday and Sunday 
matinees at 2 p.m. There will also be a 3 p.m. show March 1. Tickets range from 
$18 to $29.50 for adults, with $2 discounts for senior citizens. Children's

direction of Robert G. Weiss, will present "Our Country's Good" at the Alhecama 
Theatre through March 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in Australia in the late 18th Century, the play centers around a British 
officer's attempt to put on a restoration comedy celebrating the birthday of 
King George III, using convicts from the penal colony as cast members. The 
play, written by Timberlake Wertenbaker and based on a novel by Thomas 
Keneally, looks at colonization and the building of the British Empire.

will be at 7 p.m. Remaining Sunday shows will be at 2 p.m. General admission

Davison, alias Wild Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The guest of honor for the event will be Davison's widow, Anne Stewart 
Davison, who will share stories from her husband's career. And what a career it 
was. The ever-busy Wild Bill, renowned for his Chicago-style jazz of the 1920s 
and '30s, toured 22 countries and recorded 1,800 albums. 
</P>
<P>

weekend, Dudley, an offshoot of Santa Barbara's own eclectic jazz ensemble 
Headless Household, will play some of their inventive tunes Friday night at

THEATER REVIEW; 'JOAN OF ARC' FILLED WITH SURPRISES AS MUSICAL; COMPOSER DAVID 
POTTER'S SCORE REFLECTS RICH EXPANSE OF STYLES FROM GREGORIAN CHANT TO CADENCES 
OF 'LES MISERABLES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The short life of Joan of Arc -- the visionary shepherdess who, at the age of 
19 liberated 15th-Century France from an occupying English army, was steeped in 
the kind of unusual circumstances and exceptional personal accomplishments that 
cry out for deep, probing historical analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the girl broke every conceivable social, religious and military 
rule of her time. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in bringing "Joan of Arc" to the stage as an original musical, one of the 
creators' more surprising choices was to tell her story with little reliance on 
complex psychological or sociological interpretation. Instead, the piece is 
sketched in the broad strokes of a passion play, a meditation on faith and 
heroism performed entirely in song. 
</P>
<P>
 Another surprise is the use of the Trinity Episcopal Church as a venue. 
Despite the atmospheric appropriateness -- the Gothic stone walls, stained 
glass, windows and high ceiling -- the church's narrow altar space and 
restricted sight lines weren't designed with staging plays in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest surprise is that it all works. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason for this success is simple to identify, though complicated to 
experience -- namely, composer David Potter's score, which reflects the 
influence of a rich expanse of musical styles from the austere meditation of 
Gregorian chant to the majestic, fervent cadences of "Les Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
 Far from derivative, however, the musical integrity in Potter's songs combines 
fresh vision with piercing emotional conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Songs of heartfelt longing like "Send, Oh God," in which the uncrowned King of 
France, Charles (Gregory Franklin), calls out for divine reassurance, to be 
answered in a sweet duet by Joan (Pamela Winslow). 
</P>
<P>
 Songs of stirring loyalty, like "Out There," in which Joan's trusted aide Jean 
D'Aulon (Clark Sterling) vows to defend her to the death. 
</P>
<P>
 But golden-throated Winslow could make a phone book ring like Sondheim, and 
her focused performance as Joan is nothing short of masterful. Both the male 
leads are strong singers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Director John Blondell has admirably met the formidable challenge of evoking a 
bona fide theatrical experience from the constricted stage space. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one can't help reflecting on the theological irony of performing this 
tribute to a woman "sent by God to truly save us from the English knave" in an 
Episcopal church, with its Anglican roots. It's nice to know that some grudges 
only need a few centuries to cool off. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Joan of Arc" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Through March 6, Thursdays through Sundays at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Trinity Episcopal Church, 1500 Santa Barbara St., Santa Barbara. 
</P>

EARTHWATCH: GETTING PEOPLE TO JUMP ON THE BAT BANDWAGON; THE OFTEN MALIGNED 
ANIMALS ACTUALLY DESTROY TONS OF HARMFUL INSECTS AND HELP IN REFORESTATION.

<P>
 On Valentine's Day an acquaintance gave me a chocolate candy about the size of 
a bagel -- but it was in the shape of a bat. Clearly a token of affection, and 
as it turns out, environmental meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, I showed this valentine to my teen-age daughter, the household's 
expert on modern trends in social usage. "Ugh, twisted," was her preliminary 
finding. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was her final position on the matter even though I tried to point 
out, by reading aloud from some literature accompanying the gift, that some 
people, such as the American Bat Conservation Society, which sells this curious 
confection, think otherwise. To fight prevailing negative attitudes about bats, 
two national organizations and some local folks have become quite active 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bats are cute, adorable and lovable and it's time to associate bats with a 
holiday that better represents their disposition," writes Dr. Tom Valega. He's 
president of the Maryland-based group that came up with the 
impossible-to-forget concept of giving your loved one a "Bat Bite," as these 
copyrighted candies are called, on Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 By coincidence, this week I was given the names of some Ventura-based 
environmental activists who also think bats deserve an image make-over. I 
checked in with Dee and John Lockwood, a couple who own agricultural land 
hereabouts. "Bats are the most beneficial mammal on the planet," John told me. 
"The bat is responsible for 90% of the reforestation of the harvested rain 
forest." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that it is bats, not birds, that scatter fresh seeds wherever humans 
have come in and devastated acres of tropical rain forest. And, referring to 
California's ecology, John quipped, "What does the spotted owl do for us, or 
the coyote, when a cave of bats can fly out and eat 250,000 pounds of insects a 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Dee and John trek annually to Central America on a private crusade to instruct 
tradition-bound farmers not to torch bat colonies in mountain caves. "We're 
protecting Ventura County bats in Mexico," John said, referring to the 
migratory patterns of some of these animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain breeds go back and forth across the border devouring moths and 
mosquitoes at the rate of 600 per bat per hour. John cited a specific 
commercial benefit: "By encouraging bats (by not killing them) some farmers 
have been successful in reducing the volume of pesticides needed to keep the 
corn borer in check." 
</P>
<P>
 Other bats stay in southern Mexico and Belize all the time, existing on a 
vegetarian diet. They provide a pro-environmental service by scattering 
undigested seeds in natural fertilizer pellets, thus re-seeding land in their 
area, the Lockwoods say. 
</P>
<P>
 Their statements were echoed by the professionals that I contacted at the 
state of California's Wildlife Management Division and at another, long 
established private group, Bat Conservation International. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bats have undergone an outrageous decline in the last 50 years (which) leads 
to increase in insects and pesticide use," says Caryla Larsen, a wildlife 
biologist with the state's animal-watching organization. "People are afraid of 
them, but they're beneficial. They are not considered a threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabies incidents involving bats are low, she reports -- "in a healthy bat 
colony one-tenth of 1%." 
</P>
<P>
 But she stressed that we should not disturb or handle them, and we should 
instruct our children in the same way. It's also illegal to have them as pets. 
The purpose of erecting a bat house on your property, as some people do, should 
not be to domesticate them, she said, but give them shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than adopt a bat, I plan to hop on the bat bandwagon later this year 
when the folks who sell the Bat Bite chocolates come out with their new model. 
It's going to be keyed to yet another holiday, Halloween, and will have a 
filling of raspberry jam. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI:For information about nearby bats call Dee and John Lockwood at 642-3111 
or Caryla Larsen of the Wildlife Management Division, state of California, 
(916) 654-3806. 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC: Recommended books and videos on bats are available from Bat 
Conservation International (800) 538-BATS. For chocolate bats call the American 
Bat Conservation Society at (301) 309-6610.

SHOP TALK; BOOKSTORES COMPETE FOR SALES WITH PRICE CUTS; DISCOUNTS AT CHAINS 
CAN RANGE FROM 10% TO 50% OFF HARDCOVER OR PAPERBACKS. BUT SPECIALTY SHOPS MAY 
STILL OFFER THE BEST SELECTIONS.

 We still have memories of the good old days when Ventura County folks could 
just head over to the local bookseller to check out the latest releases, or to 
browse the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a whole lot of thought went into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, in case you hadn't noticed, the book-selling business has entered a new 
phase around the county. This is particularly true in the west end, where the 
arrival of a Barnes & Noble franchise stirred things up. Not only does the 
establishment give people a quality book-buying option, but it is also forcing 
them to confront some important shopping issues. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, before book buyers choose a bookstore, they need to run through a 
checklist: Are they looking for discount prices? Are they interested in a 
particular subject matter? What kind of setting do they prefer? 
</P>
<P>
 We visited a local Crown Books, Waldenbooks, B. Dalton Bookseller and, of 
course, the Barnes & Noble in Ventura to get a rundown of their discount 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Barnes & Noble, prices on almost all hardcover books are slashed 20%, some 
selected books are marked down 30%, and New York Times bestsellers are cut 20% 
(paperback) and 30% (hardcover). Danielle Steele's "Accident" was priced at 30% 
below the original $23.95 asking price. "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' 
First 100 Years" was also 30% below its $20 tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes & Noble also has good-sized budget -- "Fiction Under $5" and "Bargain 
Book" -- sections. We found Tracy Kidder's "Among Schoolchildren" priced at 
$3.98 (down from $19.95). We also spotted a copy of "Jimmy Stewart and His 
Poems" for $3.99 (down about $6 from its original price). 
</P>
<P>
 And, by the way, the store opened a cafe earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 At Crown Books, New York Times bestsellers are 40% off for hardback fiction 
and nonfiction. We found "Accident" priced at $14.37 and "Having Our Say" at 
$12. The store also knocks 25% off paperback fiction and nonfiction listed in 
the Top 15 of the bestseller list. General hardbacks are discounted 20% to 50%, 
children's books are priced at 20% off, and magazine prices are cut 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the remainder racks, they are hard to miss. There are "Books Near $3," 
"Books Near $4" and "Books Near $5." 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't already started taking notes, now might be a good time to 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you know what it means to be a "Preferred Reader" at Waldenbooks? It means 
that you take 10% off just about any price in the store -- for a $10 annual 
fee. Membership also means that you can accumulate "purchase points." When 
you've spent $100, you get a $5 certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 The store has "Picks of the Week" discounted 15%, 25% and 50%. Many new 
fiction and nonfiction bestsellers are cut 25%. The "Special Value" table has 
books as low as about $2.98 hardcover. There are also "Bargain Blowouts Under 
$5" and "Bargain Value" tables. 
</P>
<P>
 One store's "Preferred Reader" is another's "Book ver." For $10 a year, 
membership to the B. Dalton "Book vers Club" will allow you to subtract 10% 
from the price of your purchases, including sale books. Regular customers can 
take 25% to 50% off hardback bestsellers (Steele's "Accident" is at the low 
end). There is also a 50% off table, a "$5.98 and Under" table and a "Special 
Value" table. 
</P>
<P>
 So now we've talked discounts from the chains, let's talk selection. If you 
know what you want and you want the largest selection, your best bet may be a 
specialty shop. 
</P>
<P>
 We checked the Adventures for Kids children's bookstore in Ventura, where the 
selection is enormous. There are shelves for various school subjects -- 
science, social studies -- a shelf for hobbies, one for technology and one for 
Caldecott winners, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 You may not find the everyday discounts at these specialty shops, but you're 
going to have your pick of titles. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too late for Valentine's Day, but . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Look for the new Conroy's Florist at 3900 Thousand Oaks Blvd. (across from the 
North Ranch Mall) in Westlake to have a ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday, 
courtesy of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. The shop has been open for a 
little more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Speaking of new stores, Smart & Final just opened an outlet at 2750 Main St., 
Ventura, where the Sears surplus center used to be.

COVER STORY: HOOP HYSTERIA; THE UNBEATABLE VENTURA PIRATES, LED Y A CHARISMATIC 
COACH, INSPIRE RABID FOLLOWING

 Arriving on the run and breathless, Marty MacNair gawks at the long line 
snaking around the building. Hundreds of fans, motivated by forecasts of a 
sellout, came early to buy tickets and get good seats, even if it meant 
standing outside on a raw night in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this line," MacNair muttered. "I'm not waiting in this line. This is 
crazy. It's raining. It's cold. And we just had an earthquake. Why aren't these 
people at home? What is this anyway, a Beatles reunion?" 
</P>
<P>
 No, just an appearance by the Fab Five, otherwise known as the Ventura College 
men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing college basketball mania to the normally placid beach town, the 
practically unbeatable Pirates are ranked No. 1 among California community 
colleges and are one of the top jaycee teams in the nation. Beaten only twice 
in 31 games this season going into Wednesday night's game, they draw the 
largest crowds in the county for an indoor event -- sports or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocked with imported prime-time players destined for Division I college 
basketball and the National Basketball Assn., the Pirates play crowd-pleasing, 
fast-break offense and relentless pressure defense, but their entertainment 
repertoire goes beyond slam dunks and blocked shots to include a sizzling 
pregame show. 
</P>
<P>
 With a deejay ratcheting the volume on a 900-watt stereo system, the players 
perform a series of choreographed basketball drills set to hip-hop and rap, 
their precision chorus-line routines a mixture of MTV and Las Vegas. Aside from 
allowing players to practice moves they will use in the game, the high-stepping 
production number energizes fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their warm-up is the best show in town," said MacNair, a 48-year-old Ventura 
pharmaceutical salesman and die-hard fan. "For three bucks, you can't beat it." 
DEMANDING COACH 
</P>
<P>
 Show time and winnin' time, concepts introduced by the Lakers during the reign 
of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, have been cloned by Pirates' 
ringmaster and head coach, Philip Mathews, 43. An intense man, the son of an 
Air Force warrant officer, Mathews arrived here in 1985 and began winning 
conference titles that turned a sleepy, losing basketball program into the 
hottest ticket in town. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mathews not only created the mania, he became a key performer in it. 
</P>
<P>
 A charismatic figure, impeccably dressed in Armani suits, Mathews himself puts 
on a show during games. Prowling the sideline, glaring, scowling and screaming 
at his players, Mathews has a fixation on perfection and a short fuse. His team 
motto, "We play hard," is considered a sacrament. During a game this season, he 
pulled all five starters, marched them into a hallway while the game continued 
and tongue-lashed them for lollygagging; the Pirates went on to win by 30 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite despotic tendencies and public tantrums, Mathews has endeared 
himself to players, fans and the community. His approval is no doubt a 
byproduct of a remarkable record: an 82% winning record, eight straight 
conference titles, 129 wins in the last 143 games. But Mathews also earns 
respect with a warm, gracious post-game persona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd heard these horror stories about Coach Mathews," said star player Brandon 
Jessie, a 6-foot-5 forward. "They went: 'The coach is crazy. He yells. He gets 
in your face.' Then I met him and knew the horror stories were true. But I've 
learned that coach yells at you to get you disciplined. You have to listen to 
what he says, not his tone of voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews' most redeeming feature -- indeed, his primary marketing tool -- is 
his hard-nosed emphasis on academics. Players of the Pirates' caliber don't go 
to junior college by choice. Dismal high school grades preclude them from going 
to four-year colleges and made junior college a mandatory stop: Under NCAA 
rules, a two-year associate of arts degree becomes an automatic ticket to 
Division I, a necessary step on the long journey to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's success in attracting blue-chip players -- the Pirates' poster boy 
is Phoenix Suns' rising star Cedric Ceballos, Ventura class of '88 -- hinges on 
Mathews' reputation for taking academically challenged jocks and turning them 
into students. In his eight full seasons, 48 of 53 players graduated and 
transferred to four-year schools, including all seven sophomores from last 
season's 37-2 team. This team's 13-man squad is also on track to graduate; last 
semester, the players had a cumulative grade-point average of 2.7, with three 
of them making the honor roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kid had a problem with grades in high school, so (a friend) told me I 
should check out Phil Mathews," said Brandon Jessie's father, Ron, a former 
All-Pro Rams' receiver who lives in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 While some coaches pay lip service to academics, Mathews goes out of his way 
to keep players' noses in the books, expecting more from them than the rest of 
the student body. He also goes out of his mind if they suddenly turn into 
Beavis and Butt-head: He has been seen chewing out players in the middle of 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews makes players attend daily study halls and he checks their grades 
every three weeks. To get each player's attention, Mathews has developed a 
unique mentor program that pairs players with faculty members for once-a-week 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mathews once benched a star player for missing a class, his players 
neither mind his no-nonsense policy nor think it's excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta see where coach is coming from," says point guard Joey Ramirez, one 
of five Division I prospects on the team. "He wants to make you fulfill your 
potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews also wants his players to be straight arrows. "Ventura knows the 
Pirate basketball team," Mathews says. "That's why our kids must be on their 
best behavior and must be role models." 
</P>
<P>
 And if they step out of line, Mathews goes for the jugular: "He threatens to 
call their momma," said Becky Hull. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull is Mathews' accomplice in the fight against sloth and illiteracy. A 
41-year-old mother of twins, she is the college's academic athletic adviser, 
cajoling and guiding players through the perilous jungles of academia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm alongside them all the way, pulling or kicking them up the hill," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull gets the players' attention with the admonishment: "Do it the Becky Hull 
way, you get your goal. Do it your way: Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is graduation and enough credits to transfer to a major basketball 
factory. "Coach doesn't want to say he guarantees the players will graduate," 
said Hull, "but if a player comes here and does what he's supposed to do in the 
classroom, he will graduate." 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly nine years at the college, Hull said she has seen the most devout 
underachiever transform under her tutelage and Mathews' iron hand. "There's no 
such thing as a dumb jock," she said. "There are only athletes who haven't been 
brought up to their potential. They were never challenged academically." 
</P>
<P>
 With Hull, three assistant coaches and Athletic Director Jerry Dunlap backing 
him, Mathews has cornered the market on jaycee basketball in the state. The 
team is odds-on favorite to bring Mathews his second state championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Mathews," says Oxnard College Coach Ron McClurkin, "runs the finest 
basketball program among California community colleges." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mathews has caused a few ripples along the way. TACTICS CRITICIZED 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived from Cal State Fullerton, where he had been assistant coach, 
Mathews found a team made up primarily of local players. The Pirates had also 
posted nine straight losing seasons. Mathews brought in players from outside 
the county, even outside the state -- violating, in spirit, the community 
college concept. Although fans reportedly grumbled at first, their mood changed 
radically as winning became a team habit. Today, only four players are home 
grown -- and Mathews is unapologetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is America," Mathews says. "You can go to school where you want. The 
community is used to winning. You have to pick players who can play." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews has also shocked and reportedly angered fans by swearing at players 
during games, his booming voice reaching sensitive ears in the stands. "He had 
to learn to curb his mouth," one fan said. "Now he's pretty much under 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews was married last July to Margie Holland of Oxnard. This is a life 
change that many assert has calmed him down this season, an assertion he 
denies. "I've heard that marriage mellowed me," he says, "but I don't think my 
players would say I've mellowed. I demand as much as I always have. Maybe I'm 
just not as demonstrative as I once was." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews' aggressive personality extends to his coaching tactics, a no-mercy 
approach that sometimes leaves opposing coaches steaming. After suffering a 
105-62 loss to Ventura recently, Cuesta College Coach Rusty Blair was furious, 
saying: "They try to blow you out, to embarrass you, and leave nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair says Mathews lacks sportsmanship. "He's obviously got a very powerful 
team and doesn't need to rub it in against people less fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair slammed the Pirates, saying: "I don't like Ventura. I don't like 
anything about them. They're arrogant from the chief on down, and including the 
people in the stands." BOOSTER MANIA 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're known as pretty brutal fans -- we get in people's faces all the time," 
Hull admits. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans are arrogant on purpose, a right bestowed on them by their team's top 
ranking, several fans said. Before a recent game against Moorpark College, 
hordes of Ventura fans, supposedly bored watching the opposing players warm up, 
lounged in the stands, preferring to read newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 They may be smug and mischievous, but "they aren't ugly or unruly fans," said 
Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist. Neither is the Ventura College gym a godless 
"snake pit," he said. "A place like New Mexico State is a snake pit. You can't 
hear. The fans do things to distract the players. Ventura has great fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a preseason Midnight Madness practice drew an astounding 1,000 fans (Cal 
State Northridge, by comparison, had 470 fans at its late-night workout). 
</P>
<P>
 Averaging about 2,000 in attendance at home games this season -- highest among 
jaycees in the state -- the Pirates had standing-room-only crowds for three 
games at their gym, the largest indoor venue in the county with a 3,500-seat 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Road games also attract Ventura fans: An estimated 400 to 500 travel to 
Glendale and Santa Barbara on so-called rooter buses. At games at Oxnard and 
Moorpark, Mathews says, "our fans are probably in the majority." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-core fans belong to the booster club. A hundred strong, the club raises 
money for the team -- about $40,000 a year from charity games and sports 
auctions -- and members shepherd the players, taking them into their homes for 
the holidays. The boosters are headed by Leonard Hull, Becky's husband, who 
walks around during games recruiting boisterous fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neat thing about the club is that it's a resource of people from all 
walks of life who are there for the basketball program," Leonard Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews may have resurrected basketball at the college, but he certainly 
didn't invent it. The college has a history of fan support and outstanding 
teams going back to the 1940s. Starting in 1949, the team won at least 34 games 
for three seasons; in the early '70s, Ventura had four consecutive seasons of 
20 wins or better. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 1950 team came in second at the national tournament, "The booster 
club bought us new sport coats and paraded us through town in convertibles," 
recalled James Cowan, who played for the Pirates then and went on to become 
county superintendent of schools. "We were the biggest thing around." 
</P>
<P>
 Bigger than teams in the Mathews era? 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to Phil, we didn't have this kind of basketball mania," said Chad 
Ishikawa, a booster who has been a counselor at the college since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 The mania will no doubt continue as long as the Pirates keep steam rolling the 
opposition, a strong probability according to opposing coaches. "Players from 
all over the country are coming to Mathews now," Oxnard's McClurkin says. "He 
can sit back and decide who to accept. He's getting great players and he 
teaches them to play very hard. That's why they win." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura has a dynasty in the making. "The beat will go on," Mathews predicts, 
but fans realize it all could go away if a major college came looking for a new 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, people thought he'd use this as steppingstone," Marty MacNair 
says. "He hasn't, but there's still a fear he could leave anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, with his wife expecting in June, insists he's "not going anywhere. It 
would have to be an unbelievable offer. I'm happy here." Pirates Under Mathews

AT THE MARKET: BRUSSELS SPROUTS ARE GAINING IN STATURE AS FOOD FOR GOOD HEALTH; 
THE MINIATURE CABBAGE-LIKE VEGGIES ARE BEING TOUTED BY WEIGHT-LOSS GURUS AND AS 
A DIETARY AID TO PREVENTING CANCER. 
</P>

<P>
 Many of us can remember those frightening evenings when mom served up ("Oh, 
no, not again!") a steamy side dish of smelly, pale, ruefully overcooked 
Brussels sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't let childhood torment keep you from enjoying the tasty and healthful 
rewards of properly prepared sprouts today. 
</P>
<P>
 Brussels sprouts are most readily available during the fall and winter months. 
Although the plant is propagated nearly year-round along California's coastal 
agriculture belts, production falls off during the wilting heat of summertime. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, supermarkets such as Hughes, Ralphs and Vons are selling Brussels 
sprouts for about 70 cents a pound. While the price may be right, don't expect 
to sort through a mountain of sprouts, as all markets devote minimal shelf 
space to this golf ball-size vegetable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't see them in great quantity because they are like a specialty 
item," said Don Ames of the Produce Reporter Co., an industry marketing group. 
"Not everyone eats them like they do lettuces and other staples." 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe they should. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being a tasty dish when cooked properly, sprouts have also become a 
veggie of choice -- a poster veggie, if you will -- for many health agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprouts, like the other members of the cruciferous family -- cabbage, 
cauliflower, broccoli and others -- are high in fiber and low in fat and the 
American Heart Assn. recommends they be eaten regularly, said Camarillo 
nutritionist Georgia Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
 "They help in pulling cholesterol out of the system," she said. "Brussels 
sprouts are also high in sulfur, which takes fats out of the body" -- and 
that's especially beneficial if you're on a weight-loss program, Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The veggies of the cruciferous family may also aid in the prevention of 
certain cancers, according to the American Cancer Society and the National 
Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual buds "sprout" from a sturdy, fibrous stalk, which reaches 30 
inches or more in height. The erect stalk is crowned by an umbrella of large 
leaves and is completely shrouded by the miniature cabbage head-like sprouts. A 
single plant is expected to yield from 50 to 100 sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, most shoppers only see the sprouts after the buds have been 
picked from the stem. But shoppers at area farmers' markets can purchase the 
entire plant with the sprouts still intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Nichols Farms of Pismo Beach, who attend the Ventura (Saturday) and 
Thousand Oaks (Thursday) markets, offer their Brussels sprouts by the plant. 
Each plant costs $1.50. A pound of their pre-plucked sprouts goes for $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprouts left on the plant until they are ready to be used will retain 
freshness longer, said RichardSager of Nichols Farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols' sprouts season will continue through February and possibly into 
March, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brussels sprouts should be available at area farmers' markets well into the 
springtime, though, thanks to Michael Melendez and family, who farm near Santa 
Maria. The Melendezes travel to Ventura's Wednesday and Saturday markets, plus 
the Thousand Oaks and Oxnard markets on Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has raised Brussels sprouts for three years and has since 
determined that the vegetable is most popular with a particular age group, 
Michael Melendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brussels sprouts are kind of like spinach -- it's one of those things that 
you disliked when you are young and started eating later in life," he said. 
"The people that seem to buy it most are over 30 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Melendez said their sprout sales continue to climb -- a fact that he 
attributes to the growing awareness of the plant's nutritional benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing Brussels sprouts is simple enough. Boiling or steaming for a few 
careful minutes will result in a mild cabbage taste with hints of nutty flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 When cooking Brussels sprouts, the credo to live by is: Do not overcook. If 
you do, your nose will know. Overdone sprouts are an odoriferous nightmare, 
attributable to their high sulfur content, Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can stink really, really bad," Melendez said. And they're not very 
pleasing to the palate, either. "Soggy and smelly is what you'll get." 
</P>
<P>
 Before cooking a batch of sprouts, slice off a thin portion of the stem and 
remove just the outer layer of leaves, then rinse the vegetable under cool 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Boil: To retain the sprout's bright greenish color and fresh taste, drop into 
salted boiling water -- enough so they are completely covered. Return to boil 
and cook until just reaching tenderness. It should take about 8 minutes. You 
can check for doneness by piercing the base with a sharp knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Steam: Again, slice off a bit of the stem and remove outer leaves. Before 
steaming, Melendez suggested cutting an "X" about an eighth of an inch deep in 
the base of the stem. "This allows the steam to penetrate to the center," he 
said. Cook for a few minutes and begin to check for desired tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
 When purchasing Brussels sprouts, look for those with a fresh, vivid green 
hue. They should be firm to the touch and unwrinkled. The smaller sprouts are 
normally more tender and better tasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh sprouts may be kept in the crisper for up to five days, Melendez said, 
although for best flavor you should eat your sprouts within two days. Details 
</P>
<P>
 For a simple and delicious side dish, boiled or steamed Brussels sprouts can 
be served with melted butter and a sprinkling of grated hard cheese, such as 
Romano or Parmesan. The vegetable is also versatile enough to be served with a 
favorite sauce or in a stir-fry preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 Below is a recipe that features Brussels sprouts' traditional partner, 
chestnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brussels Sprouts with Water Chestnuts and Ginger 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons minced ginger root 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chicken stock or broth 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup whole canned water chest nuts, rinsed and drained 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound Brussels sprouts, cooked 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine) 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in medium skillet. Add garlic and ginger root, and saute 10 seconds 
over medium-high heat. Add stock and water chestnuts, and bring to boil. Add 
cooked Brussels sprouts and heat 2 minutes over medium heat, shaking pan or 
stirring gently. Add mirin and soy sauce, and heat over medium-high heat 2 or 3 
minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Makes 4 servings.

FOR THE KIDS; ON A ROLL; MARBLES -- THE VENERABLE SPORT OF YOUNGSTERS -- HAS 
MADE A STRONG COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until last week, the recess bell at Ventura's Loma Vista School would send 
small groups of kids to the playground to hunker down in the dirt with marble 
bags in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Marbles were hot -- about 30 games would be going on across the playground. So 
hot, in fact, that Principal Rich Kirby reluctantly banned them after a number 
of disruptions, like marbles rolling across the classroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the marble fad hit Mound School in Ventura. At recess, kids took to 
the playground in groups of four or five to play a game called "Poison." It's 
the same game the kids at Loma Vista School were playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it goes: After making a hole in the dirt, kids stand behind a line, 
kneel down and shoot their marble, aiming for the hole. If they succeed, they 
are deemed "poisonous" and, when they hit another marble, they get to keep it. 
That is, if they are playing for keeps -- something they must decide before 
play begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poison" is also the game of choice for Ivan Arroyo, 10, and Angel Gonzalez, 
12, who play in their Oxnard neighborhood or at the park. Angel played at 
school until the game was banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan has a collection of about 500 marbles, some he bought in Mexico. "I win a 
lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If a kid is serious about marbles, he knows the rules and the lingo. First of 
all, the shooter marbles (bigger than the rest) are called taws, glassies or 
monnies, according to marble experts. The smallers ones are mibs, kimmies, 
ducks or hoodles. 
</P>
<P>
 The proper way to shoot is to hold the marble between the forefinger and 
thumb, with one knuckle of the hand touching the ground. Then the marble is 
propelled by a flick of the thumb. Histing (raising the hand from the ground) 
or hunching (inching the hand forward) are no-no's in marble etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
 Marble games are as numerous and different as the kinds of marbles -- cat's 
eyes, rainbows, steelies or galaxies -- that kids today collect. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular game is called "Ringer." In this game, kids draw a big circle 
on the ground, then line up 13 marbles on a cross they have drawn in the 
center. Using a shooter, they take turns trying to knock the smaller marbles 
out of the circle. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the game competitors play every June in the National Marbles 
Tournament in Wildwood, N. J., a contest only for kids 14 and under. 
</P>
<P>
 At Loma Vista School, marbles were so popular that the school held a 
schoolwide tournament last month and 140 kids joined in the round-robin event. 
</P>
<P>
 The marble craze started there late last year and for two months "it was 
nice," Kirby said, because kids of all ages were playing with each other, even 
boys with girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids brought an interesting assortment of marble bags, too, some with 
elaborate beadwork or feathers, and some that had been handed down from a 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kids didn't play marbles, but simply traded them. All in all, it created 
a run on marbles at local stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "In town, there was not a marble to be found," Kirby said. Kids would even 
call local stores that stocked them to find out when a shipment would be 
arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fad was starting to die down by the time Kirby told kids last week 
that they could no longer bring marbles to school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the county, marbles are clicking, although not at craze-level. 
The Boy Scouts organization has a marble sports program for Cub Scouts, who can 
earn pins and belt loops by learning and playing the game. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mardi Gras in Moorpark? A Children's Mardi Gras Carnival will be held Monday 
at the Moorpark Community Center, 799 Moorpark Ave., from 1 to 4 p.m. Children 
3 to 12 are invited for the free activities, which include carnival games with 
prizes and a costume contest. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: If you want to learn more about marbles, pick up a copy of "The Klutz 
Book of Marbles" at a local bookstore. However, most bookstores in the county 
were out of it last week, but would gladly order it. The book, published by 
Klutz Press in Palo Alto, costs $7.95 and includes 15 different marble games, 
along with a pouch of 14 marbles and a shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 * ALSO: Or, you can pick up the Boy Scouts of America marble booklet from the 
Scouts trading post at the Ventura County Council, 509 E. Daily Drive, 
Camarillo. It sells for $1.35. 
</P>
<P>
 * BUYER'S GUIDE: To buy marbles, here are a few outlets (some were sold out 
last week): Toys R Us, Kay-Bee Toy & Hobby Shops, Sav-On Drugs, Thrifty Drug 
Stores, Village Kite & Toy Store in Ventura and Serendipity Toys in Ojai.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; ERRATIC QUALITY MAKES OLD FAVORITE A GAMBLE; WHEN RISTORANTE 
FABRIZIO IS GOOD, IT IS EXQUISITE. BUT TOUGH MEATS AND OVER-SALTING CAUSE EVEN 
SOME CLASSIC DISHES TO FAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fabrizio is a name long associated in this region with fine Italian cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 For years Fabrizio Marangoni ran his restaurant in Camarillo. He built a loyal 
following who valued authentic Florentine cooking and the rare ministrations of 
a kitchen that would "create for you," as the menu now states it, in the 
unlikely event you didn't find something exactly to your liking. 
</P>
<P>
 Ristorante Fabrizio now operates in the Westlake area of Thousand Oaks, from a 
lovely dining room tucked in the quiet rear corner of The Evergreen Center. 
Loyalists still arrive nightly. The menu remains a map of Italy's most inspired 
dishes, plus a few all-Fabrizio conceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The dining room is Fabrizio's first pleasure: a simple square with dark-wood 
wine storage racks as room dividers and canopied booths, each a cloistered 
world of its own, lining two walls. You will feel immediate comfort, a sense -- 
especially in one of the booths -- of "home." 
</P>
<P>
 But the food in recent visits proved inconsistent, with classic dishes 
arriving as great successes and unaccountable failures. Complicating matters 
further was the kitchen's liberal use of salt, for me a preference, but not so 
for my dining companions. Be warned: The food is salty. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with shrimp Fabrizio ($8.50), in which large shrimp are butterflied, 
sauteed perfectly, and adrift in a moat of Dijon mustard/vodka sauce. The 
result is stunning, what Fabrizio does best: sparklingly fresh seafood, cooked 
slightly rare so the result is succulent, never tough, and a bracing, earthy 
sauce unabashed in its reach for full flavor without overwhelming the delicacy 
of seafood flavors. This appetizer, while pricey, is my favorite first course 
in any Ventura County restaurant and easily a signature dish that makes clear 
why Fabrizio has so many fans. 
</P>
<P>
 But beware the eggplant Macario ($8.50), in which perfectly grilled, thinly 
sliced eggplant is stuffed with wonderfully piquant Gorgonzola cheese and 
thick, tough, overheated prosciutto -- leathery enough to require some forceful 
knife work. The tomato-cream sauce, fresh and delightful, just isn't enough to 
overcome the marring, salt-heavy meat. This dish typifies what can go wrong 
here, as it is so potentially satisfying but for the one mishandled ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar salad ($4.50) is a rare treat: fresh and pungent, without the glueyness 
of so many commercial preparations. Snails with butter, garlic and Gorgonzola 
cheese ($6.95) are handled nicely but suffer, even to this palate, from 
over-salting. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasta courses showed the same troublesome division of success and failure. A 
simple, classic capellini al pomodoro ($9.95) was properly al dente in the fine 
angel hair pasta but awash in salty, bland tomato sauce that found little 
shoring up by the faintest traces of garlic and basil. Gnocchi with Gorgonzola 
sauce ($10.95) was most disappointing of all, and to be avoided: The potato 
dumplings were leaden, glutinous and unredeemed by a richly flavorful sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Try instead the rigatoni puttanesca ($9.95), in which the pasta is dressed 
with a lusty sauce of tomatoes, capers, anchovies, black olives and bell 
peppers. This is not only what this characteristically spicy dish can be but 
istaken, even, to a higher level. 
</P>
<P>
 Veal scallopine with lemon ($17.95), a classic picatta treatment, succeeded in 
the treatment but not the veal, which was tough and dry, unforgivable in a dish 
built upon delicacy. But filet mignon topped with Gorgonzola ($19.95) was 
perfect: charbroiled, densely flavorful, perfectly turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 The most consistent successes were fish entrees ordered from the daily 
specials menu. Mahi mahi ($18.95), charred outside and succulent within, 
arrived topped with a heady sauce of olives, tomatoes, white wine, garlic, 
capers and bell peppers. Poached salmon ($18.95), a generous center-cut filet, 
was the picture of elegance and forkful of pleasure: delicately flavored 
within, decadently sauced in champagne cream without. This is the seafood dish 
fit for a true Sybarite. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts were all quite good, particularly the Napolean, with a flaky pastry 
that was a rare achievement of flavor and delicacy; and creme caramel, the 
example of silken restraint and nuanced flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabrizio's has an extensive, well-chosen wine list, but prices can be high. Be 
sure to check for wine specials -- in one recent visit a bottle of 1992 Silver 
Ridge Merlot, a terrifically supple and full red, was available for $26.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, Fabrizio's falls behind other restaurants of its ambition when it comes 
to offering fine wines by the glass. As a result, the rather humdrum Pinot 
Grigio, Chardonnay, Chianti and Cabernet Sauvignon that are offered seem out of 
place -- and downright uninspiring at the uptown tariff of $4.25 and $4.75 per 
glass. If your party is large enough, pick a bottle instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabrizio's does so many things well that it is frustrating to report that 
inconsistency, coupled with fairly high prices, make dining here a gamble. 
Fabrizio Marangoni wrote to us at press time to say that his main chef was on 
vacation during a period of time that, we would discover, overlaps with some of 
our review visits. That fact noted, play it safe and reduce your risk by 
choosing carefully and making clear your preferences on salt. Details

TOP OFFICIALS GO INTO SECLUSION IN CITY STUNNED BY KILLING OF OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The shooting deaths of two Palos Verdes Estates police officers continued to 
traumatize the small South Bay city Wednesday, with questions remaining about 
the killer's motive and the role of officers who subdued -- and apparently 
killed -- him. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Gary Johansen and City Manager James Henrickson, both of whom 
witnessed the killings Monday in a Torrance hotel, went into seclusion, 
refusing to speak about the deaths and referring questions to a public 
relations specialist from the nearby Redondo Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is now time for these gentlemen to rest and to begin attending to their 
personal needs and professional duties," Palos Verdes Estates Mayor Michael C. 
Moody said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Dave Smith of the Torrance Police Department, which is investigating the 
deaths of the two officers and the gunman, said Redondo Beach Lt. Jeffrey 
Cameron will act as an impartial spokesman for Palos Verdes Estates until the 
Police Department gets back on its own feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting deaths of Capt. Michael Tracy, 50, and Sgt. Vernon Thomas 
Vanderpool, 57, were the first in the department's history and have so 
overwhelmed the tiny police force that city streets are being patrolled by 
officers from neighboring departments, and a team of Los Angeles police has 
been summoned to help organize funeral arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service for the two officers has been scheduled for 10 a.m. Monday 
at Rolling Hills Covenant Church in Rolling Hills Estates. The funeral 
procession will proceed to Green Hills Cemetery in Rancho Palos Verdes, where 
there will also be a memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Johansen, who considered Tracy his best friend, lost his temper 
with reporters when asked about circumstances surrounding the gunman's death. 
"Two of my best officers died yesterday," he said at the time. "You think I 
care (how David Fukuto died)? I don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death remains an official mystery because the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office, at the request of prosecutors, has not released autopsy 
results. But there are reports that Fukuto died of a head injury during a 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to coping with the loss of the two veteran officers, the 23-member 
Palos Verdes Estates police force must also deal with ongoing investigations 
into the circumstances surrounding Fukuto's death. Independent investigations 
into the incident are under way by the Torrance Police Department and the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Botula, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said Wednesday 
that it is very unusual for prosecutors to request the temporary sealing of 
autopsy information. Botula said prosecutors could recall only a few such cases 
in recent years, all of them involving officer-related deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 County coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said his office receives "about five 
or 10 requests a year" from various law enforcement agencies to keep autopsy 
information confidential. In the Fukuto case, the decision to request 
confidentiality for 45 days was made by the district attorney's special 
investigations division, which is assigned to investigate all officer-related 
deaths, but Botula said the request should not be interpreted as an indication 
"that we're suspicious something improper was done." 
</P>
<P>
 But several attorneys and legal scholars said Wednesday that if the autopsies 
are sealed for long, it could undermine public confidence in the actions of the 
officers who subdued Fukuto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless they resolve this quickly, it suggests a cover-up of some kind," said 
Southwestern University School of Law professor Robert A. Pugsley. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal lawyer Hugh Manes, who specializes in police brutality cases, added: 
"I would be much more ready to accept the notion that the perpetrator was 
killed in reaction or in protection of others now than I would be 30 or 45 days 
from now. This will probably cost them a lot more in terms of public suspicion 
than if they let us have access to it from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 However, other legal observers suggested that it may prove wise to keep the 
autopsies confidential until each person who was in the hotel room is 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a case like this where they really do want to get all the witnesses' 
statements, they want to be careful none of the statements are influenced by 
the official coroner's report," said Loyola University Law School professor 
Laurie Levenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, police continued to search for an explanation for Fukuto's assault 
on the Torrance hotel meeting room, where 13 city officials and police were 
attending a motivational seminar. The owner of a Carson gun store said 
Wednesday that Fukuto, a gun enthusiast and son of a prominent appeals court 
jurist, once worked at Ranger Sales, a competing gun shop on Torrance Boulevard 
that closed under suspicious circumstances in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that the owner ran off and took all the guns and left a lot of 
people looking for him," said Daniel J. Rickard, who leased the space to 
Woodrow Weld, who, according to corporate records, was the proprietor of the 
gun shop. "He just closed up shop one day and locked the doors and never opened 
up again." 
</P>

NEWS ANALYSIS; PENSION REFORM VOTE SIGNALS NEW DIVIDE ON COUNTY BOARD; 
POLITICS: SPLIT IS EMERGING BETWEEN OLD AND NEW, RATHER THAN CONSERVATIVES AND 
LIBERALS. FIRST-TERM SUPERVISORS PUSH OPEN DISCUSSION, OTHER REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In the end, the County Board of Supervisors' vote to postpone the toughest 
decisions on pension reforms had less to do with the conservative/liberal split 
that traditionally defines the board than it did with an emerging divide 
between the old and the new. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the two new kids on the block, first-term Supervisors Gloria Molina and 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who led the fight to reform the controversial 
retirement plan, which had been implemented in 1990 prior to their election. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was the three veteran supervisors -- Ed Edelman, completing his fifth 
term, and Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana, both in their fourth terms -- who 
pulled together a bipartisan coalition to block some of the most far-reaching 
reform measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the dynamic here," Molina said. "It's more than the old labels of 
conservative and liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 The pension issue and the board's vote illustrate a changing of the guard that 
is under way in county government, not only on the board but also within the 
senior management ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 When Edelman retires in December, three long-term incumbents will have left 
the board in just four years. Former Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. 
Dixon, the man responsible for implementing the pension rules, was forced out 
of office last year. In the wake of his departure, several other long-term 
department heads and managers have also left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're on the verge of some real change," Burke said, adding that she 
believes the veteran supervisors were reluctant to change the pension rules 
because they were adopted on their watch. 
</P>
<P>
 As the changes shake out, they are making for some strange politics. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the board was asked to eliminate some controversial pension 
benefits for new employees and scale them back for existing employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Advocates said the complete reform plan could have saved the county more than 
$30 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The two most liberal members of the board led the fight to tighten the purse 
strings, while the self-styled fiscal conservatives -- Antonovich and Dana -- 
fought to maintain most of a pension plan widely criticized as overly generous 
and self-serving. Edelman, traditionally labeled a liberal, shared their view 
that more limited reforms were fairer to workers and joined the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the board voted to negotiate with county unions to end the 
benefits for new employees but chose not to halt the benefits immediately for 
new, non-union management employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also balked at scaling back benefits for the thousands of existing 
employees, though they agreed to consider next week a watered-down proposal to 
limit some growth in future benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the majority block formed by the three veterans may be short-lived. 
Already Molina is saying that if she cannot cannot get the rest of her reform 
package through at next week's board session, she will wait for December, when 
Edelman's successor is sworn into office. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Wednesday, the likely successor, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, weighed in on the controversy and committed himself to be the 
third vote to push through a comprehensive reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 "If elected, I will vote to rescind the pension spiking," Yaroslavsky said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a liberal, conservative issue," Yaroslavsky said. "It's the 
newcomers with less invested in the pension plan versus the others who may be 
in their last terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The party is over, or at least it will be in December," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The pension rules, revealed by The Times two years ago, were adopted without a 
public vote of the supervisors or any study of their financial impact. They 
dramatically increased pensions by counting the value of fringe benefits, such 
as health insurance, as compensation for the purposes of calculating retirement 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the unusual pension rules, some senior executives and elected officials 
would earn more in retirement pay than they do on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 In the debate on the pension reforms Tuesday, Rebecca Taylor, representing 
three of the state's largest taxpayer organizations, chided the board for not 
fully disclosing its initial decision to increase pensions of the most highly 
paid managers and elected officials. (Since then, similar but smaller benefits 
have been granted to most other county employees.)  
</P>
<P>
 "You're acting as if it's a club here," said Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor was expressing a persistent criticism that the supervisors tend to 
operate behind closed doors. Molina has lodged that complaint since she first 
ran for the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got here I felt I had to bring (the county) out of the shadows," 
Molina said. She said she is starting to do that by bringing the pension issue 
back before the board.

FOUR KILLED IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE; VIOLENCE: WOMAN, EX-HUSBAND, THEIR SON 
AND HER BOYFRIEND ARE FOUND SHOT TO DEATH IN HOME. AN INVESTIGATION IS 
CONTINUING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A woman, her ex-husband, their 12-year-old son and her boyfriend were found 
shot to death Wednesday in an apparent murder-suicide on a peaceful, tree-lined 
street in South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Jane Larsen, 49; Gene Larsen, 64; Ben Larsen, 12, and Michael 
O'Brien, 44, were discovered in a tiny beige house in the 1000 block of 
Foothill Street shortly before 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were tight-lipped about the killings, but sheriff's officers, who 
joined South Pasadena police in the investigation, acknowledged that Gene 
Larsen brought a 12-gauge shotgun to the house and that the recently finalized 
divorce may have been the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point," said sheriff's spokesman Fidel Gonzales, "we can't tell who 
did the shooting, but the former husband came to the house. The divorce was 
final last week and it probably had something to do with this." 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-gauge shotgun and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun were found at the 
scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that at least three of the victims had been killed with the 
shotgun: Ben was shot in the head and arm, Gene Larsen was shot once in the 
chest and Michael O'Brien was shot in the head. No details were available 
regarding the weapon that killed Jane Larsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Larsen was described by acquaintances as a man with a bad temper who 
could not accept the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Larsen taught disabled children in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. Gene Larsen was an insurance agent and Ben was a student at South 
Pasadena Junior High School. O'Brien taught children with learning disabilities 
for the South Pasadena School District. 
</P>
<P>
 A horrified neighbor discovered Ben's body sitting upright in the living room 
of the house his mother had rented about a year ago after the breakup of her 
marriage. Police found the bodies of the adults in a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned school officials had phoned a neighbor when Ben failed to show up 
for class Wednesday morning. The neighbor peeked through a window of Ben's 
home, saw the body of the youth and ran screaming to the home of Ricardo 
Delgado across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado entered the home and saw a boy sitting on the couch as though he was 
watching television. Overhead, a shiny red banner was strung across the room, 
reading: "Be My Valentine." Everything looked in perfect order, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado described himself and other neighbors as "depressed as hell. We're 
shocked and mad that it's always going on and seems to get worse -- the 
violence. And that we can't prevent it and that it happened to really nice, 
sweet people that don't deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lucile Baker, who was a neighbor of the Larsens for about six years when they 
lived on nearby Collis Avenue, said Jane Larsen "was always afraid" of her 
husband. "He was always smarter than you or you or you. That's why she had to 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said that Jane Larsen was unable to continue making the mortgage 
payments on the Collis Avenue house after the separation and rented the little 
home on Foothill Street. The property belongs to Caltrans because it is in the 
right of way of the long-proposed extension of the Long Beach Freeway through 
South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jane was a wonderful lady," Baker said. "She had a wonderful son."  
</P>
<P>
 Gene Larsen worked for the Prudential insurance company in Pasadena until he 
quit in September. A fellow employee, who declined to be identified, described 
him as "a little forceful. Everything was wrong with the company and that sort 
of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 A former neighbor who asked not to be identified said that Gene Larsen was a 
good father who would take Ben on helicopter rides in connection with his 
membership in a military reserve unit. But he said Larsen "wasn't a good 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Jane Larsen told him a few years ago that her husband was 
carrying guns and recently said he could not accept the finality of their 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Adelson, superintendent of South Pasadena Unified School District, praised 
both Jane Larsen's son and Michael O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 "An outstanding, delightful young man with outstanding citizenship," he said 
of Ben, who was an "A" student. Adelson said that a crisis intervention team is 
being sent to Ben's school to help students deal with his death. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that O'Brien, who taught at Monterey Hills School, "was a great guy, a 
warm, friendly, caring person." 
</P>
<P>
 Adelson said parents of O'Brien's learning-impaired students were being urged 
to come to school with their children today to help them deal with their grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are fragile kids," he said, "and we feel it will be a real support to 
have the parents there."

3 HELD IN BANK ROBBERY; POLICE RESCUE WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An apparent attempt to rob a Long Beach bank was interrupted Wednesday by 
police, who kept the institution surrounded for nearly five hours before 
storming inside to free four employees who were hiding in a vault. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident, which began shortly after noon at the Bank 
of Long Beach on Ximeno Avenue near the city's bustling traffic circle, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commotion lasted well into the night as teams of Long Beach police, 
assisted by FBI agents, arrested first one teen-age boy and then two others 
found hiding on the bank's second floor. All three suspects are believed to be 
juveniles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Kerr, a spokeswoman for the Long Beach Police Department, said police 
got word of the incident from a group of bank employees, apparently on their 
way to lunch, who stopped a motorcycle officer to report that three 
suspicious-looking people had just walked into the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer approached the bank with one of the employees, and reached the 
glass door just in time to see someone vault over the counter into the tellers' 
area, Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr said the officer radioed for help, and within 60 seconds, seven squad 
cars had surrounded the bank. As officers headed toward the door, it suddenly 
opened and one of the suspects stepped into the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freeze!" officers shouted, but the suspect instead retreated back into the 
bank and disappeared, Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation marked the beginning of the afternoon-long siege during 
which the bank was surrounded and cordoned off by FBI and police SWAT teams. 
Two major thoroughfares were blocked during the incident, and more than 50 
people were evacuated from nearby businesses and apartments, Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Kerr said, the officers believed there were seven people inside the 
bank -- the three suspects and four bank employees who were at tellers' booths. 
But 40 minutes into the standoff, she said, they were proven wrong when the 
door opened and an elderly man strolled out onto the sidewalk and into a human 
wall of rifle-toting SWAT officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Startled, the man told police that he had been secluded in the safe deposit 
box area of the bank, and had no idea that anything unusual was happening, Kerr 
said. He appeared to have been the only customer inside. 
</P>
<P>
 As the hours ticked by, Kerr said, police managed to contact the employees, 
four women who told authorities they had locked themselves in the vault at the 
beginning of the incident and had hidden there the rest of the day. Kerr would 
not say how the women had managed to speak to authorities, but other officials 
noted that the vault is equipped with a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, at 4:45 p.m., after attempts to contact the suspects by bullhorn had 
failed, the Long Beach police SWAT team stormed the bank's first floor, 
exploding three flash-bang grenades. Officers emerged with the four women, who 
were later described by FBI Special Agent John Hoos as "safe and scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and FBI agents said they arrested the three suspects between 9 p.m. and 
9:40 p.m. on the bank's second floor. The three were unarmed when they were 
captured, although the bank employees said that at least one of the alleged 
robbers had previously been armed with a pistol, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr said the incident was the second robbery attempt in the last four months 
at the bank. In November, she said, three men staged a takeover-style robbery 
at the institution. She would not say how much, if any, money was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials, however, said they do not believe there is any connection 
between the two robberies.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
BALKS AT COST OF SEISMIC WORK ON CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Council members are balking at a recommendation to spend $153 
million to make earthquake safety improvements at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly I want to preserve this building, which has some historic value," 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said at a meeting of the council's Administrative 
Services Committee."But you have to ask, 'Is all this necessary, compared to 
other seismic needs we have in the city?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But City Architect William A. Holland said enough money will be left from a 
$376-million bond measure to strengthen the dozens of buildings and bridges 
that are in need of the work. The cost of strengthening the 66-year-old 
building jumped from the initial $92.3-million estimate after a more careful 
review by engineers, Holland said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: UNIVERSAL CITY; 
COMPROMISE OFFERED ON MCA COMPLEX SUBWAY STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City transit officials have proposed a compromise for the Universal City Metro 
Rail station that would preserve the planned Lankershim Boulevard site but 
better serve the MCA entertainment complex, potentially satisfying key demands 
by the multimedia company and county transportation planners. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA has pushed hard to move the subway station to the doorstep of its 
Universal Studios and CityWalk complex -- a proposal resisted by county 
transportation planners as being too costly and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 But city analysts say in a report that the new Red Line station could remain 
on Lankershim but should include an entrance on the Universal Studios lot up 
the hill, with shuttle service between the gates and the station. Access to the 
entertainment center would therefore be improved without the added delays and 
costs of moving the station directly onto the Universal Studios lot, as MCA has 
lobbied for. 
</P>
<P>
 Both MCA executives and officials of the county Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority said Wednesday that the proposal appears workable, fueling hope that 
the long-running disagreement between MCA and the transit agency over station 
location could be near an end.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FATHER 
SUES DISTRICT OVER SHOOTING OF SON AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charging that the Los Angeles Unified School District failed to provide 
adequate supervision and security for his children, the father of a Dorsey High 
School student who was shot on the first day of school sued the district for $5 
million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by attorney Melanie Lomax, 
alleges that the 15-year-old boy was shot and critically wounded while waiting 
in an unsupervised registration area at Dorsey in September.An 18-year-old gang 
member, who did not attend Dorsey, has been arraigned on attempted murder 
charges and is awaiting trial. Glenn Browne, the victim's father, said the 
school should have provided better supervision and metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials said they believe the campuses are safe and that the 
shooting did not indicate a lack of school supervision. The district believes 
it has no liability in the case, officials said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EL SEGUNDO; CHARGES 
FILED AGAINST 4 IN SLAYING OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Murder and attempted murder charges were filed this week against four people 
in the slaying of the daughter of an El Segundo City Council member and an 
attack on her adopted daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Brendon Foster, 18, Linnette O'Neill Blocker, 18, Marcus Terral 
Brewington, 19, and Erica Dawn Olson, 20, were charged with murder with the 
special circumstances of killing during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, they could face the death penalty. The charges came in the death 
of Tairree Lynne West, 25, the daughter of Councilman Alan West. Her adopted 
daughter, 12-year-old Ashley, was stabbed in the neck. The dead woman's 
4-month-old daughter also was gagged during the attack last Wednesday at West's 
apartment in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said one of the motives was robbery, but West and Foster also were 
involved in a dispute related to Foster's romantic relationship with Olson, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven G. Levine. Levine said Olson was a baby-sitter 
for the infant, and had a key to the apartment. Police said Olson may have been 
living in West's house in exchange for child care. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants were ordered held without bail, with arraignment set for March 
1.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FEMA 
BEGINS CLOSING QUAKE ASSISTANCE CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Wednesday began shutting down its 
one-stop assistance centers for quake victims, a day short of today's one-month 
anniversary of the magnitude 6.8 temblor that forced hundreds of thousands of 
people to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, the service centers had distributed nearly $230 million in 
grants and loans and processed more than 340,000 applications -- including 
87,000 from those who walked into the centers, which were opened three days 
after the quake to provide victims one place at which to fill out applications 
to federal, state and local agencies for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two centers to close were at the Glendale Civic Center Auditorium 
and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley on Wednesday. Centers 
in Santa Monica, Santa Clarita and Newhall will close Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The center at Calabasas High School will close Saturday, when FEMA begins 
phasing in the second part of its disaster assistance program by opening 
Earthquake Service Centers at 1901 S. Bundy in Santa Monica and 28460 Avenue 
Stanford in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Disaster Assistance Centers helped victims fill out applications for 
aid, the Earthquake Service Centers will provide follow-up assistance as 
applications are processed. Rita Kepner, a FEMA spokeswoman, said that 
eventually all of the Disaster Assistance Centers will be replaced by 10 new 
Earthquake Service Centers.

GORE VISITS CSUN, PRAISES RECOVERY; QUAKE: VICE PRESIDENT SAYS U.S. WILL 'GO 
ALL OUT' TO HELP HEAVILY DAMAGED CAMPUS. APPEARANCE IS LATEST WHITE HOUSE 
GESTURE TO REASSURE SOUTHLAND OF ASSISTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Aiming to highlight the region's recovery from the earthquake, Vice President 
Al Gore on Wednesday told a crowd of several thousand people at recently 
reopened Cal State Northridge that the federal government will "go all out" to 
assist in the heavily damaged campus' restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson said Gore's 35-minute visit, coupled with a 
telephone call Monday from President Clinton, has convinced her that the 
federal government will do its share for the campus, which sustained an 
estimated $250 million to $350 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want you to know that while no one can make everyone whole as a result of 
what happened here, we certainly can go all out to do everything humanly 
possible to do what can be done," Gore said, although he made no specific 
commitments of federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, at Clinton's request, added the CSUN visit to his planned trip to 
Washington state. Aides said the visit to CSUN was arranged because the campus 
had suffered so much damage and had managed to reopen Monday for the spring 
semester only two weeks late. 
</P>
<P>
 "This college has been hit harder than any college ever in history. And yet 
you have bounced back faster and more completely than anyone," Gore said, 
standing amid some of the hundreds of portable buildings that have become the 
campus' classrooms since the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus officials have said CSUN's damage is the costliest ever for a U.S. 
university, with virtually every major classroom building on campus closed at 
least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit was the latest in a series of gestures by Clinton Administration 
officials designed to convince Southern Californians, whether they were victims 
of the earthquake or of last year's fires, that the federal government will 
fulfill disaster-response obligations. Because of its large population, the 
state is considered politically important to the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus officials are counting on the federal government to pay 90% of their 
recovery costs including, for example, the nearly $6 million in rental costs 
for the portable classrooms this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Slow progress was reported Wednesday toward making all of the portable 
classrooms operational. Some classes had to be held outside with students 
sitting on folding chairs, and officials said they were rushing to beat the 
rain expected today.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Gore visited the Devonshire Mason Plaza shopping center in 
Chatsworth, where earthquake damage forced all major stores and some smaller 
ones to close. The vice president chatted with the owners of about half a dozen 
stores, posed for pictures and signed autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Magid, manager of the 118,000-square-foot complex owned by his parents, 
said he agreed to host the state and federal officials and news crews that 
accompanied Gore in the hope that some aid would be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the government to service my tenants. Talk is cheap. We'll see what 
happens in two weeks or a month from now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Rodriguez, owner of the Pacific Aquatics West tropical fish store that 
Gore visited, said his shop has been closed since the quake. He said he is 
awaiting word on a federal Small Business Administration loan. Without it, he 
will not be able to reopen, he said, because he has no earthquake insurance.

ATTACK ON TEACHER FUELS DISPUTE OVER SECURITY; VIOLENCE: PASADENA SCHOOL 
OFFICIALS CALL THE BEATING AN ISOLATED INCIDENT THAT THE VICTIM COULD HAVE 
PREVENTED. BUT SOME IN THE DISTRICT CALL FOR BEEFED-UP PATROLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Physical education teacher Pamela Altea remembers being punched 10 times in 
the face by an apparent gang member who had walked onto the campus of 
Washington Middle School in Pasadena, where she teaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hit me right by the temple and nearly knocked me down," she said. "Then he 
kept beating me and beating me." 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Altea is afraid to return to the school to teach, tighter 
security is being called for at Pasadena schools and school officials say the 
attack is an isolated incident that could have been prevented if Altea had 
followed correct security procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 As Altea was about to drive away from the school Feb. 10 about 9:50 a.m., she 
noticed two teen-agers dressed in gang attire approaching a gate to the campus. 
She had left the gate open because of a faulty lock, Altea said. She got out of 
her car and was telling the two youths they were not allowed on campus when one 
of them began hitting her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was screaming and terrified and shaking, and he was just staring in my 
eyes, and I thought, 'Oh no, he's going to finish me off because I've 
identified him,' " said Altea, who has taught at the 750-student school for 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no written district policy on locking gates, Washington 
Principal Karen Kommer said it is standard procedure at the school to relock 
gates after they have been opened. Altea made a mistake by walking away with 
the gate open, Kommer said. When she discovered the lock was broken, Altea 
should have immediately notified a security aide on campus, Kommer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teacher put herself in jeopardy in this incident," Kommer said.  
</P>
<P>
 School board President George Van Alstine agreed. "Had the gate not been left 
open, the attack wouldn't have happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this attack was an anomaly, and I don't think this is likely to 
happen again on campus. I don't think faculty or students need to be looking 
over their shoulders all the time," Van Alstine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Vera Vignes and Jarado J. Blue, chief of the district's police force, 
also said Altea should not have left the gate open. But they are seeking more 
money to beef up security on campuses. Statistics for the district from 
October, 1992, to June, 1993, show that more than 300 crimes were reported. 
About 36 of those crimes, including an assault with a deadly weapon, three 
cases of battery and several burglaries, occurred on or near the Washington 
campus.  
</P>
<P>
 The district's seven police officers started carrying handguns in November, 
1992, after there were a dozen run-ins with armed students. The district has 31 
unarmed security aides who also patrol the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget constraints are slowing the hiring of two additional officers but 
Vignes told the Pasadena City Council on Tuesday that she hopes to hire the 
officers by the end of this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Vignes agreed to a request from the council to compile an updated list of 
crime statistics by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a very hard time convincing my peers in other parts of (Los 
Angeles County) with kids that it's a good decision to move to Pasadena," said 
Councilman Bill Crowfoot, because of fears that recent violence, including the 
killing last Halloween of three teen-agers, will keep people and businesses 
away from Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 United Teachers of Pasadena President Frank Scoonover agreed that more 
security is needed at the schools, although he acknowledged that Altea may have 
made a mistake in confronting the youths and leaving the gate open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this district needs to pay more attention to security," he said. 
There was an incident at Muir High School on Feb. 8 involving guns, he said. 
"It is very scary being a teacher nowadays."

2 TODDLERS KILLED IN HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A garage that had been converted into a bedroom became a deathtrap for two 
toddlers who died early Wednesday just strides away from a man who was unable 
to rescue them as fire swept through the bedroom and an adjoining house in 
Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 David Glen Moore, 2, and his brother, Maceo Davonne Moore, 1, died in the fire 
that broke out shortly before 1:30 a.m. in the 3200 block of Palm Avenue, 
Lynwood fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Hunter, 41, who was sleeping in a den connected to the boys' bedroom, 
was awakened when he heard them screaming in terror, said Andrew Brim, who 
rents the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter opened the door to the boys' bedroom and was met with intense heat and 
smoke, said Brim, 63. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could see the kids when he first opened the door, but he couldn't get to 
them," Brim said. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's spokesman said an autopsy is scheduled for today to determine if 
the boys died of burns or smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an electric heater in the boys' bedroom, Lynwood Assistant Fire 
Chief William Schultz said, but the cause of the fire is still under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter awakened Brim and a baby-sitter who gathered up three other children, 
ages 1, 3 and 4, and escaped from the fire through a kitchen door. Brim said he 
has custody of those three children, whose mother is incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
 The back half of the house was burning, and "fire was rolling out of windows 
in the den" when firefighters arrived, Schultz said, adding that firefighters 
extinguished the blaze in less than half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead boys' mother, Gina Hodge, 26, had gone to a store before the fire 
erupted, Brim said. She was so distraught when she returned and learned that 
her sons were dead that she was taken to St. Francis Medical Center, where she 
was treated and released, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brim said that about a month ago he had allowed Hodge and her two children to 
move into the converted garage without paying rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some friends asked me to let her stay there until she could get on her feet," 
he said. "I loved those little kids. I played with them every day. They thought 
I was their daddy." 
</P>
<P>
 Brim said the house's owner, who has moved to Alabama, converted the garage to 
a bedroom for his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz said the fire caused more than $80,000 in damage to the building and 
its contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cleaned me out," Brim said. "I don't have any insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire is yet another indication of the desperate means that poor families 
may be forced to take to find shelter. Unable to afford better housing, many 
are cramming into garages and back-yard sheds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, more than 30,000 families live in garages or storage rooms, 
according to a January, 1993, study by the city's Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood officials said they are investigating whether the garage conversion 
was legal, but they noted that it is illegal in California to sleep in a 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is also illegal to sleep in a room with a door that opens to a garage," 
said Bill Palmer, Lynwood's manager of building and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that it is virtually impossible to determine from the street if a 
garage has been converted and that his inspectors cannot enter at random. 
Illegal conversions usually come to his department's attention when they are 
reported by neighbors, he said.

CHILD PORNOGRAPHY SUSPECT ARRESTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, police in Joplin, Mo., have arrested a Canyon Country man who 
was on the U.S. Customs Service's 10 most wanted list on suspicion of 
transporting child pornography from Thailand, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Alan Nelson, 45, was arrested Feb. 4, said Joseph Charles, assistant 
special agent in charge of the Los Angeles customs office.Nelson had attempted 
to conceal his identity by growing a beard, dying his hair and carrying false 
identification, Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson had been a fugitive since 1992, when he fled after federal authorities 
seized "numerous photographs" of Thai boys engaged in sex acts, Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was wanted on suspicion of committing lewd acts with a child under 14, 
authorities said.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; PASSING ALONG THE WORD TO 
SAVE YIDDISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Archie Barkan seems an unlikely guardian of history. A stand-up comedian who 
has emceed in the Borscht Belt of New York's Catskill Mountains and the resorts 
of the Poconos and Miami Beach, he peppers his jokes with Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Barkan, the future of Yiddish is no joke. He wants to preserve what 
many call a dying language. 
</P>
<P>
 Yiddish developed a thousand years ago as a form of medieval High German using 
the Hebrew alphabet. The Ashkenazi Jews who settled in Central and Northern 
Europe after the Diaspora added the languages of their new countries and 
Yiddish became a mix of German, Hebrew, Russian, English and Polish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yiddish has a certain charm to it that has to do with it being a wandering 
language. It had no base," said the 64-year-old Barkan, who seems almost too 
gentle, too soft-spoken for his profession as a comedian. 
</P>
<P>
 What some consider to be the death knell for Yiddish came when Hebrew was 
chosen as the official language of Israel. Today, many young Jews worldwide who 
study a second language choose Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yiddish is on the decline for exactly that reason," he said. "Generally 
speaking, the young people don't learn the language enough to read a book." 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers speak volumes: In 1990, 213,064 people in the United States spoke 
Yiddish, down from 315,953 only a decade before, according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau. In 1990, Los Angeles County reported 6,716 Yiddish speakers, a mere 
0.02% of the population. In the San Fernando Valley, 3,013 residents speak 
Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
 For Barkan, Yiddish is the language of his father, of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was a Yiddish writer and educator," he said. "Even though I was 
born in Philadelphia, I knew Yiddish as a first language." 
</P>
<P>
 In comedy acts and classrooms, Barkan is making sure the language isn't 
relegated to the pages of history books and encyclopedias. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is mostly a labor of love," he said. "Whatever is done to keep the 
language alive, I think is worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkan began teaching Yiddish in the 1970s out of a respect for the 
mame-loshen, the mother language. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it has a real homey sound. The expressions are unique in that there's 
more folksiness in the language than any other that I know of -- a sort of wry 
humor in the expressionism," he said. "That sort of 'laughing with tears in my 
eyes' approach." 
</P>
<P>
 His students share the sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an old language that has much history," said Gert Appleby, 71, of Encino 
during a break in Barkan's class at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino. "I was born 
in Poland and Yiddish was the language spoken at home. I just don't get a 
chance that often to use it. For me it's important to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the problems the language faces is that at the same time younger Jews 
are learning Hebrew, speakers of Yiddish are dying off, Barkan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yiddish fell by the wayside and the people who used it died out," Barkan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman in Barkan's class speaks Hebrew but is learning Yiddish out of a 
sort of nostalgia and respect. It was the language her parents spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad because nobody speaks it anymore," said Marcia Plager, 54, of 
Encino. "In 50 years, no one will speak it." 
</P>
<P>
 They will if Archie Barkan can help it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that it's important to carry on the heritage. I think everyone has to 
remember where they are from," he said. "The importance is the Jewish 
Ashkenazim life was steeped in Yiddish all these years. The immigrant 
experience in America was all Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are those who say, 'Why do we need two languages?' " he said. "It's 
heritage. It's roots." 
</P>
<P>
 But Barkan too has faced obstacles and losses. Until a few years ago, Barkan 
said, he used to correspond in Yiddish with an uncle who lived in Israel. But 
that uncle died. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I don't think I have anyone to write to in Yiddish anymore," he said.

NFL RUSHES SPRING ROSTER CLEANING; PRO FOOTBALL: RAMS SEEKING A QUARTERBACK, 
RAIDERS A RUNNING BACK FROM MORE THAN 400 FREE AGENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Proving once again that it adheres to no laws but its own, the NFL will 
declare Friday the first day of spring, setting loose more than 400 free agents 
into the hands of teams seeking rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a time for worry for the Dallas Cowboys. Potential losers of 16 
players who helped them win their second consecutive Super Bowl, they are 
already on the verge of losing defensive leader Ken Norton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Norton has decided to negotiate a contract with the Miami 
Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 But for everyone else, it is a time to hope. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Rams, it is a time to find their new quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 They can try to sign oft-injured Chris Miller of the Atlanta Falcons, who told 
his agent he wants to play here. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they can pursue a trade for either Warren Moon of the Houston Oilers or 
Jeff George of the Indianapolis Colts, both of whom are being shopped here, 
according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
 With four draft choices in the first three rounds available for dealing, and 
with room available under the impending salary cap after Jim Everett is traded 
to one of several quarterback-hungry teams, the Rams could make either 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are exploring a lot of options," said John Shaw, Ram vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox once attempted to acquire Moon while coaching the Seattle 
Seahawks. And Knox is known to admire George's natural ability, despite his 
off-field problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have said there are no untouchables on this team, and Jeff George is a 
member of this team," said Bill Tobin, Colt general manager. "We are willing to 
talk about anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Raiders, it is a time to find their new running back. 
</P>
<P>
 They can attempt to sign Lorenzo White of the Oilers, the best of a weak 
free-agent bunch. They are also known to be interested in Minnesota's Barry 
Word. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they can look over their shoulder and find Christian Okoye, former Pro Bowl 
running back of the Kansas City Chiefs who missed last season after undergoing 
arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Okoye, who lives in the Southland and is working out daily at Chaffey College 
in Rancho Cucamonga, said this week that he tried out for the Raiders in 
December. But his knee had not yet recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The knee is fine now, and I would play for the Raiders before I played for 
anybody else," said Okoye, 32, who gained 1,031 yards in 1991. "I want to stay 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the impending salary cap and restrictions caused by the 
"transition" and "franchise" designations that organizations have placed on 
their best free agents, most believe that there will not be as much movement as 
there was last spring. During the wild first months of the labor agreement, 120 
players changed teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the lucrative recent television deal has set the cap at a level 
that is considered manageable, $34 million, and because there is a salary 
floor, $30 million, that causes the cheaper teams to increase their payroll, 
the players are still not stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference this year will be (that) teams will pick one or two or three 
guys to sign and that's it," said Bob Ackles, assistant general manager of the 
Phoenix Cardinals. "There will still be movement, but there will be an awful 
lot more players out there who will be upset." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals are the expected destination of this year's top free agent, 
linebacker Seth Joyner of the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan, the Cardinals' new coach and general manager, has told employees 
that he is eager for a reunion with his former Pro Bowl player. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner heads an impressive list of available linebackers that includes Norton, 
Tony Bennett of the Green Bay Packers and Dante Jones of the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Hill, the top young Phoenix linebacker, is also a free agent and should 
be in great demand. But the Cardinals recently named him a transition player. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that Phoenix has the right to match any offer for him, and the 
offer must be the average of the top 10 players at that position. 
</P>
<P>
 Translated, he probably isn't going anywhere. Only two transition players 
changed teams last year, and in both cases the contracts contained loopholes 
that are no longer allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other free-agent stars who instantly became unattractive this week because of 
similar designations include Deion Sanders and Michael Haynes of the Falcons, 
Anthony Miller of the San Diego Chargers, Tim Brown of the Raiders, Clyde 
Simmons of the Eagles, Eric Green of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cris Dishman 
of the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no franchise or transition quarterbacks in this year's free-agent 
group. With only three potential impact starters on the list -- the Falcons' 
Miller, Erik Kramer of the Detroit Lions and Scott Mitchell of the Miami 
Dolphins -- quarterback has become the hottest position. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, who showed potential while relieving injured Dan Marino last season, 
will make his first visits to New Orleans, Chicago and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears are more serious about Kramer, who will also be heavily wooed by his 
current team, which will have no quarterbacks under contract beginning Friday. 
The Lions are content to allow reserves Rodney Peete and Andre Ware to go 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Also seeking quarterbacks are the Falcons, who have decided that Bobby Hebert 
is too damaged, and the Washington Redskins, who have the third pick in the 
draft and will address their problem there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, due to select fifth, would also love one of the top two collegians 
available -- Trent Dilfer of Fresno State or Heath Shuler of Tennessee. But 
both will probably be gone by the time the Rams choose. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the losers in the free-agent quarterback sweepstakes -- those who 
cannot acquire George or Moon? Jim Everett is waiting.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; HE'S WELL; HECKMAN HAS HEALTHY OUTLOOK AFTER 
SURGERY FOR LUNG TUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 19, Ryan Heckman is a changed young Olympian. No more 
winning-is-the-only-thing for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have a much more lighthearted respect for the Olympic Games now," 
he said the other day. "I think it's easy as a young adult to get caught up in 
the performance syndrome. You know, people are really nice to you when you do 
well and sometimes they're not nice when you do poorly. Having gone through 
some setbacks and almost hit rock bottom a couple times, I'm just here to have 
fun. I think that's the most important part of athletics." 
</P>
<P>
 A big scare can do that to you. And Heckman had a big scare, a lung tumor "the 
size of a sweet potato." 
</P>
<P>
 It was discovered late in August, just as Heckman, of Steamboat Springs, 
Colo., was about to start the most intensive part of his training regimen for 
Nordic combined, which includes both ski jumping and cross-country skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was between my lung and my spine," Heckman said of the tumor. "That's why 
we had to move so swiftly on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The tumor turned out to be benign, but nobody knew that until several days 
after he'd had a painful biopsy. And in the meantime, Heckman, who as a 
17-year-old wunderkind was known at the 1992 Albertville Games as "the Speck," 
thought his life as an athlete might be over. In fact, he thought his life 
might be over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the worst," he said. "I thought I had cancer. I thought, 'Wow, I've 
had such a good life until now and this is why it's been so good, 'cause it's 
going to end right now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Heckman was stunned to learn that there was something seriously wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get out of bed in the morning," he said. "I was having a hard time 
just doing anything. Since (the tumor) was so close to my spine, I was putting 
it out of place and I couldn't move my back and it hurt to put pressure on my 
right side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still trained and just took a lot of (painkiller). With rigorous training 
you're always in some pain, so I didn't really think anything of it. I went to 
a chiropractor and he adjusted me and it was way better, but then an hour later 
it was bad again." 
</P>
<P>
 Then one morning he couldn't get out of bed at all and finally agreed to see a 
doctor, who recommended a CAT scan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctors, when they saw it on the CAT scan, kind of took my parents aside 
and told them they thought it was malignant," he said. "I had a biopsy done 
that afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 And after that, surgery to remove the mass. The biopsy was worse than the 
surgery, Heckman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally you'd be (anesthetized), but I had specific breathing instructions 
so we wouldn't puncture the lung. So, I had to be in a CAT-scan machine and I 
had to breathe in when they had to go in with this thing. It was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 The removal surgery was no picnic, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did thorascopic surgery," he said. "They go in like they would (for) a 
knee surgery with arthroscopic instruments and they cut it out and get it so 
it's free moving. Then they open you up, four to six inches, and actually just 
pull it out. But in order to get inside your pleural cavity, they have to break 
ribs and it's not very comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 So, suddenly, Heckman was trying to come back from a serious operation, as 
well as an off year. 
</P>
<P>
 "After '92 (in Albertville), we switched to the V-style (of jumping) and I had 
problems with that," he said. "I always jumped with my skis out in front of me. 
Making the change was tough because my skis under me were my security blanket." 
</P>
<P>
 In his eagerness not to fall behind, Heckman said, he ran four days after the 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mistake," he added. "It was a big setback. I wasn't able to train 
for a month after that." 
</P>
<P>
 And during that month, Heckman took a look at his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were constantly badgering me about when my return was going to be, 
'When is the old Speck going to be back?' and it all kind of caught up to me," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to grow up in athletics, I think. You'll notice that in '92, Toni 
Nieminen (then a 16-year-old from Finland) was absolutely the (ski-jumping) 
star, without question, and he's not here. Martin Hoellwarth, the Austrian ski 
jumper, another star at 17 in '92, he's not here. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a young adult to grow up in the Olympics is a real fun way of growing up. 
On the other hand, it's a warped sense of reality. I think that begins to catch 
up to you. I think I let it catch up with me. But the important thing is that I 
didn't just let it happen. I took some time away from it to get back to 
normal." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which doesn't mean Heckman isn't going to do his best here. He is, 
after all, having his best World Cup season. He's just planning to enjoy the 
Olympics a little more this time around.

JIM MURRAY: WINNING THE OPEN A LOSING PROPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Open is the biggest prize in golf. For a horseman, it's the Kentucky 
Derby; a race driver, it's Indy; a boxer, it's the heavyweight title. For a 
golfer, it's the Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis Love III once said he would give all eight of his regular PGA Tour 
victories for one "major." And the Open is the ultimate major. 
</P>
<P>
 Some time in the future when they're trying to measure the prowess and place 
in history of a golfer, they'll always ask: "How many Opens did you win?" Or 
even: "Did you ever win the Open?" It has always been the measure of golfing 
greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 Having said that, though, it now behooves you to examine the Open for warts 
and all. To see what it has done for golfers lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a glorious victory -- or is it a hoodoo? 
</P>
<P>
 You begin by noticing that it has been a lamentable fact of life that a golfer 
wins the Open -- and then goes off-screen, so to speak. Doesn't win anything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always thus. Byron Nelson won the 1939 Open -- and six years later 
won 11 tournaments in a row and 18 for the year. Ben Hogan not only won an 
Open, he won three more and a flock of other victories, 63 in all. Jack 
Nicklaus' first victory, the first of 70, was an Open. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, the Open has been a dead-end. Look at the record. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Strange won two Opens in a row. And has not won a tournament since his 
last Open. And that was 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne Stewart won the Open in '91. And has not won a tournament since. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Janzen won the Open last June. And has not won since. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy North won the Open in '78 and never won another tournament -- except 
another Open (in '85). Of course, Andy never won much of anything (one 
tournament) before winning his first Open. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost as if a guy says, "There! I've won the Open. What more do you want 
from me?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to overlook. Hale Irwin won three Opens -- and 16 other tournaments. 
But he has won only one other since his last Open victory in 1990. And he won 
that one the week after the Open. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't mean to suggest a player will come up to the 72nd hole of an Open 
needing a seven-foot putt to win, and will deliberately miss it so as not to 
jinx himself. Not want to ruin his chances to win the Hartford Open, so to say. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a nice jinx to have. But it's getting to be a permanent cloud over the 
winner's head. He's getting like that character in Li'l Abner. Joe Bftsplk, the 
Open winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Does an Open take that much out of a golfer? Well, consider that the USGA, 
which puts on the Open, goes to great lengths to ensure a player has to work 
like a sled dog to win its tournament. It grows the rough high and wiry. It 
hides the pins in locations you can't find without a compass -- usually tucked 
behind a sand trap or near water. It rolls the greens till they're as slick as 
if they'd been waxed. It picks the courses that are already too tough to play 
-- and they make them tougher. One year, they sent out for a fully grown tree 
to block a shortcut to a hole. They'd truck in alligators if they had to keep 
guys from shooting 62s. Make every other trap quicksand. Mine the fairways. 
</P>
<P>
 There are really three schools of thought on the tour. There are golfers who 
point for the majors, who consider everything else merely complicated practice 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But these guys were always confident the lesser opens would fall their way in 
the normal course of things. After all, Nicklaus won 70 and Hogan 63. 
</P>
<P>
 The second school of thought is to win as many tournaments as possible, not to 
make any real distinction between the U.S. Open and any Buick Classic. This 
bunch figures that in the normal course of things an Open will fall their way. 
Tom Kite, the '92 champion, kind of represents this school. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a third school of thought that strives simply to make money. These are 
guys who make little distinction between one victory -- or four fourths. They 
measure success with a calculator. They are the bricklayers of the game. It's 
not really a game at all, it's a business. They should be in a bank, not on a 
green. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Strange never played for mere money in his life. He played for the Hall 
of Fame, not the Bank of America. He never laid up on a shot to protect second 
money -- or third money or a top-10 finish. Strange went for the victory, not 
the dough. He had won 15 tournaments before he won his first Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf is a game in which you hit that Wall of Pain the way marathon runners do. 
It's out there in mid-career. The trick is to play through it, take your lumps, 
wait for it all to come back. The great ones know it will. The others drop 
completely out of sight. They have locked-in flaws. The game has undone them 
mentally, physically, psychologically. The pro shops are full of guys who had 
it, lost it and said to hell with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange is not about to strike his colors. Strange is this kind of player: He 
shot an opening-round 80 at a Masters one year (1985) but was leading the 
tournament by late Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 He is conceding nothing to the game. He hopes the Strange Interlude is over. 
"Let's just say I'm stubborn," he laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened with a respectable 70 at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic tournament 
down here this week. In a field full of guys who only dream of one day winning 
the Open, he has won two. Was it a Jonah? 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis contemplates the question. "I think when you win the Open and 
accomplish the dream of a lifetime, there is a mental letdown of sorts. You 
kind of have great expectations of yourself and don't expect to have to work as 
hard anymore. You sort of expect the game to do something for you instead of 
the other way round." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he is asked, do you tend to say, "Hey! I've won two Opens and 
this is only the Kemper Open, why aren't I leading?" 
</P>
<P>
 Strange shakes his head. "You tend to get impatient with poor shots or 
less-than-perfect shots but you have to remember less-than-perfect shots win 
Opens. They are part of this game and you have to learn to deal with them." 
</P>
<P>
 So, he won't find himself standing on the 18th tee of the final round with a 
chance to win the Open and say to himself, "Uh-oh, I'm not going to make that 
mistake again. I'll hit this one in the water"? 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis smiles. "I'll win all the Opens I have a shot at. Also all the Bob 
Hopes."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; OUR TOP STORY: HARDING FINALLY GETS TO 
NORWAY; FIGURE SKATING: REPORTERS ARE RIGHT BEHIND HER -- FROM PORTLAND TO 
LILLEHAMMER. SHE MEETS KERRIGAN WITHOUT INCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was shortly before 1 p.m. Wednesday when the media representatives were 
booted out of the Hamar Accreditation Center, which could mean only one thing. 
The Tonya watch had become a Tonya warning. 
</P>
<P>
 So while awaiting her imminent arrival, about 100 television crews, reporters 
and photographers from maybe a dozen countries, did what all aggressive, 
news-hawking members of the Fourth Estate would have done in such a 
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing outside in 10-degree weather, snow blowing in their blue faces, they 
asked trash collectors outside the Hamar Accreditation Center what they thought 
about figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 As might be expected, even they could not agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's beautiful," Amund Reck Lysthaug said of Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Nina Rehegland said, "I want Nancy to win. Tonya is not going to win. 
She's fake. She's trash." 
</P>
<P>
 That is what reporters like to call an informed source. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven minutes later, a blue Volvo 940 DL pulled up carrying Harding, 
who was dressed in her red, white and blue USA uniform; the United States' 
assistant chef de mission, Paul George, and the U.S. Olympic Committee's chief 
security officer, Larry Buendorf. 
</P>
<P>
 After another 16 minutes, she emerged with a competitor's credential around 
her neck and waved. "I feel great; I'm ready," she said. "Thanks for coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks, dozens of charges and countercharges, too many tabloid television 
shows and magazine covers to count, seven books, three made-for-TV movie deals, 
a $25-million lawsuit and a court-negotiated settlement since she was first 
tied to the Jan. 6 assault on Kerrigan, Harding had arrived at the Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 And within hours of her arrival, she had run into Kerrigan, for the first time 
since the national championships last month in Detroit, where the attack 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding and Kerrigan greeted one another, according to USOC spokesman Mike 
Moran. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were coming from opposite directions in the (athletes') village," he 
said. "They were both with groups of friends. They stopped and talked and went 
on their way. It broke the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 The last leg of Harding's journey began at 10:45 a.m. PST Tuesday in her 
hometown of Portland, Ore., where she boarded a commuter jet bound for Seattle. 
She transferred there to an SAS flight to Copenhagen, where she changed to 
another SAS flight that took her to Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen journalists, including Bob Baum of the Associated Press, arranged to 
travel with her. 
</P>
<P>
 He reported that she slept from Portland to Seattle but seemed wide awake on 
the first half of the flight to Copenhagen, padding around in her stocking feet 
in Euroclass, signing autographs and drawing smiley faces underneath them, once 
borrowing a video camera and turning it on CBS anchor Connie Chung. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding talked some to the other journalists, rejecting the suggestion that 
she would be annoyed by the media attention that would greet her in Hamar, the 
site of her figure skating competition that begins on Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. "I mean, I'm going to Norway!" 
</P>
<P>
 She would not, however, answer questions about Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 When Harding tired of the attention, she said, "I've had enough. You guys can 
all go back to your seats now so I can get some sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 There were another 100 media types waiting for Harding at Oslo's Fornebu 
Airport, where she was led down a ramp and whisked away in a USOC van that took 
her 80 miles north to Hamar. She went first to the athletes' village, where she 
received her uniform, then was taken to the accreditation center. 
</P>
<P>
 Although reporters had to wait outside, they were not alone. Standing with 
them was Norway's minister of agriculture, who could not get his credential for 
the Games until Harding left. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, reporters filed back into the building and asked eyewitnesses what 
they had seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Leif Kobbeltvedt, the young man behind the help desk, said he got Harding's 
autograph. It was only the second one he had ever asked for in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose was the first? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy Kerrigan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he going to sell them? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said, shocked by the notion. "You get them for yourself. You don't 
get autographs for money." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanne Marken, 21, took Harding's picture for the credential. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was shy," she said when asked about her most famous subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The man supervising the photo process, an American Kodak representative named 
David Curtiss, said, "She was great; she asked for a cup of coffee. Katarina 
(Witt) will be here the 18th. That'll be a breeze." 
</P>
<P>
 After Harding left the accreditation center, she was taken back to the 
athletes' village, where, in order to avoid the media, she was admitted through 
the service entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the last public Harding sighting of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Chung, however, was seen later at the Olympic Amphitheatre. The woman 
who shares the seat once occupied by Walter Cronkite was interviewing a South 
Korean skater, asking her what she thought about Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya 
Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the way it was, Feb. 16, 1994.

MIKE DOWNEY: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; HERE IS ONE PERSON WILLING TO 
THROW BOOK AT TONYA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Excerpts from my new insta-book, "On Frozen Pond: The Tonya Harding Story" 
(Random Violence House, $24.95), a piece of work in progress: 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 17, Mom on Montel:  
</P>
<P>
 Well, Mom fainted today. She went lights out on "The Montel Williams Show," 
which is an American TV program like, you know, Oprah Winfrey's or Joan 
Rivers', except with a guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyhow, Mom did a guest shot. Guess they wanted her to talk about me. About, 
you know, how she used to be mean to me and stuff. About my calling her the 
B-word on that tape those rats at "60 Minutes" found. About me and her goofy 
son-in-law Jeff and stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom's name is LaVona. Not to be confused with Leona, who was that hotel woman 
who went to jail, or Lorena, who was that woman who, well, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure what Montel asked Mom that made her pass out. They tell me she 
toppled over like that German fraulein who fell flat on her tutu at the Olympic 
pairs skating the other night. (Man, did you see that? Wide World of Chokes. 
But I'd still like to give her a hug.) 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Montel Williams asked Mom a hard question. You should have worn one of 
my cool NO COMMENT shirts, Mom. Only guess they wouldn't've paid you then, huh? 
</P>
<P>
 I'll have to call Mom and see who else Montel had on. Maybe, like, Erik 
Estrada or an astrologer or figure-skating transvestites or stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 18, My Bare Lady  
</P>
<P>
 Uh, oh. That goofy Gillooly sold a video of me. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess I popped my top one night while Jeff was holding the cam. He said, 
"Hey! Tonya Harding! You've just won the Winter Olympics! Where are you going?" 
And then I said, "I'm going to Disneyland!" And then I, you know, did my Snow 
White Goes to Hell dance for him. 
</P>
<P>
 That TV show "A Current Affair" got hold of it. I don't know what they offered 
Jeff -- knowing him, probably two packs of cigarettes to use in the slammer. 
Ha! 
</P>
<P>
 Anyhow, they showed me topless on TV. Thirty million people saw me standing 
there like I'm, I don't know, Jessica Hahn or something. They, you know, 
digitally altered the film so you couldn't really see me. I heard some L.A. 
Times guy over in Norway said later, "I wish somebody could digitally alter 
Tonya so we couldn't see her!" (I'd still like to give him a hug.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then it got worse. Somebody gave me a copy of the London Sun, a so-called 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Three pictures of me! Topless! Front page! Like I'm, you know, Di or Fergie or 
somebody. With this huge headline: "Tonya Loves to Dance Around Naked!" 
</P>
<P>
 Totally weird. There's like this smaller headline that says: "She Likes 
Flaunting a Great Body." (Well, at least that part was nice.) And then this 
caption that reads: "Striptease! Tonya lets a breast slip out of her dress, and 
then bares both, wiggling them for the camera, before cavorting topless!" 
Cavorting! 
</P>
<P>
 I never cavorted in my life. (Well, OK, once, but my scores were 6.0, 5.9, 5.9 
and 6.0.) And then there's this "interview" with this guy from Oregon I know. 
His name is Mike Pliska. He's the one who told them about my "flaunting a great 
body." (Remind me to give him a hug.) 
</P>
<P>
 They spoke to guys I dated back in school! What next? Baby Tonya in her 
Pampers?!!! 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 19, Norway, My Way  
</P>
<P>
 I flew to Norway today. Boy, you'd think they'd have a Portland-to-Oslo 
nonstop, but no! 
</P>
<P>
 Guess I missed Hillary Clinton. Maybe when I win the gold medal, she'll invite 
me to the Rose Garden to meet with her and the First Husband and stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody else came to meet me. Mobs and mobs! Wish I still had that tubby 
bodyguard. Rats, I forgot my NO COMMENT shirt at home. And where's my video cam 
when I need it? I'd like to digitally alter these media creeps, boy. Whip their 
butts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wish I'd said something funny. Or I should've sung something, like that old 
guy Sinatra: "And through it all, when there was doubt! I ate it up, and spit 
it out! The record shows! I took the blows! And did it . . . Norrrrr way!" Ha! 
That would've freaked 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 That snotty Kerrigan didn't meet my plane. What is it with her, anyway? She's 
so standoffish! 
</P>
<P>
 (Maybe tomorrow at practice I can give her that hug.) 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I hope things go well. Gonna keep to myself, unless maybe I get a call 
from Montel Jorgensen or Oprah Swenson or Norwegis & Kathie Lee or one of these 
TV shows over here. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm here, Mom! Top of the world! 
</P>
<P>
 OK, OK, gotta go sharpen my skates. Out of my way, you photographers! Yeah, 
yeah. Keep your shirts on. 
</P>

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; NORWEGIANS ONLY GET LOUDER, KOSS ONLY GETS 
FASTER IN 1,500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Vegard the Viking, add Koss the Boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegian speedskater Johann Olav Koss, who set a world record in winning the 
men's 5,000-meter event Sunday, did it again Wednesday in the 1,500 at the 
Viking ship indoor rink. 
</P>
<P>
 On Norway's sports-hero list, that put him up there with cross-country skier 
Vegard Ulvang. 
</P>
<P>
 Koss was only the peoples' choice, not the experts'. The favorites were Rintje 
Ritsma and Falko Zandstra of the Netherlands. Ritsma had skated the 1,500 on 
the same rink Jan. 9 in world-record time, 1 minute 51.60 seconds, and Zandstra 
is the World Cup leader at the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 But before a frenzied crowd of nearly 12,000 fans, some with Norwegian flags 
painted on their faces, many of them waving real Norwegian flags, most of them 
screaming, Koss, skating in the second pair, set the standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Making up for an average start with a blistering third lap of 28.85 seconds, 
then a strong last lap of 29.38, Koss finished in 1:51.29 to a deafening 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 No one else could match his kick -- Ritsma was gasping at the end and was 
second in 1:51.99. Zandstra was third in 1:52.38 and Norway's Adne Sondral 
fourth in 1:53.13. "The last two laps made the difference, but I didn't think 
this could happen," Koss said. "What a great feeling to have the crowd behind 
me like this."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER; THESE MOGULS ARE 
SUPER RICH, BUT IT'S FUN THEY OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Winter Olympics are supposed to be fun but, of course, things don't always 
work out exactly as planned. Lots can happen to take some of the fun out of 
Olympic sports. 
</P>
<P>
 In mogul skiing, though, they work hard to keep the fun alive. And that 
doesn't mean just the spectators, although they certainly do their part. It 
starts with the athletes and organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not surprising, considering the roots of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has ever skied down a mountainside has encountered moguls. They are 
snow bumps carved into the steeper slopes by skiers turning frequently to keep 
their speed in check. A mogul slope looks like a hillside with goosebumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Moguls are not easy to ski, but skiers who have mastered the technique usually 
seek them out. Good mogul skiers ski them fast, bouncing from bump to bump, and 
also seek out the natural jumps that occur on most mogul hills. And good 
jumpers like to add another element, aerial tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can do it say it's fun. And usually on a ski slope, if someone is 
hotdogging down a mogul hill, there are other skiers watching. The mogul skier 
is having fun doing it, and the watching skiers are having fun watching. 
</P>
<P>
 So, of this, they made a competitive sport. And the only real difference is 
that the moguls are not naturally carved. 
</P>
<P>
 The fun remains. The other day at the mogul hill, a recording of a space-shot 
countdown led into the start of the competition, during which each run was 
signaled by a rooster crow. Rock, country or country-rock music blared while 
the skiers, lower legs looking like zigzag sewing machine needles, were 
bouncing down the slope and off the jumps. The fans bopped to the music, and 
during lulls, sometimes made their own. A kazoo contingent made itself known.  
</P>
<P>
 Describing the sport, American skier Ann Battelle said: "Take the hill out 
behind your house, that steep one, then add some Volkswagen Bugs. Cover the 
Bugs with snow, strap some skis on your feet and try to get down as fast as you 
can. Then, to complicate things, put a couple more Bugs on top of the other 
Bugs and point your skis off them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like fun? Well, it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to make sure that nobody had too good a time, though, there were people 
at the gate collecting bottles of liquor from the spectators and issuing claim 
checks, to be redeemed on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone had a good time, anyway. MIKE KUPPER

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; ANALYSIS; U.S. HOCKEY TEAM SHOOTS FOR 
OLYMPIC INTENSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hitting the right emotional pitch today will be as important for the U.S. 
hockey team as hitting the open man on the power play or hitting the upper 
corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly tense in their first two Olympic appearances, the U.S. players 
showed little offensive creativity and had to scramble for a 4-4 tie with 
France and a 3-3 draw with Slovakia. Giving in to anxiety today against Canada, 
a well-rounded team that's well on its way to the medal round with a 2-0 record 
and four points, could turn the Games from a joy ride into a steep climb. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about this being the biggest hockey moment of their lives," Coach 
Tim Taylor said. "We want them to play with intensity and to raise their games 
to an Olympic level. You can't do that if you're uptight and jittery and 
nervous with the puck, so we're trying to calm them down. I think they're calm 
and relaxed in practice, but once the game starts they get a little uptight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with strong opponents . . . who have good defensive game plans, 
and this team succeeded all year because it dominated offensively. It gets to 
the point where they're almost trying too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States could lose today and still finish in the top four in Group B 
and qualify for the medal round. A victory over Italy, which gave up 11 goals 
in losing its first two games, and two more losses by France would launch the 
United States into cross-over play, but a tie or a victory today would make the 
final preliminary-round games less urgent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're in bad shape," defenseman Matt Martin said. "We've got 
two points, and if we beat Canada, we'd be tied with them. . . . We're 
confident about this game, and I imagine they're confident, too. It's going to 
be a good game." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams met 11 times in pre-Olympic play. The United States had an 8-2-1 
edge, but Canada has revamped its roster in the last few weeks, adding 
offense-oriented defensemen Brad Werenka from Edmonton, Mark Astley from 
Switzerland and Brad Schlegel from Calgary. In the Olympics, Canada holds an 
8-2-2 edge and has won three in a row since a 2-1 loss in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S., Sweden, Slovakia and us, it's so close as to who's going to 
advance," said Canada goaltender Corey Hirsch, a New York Ranger draft pick 
voted the American Hockey League's best goalie last season. "We want to get as 
big a lead as possible in our group because Slovakia has two ties and the U.S. 
has two ties. A win would put us in a real tough position for anyone to knock 
us out of the medal round." 
</P>
<P>
 Canada will try to slow the speedy U.S. forwards. If its defensive blanket 
goads the Americans into frustration and the penalty box, so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually a couple of minutes in each game has been their downfall," Canadian 
Coach Tom Renney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a very quick team and a great transition game. Anybody who would 
want to have success against them would try to slow them down. We played a 
patient, poised game against France (a 3-1 victory), with a very patient 
forecheck and good discipline. If we play that way, I'd suggest we have a very 
good chance of success against them. If we get into a run-and-gun game, we 
could be in for a tough one." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor wants his players to gun more and run less, especially on the power 
play. The United States had a tournament-high 27 minutes 45 seconds of 
power-play time in its first two games but scored only once. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more action in front of the net," Taylor said. "The power play is 
still a concern." 
</P>
<P>
 The scoring potential of Canadian winger Paul Kariya, the Mighty Ducks' first 
pick in last June's draft, also concerns U.S. players. Kariya, center Petr 
Nedved and right wing Chris Kontos have combined for eight points, although 
Kariya has no goals. That isn't likely to last. 
</P>
<P>
 "His talent is unlimited," said U.S. goalie Garth Snow, who played with Kariya 
at the University of Maine last season . "If I were a goalie going in and had 
never seen him, I might be dumbfounded or awe-struck. You really don't shut a 
player like that down. You just try to be more aware of him when he's out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Awareness of their situation will be crucial to the Americans' success today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even think about losing this game," Snow said. "If you think 
negatively, that's how you're going to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get back to basics, get pucks to the net and get some rebounds. 
You're not going to get too many pretty goals. There's going to be garbage 
goals, rebounds, goals off someone's leg. You've got to muck it up a little and 
get some ugly goals, and we know we can do that."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; HARDING-KERRIGAN SECURITY TO BE TIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While security reinforcements arrived here to oversee the first practice 
session expected to involve both Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding today, peace 
broke out in figure skating as the two Americans greeted each other cordially 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours after Harding arrived in the athletes' village here, the site of 
the Winter Olympic figure skating competition, Kerrigan initiated a 
conversation in a chance meeting with Harding, U.S. Figure Skating Assn. team 
leader Gale Tanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was "very brief, but very natural," Tanger said. "It was great for 
all of us. We feel comfortable now. It was a little hard not knowing exactly 
(how they would react)." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan and Harding later posed together for a USFSA team picture. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tension was not alleviated for officials at the Olympic Amphitheatre, 
where the practice group including Kerrigan and Harding is scheduled for two 
sessions today. 
</P>
<P>
 Already bracing for an invasion by media eager to see whether there will be a 
confrontation between them, venue manager Bjorn Ruud said Wednesday night that 
security has been quadrupled in the rink after he received threats against each 
skater in telephone calls from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "One call was from someone who wanted very much for Tonya Harding to win, and 
she knew how to do it," Ruud said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The other call came from a man in Santa Barbara, who said: 'I will have to 
stop Tonya Harding so she can't take part in the competition, and if I do that, 
God will bless me forever.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated efforts by the U.S. Olympic Committee and the USFSA to move Harding 
and Kerrigan to separate practice groups have been rejected by International 
Skating Union officials because they fear that granting the request would cause 
disruption for even more female competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The furor surrounding the two U.S. skaters has affected at least one of their 
competitors, Lee Lilly Lyoonjung, 24, of Alexandria, Va., who represents South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Kerrigan arrived here last Thursday, she and Lee have been the only two 
skaters assigned to their daily practice group to attend the sessions. They, 
however, have not been alone, because hordes of reporters and photographers 
have been recording Kerrigan's every move. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee went to her coach, Kathy Casey of Colorado Springs, Colo., and cried on 
the third day they were here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was OK in the beginning," she said. "But then 5,000 media showed up, and 
there were only two of us skating. I said, 'Oh God, this is kind of 
intimidating.' But Kathy and I sat down and refocused. Now, Tonya's here." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding is in the six-woman group with Kerrigan, Lee, two Czechs and a 
Bulgarian that is scheduled to practice at least once a day before the start of 
their competition next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Figure skating experts said Harding, 23, and Kerrigan, 24, are so experienced 
that a collision is unlikely, but it is inevitable that their paths will cross 
during practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to get in each other's way, that is going to happen," former 
U.S. Olympic figure skater Caryn Kadavy said by telephone from Sarasota Fla., 
where she was touring with an ice show.  
</P>
<P>
 Kadavy, whose practice sessions with former world champion Jill Trenary while 
both trained in Colorado Springs were famous within the sport because of the 
tension they produced, said Harding is one of the most difficult skaters to 
share ice with because of her athleticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll come barreling down the ice and go into one of those big jumps," 
Kadavy said. "You have to know where she is all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Kerrigan-Harding contact in the village Wednesday night, Lee had 
said she hoped they would do something to break the tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we can practice normally," she said, adding that she intends to greet 
Harding warmly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see people I haven't seen for a long time, I hug them and say hello," 
she said. "Even if there's not a hug for her from Nancy, there will be a hug 
from Lilly."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; WHEN CHANEY LOST COOL, COACHES LOST 
CREDIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The little rubber band holding Temple Coach John Chaney's senses together 
snapped this week, and it couldn't have come at a worse time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the few moments it took Chaney to embarrass himself and his profession 
Sunday, the combined efforts of the Black Coaches Assn. and the National Assn. 
of Basketball Coaches were compromised, perhaps permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, even years, the coaches have demanded that they be treated as 
equals in the NCAA legislative process: They are educators, role models. Some 
have even fancied themselves as statesmen, learning parliamentary procedure and 
generally acting like William F. Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along comes Chaney, eyes bulging in anger, neck veins swollen like 
flooded tributaries, legs churning, and he's making a postgame beeline for 
Massachusetts Coach John Calipari, whose team had beaten Temple by a point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll kill you!" Chaney yelled as players and bystanders rushed to restrain 
him. "You remember that! When I see you, I'm going to kick your . . . . Kick 
your . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney was upset that Calipari had confronted the game officials in a hallway 
after the victory. So he let him know it. In the process, he pretty much 
dispelled that statesman stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got a good team and you don't need that edge!" Chaney shouted. "That's 
why I was telling my kids to knock your . . . kid in the mouth! Standing there, 
pushing in the game . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same impassioned Chaney who has admirers galore throughout the 
sport. The same Chaney who rides point on the BCA's quest for change. The same 
Chaney who can't understand why the NCAA Establishment -- the powerful 
university presidents and chancellors -- chooses to ignore the assorted 
legislative pleas of coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why: Because you can't be the voice of reason off the court, and the 
voice of insanity on it. CHANEY -- PART II 
</P>
<P>
 If the BCA and the NABC were looking for credibility with the policy-makers, 
this wasn't the way to do it. In these delicate and critical times of 
threatened boycotts, mediation and negotiation, you don't want Chaney on the 
nightly news making a fool of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But there he was, causing coaches everywhere to wince in discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed it happened," said Calipari, who stressed that this was 
Chaney's doing, not his. "I'm totally embarrassed that it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from Florida State's Pat Kennedy: "I think the solution is that all 
coaches should be man enough and straight up, man to man, to confront each 
other privately. I think there's nothing worse than when two coaches have to 
confront each other publicly like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech's Bobby Cremins, a friend and fan of Chaney, did what he could to 
defend the Temple coach. But how exactly do you defend someone who vowed to 
kill someone and who ordered his players to hurt an opponent? 
</P>
<P>
 "In the heat of the moment, with the emotions so high, we all let out steam 
the wrong way sometimes, including myself," Cremins said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chaney's case, the vapors escaped out his ears. 
</P>
<P>
 An apology came Monday, followed later by an announcement that Temple 
President Peter Liacouras had suspended Chaney for one game . . . against St. 
Bonaventure, the seventh-place team in the Atlantic 10 Conference. Another 
apology came Wednesday, but the punishment barely left pink marks on Chaney's 
wrists. CHANEY -- PART III 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the only instance this season of a coach having an out-of-body 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day as Chaney's outburst, California's Todd Bozeman and Arizona's 
Lute Olson engaged in an ugly cat fight in full view of an ABC audience. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 22, Georgetown's John Thompson got tossed from a game, prompting the 
Hoya coach to charge the referee who dared to defy him. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 19, Xavier's Pete Gillen and Cincinnati's Bob Huggins, as well as 
their staffs, nearly sparked a postgame rumble. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 7, Indiana's Bob Knight, obviously smitten with World Cup fever, 
launched a kick in the general direction of his son, Pat, who had botched a 
pass moments earlier against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 The BCA and the NABC want to be taken seriously, but imagine the university 
presidents' reaction to the sight of Chaney, a supposed leader of the cause, 
spewing profanity and threats at one of his peers. Heat of the moment or not, 
such actions erode the BCA's and NABC's credibility among the power brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone agrees with this theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people have already had a tainted view of coaches, and I don't think 
that will change," one high-profile coach said. "I think most people -- many 
people -- think that coaches are always selfish and think about their own 
welfare. I don't think that will necessarily change. I think that people who 
really know what coaches do in trying to develop character in young people are 
the only people you think about, are the only people that you can care about. I 
really don't care about what the public thinks." 
</P>
<P>
 The coach? 
</P>
<P>
 John Chaney. TV TRICKLE-DOWN EFFECT 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the Southwest and Big Eight conferences are close to signing a 
five-year, $80-million deal with ABC and ESPN, the possibility of future 
defections remains. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words: The Pacific 12 Conference? 
</P>
<P>
 Texas and Texas A&M, the two most coveted members of the beleaguered SWC, 
still aren't convinced that a Big Eight alliance or merger -- call it what you 
want -- is the right way to go. And if they are shopping themselves around, 
they'll find plenty of interest from the SEC and the Pac-10, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not rule that out," said a source who has specific knowledge of the 
Pac-10's expansion agenda. "Everybody is in play. Everybody is in play." 
</P>
<P>
 The same source said the Pac-10 was prepared several years ago "to do 
(expansion) business" with other schools, but no agreement could be reached. 
The source wouldn't name those universities, but the likelihood of Texas and 
Texas A&M being involved isn't a bad bet to take. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas and Texas A&M are attractive because they offer the best of both worlds: 
high academic and athletic standing. Another possibility is Colorado of the Big 
Eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Not on the list of Pac-10 candidates: Brigham Young, which doesn't fit the 
academic profile the conference is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Expansion probably would signal the beginning of division play within the 
Pac-10, as well as a conference football and basketball tournament. At the 
moment, only the 12-member SEC has both such championship playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Penn State joined the Big Ten as a full-time member in 1993, Pac-10 
officials have talked informally with other schools about realignment. And 
those same officials have watched with keen interest as the SWC and the Big 
Eight discuss a possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a prominent Pac-10 administrator who asked to remain anonymous, 
the conference will consider expansion only if the balance of power among the 
leagues changes and "we lose critical influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: If it looked as though the SEC were going to get Texas and Texas 
A&M, or the Big Ten get Rutgers, Syracuse or Missouri, or the Big East get four 
football-only schools as basketball members (Rutgers, West Virginia, Temple and 
Virginia Tech) and later invited Notre Dame and DePaul or Xavier . . . the 
Pac-10 would move into action. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if the SWC and the Big Eight merge and the Big East simply 
adds the four football schools as full-time members, a full-scale realignment 
war might be prevented. That's because the Pac-10, the SEC and the Big Ten 
effectively would be denied their main targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't count on it. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts travels to Temple's 3,900-seat McGonigle Hall next Thursday. In 
a clever move, Temple's Liacouras has invited Massachusetts President Michael 
Hooker to attend the rematch. . . . Chaney might not like Calipari, but he 
likes Calipari's team. "I thought that Massachusetts is the kind of team that 
should be ranked No. 1 in the country," he said Wednesday. Not after losing to 
St. Joseph's Tuesday night, it shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas Coach Roy Williams said it should surprise nobody that North Carolina 
and Arkansas are repeat No. 1-ranked teams this season. "I'm still of the 
opinion that (they) have more than anyone else has," he said. Williams also 
said it was "mystifying" that No. 12 Missouri wasn't ranked in the top 10 and 
that "as many as 20 teams could actually win (the NCAA championship)." . . . As 
for the SWC-Big Eight rumors, don't ask Williams. "If there is an alliance, if 
there is a merger, if there is an agreement or something, then I'll look at it 
at that point," he said. "That's the farthest thing from my mind right now. I'm 
more interested in the luge or the backwards downhill than I am with what's 
happening with the conference." 
</P>
<P>
 To anyone (that means you, Dick Vitale) who thinks teams with sub-.500 
conference records shouldn't be invited to the NCAA tournament, Duke Coach Mike 
Krzyzewski has a message: "Then (those critics) should come in our conference 
and see how easy it is to be .500 in our conference." Krzyzewski probably was 
referring to No. 25 Georgia Tech, which is 13-9 overall, but only 4-7 in 
Atlantic Coast Conference play. Two of those victories have come at North 
Carolina's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 His team reduced to seven players because of injuries, St. Joseph's Coach John 
Griffin had to raid the JV squad for the Massachusetts game. Said Griffin of 
the depleted roster: "Short of a tragedy, a plane crash, whatever, I've never 
heard of something similar." Top 10

GANG OF ONE; BASKETBALL COMMITMENT GETS MONROE'S HAYMOND OFF STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shots rang out and Dimara Haymond was caught in the cross-fire. A minute 
earlier she had been enjoying herself at a backyard party in South-Central Los 
Angeles. Suddenly, she found herself in the middle of a gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were pulling out guns and I ran in a complete circle because I didn't 
know where to go," Haymond said. "And I was like Ahhhhhh ." 
</P>
<P>
 It was her first "real shootout" and a close brush with death, yet Haymond is 
engulfed with laughter as she recalls the memory a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone grabbed me and brought me into the house," Haymond said. "And I was 
like, 'Oh, you saved my life. I was about to die out there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A harrowing experience, to be sure. But Haymond recalls it as if she were 
acting out a scene from her favorite movie. It's a common theme for Haymond -- 
shocking, heart-wrenching stories told giddily, perhaps only to make her life a 
little more bearable. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether she is sharing a story about fighting for a rebound for the Monroe 
High girls' basketball team or talking about being chased by her mother in a 
wheelchair, she's as animated as Robin Williams in a stand-up comedy routine. 
</P>
<P>
 All stories are told with the same vigor. A smile engulfs her face, her head 
bobs up and down as if it is keeping time to a hip-hop beat and her hands slap 
sporadically all around her. And Haymond -- who is known to intimidate 
opponents with her tough demeanor and imposing physical play -- chatters all 
the while, telling endless stories punctuated with lively shrieks and 
screeches. 
</P>
<P>
 If laughter is the best medicine for sadness, Haymond is keeping herself 
extremely healthy. With nearly two decades of pain to draw from, Haymond speaks 
from experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father is serving a life sentence without parole on charges of kidnaping. 
Her mother, who was shot during a robbery 16 years ago, is paralyzed and gets 
around in a wheelchair. Her closest friend was killed in a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dimara, who said she was molested several times by a family friend before 
her 10th birthday, is trying to shake free from the social group she now refers 
to as the "wrong crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through so much in my life," she said. "I know who to trust and who 
not to trust. Who not to hang around and who to hang around." 
</P>
<P>
 She is nearly 19 and trying desperately to escape the life style that claimed 
her best friend, Pashette. Haymond is street smart, yet smart enough to know 
she can't survive on the streets. Her former friends, most of whom belong to a 
gang called the Ruthless Queens, now call her a "sellout." Her teammates simply 
call her Dee Dee. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I am a sellout, so what? I'm making my grades, you know?" Haymond said. 
"They're not helping me do nothing in life. They're just people on the side of 
me trying to put me down." 
</P>
<P>
 Haymond, a senior, sounds like someone still trying to convince herself that 
she doesn't miss her other life. But, little more than a year ago, Haymond 
dumped her old friends and committed herself to basketball. She knew she could 
never be successful with both -- at least that's what Coach Bryant Ching told 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging out with her buddies -- a "social club" as she prefers to call it -- 
left little time for school and homework. In August, before her junior year, 
Haymond was declared academically ineligible to play basketball. The next move 
was Ching's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided on my own either she was going to become a basketball gym rat, or 
she's going to become a gangbanger," Ching said. "I kinda forced the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Ching provided Haymond with a challenge, a proverbial fork in the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been my project ever since the 10th grade," Ching said. "I saw someone 
who probably had a love of basketball, but (basketball) was interfering with 
home or the rest of her world. She just needed some focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Ching was there to help adjust her viewfinder. "Luckily, it 
turned out the right way," he said. "It's like a light turned on." 
</P>
<P>
 Haymond's teammates couldn't agree more. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our sophomore year to now, she's a totally different person," senior 
Michele Zamora said. "I like her now." 
</P>
<P>
 Haymond missed three games last season because she was academically 
ineligible, but rejoined the team in late December after improving her grades. 
Behind Haymond's strong inside play, Monroe advanced to the City Section 3-A 
Division semifinals. No Monroe girls' team ever advanced further. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell my mom every day, 'I'm going to be somebody, you watch. I'm going to 
be somebody very special. My name is gonna be in the (record) books in big 
black print. I'm going to be the best basketball player ever,' " Haymond said. 
</P>
<P>
 A stretch of her vivid imagination perhaps, but Haymond is tearing up the 
competition, averaging 19.2 points and 18.6 rebounds a game and seems poised to 
lead her team to a City championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Her solid, sturdy 6-foot frame is a menace to those who challenge her 
underneath the basket. A hearty roar from Haymond usually accompanies a good 
rebound -- and scares the opposition into submission.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's her competitive attitude on the court that intimidates most, a 
presence she picked up on the streets that seems to say, "Don't mess with me." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go on the court, it's like this is my domain, this is my house and I'm 
gonna play the way I want to play," she said. "And no one is gonna hurt me 
because I'm gonna hurt them -- but not in a physical way, but by winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps by necessity, Haymond is tough. And it shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had guys run into her in the hallway and bounce off her -- and that's 
not a figure of speech," Ching said. "She's just so strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention strong-minded. 
</P>
<P>
 She can't recall ever seeing her mother walk, nor does she have any 
recollection of her father outside prison walls. Her parents received those 
life sentences before she was out of diapers. This is her reality. 
</P>
<P>
 She is neither proud nor ashamed of her background. Her mother tells her that 
the truth will set her free.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet Haymond has never opened up to any of the friends she has made on this 
season's team. None of her teammates had known that her father is in prison or 
how her mother wound up in a wheelchair. They've never asked, so she's never 
told. 
</P>
<P>
 Haymond seems prone to roll with life's punches on her own. Like the time she 
fell out of her mother's van and into a grocery store parking lot when she was 
5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked in the rear-view mirror and Dee Dee was sitting in the middle of the 
street," Shirley Haymond said. "I was almost a quarter of a mile away when I 
realized (she had fallen out of the van)." 
</P>
<P>
 There's one subject Haymond seems unable to laugh away: her father. 
</P>
<P>
 She is resentful of the judicial system, saying Tyrone is serving an unjustly 
long sentence. He has been imprisoned for nearly 16 years and can never expect 
to go home. Even some murderers, Dimara insists, receive shorter sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people killing people and raping people, doing harmful things to 
people, but he didn't kill anybody," Haymond said. "He didn't even hurt the 
guy. He just took him into his possession." 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances and physical distance from her father have taken their toll 
on the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a relationship with my father, but it's not like a father-daughter 
relationship because he's not here to do anything for me . . . like go to my 
games," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haymond visits her father in prison at Tehachapi a couple of times a year and 
talks to him by telephone occasionally. She has a father, but doubts the 
strength of their bond. She admits to feelings of bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hardly ever write my father in jail because I feel like he should be here 
with me, so I can tell him what I feel face to face instead of writing it on a 
piece of paper," she said. "I can send him all my little records and (newspaper 
clippings), but he wasn't there to see them (in person) so it doesn't really 
matter to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother rarely misses one of her daughter's games and is a source of 
inspiration to Dimara. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't know she's paralyzed, because she's so cool," Dimara said. "She 
does everything. She's like a woman on wheels." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shirley Haymond: "(Dimara's) got all the legs I ever wanted. I see myself 
through my kids. Their walking and running around makes me so tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Haymond's teammates never tire of her antics and playful energy. When Haymond 
is not in the game, the Vikings play without inspiration, teammates say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she is now the team's centerpiece, it certainly didn't start that 
way. She was not popular with teammates in the beginning. Fact is, she wasn't 
even liked. 
</P>
<P>
 She made a bad first impression nearly four years ago during a tryout for the 
Sepulveda Junior High girls' team. During the tryout, Haymond drove to the 
basket and ran over diminutive Stacy Wong on her way to two points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even say, 'Sorry,' " she said. "I just walked away so maybe that 
left a bad impression." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a scene few teammates can forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared of her," said Zamora, who has played with Haymond for three 
years and witnessed the Sepulveda incident. "I was really intimidated by her, 
so I just kinda stayed away." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Haymond's transformation, Zamora and Wong are among Haymond's biggest 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, when you get to know her, she's a softy," teammate Florence Fujita 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ching, in his third season at Monroe, is hoping Haymond can win over college 
recruiters as well. He has been in contact with several college coaches, mostly 
in the Division II ranks because of her low grade-point average and incomplete 
curriculum. He is determined to keep her headed in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Haymond has no reservations about the path she has chosen. Now, her best 
friends wear the same colors, but shoot baskets, not bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 And as long as she's playing basketball, she's committed to avoiding her 
"social club." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I could hang around those people and play basketball because I 
know for a fact every time I'm around them, something happens," Haymond said. 
</P>
<P>
 But what does the future hold for Haymond after this season? Will she be 
motivated to continue schooling when basketball season ends? Will she graduate? 
Will she return to the "social club" she abandoned a year ago? What will become 
of her when Coach Ching is no longer around to monitor -- and correct -- her 
every move? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers rest with Haymond. For now she is focused -- and no longer running 
mindlessly in circles and dodging bullets.

MOORE NAMED RAM ASSISTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Moore was named Ram wide receivers coach Wednesday, and offensive 
assistant Mike Martz was promoted to quarterbacks coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, out of coaching since 1989, replaces Milt Jackson, who left earlier 
this month to become Atlanta's receivers coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 46, was Seattle's offensive coordinator from 1986-88 under Coach Chuck 
Knox. He held a variety of assistant coaching positions in 11 seasons on Knox's 
staffs in Seattle and Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Martz, who coached the Ram tight ends last season, replaces Ted Tollner, who 
left after the season to become San Diego State's head coach. The Rams have yet 
to hire a special teams coach to replace Howard Tippett. 
</P>
<P>
 Martz, 43, joined the Ram staff as an offensive assistant in 1992 after 14 
seasons coaching at the college level. He was the quarterbacks coach from 
1983-87 at Arizona State. MIKE REILLEY

TO BUILD MODEL FACILITY, TO BE SEVERAL STORIES HIGH ON A SMALL TRACT BEHIND A 
SANTA ANA SHOPPING MALL. APPROVAL ON 3-2 VOTE ENDS AN EMOTIONAL DEBATE.

 After almost two hours of emotional debate, the school board narrowly approved 
building a state-funded, $43-million "space saver" school at the back of 
Bristol Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a responsibility to house these children in adequate 
schools," Trustee Robert W. Balen said before the vote. "The site is not 
perfect, but we can make it work. We have a real risk of losing this money for 
our neighborhood schools, and I am not willing to take that risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Space saver schools are built vertically, with several stories, instead of 
taking up large areas with single-floor buildings. The idea behind them, school 
officials said, is to add schools without condemning private property in dense 
cities with little room for new development. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will house 1,300 students and serve as a model for other urban 
school districts throughout the state, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board made its decision Wednesday night during a special meeting held at 
the City Council chambers. More than 150 people attended, many of them wearing 
badges supporting the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, during a public hearing that lasted until 2 a.m., hundreds 
of parents on both sides of the issue debated the project's potential impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents argued that being awarded the state funding to build the school was 
equivalent to winning the lottery. Many urged the district to seize the 
opportunity to alleviate rampant overcrowding in a school district that serves 
49,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents blasted the concept of placing a school behind the shopping mall at 
Bristol and 17th streets, saying that the plan would be too costly and 
potentially unsafe, and that other sites would better serve the community. 
Other residents complained that the project would clog traffic, promote 
vandalism, cause too much noise and provide too little space in which students 
could play. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night's vote by the board of the Santa Ana Unified School District 
was 3 to 2, with Balen, Sal Mendoza and Audrey Yamagata-Noji in favor. Trustees 
Rosemarie Avila and Tom Chaffee voted against the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila called for a delay to study other possible sites for the project, saying 
that "so many decisions are made based on where the money is, and not whether 
it's good or bad for the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Cast, who lives north of the proposed project, condemned the site as 
"a terrible place for a school." The board, she said, was motivated by "the 
almighty dollar. They're not thinking about the safety of the children." 
</P>
<P>
 But district Supt. Rudy Castruita praised the board's decision, saying: "It 
gives (the children) hope that they'll have a new facility right here in the 
middle of town that they'll have access to. I'm delighted." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucila Avina, 33, president of the bilingual district activity council, said, 
"We're very happy because we think it's the best decision for the children, and 
to have a better community. Our children are tomorrow's future, and if we don't 
have more schools, our children will be the ones who suffer."

OFFICER WOUNDED IN CHASE OF SUSPECT; VIOLENCE: SANTA ANA POLICEMAN RESPONDING 
TO A CALL IS SHOT IN HAND AND ARM. FOUR PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED. AREA NEAR EL 
SALVADOR PARK IS CORDONED OFF FOR HOURS.

<P>
 A 20-year veteran of the Santa Ana Police Department was shot in the hand and 
arm Wednesday while responding to a call of shots fired near El Salvador Park.  
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested four people, including a 15-year-old boy who surrendered a gun 
and who police believe was the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Robert Chavez, 45, was reported in good condition at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, where he was to undergo surgery to remove bone fragments, 
said Santa Ana Police Department Lt. Robert Helton. Helton said the shooting 
was the department's first in about six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a life-threatening injury," Helton said. "He's in good condition."  
</P>
<P>
 Of the four people held in the incident, Helton said, only the 15-year-old is 
expected to be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we can tie the other three to the earlier incident, we probably won't 
keep them in custody," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, a woman dialed 911 about 3:20 p.m. to report she heard 
five shots fired in the 900 block of North English Street and West Civic Center 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Police cars responding to the scene saw four or five young men running along 
10th Street, but the men turned back and ran south through the park toward West 
Civic Center Drive when confronted by a patrol car on 10th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the men ran from the park, through a back yard and toward English 
Street, just a few houses north of West Civic Center Drive, and into the arms 
of a police officer, who took them into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe a fourth and possibly a fifth male ran into a garage 
behind a home in the 800 block of North English Street.  
</P>
<P>
 Chavez entered the garage and was shot in the right hand, Helton said. Other 
officers returned fire, but no one else was struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Police then retreated and surrounded the garage. A suspect with a gun later 
climbed out the garage window, dropped a handgun and was taken into custody 
without further incident, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that a fifth person or more might still be hiding in the garage, about 
20 SWAT officers were called to the scene, where about 30 officers were also on 
hand. At least seven armed SWAT officers and one dog entered the house in the 
800 block of North English Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if there is anybody in there, but we don't want to take any 
chances," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, by 7:30 p.m., police entered the garage, but found no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said it is not yet clear what sparked the initial gunfire. Helton said 
it did not appear that any of the suspects live at the house on North English 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Several blocks surrounding the shooting scene were cordoned off, causing 
severe traffic snarls in the area. Dozens of residents stood by watching and 
waiting for something to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that officer was shot, just for doing his job," said Marta 
Doritas, 26, who lives in the neighborhood. "Thank God it wasn't worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Several neighbors said the tell-tale pops did not surprise them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard four shots -- pow pow pow pow. But I didn't think it was going to be 
a big deal. I thought it was gunfire in the air," said another neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who sell drugs in the park, lots of people who 
don't work just hang out there," said a 28-year-old neighbor. "Here we hear 
shots pretty often. It's common." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that things have been a bit quieter in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have been playing sports in the park and they put on the lights," Martin 
said. "It has made it calmer."

TEEN-AGER COLLAPSES DURING GYM CLASS, DIES; TRAGEDY: THE IRVINE STUDENT, WHO 
HAD BEEN PLAYING BASKETBALL, WAS IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE FULL CARDIAC ARREST 
WHEN PARAMEDICS ARRIVED.

 A University High School student collapsed of an apparent heart attack as he 
played basketball in gym class Wednesday and died, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Sunoo, a 16-year-old junior, suddenly fell at 11:50 a.m. and stopped 
breathing, Police Lt. Sam Allevato said.  
</P>
<P>
 The physical education teacher, Steve Scoggin, immediately tried to revive 
Sunoo, students said. A second teacher arrived moments later and attempted 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. When paramedics arrived, they found Sunoo in 
what appeared to be full cardiac arrest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics continued to try to revive him. He was taken to Irvine Medical 
Center, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just collapsed," said Thien Tran, another student who was also playing 
basketball when Sunoo lost consciousness. "We were all very quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, school administrators and students were apparently unsure of his 
condition. About 12:45 p.m. Wednesday, school officials told the school via the 
public address system that Sunoo had been taken to Irvine Medical Center but 
was OK, said Amir Khalilpour, a senior at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Irene Voro, 15, who had been playing basketball in the gym when 
Sunoo collapsed, said that at first, some students thought he was resting. But 
minutes later they realized he was unconscious and called the gym teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, everyone stopped playing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police said there did not appear to be any unusual physical altercation 
during the basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Phong Tran, a classmate and good friend, described Sunoo as "a really nice 
guy. He really cared about people." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, 18 said they became friends last year when Sunoo moved to Orange County 
from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunoo liked to go to video arcades, Tran said. He was also a talented artist, 
whose pencil drawings appeared in the Korea Times newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he wanted to be an artist," Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
 After school, a meeting was held at which some faculty members were told of 
Sunoo's death, said varsity basketball coach Mike Dinneen. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy will be done to determine the cause of death, Allevato said.  
</P>
<P>
 School board member Margie Wakeham said: "It's tragic. I think it's the worst 
thing that could happen to a staff and a family. The University staff is 
devastated, and I can imagine what grief the family must be experiencing. I 
don't think words can express it."  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Burnham, also a member of the Irvine Unified School board, said: "I think 
the reaction is one of tremendous sadness. When any type of situation like this 
occurs, you really don't understand why." Schoolmate Ryan Cheung, 17, said: "I 
think a lot of University High School students will send their hearts out to 
the family and relatives."

DISNEY SETS HIGH GOALS WITH PLANS FOR YOUTH HOCKEY; CRIME FIGHTING: COMPANY 
DONATES $500,000 TO START THE WIDELY PRAISED PROGRAM. TWO GANG- AND 
DRUG-INFESTED NEIGHBORHOODS IN ANAHEIM ARE INITIAL TARGETS. EDUCATION, 
CAMARADERIE WILL BE STRESSED.

<P>
 Reaching out to youngsters in two of the city's most crime-ridden 
neighborhoods, the Walt Disney Co. on Wednesday announced plans for a youth 
hockey program aimed at teaching underprivileged children positive values and 
getting them off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will target the gang-infested Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood and 
drug-plagued Ponderosa Park area this summer. Eventually, it will branch out to 
other Orange County cities and then across the country, said officials of the 
Disney company, which also owns the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started the Mighty Ducks, we knew we wanted to create a youth hockey 
program that would have an impact on the lives of its participants," said 
Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner. "Through its Anaheim ice hockey program, 
(Disney) will not only give kids a sport they can become fanatical about, but 
will provide them with lessons that will serve them well throughout their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The program was widely praised by city officials and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's nonprofit program called GOALS -- Growth Opportunities Through 
Athletics, Learning and Service -- is modeled after a highly touted New York 
program named Ice Hockey in Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wilk, who spearheaded that program, was hired by Disney to run GOALS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still a little bit numb that Disney has judged it to be a good program 
and something they want to invest in," Wilk said. "I know the program works. . 
. . I know the problems and challenges and needs of inner-city kids are just 
the same here as they are in Harlem." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner, who spoke at a press conference at the Anaheim Arena, said the program 
will give adolescents, particularly those who might be lured into gangs, an 
outlet to get their "testosterone working in a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney will donate $500,000 to start up the program, but it is relying on 
community volunteers as well as other sponsors to help sustain the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money alone is not going to build the program," Wilk said. "People and 
relationships will." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials said the Anaheim program will use hockey to teach the 
youngsters three concepts: "Discipline and camaraderie of sports, the 
development and empowerment of education, and the goodwill and growth of 
community service." 
</P>
<P>
 The program will move beyond athletics and include mandatory after-school 
classes and participation in community service events, as well as clinics in 
skating techniques. The children will also compete in hockey matches, meet 
hockey stars and have the opportunity to earn camp and school scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and Disney are discussing building an ice rink that would be used by 
the program as well as by the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilk said the program will be open to girls and boys up to 18 years of age. 
All participation and equipment costs will be free. As the children re-enroll 
over the years, they will be encouraged to become mentors and coaches to new 
participants. Wilk added that the program will try to accommodate as many 
underprivileged children as want to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's two initial target areas, one of which is less than a mile from 
Disneyland, were selected with the input of city and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that can get these kids off the streets is good," said Harald 
Martin, a police officer who walked a beat in the Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood as 
part of a now-defunct community policing program. "I think the kids would get a 
kick out of ice skating. It's obviously something they don't normally do." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released Wednesday, Gary B. Bettman, commissioner of the 
National Hockey League, also commended Disney's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combination of inadequate resources for youth programs and an increase in 
crime affecting youth have made too many kids fearful of the present and 
without hope for the future," Bettman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 To supplement Disney's contribution, Mighty Ducks officials said they will 
hold a "FanFair" benefit March 20 at the Anaheim Arena attended by Ducks 
players and coaches. Ducks President Tony Tavares said the organization hopes 
the event will raise $300,000 for GOALS.  
</P>
<P>
 The team is committed to making GOALS work and to bringing hockey to children 
who might not have been able to enjoy the sport because of its costs, he said, 
noting that equipment and ice times for youth hockey leagues in Southern 
California can run as high as $2,000 per person for one season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a natural thing for us to become involved with," Tavares said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials said the final details of the ice-rink project are being 
worked out and an announcement will be made soon.

A MARK OF FAITH FOR LENT; CATHOLICS, LUTHERANS, EPISCOPALIANS ATTEND ASH 
WEDNESDAY RITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For 35-year-old Lisa Olsen of Orange, Ash Wednesday inspired a simple yet 
challenging Lenten resolution -- to be more patient with her children, ages 9 
months and 3.  
</P>
<P>
 Hortence Carey, 88, tightly gripping a rosary against her walker, said she 
intends to coax her tiny frame the two blocks to Our Lady of the Pillar parish 
in Santa Ana daily through Easter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Candida Madrid, 61, of Santa Ana, honoring the start of Lent marked 
yet another year in a lifetime of unquestioning observance, borne of habit and 
a strict Catholic upbringing.  
</P>
<P>
 Abiding by ritual, Catholics, Episcopalians and Lutherans throughout the 
county interrupted daily routines and flocked to parishes Wednesday to mark the 
start of Lent, emerging with the day's namesake ashen cross swabbed on their 
foreheads -- a symbol of human impermanence that dates back to the Old 
Testament. 
</P>
<P>
 Lent continues for 40 days, ending on Easter Sunday, and commemorates the 
period that Jesus fasted in the wilderness. It is marked by prayer, repentance, 
symbolic abstinence from decadent treats like chocolate and alcohol, and a 
spirit of giving to those less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday observances at Our Lady of the Pillar Catholic parish on West 6th 
Street began at 6:30 a.m. as Spanish-speaking worshipers stopped in for a 
message of penance delivered in their native tongue, and continued throughout 
the day as families, assorted stragglers and even kindergarten classes filed 
into the sanctuary to be marked by blessed ashes of burnt palm fronds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange, at the Holy Family Cathedral, the parking lot was jammed early 
Wednesday as many couples arrived on their way to work in separate cars to 
listen to Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird of the Catholic Diocese of Orange urge 
confession, symbolic sacrifice and intensified prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attend Mass more, pray 15 minutes a day, and come make that good confession 
that will make all of our thoughts happy thoughts," Baird told the 8 a.m. 
gathering of about 300 worshipers at the first of five masses that continued 
throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time to think about what's really important -- the value of life. The 
older you get, the more you appreciate it," said Rick Kison, 49, of Orange, who 
emerged from Baird's Mass marked with a heavy ashen smudge, remembrance of the 
body's cycle from dust to dust. "We're not the best thing going in the world. 
We're only here for a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 While the symbolism of ash dates back to Old Testament, the ritual imposition 
of the ashes became official in Roman Catholic liturgy in the 11th Century, 
Baird said. It is also practiced by other, more traditional offshoots of 
Catholicism, such as the Episcopal and Lutheran churches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ashes are generally gathered from palm fronds burned after the previous 
year's Palm Sunday, which heralds Holy Week, the final week of Lent. 
</P>
<P>
 Kison, who attended Mass with his wife before they headed off in different 
directions to their respective jobs, comes to Holy Family Cathedral every 
Sunday. But Ash Wednesday is a special time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real community gathering. It was nice to see so many babies in there," 
Kison added. "People get up earlier today. It's a family time." 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen, who came to church with a parcel of church linens that she volunteers 
to iron every other week, made her Lenten resolutions as Baird spoke. When her 
3-year-old son, Bobby, increasingly jealous of his 9-month-old baby sister, 
started to wail, she roughly yanked them out of Baird's service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to try to not eat between meals . . . and try to be more patient 
with my children," she said in the cathedral lobby, holding Bobby close to her 
as he smeared the ash into a blob across his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, personal tragedy marks this Lent as distinctly serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Callanan, 31, of Tustin lost his father to heart failure three weeks ago. 
Then, on Sunday, a close friend who lived in Santa Ana died in an airplane 
crash in South Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try to attend Mass every day, and ask God to make sense of it," 
said Callanan, who runs a beer and wine bar in Tustin. "Usually I give up 
alcohol, but I'm not going to do that this year. There have been too many 
deaths." 
</P>
<P>
 Parishes throughout the county can look forward to an increase in alms-giving, 
and most commit to pass the offerings on to the poor during Lent. At the Holy 
Family Cathedral, a "Skip a Meal, Share a Meal" program brings in money that 
people would have spent on the meal they opted to miss. Traditional Catholics 
swear off all meat except fish on Ash Wednesday and every Friday during Lent. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 53 parishes in the Diocese of Orange were expected to be filled to 
capacity throughout the day Wednesday, Baird said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our Lady of the Pillar, in Santa Ana, attracted throngs of predominantly 
Latino Catholics, many of whom place particular importance on the rituals of 
Ash Wednesday and the call to repent their sins. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's a very important day of repentance, a very big day," said Amparo 
Casillas, 42, who came to Santa Ana five years ago from the Mexican state of 
Jalisco, as she struggled to quiet her 2-year-old grandson outside the 
sanctuary. "Ever since I was a little girl, I have come to Mass on Ash 
Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Many, however, came simply out of years of habit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 72-year-old Guadalupe Flores' earliest memories, she recalls receiving the 
ashen cross on her forehead with her four brothers in the Guerrero town of 
Altamirano. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it's our belief and it's very ancient. They taught us this way since 
we were very small," said Flores, who recently moved to Garden Grove but still 
goes to church in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother died in July. She always brought us," added Candida Madrid. "If we 
didn't come, God would not be with us. If we don't come, we feel guilty. We're 
afraid. We have to come!" 
</P>
<P>
 More devout Catholics, who passed out flyers announcing a "Popular Mission for 
Lent" held on weeknights across the street from the sanctuary, chided those who 
come without understanding the religious significance of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousands of people come . . . but a lot of people don't know what it's 
really about," said Heriberto Alvarez, 52, who has volunteered at the church 
for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows that they'll get a cross on their forehead, so they come. It's 
been converted into a tradition," he said, as a group of kindergarten boys 
lined up in front of him poked at each other's ash-smeared foreheads.

 Stewart Peck sensed trouble as he watched a man run out of the Wells Fargo 
Bank on Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really hot day and this man had a ball cap pulled low over his head, 
he was wearing a wool coat and he had this brown paper bag," Peck, 48, 
recounted Wednesday. "I thought that there was something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The man got into a waiting car, which sped off from the bank on Katella 
Avenue. And Peck, who was parked nearby, decided to follow in his Infinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Using his car phone, Peck led police to the suspects. Today, Wells Fargo will 
present a $5,000 reward to Peck, an Orange resident and president of FormWorks 
Plastics Inc., a manufacturing firm in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck is "an excellent citizen," said Wells Fargo spokesman Dan Conway. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck will be the first recipient of a James B. Hume Reward established in 
December, bank officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward's namesake was a chief of detectives for the bank from 1873 to 
1902, Conway said. Hume chased outlaws across California and brought most of 
them to justice. 
</P>
<P>
 When Peck followed the suspects into Santa Ana, he used his cellular phone to 
call 911 and learned that the bank indeed had been robbed, he said. Witnesses 
said a robber had pointed a handgun into a teller's face and demanded money. 
</P>
<P>
 At an apartment complex in the 500 block of North Tustin Avenue, the car 
stopped and the man ran out from the back seat, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver "just sat there looking at me while I'm on the phone with police 
officers, telling them how to get there," Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers arrested the driver, Tina Lynn Sandusky Demko, 27, and the robbery 
suspect, her husband, Robert Allan Demko, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 About $1,000 in cash and a handgun were found in the Demkos' apartment in the 
complex, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway telephoned Peck several weeks ago to invite him to a thank-you lunch at 
the bank, but the honoree only learned of the monetary reward Wednesday from 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're giving me money?" Peck asked. "That's very nice of them to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will put the $5,000 into the college education account for his 
12-year-old daughter, Nicole. THUAN LE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; PROGRAM ENCOURAGES PARENTS' INVOLVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been only five weeks since 41-year-old Julio Ruiz joined the Santa Ana 
Unified School District's parent leadership program, but he says his life has 
already changed for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz, one of 42 parents who completed the five-week leadership class on 
Monday, said the program encouraged him to participate more in his sons' 
education and improved his understanding of how the school district is run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got more communication with kids. I've been talking with them more about 
school. We're closer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes are designed to increase parents' involvement in their children's 
education and the schooling of their classmates. School officials hope to spur 
involvement in volunteer work, such as assisting in the classroom, serving on 
committees and joining or leading parent-teacher associations, said Patricia 
Gomez, who coordinates the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Research shows that when parents are involved in their local schools, students 
are more motivated and perform better. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said the idea "is to provide parents with the tools they need to become 
(effective) partners with us. If they are effective, they will in turn create 
the opportunity for students to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 The program's topics include how to encourage strong study habits in students 
and how to prompt changes in district policies. Parents also can learn about 
the types of programs the district offers and make informed choices on which 
ones might be best for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents also receive information from UC Irvine officials on the importance of 
planning early for their children to attend college and finding financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 1,000 parents have graduated from the program, which began about four 
years ago. The classes are conducted year-round in Spanish and once a year in 
English, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Lao and Khmer. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to join a class, call Gomez at (714) 558-5720. JON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; RILEY NAMED HEAD OF EL TORO BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By E.J. GONG JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nine-member panel created to oversee El Toro Marine Corp Air Station's 
conversion to civilian use on Wednesday unanimously elected County Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley as its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez was elected vice chairman on a 6-3 vote over 
Irvine Mayor Michael Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Riley and Vasquez will serve in the posts for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The election went smoothly as the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority board met 
for only the second time at the County Hall of Administration in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The leadership of the planning authority had been hotly debated before 
Wednesday's meeting. County supervisors wanted the top two positions, while 
Irvine officials sought to have city representatives share in the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 City representatives seemed satisfied by the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make sure the (election) process was open, and I'm glad that it 
is," said Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond, who sits on the board.  
</P>
<P>
 The planning authority was formed after months of wrangling to chart the 
post-military use for the 4,700-acre Marine base, which is scheduled to close 
by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which voted to hold its monthly meetings at 8 a.m. on the fourth 
Wednesday of every month, is made up of the five county supervisors, three 
council members from Irvine, which has land-use authority over a portion of the 
base, and a council member for Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 In another matter during the hourlong meeting, the board designated County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider to serve on a committee that will help 
devise a plan to clean up environmental waste at the base. E.J. GONG JR.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; COACH LOSES HAIR OVER LEAGUE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fountain Valley High School Coach Gordon Billingsley has had several close 
shaves while guiding his boys' basketball team to a Sunset League championship 
this year -- but nothing like Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 While 2,500 students watched and cheered, Billingsley sat in a chair in the 
middle of the basketball court while one of his players cut off his 
medium-length dark brown hair and shaved his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Billingsley was making good on a promise he made earlier in the season to his 
players: If they won the championship, they could shave his head. The regular 
season ended last weekend with Fountain Valley on top of the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Billingsley, who also teaches algebra and geometry, said the stunt was 
something that the players talked about throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fun thing," Billingsley said. "I don't think it made us play any 
better, but it helped build team unity and it kept the team loose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be a little bit self-conscious, but at least it will take care 
of itself," he said of his new look. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing the honors was team member Javier Scalini, who said he received the 
barber equipment as a Christmas present and cuts the hair of about 10 of his 
friends, including several basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun. I might do it as a part-time job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach complained that I pulled his hair. I asked him if he wanted me to do 
his eyebrows and he said no," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Brandon Leimbach said the head-shaving business started as a joke when 
Phil Domingo, another player, had his head shaved before the first game of the 
season. "It's been a lot of fun and we've talked about it a lot," Leimbach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's shearing came at a pep rally aimed at building school spirit for 
Fountain Valley's boys' and girls' basketball teams, both playing in the 
postseason CIF championships, and in honor of other school athletes. ROBERT 
BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FIREFIGHTERS BURN BRUSH ON RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County firefighters burned 850 acres of private grazing land in South County 
this week to try to prevent future brush fires, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prescribed burn took place at Rancho Mission Viejo, a cattle ranch, 
between Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park and Camp Pendleton, Tuesday and 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters targeted patches of dead, dry brush to encourage the growth of 
young vegetation that is edible by wild animals, said Kathleen Cha, a 
spokeswoman with the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; MEETING SCHEDULED ON LIBRARY STUDY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will hold a special meeting Wednesday to look at a 
city-commissioned library study and discuss ways to speed construction of a new 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was set after council members heard a preliminary report from a 
city-hired consultant that confirmed what city officials have been saying for 
years -- that the 9,000-square-foot library is grossly undersized. 
</P>
<P>
 "This facility is too small to accommodate adult and child programs," said 
consultant Barbara Pearson, who runs the El Segundo municipal library. "There 
are no staff offices . . . it cannot accommodate modern technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were particularly disturbed to hear that the city library held 
less than 50 children's reading programs and no adult events last year because 
the building lacks room. Pearson said other city libraries normally hold more 
than 300 programs annually for children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've proven what we've known for years, that our library is woefully 
inadequate," said Councilman Robert D. Breton.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sharon Cody, a nine-year resident of Mission Viejo and a member 
of the city library committee, said she had been used to the library's cramped 
quarters until she visited other city libraries recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really embarrassed," she said. "I've grown to learn that there are no 
books available in our library." 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson's full report is expected to be ready on Friday. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; CITY TO USE EMINENT DOMAIN TO TAKE BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, has decided to acquire a 
local bar through eminent domain despite more than two hours of emotionally 
charged public testimony against the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years, the agency has tried several times to buy out the 
tavern's owner or move the business to another part of town. The city wants to 
acquire the property so it can go ahead with a $100-million redevelopment of 
the downtown area. The city plans to transform the 50 acres into a 
residential-commercial area that would include a shopping center and an 
entertainment corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my constitutional right to oppose this project and to do business 
without being encumbered by any government interference," bar owner Seaton 
Greaves told the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing Tuesday, William M. Vega, a resident who has been battling 
the city for years, waved an American flag, and three other residents who 
oppose the redevelopment project stood behind Greaves in a show of support. 
</P>
<P>
 "This eminent domain is a dirty law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega's mother, Marina, who lost property through eminent domain in 1989, 
accused the City Council and staff of taking property for personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are victims. . . . You are like the big lion ready to jump on the victims 
to raise your ego," she said in a loud, trembling voice. "You don't care. . . . 
It's a shame!" 
</P>
<P>
 Others urged the council to preserve the bar, Sam's Place, because of its 
historical significance. The two-story tavern was built around 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the agency voted 4 to 1 in favor of acquiring it. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Kathryn E. Wiser cast the dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the absolutely wrong thing to do," she said. "We are not bettering the 
public good, and we're giving the city a terrible black eye." 
</P>
<P>
 But the rest of the agency said that taking Greaves' property is crucial to 
the elimination of blight in the downtown area and to begin the redevelopment 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been trying since 1992 to reach a settlement with Greaves, said 
Mayor Glenn G. Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been accused of not listening, but we have negotiated for a long time," 
he said. "We do care." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Greaves filed a lawsuit against the city in Orange County Superior 
Court, seeking to stop any eminent domain proceedings against his property at 
117 S. Brea Blvd. No action has been taken in that suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the city offered Greaves $467,000 for his property. Greaves 
wants $1.5 million for the city to relocate his business to Brea Boulevard and 
Birch Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations will continue when city officials meet with Greaves on Wednesday, 
Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 In related action, the agency voted 4 to 1, with Wiser dissenting, to acquire 
the Wienerschnitzel restaurant at 145 S. Brea Blvd. through eminent domain and 
spend $272,600 to relocate the business to city-owned land on the southeast 
corner of Lambert Road and Orange Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The two acquisitions were the last necessary before beginning the downtown 
redevelopment project, which is expected to break ground next month, city 
officials said.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SHOPPING CENTER SCAFFOLDING OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Permanent scaffolding that draws attention to a new shopping center will be 
allowed, though city planners said the 25-foot-high metal scaffolding does not 
blend visually with the rest of the commercial neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaheen Sadeghi, owner of the LAB at 2930 Bristol St., persuaded the Planning 
Commission on Monday to let him continue putting up the scaffolding, which he 
started without building permits.The city recently denied him the permits after 
looking at the structure, which resembles the scaffolding used when 
constructing a building. 
</P>
<P>
 A report to the commission criticized the "unfinished" look of the 
scaffolding, and noted that the building is on a street that leads to the South 
Coast Plazaarea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very subjective as to whether it looks good to you folks, or whether it 
looks good to us," Sadeghi told the commission. He said the scaffolding will be 
lighted at night, and will improve the architecturally unremarkable pair of 
buildings he owns. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-week-old LAB is a collection of 15 alternative clothing, music and other 
retail stores, a gallery space and a stage for performances. Sadeghi told the 
commission that LAB stands for "little American businesses," and that the 
project has used all recycled products to renovate the warehouses that occupy 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the project is a tremendous asset to that street," said commissioner 
Linda Dixon, who voted to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Mark Korando was the sole dissenting vote. He said the 
scaffolding may overwhelm the buildings and surrounding landscape. WILLSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY MAY DROP OUT OF WATER DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials want to re-evaluate the city's relationship with the Los 
Alamitos Water District, which provides sewer services to area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are worried that the water district, formed eight years before the 
city was incorporated in 1960, may not be able to provide efficient service at 
reasonable cost to residents in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In what amounts to filing for divorce, the city will ask the Local Agency 
Formation Commission for permission to "detach" from the water district and 
assume sewer services within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district provides sewer services to about 8,000 households in Los 
Alamitos, Rossmoor and portions of Seal Beach and Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just looking after the interest of Los Alamitos residents," said Mayor 
Anthony R. Selvaggi on Monday after a unanimous council vote to break away from 
the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to provide the best sewer service at the cheapest cost to our 
residents. There are no personalities involved," Selvaggi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council action came one month after Carolyn T. Sylvia, wife of Los 
Alamitos Councilman Charles E. Sylvia, suggested that the water district 
dissolve itself to cut administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report submitted to the five-member board and the council, Carolyn Sylvia 
said that taxpayers could save $70,000 a year by eliminating the salaries, 
benefits and office expenses of the water district's general manager and board 
of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district officials said Carolyn Sylvia's projected savings were 
exaggerated. Arylss Burkett, a water district director, said that Carolyn 
Sylvia's suggestion may have been prompted by Los Alamitos officials who may be 
interested in the district's properties and reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burkett on Monday seemed resigned that the district may eventually have to 
disband. 
</P>
<P>
 "My inclination is not to fight," said Burkett. "If the people of Los Alamitos 
want it, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwyna Moyer, a water district director for the last 20 years, said that she 
won't fight the council decision either. "I'm getting tired of fighting with 
politicians," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Rosenthal, president of the board, said he will "cooperate in any way I 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed City Manager Robert C. Dunek to prepare the application 
to LAFCO, the agency responsible for creating and dissolving public agencies, 
and to notify surrounding communities about the decision. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; OVERNIGHT PARKING PERMITS TO COST $5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than three months of debate, the City Council decided Tuesday night 
to charge residents a fee for overnight parking permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, people who park their vehicles on the city's streets between 2 and 
6 a.m. must have permits displayed in the cars. Under the new program, those 
who need permits must apply for new ones and pay $5. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the permits will have to be renewed annually, at no charge. But 
lost permits must be replaced at a cost of $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two permits will be issued per single-family house and one per apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents had tried to get the city to abolish the use of parking permits 
altogether but council members voted 3 to 2 to keep the current ordinance, 
which requires overnight parking permits, and to charge for them. Council 
members Kathryn E. Wiser and Carrey J. Nelson voted against the ordinance, 
questioning the need for parking permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another fee that the people shouldn't have to bear," Nelson said, adding 
that the permits should be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett R. Barbre, a representative of the Apartment Assn. of Orange County, 
agreed. He called the ordinance "bureaucratic overkill" and said it is unfair 
to renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who favor the parking ordinance said it does not discriminate 
against renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents said the parking ordinance causes undue hardship and they can't 
understand why they will not be allowed to park more than one or two cars in 
front of their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sandra Nolte: "I don't think (the ordinance) is going to serve the people 
at all. People have to park somewhere and they should be able to park wherever 
they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Glenn G. Parker said the ordinance helps to cut down on street 
maintenance and is "in the best public interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Vehicles without permits receive parking citations and owners who repeat 
violations face fines of up to $1,000 or jail terms of up to six months for 
parking on city streets longer than 30 minutes between 2 and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The current parking ordinance requires that free, unlimited parking permits be 
obtained every three years.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently, street sweeping is done between 5:30 and 11:30 a.m. Monday through 
Friday. MIMI KO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 13-year trustee on the five-member Buena Park Library District board has 
resigned, and the board is looking for someone to fill the vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Bill Hardin, 81, resigned for personal reasons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was time to get out," said Hardin, a board member since November, 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The person chosen to replace Hardin will complete Hardin's term, which expires 
in November. The new board member will have to run for office in November to 
retain the seat for another four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees are expected to interview candidates at the April 6 meeting and make 
an appointment at that time.  
</P>
<P>
 Hardin, a retired printer, said he is planning to move from the city. He and 
his wife, Jennie, who will celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary in April, 
also plan to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 People interested in Hardin's job are required to mail a resume by March 14 to 
the library, 7150 La Palma Ave. Candidates must be 18 years old or older, a 
resident of Buena Park and a registered voter in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 More information is available by calling the city library at (714) 826-4100.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; RANCH BUILDINGS MAY GO TO FAIRGROUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Fair officials are interested in relocating some or all of the 
structures on the historic Buffalo Ranch to a site at the Costa Mesa 
fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is outlined in a letter this week from the fair's interim general 
manager to the Irvine Co., which owns the Buffalo Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Thomas, the Irvine Co.'s vice president for corporate communications, 
said the company is "intrigued" by the proposal but has made no decisions on it 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface, it makes a lot of sense. The devil is always in the details," 
Thomas said. "We will be sitting down with fair (officials) and seeing what 
their needs are and whether we can accommodate them and make it work out." 
</P>
<P>
 The move, however, has concerned some preservationists working to have the 
ranch listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so few building sites of historic significance that have been set 
aside. It would be a shame to lose this one in Irvine," Councilwoman Paula 
Werner said. "I'd love to see the (buildings) stay here and used for some 
public function, perhaps as a museum." 
</P>
<P>
 A review of the site by the State Office of Historic Preservation found that 
the ranch would probably be eligible for the register. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch -- at MacArthur Boulevard and Ford Road -- consists of more than a 
dozen buildings that in the 1950s made up a popular amusement park known for 
its display of live animals. In the 1960s, the ranch was the headquarters for 
the architects who designed UC Irvine, Fashion Island Newport Beach and parts 
of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the ranch buildings were rented out to business tenants. But 
the Irvine Co. has decided clear out the complex, in part because the upcoming 
realignment of Ford Road will limit auto access to the ranch from MacArthur 
Boulevard. The last of the Buffalo Ranch tenants is scheduled to leave the 
complex this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. is interested in preserving the buildings but not necessarily 
on the current site, which is zoned for residential use in Irvine's general 
plan, said Carol Hoffman, vice president of entitlements for the company.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY SWEETENS OFFER IN POLICE UNION TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what may be the final attempt to resolve a 19-month wage dispute with 
police officers, the city has offered them a larger pay raise, the police 
association president said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bottolfson, president of the Anaheim Police Assn., said the city has 
increased its two-year raise package from 6.5% to 6.75%.Additionally, the city 
will give each officer an immediate bonus of $1,000 instead of the $750 
previously offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the city's last and final offer," Bottolfson said. "Now it's up to 
the rank and file to see if they are going to accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 He said a vote of the membership will be held next Wednesday. The union must 
inform the city by Feb. 28 if it intends to accept the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's total wage package includes raises of 3.25% this year and 3.5% next 
year. Union officials said it is a three-year contract that dates back to July, 
1992, when the last contract expired. The union's last raise was in July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth could not be reached for comment late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract dispute between the city and police officers has resulted in 
several public protests by the officers, including a 24-hour "blue flu" job 
action last month. The officers have also demonstrated during City Council 
meetings and at Disneyland throughout the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers have been seeking a 10% salary increase over two years. City 
officials have insisted that they cannot afford to meet the union's demands, 
especially when they are faced with an $8-million deficit for the next fiscal 
budget.MATT LAIT

LATINOS' SUPPORT NEEDED, GOP CHAIRMAN SAYS; POLITICS: REPUBLICAN PARTY CHIEF 
TELLS COUNTY LEADERS THAT RECRUITMENT OF SUCH VOTERS 'IS HUGELY IMPORTANT' IN 
KEY UPCOMING RACES, INCLUDING GOV. WILSON'S REELECTION BATTLE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to build on the party's victories of 1993, national Republican Party 
Chairman Haley Barbour told Orange County leaders Wednesday that the 
recruitment of Latino voters "is hugely important" to the GOP's future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The victories, which included the elections of Republican mayors in Los 
Angeles and New York, were partly accomplished with increased support from 
Latino voters, Barbour said. That strategy should be integrated into the 
party's efforts to reelect Gov. Pete Wilson and to capture the U.S. Senate seat 
held by Democrat Dianne Feinstein, he urged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sick of our leaving those (Latino) votes on the table," Barbour said 
during a speech sponsored by the California Republican Party and the Orange 
County Republican Party's Hispanic Committee. "We don't have to, we are not 
going to and the success that we had in 1993 can be replicated over and over 
again across the country in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour said Wilson's reelection would be the national party's top priority 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1994, California must be the superstar state of the Republican Party," 
Barbour said. "There's no more important race in the U.S. to the Republican 
Party than the reelection of Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Local Democratic Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia said later that the pitch 
for Latino voters must mean Republicans are "running scared." 
</P>
<P>
 "They never gave a damn about Latino voters before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said Latinos have not forgotten the 1990 Assembly campaign in central 
Orange County when the Republican Party and its then-candidate Curt Pringle 
hired uniformed security guards to stand outside polling places in largely 
Latino precincts in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way Republicans are going to get Latino votes is to buy them," 
Garcia said, referring to their ability to finance voter registration drives. 
"They are going to do what they can to get out the vote -- or to suppress 
votes. Latinos have seen that in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 But during his speech at the Center Club, Barbour said there is "no more 
important place" than California -- and Orange County, in particular -- to 
recruit Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that he had been introduced to the audience by state Republican Party 
Chairman Tirso del Junco, who in turn, had been introduced by Orange County 
party Chairman Tom Fuentes, Barbour quipped: " . . . I feel like I'm the Anglo 
representative" on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hispanic voters share our views and values about family, about small 
business, about opportunity, about a strong national defense, yet so many 
Hispanic voters voted Democrat despite the fact that they think like us," 
Barbour said. "This is a party that has the tools to take the message into the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning his attention to campaign strategy, Barbour said Feinstein "is not 
invincible." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in voting to cut defense spending, Feinstein caused the loss of 
thousands of jobs in the state and "cut the throat of the economy of 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour said the party also would attempt to persuade voters that although 
President Clinton might sound like a conservative, he is not likely to follow 
through on his "tough on crime" and "welfare reform" promises.

MAN WHO SUFFERS FROM MEMORY LOSS IS MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 75-year-old man who suffers from short-term memory loss was reported missing 
after he went to the hardware store Tuesday and did not return, the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest William Constable left about 4:40 p.m. Tuesday from where he lives with 
his wife on Ridge Route Drive, according to Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies searched the neighborhood and local businesses but did not find him. 
</P>
<P>
 Constable is 5 feet 8, 160 pounds, white, and has blue eyes and gray hair, 
Martini said. His car is a 1991 white Ford Tempo, California license 2VMM799. 
He was last seen wearing a long-sleeve plaid flannel shirt, blue jeans and 
white tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about Constable should call (714) 647-7044 or (714) 
647-1832.

STATE PANEL TORN ON BEACH CURFEWS; GOVERNMENT: HUNTINGTON BEACH'S 
MOULTON-PATTERSON IS AMONG COASTAL COMMISSION MEMBERS WHO OPPOSE MOVE TO ISSUE 
GUIDELINES THAT LIMIT CITIES' OPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If a meeting here Wednesday was any indication, the California Coastal 
Commission may have a hard time deciding whether to force coastal cities to 
limit beach curfew laws. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This commission must put some trust in local city councils to govern," said 
Linda Moulton-Patterson, a commissioner and mayor of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As an elected official whose council imposed a beach curfew last year, 
Moulton-Patterson is a vocal critic of the commission's recent challenge of 
curfews imposed by local governments to help curb late-night crime on beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite criticism and reluctance from five of the 11 commissioners, the panel 
voted to distribute proposed guidelines to local governments for comment. The 
guidelines, proposed by the commission's executive director, would tightly 
regulate any future beach closures. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, the commission's executive director, Peter M. Douglas, issued 
warnings to 73 cities and counties, including four in Orange County, along the 
state's 1,100-mile coastline that beach curfews are illegal without state 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 That action prompted heated debate by elected officials who believed the 
commission was going beyond its authority and meddling in local affairs. As 
Moulton-Patterson said: "We are closest to the problem and know what our 
problems are." 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 28, after meeting with representatives of six Orange County coastal 
cities, Douglas said the state would no longer challenge the curfews recently 
imposed by cities, but would review them.  
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines drafted by Douglas are the commission's attempt to determine 
when and how curfews may be enacted without violating state laws and ensuring 
the public's right to beach access. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed guidelines, cities wishing to prohibit or restrict public 
use of beaches must notify the commission before the action, state a reason for 
a curfew, and carefully consider alternatives to sweeping beach closures. Also, 
city ordinances enacting a curfew should last no more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas described the guidelines only as a "work sheet, a starting point for 
beginning dialogue with local governments." 
</P>
<P>
 But some commissioners called the proposals premature. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to hear more from the cities first," said Eureka Mayor Nancy 
Flemming. "I thought it was premature to distribute these proposed guidelines 
when we haven't heard back from a lot of cities yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Division among commissioners was clear as Moulton-Patterson was questioned by 
her colleagues about remarks she made on local control. 
</P>
<P>
 "These cities want to reduce their police enforcement on the beaches, and no 
person in their right mind would even want to go fishing or walking on the 
beach where there's no police protection," said Madelyn Glickfeld, a 
commissioner from Malibu. "With a curfew, all we're doing is just ceding the 
beach to the criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand that the gang problem is real," Glickfeld said, "but if people 
want to roll up their communities at night, well, these curfews seem to do just 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Commission member Lily Cervantes took exception with the Huntington Beach 
curfew which, as explained by Moulton-Patterson, allows fishing and walking on 
the beach but prohibits youths from gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if we have people congregating to fish at night? If four or five people 
want to get together and go fishing and they're laughing out there and having 
fun, that's OK?" Cervantes said. "We need to be explicit about ordinances that 
use the word congregate. " 
</P>
<P>
 If local governments say they don't have enough money to patrol beaches and 
parks now, Cervantes added, "how do they enforce the curfew?" 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas said the guidelines will be sent to at least 2,000 agencies, 
organizations and environmental groups. Once the commission staff receives 
comments, Douglas said, he plans to revise the guidelines before he brings them 
back to the commission for a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we can get our guidelines approved this year," Douglas said.

METZLER ENTERS ASSEMBLY RACE AS PARTY FAVORITE; DEMOCRATS: THE SANTA ANA 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PRESIDENT IS ENDORSED BY FORMER STATE AND COUNTY CHAIRMEN 
IN THE RACE FOR UMBERG'S 69TH DISTRICT SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With two local Democratic Party standard-bearers at his side, Santa Ana 
Chamber of Commerce President Michael Metzler on Wednesday took on the air of 
the "anointed" candidate for the Democratic primary in the 69th Assembly 
District as he kicked off his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Metzler does not have the official backing of his party, the 
endorsements from former Orange County Democratic Party Chairman Howard Adler 
and former state party Chairman Richard O'Neill raise his status as the party's 
preference to replace Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, who is stepping down to run for state attorney general, was among 
those who encouraged Metzler to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference at the County Hall of Administration, Adler said 
Metzler is the best candidate to "follow through with the tradition that Tom 
Umberg has already established . . . good on business issues, good on crime 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The other Democrats in the race are Latino political activist Zeke Hernandez, 
Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno and John Patterson, a contractor who ran 
unsuccessfully two years ago for a council seat in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 That O'Neill and Adler would want to replicate Umberg's style and moderate 
politics is not unexpected, since Umberg's departure threatens the loss of the 
only legislative seat in Orange County now held by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 69th (Assembly District) has to be held as our base here," Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district by a margin of 53% to 36%, but 
the GOP is expected to target the district in an attempt to sweep Orange 
County's state and federal legislative districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Wednesday, National Republican Party Chairman Haley Barbour urged 
local party activists to go after Umberg's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In a later interview, Barbour said state and national party officials were in 
the process of deciding which California races would receive national funding. 
Although he did not know if the 69th Assembly race would be targeted by state 
party officials, he said the seat should be pursued by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't try to delegate from Washington what Republicans in California 
should focus on," Barbour said. "But I think this is a super opportunity for us 
to pick up another seat in the Assembly." 
</P>
<P>
 Adler, O'Neill and Metzler emphasized the importance of the seat to the 
Democratic Party, but downplayed the Republican threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars the last time with (Republican 
candidate) Jo Ellen Allen, and the result was that Tom (Umberg) got 60% of the 
vote," Adler said of the 1992 race. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to be fielding a weaker and weaker field of candidates," O'Neill 
added. "I don't know of anybody in this (Republican field) who looks strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler, who emphasized his work in Santa Ana with the Chamber of Commerce on 
issues such as education and jobs creation, said he was ready for a tough 
fight. "I would not have chosen to do this if I was not in it for the total 
campaign," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five Republicans who have declared their candidacies are Martin Ageson, an 
attorney from Santa Ana; Rosemarie I. Avila, a Santa Ana school board member; 
businesswoman Judy Buffin-Edge; party activist and businessman Jim Morrissey, 
and businessman Virgel L. Nickell. 
</P>
<P>
 The race in the 69th apparently has slightly superseded what was once the 
Democrats' top priority: to defeat Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Adler said that although the 69th Assembly race is the Democrats' "targeted 
race," they have not given up hopes of ousting Dornan from the 46th 
Congressional District in central Orange County, in which Democrats have a 
slight edge in voter registration over Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dornan has not officially announced his intention to seek reelection, 
Adler pointed to a recent fund-raising letter by Dornan in which he states his 
preparation for his "final race for Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan had been considering running for other offices or taking a leave from 
politics to enter broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dornan aide would not disclose Dornan's decision, but he said an 
announcement is scheduled for Friday.

TRANSIENT HELD IN RESTAURANT ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 36-year-old transient was arrested on suspicion of robbing a restaurant of 
$460 Tuesday night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Clark allegedly entered El Taco Sabroso Restaurant on West La Habra 
Boulevard just before 9 p.m., Sgt. Phil Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant employees told officers Clark indicated that he had a handgun and 
demanded money from the cash register, police said. He then fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes later, patrolling officers arrested him three blocks away near 
El Dorado Avenue and El Rancho Drive. Clark had the $460 in cash on him, 
Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was held in the city jail Wednesday in lieu of $25,000 bail, police said.

ABDUCTED BOY SEEN WITH BIOLOGICAL PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 4-year-old boy taken last weekend from his foster home in Rancho Santa 
Margarita was sighted Wednesday with his biological parents in Anaheim, the 
Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified witness spotted Taj Yaser Jayyusi and the couple in a car 
going westbound on Orange Avenue from Beach Boulevard at 4:40 p.m., authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Taj disappeared Saturday morning, authorities said they feared that Yaser 
Majed Jayyusi, 55, a Jordanian national, and Deborah Ann Jayyusi, 35, might 
attempt to flee the country with the boy, who has been in foster care for two 
years. The couple also have a daughter in foster care in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities would not reveal why the two children were removed from the 
Jayyusis' home. The Jayyusis are permitted weekly, court-monitored visits with 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the boy was taken from a garage that had been converted to a 
playroom, while his foster mother was taking a shower. The foster mother, Susan 
White, said the garage door was open about a foot. 
</P>
<P>
 White, 43, had started adoption proceedings, and a hearing to terminate the 
Jayyusis' parental rights was scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information regarding Taj is asked to call the Sheriff's 
Department at (714) 647-7000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jayyusis were driving a yellow 1980 Oldsmobile Delta, according to Lt. Dan 
Martini.

THIRD BREA COMPUTER FIRM IN A YEAR INVADED, ROBBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Robbers invaded a computer accessory company Wednesday and held employees at 
gunpoint while robbing them of their property, including a Mercedes-Benz. It 
was the third such robbery in the city in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea police said three to five men entered the business about 3 p.m., tied up 
the employees and seized cash, credit cards and jewelry from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not further identify the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of the robbery, Brea Police Officer Susan Howey spotted the 
stolen car and arrested a suspect who identified himself as Tam Ngyuen Le, 21, 
of Perris. Le was taken into custody without incident, according to Detective 
Grant Gulickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year on Feb. 1 and Nov. 23, groups of three to five armed men invaded 
high-tech firms specializing in manufacturing computer chips, bound employees, 
robbed the businesses and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Four men who police believe planned the Feb. 1 robbery of PC Craft Inc. were 
arrested in Monterey Park and later pleaded guilty. Police recovered more than 
$300,000 in computer chips and other electronic equipment. But PC Craft 
officials later said the $2.2 million in stolen chips ultimately cost the 
company $5.9 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Those responsible for actually carrying out the armed robbery were never 
apprehended, despite a $50,000 reward offered by Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nov. 23 robbery of Aten Research Inc. involved a loss of about $100,000 in 
computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 9, six armed gunmen robbed an Irvine computer firm, seizing tens of 
thousands of computer chips after forcing employees to the floor and tying them 
up.

PROPOSAL TO KEEP WEDAA IN CLEAN-AIR POST OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Orange County mayors and three city council members on Wednesday rejected 
a compromise proposed by the mayors of Santa Ana and Anaheim that would enable 
the controversial chairman of the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
to remain on the board until November. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Mayor Tom Daly of Anaheim and Mayor Daniel H. Young of 
Santa Ana wrote their fellow Orange County mayors, asking them to support a 
proposal severely limiting the powers of Henry W. Wedaa. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa, a Yorba Linda City Council member, has not been able to muster the 
votes required to remain Orange County's representative to the AQMD, and thus 
continue serving as its chairman. The county's mayors will meet again tonight 
to decide whether to retain or replace Wedaa, who has been criticized as 
anti-business for his stances on protecting air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa said Monday that he agreed with the compromise offered by Daly and 
Young. If enough mayors agree tonight, he will automatically leave the AQMD 
when his term on the Yorba Linda council ends in November, since he has 
announced he will not seek reelection to that body. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a letter to members of the Brea City Council, Costa Mesa Mayor Sandra 
L. Genis and Orange Mayor Gene Beyer strongly rejected the proposal, saying it 
"is neither a compromise nor workable," and urged its defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayors called the proposal "terrible public policy," saying that "the only 
thing it accomplishes is to delay a difficult decision for a few months." 
</P>
<P>
 They were joined in their criticism by city council members Mark Leyes of 
Garden Grove, Fred Hunter of Anaheim and Heffrey M. Thomas of Tustin.

HEART FAILURE IN YOUTH LIKELY IS CONGENITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Massive coronary arrest like the one that killed an 11th-grader on the 
basketball court in Irvine on Wednesday is extremely rare and usually triggered 
by some congenital heart defect, according to a heart specialist at UCI Medical 
Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Byron Allen, UCI's director of coronary care, said that in the "vast 
majority of cases," adolescents who suddenly die during exertion "have some 
congenital heart disease that has not been diagnosed." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said the most common culprit is a genetic disease called hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy which causes an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle that 
predisposes its victims to abnormal heart rhythms.  
</P>
<P>
 This disease "usually manifests itself in the teens or 20s" during strenuous 
activity, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Allen said sometimes a person can live a normal life span with the disease 
or not suffer a heart arrest until an older age. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he said, one of his patients is a 35-year-old woman whose 
congenital heart defect made her collapse two weeks ago on a tennis court. In 
that case, he said, a doctor who was playing in the next court and paramedics 
were able to revive her. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another possible explanation, Allen said, would be a viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are cold viruses that in the vast majority of people cause just a 
cold," he said, "but for some whose immune systems are undermined they can 
attack the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said sudden death in adolescents is so rare that it is not practical to 
screen everyone in that age group for heart disease. But he said that children 
whose parents or siblings have congenital heart disease should receive 
electrocardiograms to look for heart rhythm abnormalities.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: LEO KOTTKE "PECULIAROSO" PRIVATE MUSIC  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leo Kottke is one of those rare artists whose latest album never differs 
radically from its predecessor, yet he never seems to be caught in a rut. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, one time he might release an album full of instrumentals showcasing his 
wizardry on six- and 12-string guitars; another time, as with 1991's "Great Big 
Boy," devote the collection to his signature craggy vocals.But each time out, 
there's no mistaking who is at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's because this self-taught musician is in a class by himself to 
begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 Few singer-songwriters also qualify as virtuoso instrumentalists, a facet 
Kottke exhibits on the rhythmically off-kilter opening cut, "Peg Leg." Few 
virtuosos can play blues with as much gutsy authority as Kottke manages on his 
version of "Poor Boy," the oft-covered number by Bukka White and Kottke's 
mentor, John Fahey. Even if they could, it's unlikely they could then turn 
around and be as unabashedly romantic as Kottke is in performing the Platters' 
melancholy "Twilight Time." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's hard to think of any other similarly well-rounded musician who also 
possesses the loopy sense of humor that can produce a song like "Turning Into 
Randolph Scott (Humid Child)" -- one that is both a teasing and touching look 
at the road from childhood to adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peculiaroso," yes, but also marveloso -- as usual. RANDY LEWIS

3 -- HOUR TOUR: RESTORED MISSION INN BOASTS RIVERSIDE'S COURT OF PAST RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, Anne Michaud is a staff writer for The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The closets in the older rooms at Riverside's Mission Inn hint at its early 
grandeur. They are cavernous, built to hold travel trunks and clothing enough 
for weeks-long visits. 
</P>
<P>
 From the turn of the century to World War II, the inn was a resort 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
 In its earliest days, it was a two- or three-day coach ride from Los Angeles. 
Having made that journey, people stayed a while. 
</P>
<P>
 The inn was worthy of visits by presidents (Theodore Roosevelt and Taft) and 
presidents-to-be (Nixon and Reagan). 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the inn has been quiet. For most of the 1980s, it was closed. And, to 
be truthful, it had been decaying for decades before that. At one time, the 
oldest of the hotel's wings was used as a dormitory by UC Riverside students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Inn has since undergone a $40-million restoration and reopened a 
little more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This eclectic inn, whose rooms rent for $85 to $180 per night, boasts of 
architectural styles ranging from Medieval European to mission-era California 
to the Orient. It is once again worth a special trip. 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 to 3: The Mission Inn Foundation, a nonprofit group dedicated to the 
preservation and exhibition of the inn and its artifacts, offers 90-minute 
tours every day but Monday. The tour begins in a tree-shaded courtyard 
surrounded on three sides by the U-shaped inn. This area was originally named 
Court of the Birds, and it was home to parrots and macaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds were so tame that they traveled on the shoulders of Frank Miller, 
the inn's early owner, developer and host. Images of macaws are still found 
throughout the inn, in such unlikely places as shower stalls and stained-glass 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 In his later years, Miller toured the world and sent artifacts back to the 
inn. Evidence of his travels are paneling from a 17th-Century Belgian convent, 
a Steinway Centennial piano, church pews from Westminster Abbey and a 
5-by-18-foot wood carving titled "Mandarin's Journey." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also modeled the inn's later wings on the architecture he saw in Europe 
and Asia, as well as on California missions. Highlights are the Spanish Patio, 
the Ho-O-Kan Room and the St. Francis Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour finishes in a commercial section of the inn. It housed a barbershop 
at one time and now is home to the Mission Inn museum. 
</P>
<P>
 If your tour guides forget, remind them to tell you about the escaped circus 
elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 3:45: From the inn's museum, follow the pedestrian mall (Main Street) 
across 7th Street. On your left, you will find the California Museum of 
Photography. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a wonderful museum, vital and intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibits on display, now through March 20, are of photos taken by homeless 
children in Washington, D.C., and in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington project, titled "Shooting Back," was organized by photographers 
and artists there. They taught children age 5 to 17 in shelters to use 
35-millimeter cameras. (A 30-minute video on view at the museum tells the story 
of the project.) 
</P>
<P>
 The result is frank pictures of life in shelters -- images that might have 
eluded an outsider. There are about 100 in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 The local version of "Shooting Back," called "Helping Hands in the Inland 
Empire," seeks to show that there are impoverished families in places other 
than big cities such as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 3:45 to 4:30: After seeing the museum, stop for a beer, and maybe an early 
dinner, at the Riverside Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
 This restaurant brews six of its own beers. You can buy a three-beer sampler 
for $3 or try all six for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is filled with sandwiches, salads and wood-oven-baked pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices run about $6 to $8 for an entree. The Riverside turkey sandwich ($5.95) 
is a treat.

CONSERVATIVES TO PROTEST CATHOLIC CONGRESS IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conservative Catholics, upset about speakers they deride as "ex-priests, 
apostates and schismatics," said Wednesday they plan to picket a religious 
education congress that is expected to draw 20,000 Catholic educators to the 
Anaheim Convention Center this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy over the annual conference, which begins with a youth day 
celebration today and continues through Sunday, erupted earlier this month with 
demands for the resignation of the conference coordinator and a leading nun in 
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which sponsors the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The appalling thing is that this congress consists of people who teach 
religion and the speakers who will address them do not adhere to church 
doctrine," said Adria Laubacher, a spokeswoman for the California Coalition of 
Concerned Catholics, based in Camarillo. "It's a whole horrible parade of 
dissenters." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Rivera, a spokesman for the Los Angeles archdiocese, said the protesters 
belong to several small groups of conservative Catholics and do not speak for 
the majority of church members in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church is very diverse these days, with a wide variety of people and 
views," Rivera said. "This group of very conservative, traditional Catholics 
has objected to some of the changes that have taken place in the church in 
recent years and has become increasingly outspoken." 
</P>
<P>
 The critics, a small coalition of uncertain membership that includes a 
Tustin-based group, Catholics United for the Splendor of Truth, said they 
object to a number of the speakers because they have expressed views that 
include abortion rights, support for the ordination of women priests and New 
Age spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger M. Mahony announced two weeks ago that he had revoked an 
invitation to Daniel Maguire, a former priest and abortion-rights advocate who 
had been scheduled to speak at the meeting, the nation's largest Catholic 
religious education conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Also dropped from the program was Father John R. Aurelio, a Buffalo, N.Y., 
priest who was placed on leave by his bishop in December after allegations 
surfaced that he had molested two boys 15 to 20 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Aurelio has not been charged, and the statute of limitations for any alleged 
crime has expired. Officials at the Buffalo diocese could not be reached for 
comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera confirmed Wednesday that Aurelio was no longer on the conference 
program but said he did not know the reason for the change. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a statement released by his office, Mahony also has taken the 
unusual step of writing to all speakers to request that they adhere to Catholic 
teachings in their conference presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the statement, Mahony said he shared concerns about the orthodoxy of what 
he called "a very small number" of the invited speakers. The congress, he 
wrote, has simply grown so rapidly in recent years that his staff has been 
unable to complete background checks of the speakers or adequately research 
their writings before issuing invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 The cardinal said he has instituted a new system that will allow the 
backgrounds of speakers for future congresses to be reviewed more thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, however, anger over the current conference continues. Thirty to 40 
protesters demonstrated outside Mahony's Los Angeles chancery Tuesday and 
announced plans to picket the Anaheim conference every day except today, when 
9,000 high school students are scheduled to attend workshops, masses and 
musical performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We chose not to picket (today) because the kids are confused enough these 
days as it is," explained a spokesman for Catholics United for the Splendor of 
Truth, a loose-knit group of conservative Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 The activist, who asked not to be named because he said he feared reprisal 
from the Catholic hierarchy, said the group is part of an evolving coalition of 
anti-abortion and traditional Catholic organizations in Orange County that has 
formed in response to what it contends is the growing influence of unorthodox 
teaching in the church in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the coalition's demands are that Mahony cancel invitations to all 
speakers who have established what Laubacher called "a paper trail of dissent 
to the teachings" of Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 Her organization, which took part in the protest at the Los Angeles chancery, 
has also charged that the Los Angeles Archdiocese's Office of Religious 
Education, which planned the conference, is "in the hands of dissenters." They 
have called for the resignations of Sister Edith Prendergast, the director of 
religious education, and conference coordinator Adrian Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 While the diocese office occasionally draws picketers from a variety of 
causes, Rivera said he could recall only one previous protest at the 
conference, which has been held in Anaheim for about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Steichen, a conservative Catholic author and activist, said Wednesday 
that she sees the protests as part of a growing division in the church between 
progressives and traditionalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true that the Catholic bureaucracy is riddled with dissent and has been 
for a generation," said Steichen, who is planning to cover the conference as a 
free-lance writer. "What I find quite exciting is that people are finally 
starting to object to the influence of these dissenters." 
</P>
<P>
 Steichen and others this week dismissed Mahony's statement that he has sent 
letters to all speakers insisting that their presentations be "in full harmony 
with the church's teachings." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony also has telephoned another speaker, Father Michael Crosby of 
Milwaukee, seeking similar assurances that Crosby will adhere to church 
doctrine in his remarks at the conference, Rivera said. An article in the 
Wanderer, a national Catholic weekly newspaper, recently accused Crosby of 
comparing the Catholic hierarchy to the abusive parent in a dysfunctional 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mahony's office has made such a big deal of the fact that he has asked them 
all only to speak on orthodox subjects," said the spokesman for Catholics 
United. "But even if they got up and spoke about Donald Duck, they shouldn't be 
allowed to speak to an orthodox Catholic conference." 
</P>
<P>
 He and others said the flash point for their protests was the announcement 
that Maguire -- a Marquette University professor who is a vocal advocate of 
abortion rights -- had been invited to speak at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But Laubacher said she found it dismaying that the congress would still 
include speakers whose views challenged the church's traditional teachings, 
especially in light of last year's papal encyclical "Veritatis Splendor," in 
which the Pope called on bishops to uphold orthodox Catholicism.

 While the Pope "uses as his sources St. Matthew, St. Paul, St. Augustine," she 
said, "in this archdiocese, we use ex-priests, apostates and schismatics. The 
faithful deserve better."

O.C. ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO U.S.-JAPAN TRADE CHILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When trade relations between Japan and the United States get chilly, an icy 
breeze blows through Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan is Orange County's largest export destination, taking about $1 billion 
in computers, medicines and other goods produced locally every year. And Orange 
County is the home of U.S. headquarters for Japanese companies like Mazda, 
Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and Ricoh, which provide thousands of jobs locally. 
</P>
<P>
 So it hit home Wednesday after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said 
that the United States may seek high tariffs on several hundred million 
dollars' worth of Japanese goods in response to Japan's refusal to fully open 
its cellular telephone market to companies such as Motorola Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was a general deterioration of exports to Japan, then Orange County 
is bound to lose more than other areas," said economist Anil Puri of Cal State 
Fullerton, who has analyzed the county's export industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Without specifics, many businesses were unsure of how to gauge the 
announcement or know what to expect, but officials were uniformly unhappy about 
the prospects of rising discord among the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see it deteriorate to the point of emotional hatred," said 
Maho Fukuda, president of Maho International Co. Ltd., an Irvine trading 
company that sells U.S.-made industrial machinery to the Japanese. Her business 
would suffer if trade barriers went up, she said, but "it will (put) pressure 
on the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
 What Fukuda said she fears most is a resurgence of anti-Japanese sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are always blaming the Japanese and the Japanese are always blaming 
the Americans," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 30 days, Kantor said, the United States would publish a list of 
Japanese products that could be subject to punitive tariffs of up to 100% if 
the cellular phone dispute isn't resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, chief government spokesman Masayoshi Takemura said Tokyo would wait 
for a U.S. decision on sanctions before responding to the U.S. trade 
representative's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 But a bilateral trade war is unlikely, suggests Cal State Fullerton's Puri. 
Japan and the United States both have a lot to lose from retaliatory tariffs 
and other restrictions, so any action by the Clinton Administration will 
probably be fairly limited, he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 About 16% of all Orange County companies that sell overseas are trading with 
Japan, said UCI management professor Kenneth L. Kraemer, who released the 
university's annual survey of the county's top executives earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 While a trade war could cause short-term pain, Kraemer said he sees long-term 
benefits. Such action could force Japan to pry open markets for high-technology 
products heretofore closed to Americans, creating new opportunities for Orange 
County companies, such as computer disk-drive maker Western Digital Corp. in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, most Orange County companies with ties to Japan are waiting to see 
how the two nations respond. 
</P>
<P>
 If the United States imposes tariffs on Japanese-made cellular phones, that 
could hurt phone manufacturer Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc. in Cypress, 
part of the far-flung Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Electric Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early for us to tell what impact there would be," said Mitsubishi 
spokesman Tom Chapman. "It has been mentioned that cellular telephones might 
face a tariff, but we don't know what will happen." The company, however, has 
several options. For instance, if tariffs are slapped on assembled phones 
imported from Japan, Mitsubishi would likely expand its assembly operations in 
Braselton, Ga., which depends largely on Japanese-made parts. 
</P>
<P>
 If the parts are hit with tariffs too, Mitsubishi would be forced to find 
American suppliers of those parts or consider raising the prices on its phones, 
though they are assembled in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Toshiba America Information Systems Inc. in Irvine could see its 
business disrupted if the Clinton Administration reinstitutes tariffs on 
imported computer screens, a sanction that was lifted last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under President George Bush, tariffs were imposed on flat-panel displays that 
were imported into the United States, but not on displays that were brought 
into the country as part of an assembled computer. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, companies with U.S. manufacturing, such as Toshiba America in 
Irvine, shifted assembly of the affected portable computers offshore so that 
they wouldn't be hit with a tariff. Critics of the policy contended the tariff 
forced thousands of jobs overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lifting of that tariff allowed us to assemble the computers here and 
create jobs here," said Robert Wittenburg, a Toshiba spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rino Zaccuri, spokesman for Ricoh Electronics Inc. in Tustin, said the company 
doesn't expect to be affected with product sanctions since it is not involved 
in the telecommunications industry. The company's 1,000 employees in the county 
are involved in making and selling copiers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the currency fluctuations resulting from the rise of the yen could play 
havoc with the company's financial planning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like with the electronics companies, Orange County's cadre of Japanese car and 
motorcycle importers say they are paying close attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese auto and motorcycle importers -- Mazda, Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, Suzuki 
and Yamaha, which all have U.S. headquarters in the county -- already are being 
hurt by the growing weakness of the dollar against the yen. So to the extent 
that trade policy affects currency exchange rates and pressures Japanese 
companies to increase prices in the United States, the burgeoning trade war 
would be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strength of the yen affects us more" than the present strain in trade 
relations between the two countries, said Kim Custer, spokesman for Mitsubishi 
Motor Sales of America Inc. in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Meyers, marketing director for American Suzuki Motor Corp., the Brea-based 
importer of cars, sports utility vehicles, motorcycles and outboard motors, 
said he and other officials of the company don't see the trade dispute 
affecting their business at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, the issue seems strictly one targeted at mobile phones, and we 
think any retaliation against Japan will be in that area and wouldn't affect 
our industry." 
</P>

HUNGER FOR HEROES, VILLAINS ROOTED IN AMERICAN PSYCHE; MEDIA: IN A SOCIETY THAT 
VENERATES THE INDIVIDUAL OVER COMMUNITY, COVERAGE OFTEN GLORIFIES FAME -- AND 
INFAMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an old American folk saying, dating back to the mid-19th Century: 
</P>
<P>
 "The wheel that squeaks the loudest is the one that gets the grease." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese don't see it that way. They have a saying that translates as "The 
nail that protrudes gets hammered down." 
</P>
<P>
 The difference in these aphorisms goes a long way toward explaining the 
strange fascination with personality and celebrity in American society and in 
the American media compared not only with Japan but with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans have a unique "hunger to identify with personalities, 
larger-than-life personalities especially," says Peter Jennings, anchor of 
ABC's "World News Tonight." "No country in the world is so driven by 
personality as this one." 
</P>
<P>
 This infatuation with celebrity -- real or synthetic, Madonna and Michael 
Jackson or Lorena Bobbitt and Amy Fisher -- stems to a considerable degree from 
our indigenous emphasis on the individual, rather than the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Although historian Daniel J. Boorstin says that a sense of community is "a 
leitmotif in American history," he notes pointedly that several of his books -- 
with titles like "The Americans," "The Creators" and "The Discoverers" -- 
emphasize the role of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not surprising in a country based on the sacred notion that the rights 
of the individual are the bedrock of freedom, a country founded by 
individualists, "people who were trying to buck the system (and) get out of a 
place they didn't like," says John Tomlin, executive producer of the syndicated 
TV shows "Inside Edition" and "American Journal." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fascinated by people who do different things . . . strange things . . . 
(who) break the mold," Tomlin says. "We're fascinated by ordinary people 
dealing with extraordinary circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 That may not seem to be a singularly American quality. Indeed, populist media 
in other countries, from England to Japan, are filled with gossipy, 
sensationalized tidbits about extraordinary happenings. But nowhere is the 
phenomenon as pervasive and as constant, throughout the media, as it is here. 
And nowhere does the phenomenon reflect the national character as much as it 
does here. Not only are we a country dedicated to the concept of individuality 
but we are a young country, without either royalty or an official church. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with the help of the mass media, we have created our own history and our 
own heroes and villains, our own everyday popes and princes -- and our own 
rogues, rascals and reprobates. 
</P>
<P>
 In some countries, media preoccupation with personality and celebrity is 
beginning to resemble that in the United States. But that may simply be further 
testament to the influence of the American media and pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
 As a character in the German film "Kings of the Road" says, "The Americans 
have colonized our unconscious." 
</P>
<P>
 Until relatively recently, many Asian cultures traditionally taught people, 
almost by osmosis, to avoid being perceived as different or as breaking the 
mold, to know they shouldn't stand up or stand out. Some Americans also prefer 
being part of a crowd. But that is generally more a matter of individual or 
family or even community behavior than it is a national culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, despite some notable exceptions, "the culture . . . historically has 
tended to value the group more than the individual up until very recently," 
says Ellis Krauss, a political science professor at the University of 
Pittsburgh, who has studied Japan since 1965 and has written about Japanese 
media since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the individual is not only valued, he is exalted. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Braudy, a literature professor at USC and the author of "The Frenzy of 
Renown," notes that there's an academic term -- "American exceptionalism" -- 
for our tendency to imbue those who distinguish themselves with "an aura they 
don't have in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, Braudy notes that Jean Paul Sartre, the French philosopher and 
writer, likened American society to a skyscraper such as the Empire State 
Building -- "exactly the same floor to floor, until the top, where 
individuality with all its curlicues and baroque elaborations could flourish." 
</P>
<P>
 "European societies were more homogenous (than ours), up till recently," 
Braudy says. "The repression of the individual, of individuality, for the 
communal good was the European ideal." Indeed, in his book, he says 
individualism "has generally been considered antisocial" in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially true in countries where the Roman Catholic Church has 
played a dominant cultural role. Historically, most people in those countries 
"don't value individualism the way Americans do," says Steven Englund, who is 
writing a book on the concept of nation in French history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Catholicism puts a very strong emphasis on what mainline American Protestants 
-- and nonbelievers -- would consider an almost claustrophobic sense of 
community," Englund says. 
</P>
<P>
 In non-Catholic Australia, there is a phrase for the notion that individuals 
shouldn't become too prominent -- "the tall poppy syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you become too famous and too self-important, they chop you down," says 
Landon Y. Jones, managing editor of People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Pompous "poppies" often get chopped down in the United States, too. Only here, 
the news media does the chopping -- after having shoveled the manure that 
fertilized the poppies in the first place. It's what makes America's cult of 
personality both fragile and fickle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something of a mean streak in the American media which . . . derives 
some energy from building characters into personalities, only to deconstruct 
them once they've been created," says ABC's Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jennings thinks the media, to some extent, "reflect . . . the people's 
instinct" in this regard. 
</P>
<P>
 The interview -- a journalistic form we now take for granted -- was an early 
indication of America's fascination with personality. The interview is a 
"distinctively American invention," the British journalist William Stead wrote 
in 1902. In an essay to appear in two forthcoming books, Michael Schudson, a 
communications professor at UC San Diego, traces the earliest interviews to 
U.S. newspapers in the mid-19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Before then, he says, "Much reporting remained nothing more than the 
publication of official documents and public speeches, verbatim. Reporters 
often talked with public officials but they did not refer to those 
conversations in their news stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars disagree on who conducted (and who granted) the first published 
interview -- at least one thinks it was Horace Greeley's report of his 
conversation with Brigham Young in 1859. But the interview is now enshrined in 
our culture, from Playboy magazine to late-night TV to the loftiest journals of 
opinion. Americans want to know what their favorite personalities have to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Edward R. Murrow, the patron saint of broadcast news, succumbed to that 
temptation 40 years ago, with the creation of "Person to Person." The show 
began with a noble objective, to profile unknown people -- "none of this fame 
stuff . . . (just) the extraordinary 'ordinary' man . . . whose quality and 
character would come through on the screen," in the words of Murrow's 
biographer, Ann Sperber. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in early 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 "By fall, of course," Sperber writes, " 'Person to Person' had evolved into 
live camera visits with the rich and famous, the quintessential home tour of 
celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings, the most cerebral and sophisticated of our current network anchors, 
had a similar experience. He says "Person of the Week," which appears on ABC's 
"World News Tonight" every Friday, was conceived in 1986 as "a way to get at 
certain subjects in the country in a more communicable way . . . (through) a 
series of American portraits . . . ballet dancers and scientists and engineers 
. . . various disciplines, social and otherwise, which didn't have obvious 
celebrity value." 
</P>
<P>
 But even before it first aired, the feature was modified to give it more 
"edge," something that would command viewers' attention. "Person of the Week" 
would profile people who "made a difference, for good or ill," Jennings says. 
That quickly evolved into "a prize," a celebration in a "purely positive 
sense." The one time the program departed from that approach -- for Jackie 
Presser of the Teamsters Union -- "The phone rang off the hook," Jennings says. 
Callers demanded to know, "How dare you celebrate Jackie Presser?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings isn't completely happy with the way "Person of the Week" has evolved, 
but he's a realist; it's now the second most popular feature on "World News 
Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Jennings is especially well-qualified to speak on the American 
fixation with personality and celebrity. He was born and reared in Canada, and 
he worked and traveled throughout much of the world before settling in the 
United States 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our political campaigns, largely at the behest of the media, have been 
covered like sports contests," he says, "and sports is another 
personality-driven facet of our national life." 
</P>
<P>
 The most celebrated American celebrities of all are movie stars (and their 
latter-day progeny, television and rock stars). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our greatest export is culture," Jennings notes. "Our culture is Hollywood; 
Hollywood is built on personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Americans love stars -- on the screen, on the playing field, in the political 
arena -- in part, Jennings says, because "We are a fairly celebratory people. 
We are too young as a nation to be skeptical, cynical. That's part of the 
national character of France." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he says, "I know no other society which moves with the speed that 
we do through every 24-hour period . . . . In order to make your mark on life . 
. . you gotta be noticed. And to be noticed is to draw attention to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 This syndrome "is not unique to the American psyche but to American commerce," 
argues Van Gordon Sauter, president of Fox News and a former president of CBS 
News. "People are thrust into public consciousness, frozen in Lucite for two 
weeks," then fade from memory and are replaced by new pseudo-celebrities, 
Sauter says, because the profit-driven news and entertainment industries 
require "a constant supply of personalities as fodder." 
</P>
<P>
 C. Wright Mills, in his landmark 1956 work, "The Power Elite," made a related 
point about the capitalist marketplace. Celebrity, he said, is "the crowning 
result of the star system in a society that makes a fetish of competition . . . 
. It does not seem to matter what the man is the very best at; so long as he 
has won out in competition over all others, he is celebrated." 
</P>
<P>
 But many others argue that capitalism and competition only begin to tell the 
tale of America's enormous interest in personality and celebrity. It's an 
interest, they say, that's woven deeply into the fabric of our social structure 
as well as our national character. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some recent shifts toward a more American approach, especially in 
Italy, the news media in most countries are considerably more stratified -- and 
the societies more hierarchical -- than they are here. Personality stories fill 
the gossip sheets abroad, but they don't routinely enter the mainstream media, 
Le Monde and Asahi Shimbun and the BBC, as they do here. 
</P>
<P>
 There are weekly magazines in Japan, for example, that publish "spurious . . . 
speculative . . . gossip . . . that no American publication could ever publish 
without a libel suit," says Ellis Krauss, the University of Pittsburgh 
professor who studies Japanese media. (Libel laws are looser in the United 
States than in many other countries.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Japan's major daily newspapers are more serious and more devoted to "just 
the facts, ma'am" reportage and so less likely to indulge in personality 
journalism than are most American dailies. 
</P>
<P>
 England has its tabloids -- still more aggressive and outrageous than their 
American counterparts -- and their frantic pursuit of the royal family 
essentially drove Princess Diana out of public life late last year. Most other 
western European countries also have celebrity-driven, personality-obsessed 
magazines and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Brits and Australians brought the modern-day tabloid to the United 
States -- and play a large role in "A Current Affair," the first tabloid TV 
show here. But the proliferation of tabloid TV and the adoption of many of its 
topics and tactics by the mainstream media is almost exclusively an American 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 This phenomenon contributes greatly to what Jennings and others call a 
devaluation of the concept of heroism in our society. Virtually everyone, it 
now seems, can be a hero or a heroine in the multimedia United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt, who cut off her husband's penis while he lay sleeping, was 
hailed as "a national folk heroine" by Vanity Fair. Earvin (Magic) Johnson, who 
says he contracted HIV from one of the large number of women he slept with, 
sans condom, during an epidemic, was hailed as a hero simply for having said 
publicly that he had the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first five years (1946-1950) that the Gallup Organization polled 
Americans on whom they admired most in the world, singer Kate Smith was the 
only person in the top 10 who was not a political, religious or military 
leader; in the last five years, Gallup's "most admired" lists have included not 
only Johnson but Cher, Bill Cosby, Rush Limbaugh, Donald Trump (twice), 
Princess Di (three times), Michael Jordan (three times), Elizabeth Taylor (four 
times) and Oprah Winfrey (five times). 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is increasingly "a nation of hero-worshipers . . . . It is . 
. . (a) national fetish," Jim Murray, the sports columnist, wrote last fall in 
the Los Angeles Times. As a result, says Jennings, "Americans use the word hero 
more readily than any other group of people on the planet." 
</P>
<P>
 Landon Jones of People magazine worries that our "hunger for heroes" has 
"weakened our concept of (the) truly heroic . . . . Celebrities are people who 
are famous for acting in their own self-interest basically . . . Heroes are 
people with a cause larger than themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 As Daniel Boorstin writes in his book "The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in 
America," the modern "machinery of information has brought into being a new 
substitute for the hero . . . the celebrity . . . Anyone can become a celebrity 
if only he can get into the news and stay there." 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier eras, Boorstin says, the hero "created himself." Today, the 
celebrity is "created by the media. The hero was a big man; the celebrity is a 
big name. Formerly, a public man needed a private secretary for a barrier 
between himself and the public. Nowadays he has a press secretary to keep him 
properly in the public eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Boorstin cites Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as a model of heroic behavior, 
not only for what he achieved on the battlefield but because "he had the 
reputation for never having given a newspaper interview. He steadfastly refused 
to write his memoirs," insisting that to do so would be "trading on the blood 
of my men." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, a recent military hero, retired Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, 
appeared regularly in news conferences, gave lectures at upward of $50,000 each 
and sold his autobiography for almost $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In contemporary America, we have turned celebrities into heroes -- and heroes 
into celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 One explanation is that unlike many countries, we have never had a royal 
family to fill that dual role. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans and the American media have adopted Princess Diana; she's been on 
the cover of People magazine more than anyone else in the world, more than 
Michael Jackson, Madonna, Barbra Streisand, Tom Cruise and Woody Allen 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
 We've even tried to create a home-grown royal family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kennedys have become "America's one chance to be able to say . . . 'We 
have our own monarchy,' " says Steve Dunleavy, the Australian-born reporter for 
"A Current Affair." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Ellman, co-executive producer of the rival "Hard Copy," says Hollywood 
stars are actually "America's uncrowned royalty." Other, less traditional 
"celebrities" -- Bobbitt or Schwarzkopf -- regularly flash in and out of the 
news, each anointed queen -- or king -- for a day. Or a week. Or a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes are especially lionized here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We substitute point guards, quarterbacks, cleanup hitters and pugilists for 
archdukes, earls, barons and counts," Murray wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual performers are often perceived as transcending their teams and 
their sports. When Michael Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls before the 
start of the current NBA basketball season, many sportswriters predicted the 
immediate collapse of the Bulls, and several wondered in print how the game 
itself could survive the combined loss of Jordan, Johnson and Larry Bird, all 
of whom retired in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bulls lead the central division, with a better mid-season record than 
they had during seven of Jordan's eight years -- third-best among the NBA's 27 
teams, in fact. League-wide, attendance and television ratings are both up. 
Professional basketball is doing quite nicely, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 Other observers suggest that American hero-worship is a search for parental 
replacements -- for authority figures in a society that lacks them. Or that our 
fondness for "heroes" is a manifestation of our tendency to see things in black 
and white, not shades of gray, to divide everything into good and bad and to 
categorize people as heroes -- or villains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans hate ambiguity," Anna Quindlen wrote in the New York Times last 
fall. "That's why so many of them liked (Ross) . . . Perot." 
</P>
<P>
 That's also why Americans -- and the American media in particular -- often 
seem so determined to find answers and explanations, no matter how random or 
inexplicable a given event may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Our fixation on heroes and villains and our preoccupation with personality and 
celebrity often combine to blur the lines between celebrity and notoriety and 
lead to oddly sympathetic news media portraits of malefactors. 
</P>
<P>
 Maynard Parker, the editor of Newsweek, ordered a story on the slayings of 
several tourists in Florida rewritten last year because the story gave almost 
as much attention to "how the alleged perpetrators had no jobs" as it did to 
"the horror of the killings" -- as if, Parker says, economic hardship 
"justified predatory murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellie Nesler was hailed in many quarters as a heroine last year after gunning 
down a man accused of molesting her son. (Nesler was convicted of voluntary 
manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years in prison.) 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Reinhold, former Los Angeles bureau chief for the New York Times and 
now an editorial writer for the Los Angeles Times, says that in "playing up" 
such stories and "making heroes" of people like Nesler, the news media may 
encourage violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, Katherine Ann Power turned herself in to authorities 23 years 
after driving the getaway car in a Boston bank robbery in which her accomplices 
killed policeman Walter Schroeder. Newsweek's cover story ended with the 
observation that "it's hard to know whom to feel the most sympathy for" -- the 
dead officer's nine orphaned children, Power's own family or Power herself, 
"the young woman who lost her way in the tumult of the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Many were outraged that Newsweek could equate Power's self-inflicted suffering 
with the pain she helped inflict on Schroeder's family. One reader wrote 
Newsweek to complain that the magazine was "trying to make a heroine out of a 
murderer." 
</P>
<P>
 We have always tended to glamorize villains. Look at all the movies about Al 
Capone and other Prohibition era gangsters over the years. There aren't 
necessarily more villains now. But there are more media -- and there is, 
indisputably, a lower threshold for both celebrity and notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Rap star Snoop Doggy Dogg was indicted for murder last fall -- and made the 
cover of Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Seale kidnaped an Exxon executive and locked him in a wooden box while 
awaiting ransom, and after the executive died, Seale was interviewed for one 
hour by Barbara Walters on ABC'S "20/20." (Seale and his wife both went to 
prison.) 
</P>
<P>
 If a story is sensational enough, even murder charges are not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992 riots, Los Angeles gang members known as "Li'l Monster" and 
"Bone" made the rounds of TV talk shows -- including two appearances on 
"Nightline." Almost a year later, members of the "Spur Posse" -- a group of 
Lakewood High School boys who were accused of sexually mistreating teen-age 
girls -- were vigorously courted on the TV talk circuit. (Of the 17 Spur Posse 
cases presented to the district attorney's office, 15 were rejected. One 
teen-ager pleaded guilty and was sent to a juvenile camp; another faces one 
felony charge.)

 Amy Fisher was the subject of three made-for-television movies last year after 
she shot her boyfriend's wife. (Mary Jo Buttafuoco recovered -- and "A Current 
Affair" paid Joey Buttafuoco a reported $500,000 for his story.) 
</P>
<P>
 As Barbara Goldsmith, the author and social historian, wrote in the New York 
Times Magazine: 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we are faced with a vast confusing jumble of celebrities: the talented 
and untalented, heroes and villains, people of accomplishment and those who 
have accomplished nothing at all, the criteria for their celebrity being that 
their images encapsulate some form of the American dream, that they give enough 
of an appearance of leadership, heroism, wealth, success, danger, glamour and 
excitement to feed our fantasies." 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Goldsmith wrote, "The line between fame and notoriety 
has been erased."

 Heroes behave differently in the Age of Celebrity than they did in the days 
before People magazine, tabloid television and CNN. Gen. Robert E. Lee, 
commander in chief of the Confederate army in the Civil War, was reputed to 
have declined all interviews and all entreaties to write his memoirs because he 
did not want to trade "on the blood of my men." Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, field 
commander for allied forces in the Persian Gulf War, apparently felt 
differently about the matter; he gave interviews and news conferences, 
delivered lectures at more than $50,000 each and sold his autobiography for 
almost $6 million.

OFFICIALS ASSAIL STATE OVER BRIDGE RETROFITTING PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN and MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The pace of safeguarding California's vulnerable freeway bridges from 
earthquakes has been dangerously slow and should be put on an emergency course, 
even if taxes must be raised, federal, state and local elected officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This state knew darn well in 1989 that, without question, we had dangerous 
structures out there and that they had to be retrofitted," said U.S. Sen. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) "There's no excuse for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer and other officials said that state government, particularly the 
Administration of Gov. Pete Wilson, bears responsibility for not getting the 
job done faster. Many officials, including three Democratic candidates for 
governor, said they would support a temporary increase in either the state 
sales or gasoline tax to help pay for safeguarding the bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The calls for action followed a Times report Wednesday revealing that about 
80% of the state's 1,313 bridges identified as being vulnerable to earthquakes 
have not been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointees of Wilson say that retrofitting of the bridges has moved as quickly 
as possible, in light of the complexities and scope of the task. The governor 
has said he opposes any tax increase to pay for retrofitting but might favor 
placing an earthquake-related bond issue before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, commenting in San Francisco, said that he believes most of the 
vulnerable bridges have been retrofitted but that new highway projects should 
be slowed if necessary, to speed the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we ought to put a greater emphasis upon completion of retrofit 
projects," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was referring to progress in retrofitting the state's 259 bridges that 
are supported by single concrete columns. The state has moved to fix those 
before repairing the 1,056 bridges that are supported by clusters of columns. 
Both types of bridges failed in the Northridge earthquake -- and now officials 
say that retrofitting of the cluster-column bridges must be accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 2% of the cluster-column structures have been strengthened so far, 
records show. Some of these spans are located at the most heavily traveled 
freeway junctures and pose the highest seismic risk of any of the state's 
overpasses, according to engineering calculations made by the California 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which collapsed parts of four San 
Francisco Bay Area freeways and killed 43 motorists, Caltrans identified about 
1,300 overpasses statewide in need of retrofitting. The Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake collapsed six freeway bridges in Los Angeles County -- including 
five that had been identified as vulnerable but had not been retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Angeles County, 84% of 716 bridges designated for retrofitting remain 
unrepaired. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caltrans has spent less than a third of the $300 million per year that 
officials had estimated would be used for shoring up bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 * A small share of the billions of dollars from a new gasoline tax has been 
spent on bridge repairs -- although seismic retrofitting was supposed to be a 
major beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Just three days before the earthquake, the director of Caltrans, James W. 
Van Loben Sels, halted the hiring of outside engineering consultants who have 
performed nearly half the design work for bridge retrofitting. Van Loben Sels' 
decision was made because of cost concerns, according to a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overruling his chief bridge engineer, Van Loben Sels has declined to seek 
emergency powers that would streamline contracting for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisions by Van Loben Sels, an appointee of Wilson, to halt the hiring of 
outside engineers and to reject emergency contracting procedures were wrong and 
should be reversed, the Republican leader of the state Assembly, Jim Brulte of 
Rancho Cucamonga, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Caltrans, Jim Drago, said the department's own engineers can 
shoulder the extra workload without delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly don't think the firing squad is in order here," Drago said. "We 
recognize Assemblyman Brulte's frustration at the pace of retrofitting. 
Director Van Loben Sels' commitment is to get the work done as quickly as 
possible and we're going to do whatever it takes to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Republican, Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, whose San 
Fernando Valley district was heavily damaged by the quake, declined to place 
blame but said the retrofitting of the bridges should be accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that these things should have been done," said Bernson, 
who also serves on the California Seismic Safety Commission as an appointee of 
Wilson. ". . . We've got a ton of work to do to get ready for the next one." 
</P>
<P>
 Three Democratic candidates for governor -- state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, 
state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden of Santa 
Monica -- said Wednesday that the retrofitting of the bridges will be an issue 
in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are late; there is no explanation that is satisfactory," Hayden said of 
Caltrans' failure to complete the retrofitting of bridges at high seismic risk. 
". . . They are not on top of the situation. If they were doctors, they would 
be sued for malpractice." Hayden said he would support a temporary quarter-cent 
sales tax increase to pay for retrofitting and other quake-related repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi was more critical of Wilson, calling the failure to retrofit bridges 
at a faster pace "a horrible example of awful leadership. . . . It is alarming. 
We absolutely know we're going to have an earthquake. And we know (some of) 
those bridges are going to collapse in an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said he supports temporarily increasing the state sales and gas 
taxes to pay for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Brown blamed Wilson's management approach. "At every turn and 
in every crisis, (Wilson) tends to respond with bureaucratic thinking," said 
Brown's aide, Michael Reese. "That tends to lead to bureaucratic paralysis." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese said that Brown supports raising the sales tax by a quarter-cent, for a 
maximum of 17 months, to pay for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Boxer, meanwhile, said she would introduce legislation in Washington to 
force California and other states to report their progress in safeguarding 
bridges and roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who also was in Los Angeles on 
Wednesday, said that she too favors a temporary increase of the state sales tax 
-- if the money is spent solely for retrofitting and other quake-related needs. 
"Retrofitting should be done more rapidly," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, the heads of the Legislature's two transit committees said that 
they also support raising the sales tax temporarily to pay for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), chairman of the Senate Transportation 
Committee, said the bridge repairs have proceeded too slowly. Kopp criticized 
Wilson for blocking Kopp's effort to impose a gas tax surcharge in the early 
1990s to pay for retrofitting. Without that revenue, Kopp said, the 
retrofitting program has had to compete funding with newly proposed highway 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who chairs the Assembly Transportation Committee, 
called for completion of bridge retrofitting "even if no new roads are built in 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, a Democrat who also is chairman 
of the county Metropolitan Transportation Authority, called for Wilson to "put 
the welfare and safety of the people over" his reluctance to support a 
temporary sales tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the price of leadership," Alatorre said.

GAY LAWYER'S SUIT OFFERS A REAL-LIFE 'PHILADELPHIA'; COURTS: SAN DIEGO ATTORNEY 
SAYS HE LOST JOB BECAUSE HE WAS HIV-POSITIVE. FIRM SAYS FIRING WAS COST CUTTING 
MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Viewing the film "Philadelphia" on the eve of his own legal battle was "like 
watching my own nightmare," says Martin D. Caprow, a gay lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow is the plaintiff in a trial with striking similarities to the hit film, 
in which a gay attorney sues his former law firm on the grounds that he was 
fired because he has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow, 37, says he was abruptly fired in 1992 because the senior partner 
learned that Caprow was HIV-positive and that his condition would prohibit the 
firm from getting a new, cheaper health insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knocked me when I was down and that is as low as you can get," said 
Caprow, who has since developed AIDS. "Employers need to know that gay people 
won't stand for this anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But the senior partner of Frank & Freedus, a San Diego firm specializing in 
insurance and personal injury cases, testified that Caprow was fired not 
because of his HIV condition but because the firm was losing clients and needed 
to cut expenses. Caprow was dismissed because he was not as good as other 
lawyers with similar standing in the firm, the partner testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is being heard without a jury by Superior Court Judge Vincent P. 
DiFiglia because defense attorneys were worried that jurors might be influenced 
by the movie, in which Tom Hanks stars as a lawyer with AIDS who wins a 
discrimination suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Gerald L. McMahon said that Caprow is trying to unfairly use 
laws that ban discrimination against gays and lesbians as a way to force Frank 
& Freedus to fire someone else rather than him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those laws are a shield (against discrimination) but those laws are not a 
sword to get preferential treatment," McMahon told the judge in his opening 
statement this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caprow case has drawn attention from gay and lesbian support groups eager 
to see how the state's new anti-discrimination law is handled in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Discrimination) is going on a lot in the legal profession," said Amelia 
Craig, staff attorney for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. "It's 
very hard to prove." 
</P>
<P>
 The star witness for Caprow is the law firm's former office manager, who 
testified that after Caprow was fired, senior partner Eric B. Freedus told her: 
"He's likely gay, he's probably got AIDS. What's the big deal? We've terminated 
him, he's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow, who has a raspy voice and sunken eyes, has had five hospital stays in 
the last year. He has been found to have cytomegalovirus, one of the 
opportunistic and deadly infections that hit AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow's widowed mother, Nikki, who had not known her son was gay before he 
became HIV-positive, has come to San Diego from her Chicago home to sit in the 
front row at the trial. "I'm there for the same reason my son is: I want to see 
justice done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Philadelphia," the lawyer's mother (played by Joanne Woodward) is 
similarly supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedus, the senior partner, has been portrayed during the trial as 
hard-driving (arriving at work before 6 a.m.), highly critical, quick to fire 
new attorneys and capable of great personal coldness (firing a secretary who 
took medical leave due to lung cancer). In the movie, Jason Robards plays a 
senior partner with similar characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominated for five Academy Awards, including best actor, "Philadelphia" is 
playing to packed houses around the country, including a theater one block from 
the San Diego courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In deference to his rapidly weakening condition, Caprow was allowed to testify 
in December. He listened intently this week when the trial resumed with 
additional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedus testified that he and his partner James Lieberman had decided in 
January, 1992, to fire Caprow from his $55,000 a year job as a fourth-year 
associate because of a downturn in business and concerns about the quality of 
his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedus said he delayed firing Caprow because Lieberman said he needed Caprow 
to help on a "slip and fall" case in which a shopper was suing a grocery store 
represented by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 While Caprow and Lieberman were working on that case in early 1992, 
then-office manager Karen Tessier began shopping for a new group health plan 
because Freedus was concerned about escalating premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 At the suggestion of insurance agents, Tessier distributed a health 
questionnaire to all employees. It asked, among other things, whether they 
suffered any chronic, debilitating diseases that would be grounds for insurance 
companies to deny coverage to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Freedus was notified by Tessier that someone in the firm had a 
chronic disease that would make it impossible to get a new group health plan. 
In accordance with state law that makes it illegal to disclose someone's HIV 
status, Tessier did not identify the employee. Still, having long suspected 
that Caprow was gay, Freedus reportedly guessed that Tessier was talking about 
Caprow and that the disease was probably AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 30, Freedus fired Caprow telling him that the firm did not have 
enough work. He was allowed to remain for 30 days and given an additional 30 
days pay as severance. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow was the first associate-level lawyer ever fired by the firm, Freedus 
testified under examination by Caprow's attorney, Ann M. Smith. Just five 
months before being fired, he had been given a raise and an end-of-the-year 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Caprow certainly had pluses, but he certainly had minuses," Freedus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tessier said other attorneys were upset at Caprow being fired without warning. 
When she told Freedus that morale was sinking, Tessier testified that he got 
mad at her and blurted out that Caprow was probably gay and probably infected 
with AIDS and that the matter was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedus, questioned by McMahon, remembered that conversation differently. He 
said he had mentioned that Caprow was probably gay and had AIDS but only 
because he was worried that other employees would incorrectly decide that he 
had discriminated against Caprow rather than realizing that he had fired him 
for strictly business reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Tessier testified that Freedus told her to spread a story in the office that 
Caprow had not been a very good lawyer. "I told him I couldn't do that and that 
people would have problems with that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contretemps over Caprow's firing soured the relationship between the 
senior partner and the office manager and within a few months Tessier, also 
upset at Freedus' refusal to give her a raise, took a job for less pay at 
another San Diego firm. 
</P>
<P>
 She contacted Caprow and told him what she knew about the circumstances of his 
firing. She said she did so to soothe her conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been complicitous in my silence in not telling him," Tessier testified. 
"I felt very, very strongly he had a right to know what I knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow, in an interview, said he had suspected immediately that he had been 
fired because of his HIV condition but that he had no proof until Tessier came 
to him that summer. That prompted him to file suit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated," he said. "I cried. I had nightmares. I had worked 
extremely closely with these people for four years. It was mind-blowing." 
</P>
<P>
 In cross-examination, McMahon sought to portray Tessier, a Navy veteran with 
extensive experience as a legal secretary, as a disgruntled ex-employee who has 
a grudge against Freedus and is trying to damage him and the firm with false 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, he noted changes in Tessier's account of various 
conversations and discrepancies about when those conversations took place. 
McMahon also said that Frank & Freedus has lost half its clients in recent 
years and trimmed from 15 lawyers and paralegals to seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Tessier testified that she commonly knew when Freedus was on the verge of 
firing a young lawyer but that she had no warning that Freedus was planning to 
fire Caprow. Both Tessier and Caprow were on the verge of tears during her 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow, who enjoyed skiing and bowling before illness overtook him, graduated 
from Arizona State University in 1978 and Western State University College of 
Law in San Diego in 1988. Before law school he was a marketing director for 
Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. 
</P>
<P>
 After being fired from Frank & Freedus, Caprow was offered a job at a higher 
salary with a Los Angeles firm but declined because he did not want to leave 
San Diego. He has done volunteer legal work for the local AIDS Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of death in the last two years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow is suing for unspecified damages. In similar cases, a Philadelphia 
lawyer was awarded $157,000 in 1990, and last December, a New York claims judge 
ordered a firm to pay $500,000 to the survivors of a fired lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 David Rubin, a San Diego lawyer and a leading member of the Tom Homann Law 
Society, a gay and lesbian lawyers' group, said that if the judge finds in 
favor of Caprow, "that means this law firm practiced bigotry and we cannot have 
that in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Caprow, Rubin said, "He's not doing this just for himself. He's trying 
to stand up for a lot of people. That will be his legacy."

JET DEAL LIKELY TO PRESERVE JOBS IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saudi Arabia's plan to buy about $6 billion worth of jetliners from McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. and Boeing Co. is likely to save the 11,000 remaining jobs at 
McDonnell's struggling Douglas Aircraft Co. division in Long Beach -- and 
perhaps prevent Douglas from failing, industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudi order announced Wednesday will help staunch the erosion of aerospace 
jobs not only at Douglas but also at dozens of Southern California 
aircraft-component makers -- including Northrop Corp., Rohr Inc. and 
AlliedSignal Inc. -- that supply both Douglas and Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those companies have been battered in recent years -- forcing layoffs 
of more than 100,000 workers in California -- because of a severe slump in the 
commercial aircraft industry and ongoing cuts in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Saudis have yet to specify which aircraft they want for their 
national carrier, Saudia Airlines, the order is expected to total between 50 
and 65 planes, with Douglas getting at least a third of the order. Douglas also 
expects Saudi Arabia to buy both Douglas' MD-11 wide-body and MD-80 or MD-90 
single-aisle jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 The orders would be a major boost for Douglas' future. Having already dropped 
to a distant third in market share behind Boeing and the European consortium 
Airbus Industrie -- which was shut out of the Saudi plans -- Douglas has 
struggled to sell new aircraft in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 It ended 1993 with two fewer orders than when the year began, after 
subtracting earlier contracts that were then canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 While Douglas is currently profitable, and its backlog of 203 firm orders will 
keep its assembly line running through most of the decade, the company's lack 
of new orders had sustained speculation that Douglas might eventually be folded 
by its St. Louis-based parent company, which is also one of the nation's 
largest defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the Saudi order should stabilize Douglas' employment and perhaps 
even add to it later in the decade, particularly if Saudi Arabia's purchase 
spurs other airlines to give Douglas' jets another look, said Douglas 
spokeswoman Renee Handler. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not going to immediately translate into vast increases of employment, 
but it helps stabilize our employment and that's good news," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merely protecting the status quo is crucial these days at Douglas, where 
employment has plunged nearly 75% from four years ago, when it peaked at about 
42,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudi order could be the bridge Douglas needs to survive until the entire 
aircraft business recovers, which is expected in the late-1990s. It could also 
encourage other airlines to reconsider buying Douglas planes in the interim, 
now that they know Douglas will remain in business for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 The order "will allow us to weather the storm as we await the end of the 
current commercial airline recession," Douglas President Robert H. Hood Jr. 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing President Clinton's announcement of the deal, more than two 
dozen laid-off Douglas workers telephoned their union, UAW Local 148 in 
Lakewood, about the prospects for being rehired. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Griffith, the local's president, was in Washington for the 
announcement and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudi order drew cheers from Wall Street. McDonnell's stock climbed $1.875 
a share, to $118.875, and Boeing gained $2.125, to $46.50, in New York Stock 
Exchange composite trading. But some analysts said Douglas still faces a 
troubled future. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not out of the woods yet," said John Simon, aerospace analyst at 
Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles. "This is a very specific event. The 
only thing that will change the outlook for Douglas or Boeing is an uptick in 
the (business) cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the local suppliers that could be affected is Northrop, whose Hawthorne 
plant provides the fuselages for Boeing 747 jumbo jets, which are expected to 
be among the planes added to the Saudi fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful the 747s will be included, and that it can help preserve the 
jobs we have," said Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio, noting that Northrop's 
747 work force has dropped from 3,000 a year ago to 1,900 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing spokesman T. Craig Martin agreed, saying that "in the current 
environment, something that just helps keep jobs is very important. That is 
probably going to be the major impact" of the Saudi order. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of some aerospace suppliers said they do not expect to be hiring 
many workers because of the Saudi order, although they cautioned that the exact 
impact would not be known until Saudia Airlines, Douglas and Boeing work out 
the order's details next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simply too early to tell," said Valerie McClelland, a spokeswoman at 
Chula Vista-based Rohr, which supplies engine components to Douglas and Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever there's a major boost in aircraft orders, the first to feel it are 
the parts suppliers, which might have to ship components a year or two before 
the airplane reaches final assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as Douglas and Boeing have slashed costs to counter the industry's 
slump, so too have they put pressure on suppliers to cut prices and operate 
more efficiently. Thus, some suppliers are likely to fill new orders from the 
Saudi purchase with workers they have.

S. AFRICA LEADERS OFFER CONCESSIONS TO MILITANTS; POLITICS: AMENDMENTS TO 
INTERIM CONSTITUTION URGED. AIM IS TO LURE ZULUS, RIGHTISTS INTO ELECTORAL 
PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to defuse a growing political crisis and reduce the threat of civil 
war, leaders of the government and the African National Congress on Wednesday 
announced major political concessions in hopes of luring militant black and 
white holdouts into the election process. 
</P>
<P>
 President Frederik W. de Klerk announced that the Parliament will be called 
into special session in early March to ratify a series of amendments to the 
recently approved interim constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other changes, the new provisions would allow the use of two ballots 
instead of one in the April elections, so voters can pick different parties for 
the National Assembly and provincial legislatures. And far greater regional 
autonomy would be granted to the country's nine new provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament will also be asked to modify the law so the holdout parties can 
register to contest the elections, the first in which South Africa's black 
majority will be able to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen parties had registered before the deadline expired last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC and government negotiators say the constitutional changes go a long way 
toward meeting key demands of the Freedom Alliance, a fractious coalition of 
militant right-wing Afrikaner groups; the pro-segregationist Conservative 
Party; conservative black homeland leaders who were installed under apartheid, 
and the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups are united in their fear that their current powers will be crushed 
under an ANC-dominated government led by Nelson Mandela, the ANC president. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance has said it will boycott the elections and not abide by the 
post-apartheid constitution unless its demands are met. 
</P>
<P>
 Its leaders have repeatedly threatened to launch a campaign of armed 
resistance if they are not given far greater regional autonomy, including the 
creation of an independent white homeland for Afrikaners and the restoration of 
the traditional Zulu kingdom in eastern South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the accommodations announced Wednesday night specifically dealt with 
those two demands. 
</P>
<P>
 But the changes include a new constitutional provision guaranteeing the 
principle of "self-determination" and a promise to create a mechanism for 
consideration of limited ethnic or racial enclaves under provincial charters. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC remains opposed to the establishment of territories based on race, but 
Mandela said he is willing to discuss white fears and to try to work out a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes also include additional powers of regional taxation and 
greater devolution of authority to guarantee more independence to the 
provincial assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
 This could make it more difficult for an ANC-dominated National Assembly to 
rewrite the interim constitution to override local decisions, a key demand of 
the smaller parties. 
</P>
<P>
 In this vein, the concession on two ballots is significant because the ANC and 
the government previously had insisted on one ballot, a device that seemed 
likely to ensure greater majorities for the two dominant parties and the demise 
of many smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In a small but also important gesture, Natal province will also be renamed 
KwaZulu/Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 KwaZulu, now a homeland in Natal that was created under apartheid, is a 
traditional name for the Zulu land, and this demand has been an emotional issue 
among many Zulus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are firmly of the view that these proposals remove all the remaining 
obstacles for the parties which have not yet done so to register and become 
part of the process," Mandela said at a Johannesburg news conference before he 
left on a fund-raising visit to the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Freedom Alliance declined immediate comment, saying they needed 
time to study the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Wednesday, Zulu chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi had warned at a news 
conference here in Cape Town that the country faced "a holocaust" if the 
disaffected groups were not accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
 The package is virtually identical to one that the government offered to the 
Freedom Alliance before intensive, closed-door negotiations broke down last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the ANC and the government said the changes would be made only if 
the alliance members agreed to participate in the election and respect the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 The new version, however, will be implemented whether or not the alliance 
agrees to renounce violence and join the democratic process. It effectively 
throws the ball into their court, and gives their leaders, or at least their 
supporters, a face-saving way to avoid being shut out of the transition to a 
post-apartheid government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The road to peaceful participation in the election is, in our opinion, now 
open to all the parties, and the government expresses its hope that the Freedom 
Alliance will now place the interests of South Africa and its own voters 
first," De Klerk said in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We are going to do this whether the Freedom Alliance accepts the 
present conditions or not. Time is of the essence." 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk will meet with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini today to discuss the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
 The king announced Monday that he wanted the government to cede him the 
northeast quadrant of the country to create an independent monarchy as a home 
for the estimated 8 million Zulus. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela said the ANC is also prepared to meet with the king. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp shift by the government and ANC allows them to claim the moral high 
ground by unilaterally yielding to avoid greater bloodshed in a country already 
racked by fierce factional fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4,000 people were reported killed in political violence last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate incidents Wednesday, an ANC local leader and school principal was 
shot to death as he taught a class near Port Shepstone in Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 Further west, in the Eastern Transvaal, about 30 people were wounded when 
police fired shotguns and rubber bullets at blacks protesting right-wing plans 
to declare the town of Standerton part of a white homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must treat the threat of civil war seriously. That is why we have gone out 
of our way to make these concessions," Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that the transition to democracy and black majority rule will 
proceed with or without the Freedom Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela told reporters that the country's first democratic elections will not 
be postponed under any circumstances.

NEWS ANALYSIS; IN JAPAN, FAIR TRADE IS MATTER OF PERCEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY and PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hiroshi Soma, a professional jewelry appraiser with an avid interest in cars, 
had never remotely considered buying an automobile made in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's legendary that they break down very easily," Soma said, ticking off a 
list of other common fears: low resale value, inability to get good service, 
lack of available dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, though he has yet to buy an American car, Soma has started to change 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are getting better every year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like those of many Japanese consumers, Soma's traditional suspicions of 
foreign products appear to be changing. 
</P>
<P>
 But as trade tensions rise between the United States and Japan, Soma's 
lingering ambivalence is a telling example of the prevailing attitudes in a 
nation that remains reluctant to open its markets completely. 
</P>
<P>
 To Americans, Japan's motives seem rooted in a deep-seated suspicion of 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan, after all, cut itself off from the world for 250 years, prohibiting 
trade with foreigners until the mid-19th Century, when the cannons of Commodore 
Matthew Perry's Black Ships abruptly ended the empire's isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the Japanese, the issue is more pragmatic. 
</P>
<P>
 For consumers such as Soma, it is a matter of avoiding what they perceive to 
be inferior or unsafe products and bad service. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Japanese consumers are grappling with perceptions similar to 
those that Americans held 30 years ago about products made in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 For business executives, the issue is a matter of protecting the security of 
jobs in a nation where the concept of lifetime employment remains viable, as 
well as the independence of home-grown industries -- many developed with the 
help of Americans in the post-World War II era. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, it is a matter of preserving a system that they believe is fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not seek trade restrictions," said Hiroya Noguchi, assistant general 
secretary at Zensen, a national federation for the textile industry. "What we 
look for is trade based on rules." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent debate here has focused on how Japan may suffer from the rising 
value of the yen and a continued drop in an already battered stock market in 
the wake of the breakdown of U.S.-Japan trade talks last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many Japanese have also applauded Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for 
refusing to yield to American demands for numerical targets for imports and to 
threats of sanctions on Japanese products sold in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that many American companies are doing well in Japan, and 
change is occurring rapidly here, though many features of Japan's economic 
structure and society still make this an exceptionally difficult place for 
foreigners to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Japan's Ministry of Finance reported that Japan's trade surplus 
with the United States grew to $3.1 billion in January from $2.9 billion in the 
same month a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, Japan has simply taken to heart the lessons of the West, practicing 
a kind of mercantilism long ago abandoned by Europe and the United States, 
American executives argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long term, Japan always protected its industries . . . from foreign 
influence of any kind," said Andrew Procassini, president of the Semiconductor 
Industry Assn. in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Japanese, there is a real fear that imports will overwhelm Japan's 
industry. So far, that fear has focused more on imports from Asian countries 
than on those from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese garment manufacturers are being hit by the growth of imports, 
especially from neighboring countries, and have begun pleading for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inexpensive textile imports are coming in like a flood because Japan is the 
only industrialized country that has never invoked a quota" under a textile 
agreement approved in 1974 under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or 
GATT, said Noguchi at Zensen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese government has also been nervous about the rapid growth of 
discount stores -- allowed under pressure from Washington in 1990 -- partly 
because of the threat they pose to traditional retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Discounters such as Aoki International Co. and Aoyama Trading Co. have grown 
rapidly, in part by selling imported garments. 
</P>
<P>
 To appreciate the American perspective, Ford Motor Co. officials say that 
their experience in Japan is instructive. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a dominant force in the Japanese auto market, the firm was asked to leave 
just before World War II broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the occupying Americans, led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, favored 
allowing Japanese industry to rebuild with limited foreign competition, Ford 
spokesman Al Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford was unable to resume auto production at its Yokohama plant, a situation 
that persisted until 1979, when Ford sold the property and bought a stake in 
Japanese auto maker Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ford is finding that the best way for it to break back into the market is 
by having Mazda build autos and sell them under the Ford badge -- unlike in 
Europe, where Ford sells its own cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese say that we're not serious about the market," Chambers said. "We 
think that . . . the (Japanese) auto industry does not want competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese auto executives say they have no fear of competition and argue that 
U.S. auto makers simply lack the will to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we developed our export business in the United States around 1960, we 
left cars at gas stations to sell," said Yoshikazu Kawana, executive managing 
director at Nissan Motor Co. "We started from scratch. . . . I'd say, how much 
effort are they going to put into developing the Japanese market?" 
</P>
<P>
 As U.S. makers shift toward cheaper, smaller, right-hand drive cars with 
better gas mileage, car buff Soma predicted that American cars will gain favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of time, like the Berlin Wall in Germany coming down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing consumer attitudes toward American products account in part for the 
success of American firms such as Apple Computer, now the No. 2 seller of 
personal computers in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 For foreign manufactured goods to sell in this environment, they must either 
be noticeably cheaper or offer something special, said Yoshiko Hiramatsu, a 
Yokohama housewife. Otherwise, she said, the Japanese will buy domestic 
products for their reliability and familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most sensitive sectors for foreign companies is food. Here, taste 
and cleanliness are of paramount concern. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, American rice is being allowed into Japan under an 
emergency program to make up for shortages. Rice imports will also be allowed 
under GATT. 
</P>
<P>
 When U.S. rice finally hit the shelves in Tokyo last week, some supermarkets 
reported selling out in just a few hours as consumers seemed willing at least 
to try it. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is no simple matter to sell foreign rice in what California industry 
spokesman John Roberts calls "the most discriminating rice market in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Taste comparisons of Japanese and foreign rice are a hot topic. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikkei Trendy Magazine, a popular lifestyle publication, conducted a taste 
test, which placed a Japanese variety predictably on top. Surprisingly, a 
U.S.-Japanese blend placed second. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is convinced. A blend of U.S. and Japanese rice makes a "pretty 
decent" combination for use in Yokohama-based Tokatsu Foods Co.'s bento lunch 
boxes, said Akira Arahata, the firm's managing director. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "It has a smell." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer tastes aside, the threat of imports to Japanese agriculture stirs 
real concern. During the first 11 months of 1993, beef imports from Australia 
and the United States soared 24%, spurred by lower tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, wholesale prices for domestic beef have dropped about 15% since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the difference in quality would enable us to survive," a cattle 
grower in northern Japan recently told the Nikkei Weekly, an English-language 
economics newspaper. "But I'm not so sure any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Holley reported from Tokyo and Lee from Los Angeles. Times researcher Chiaki 
Kitada in Tokyo contributed to this article.

UNLEASHED BY QUAKE, WILD BUNCH REWRITES THE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's OK to turn the freeway shoulder into an extra lane and whiz by your more 
polite fellow commuters. It's OK to ignore a long queue for an off-ramp on a 
quake-damaged freeway, then race ahead and try to jam into the lane at the last 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 When crowding into a Metrolink train, don't bother waiting for others to 
disembark first. Go ahead and hoard food; Red Cross workers are required to 
feed all takers on a first come, first served basis, so no one will stop you. 
</P>
<P>
 But do not snore in a crowded disaster shelter. If your neighbor snores, don't 
wake him up; the racket means at least someone's getting some rest. And, for 
heaven's sake, hold off on the sexual activity when your 130 roommates are 
trying to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the new rules as Southern Californians are rewriting them, the 
revamped codes and social contracts that are smoothing our days and nights in 
post-quake Los Angeles. Everything has changed since Jan. 17, thanks to a 6.8 
temblor that didn't have the manners to wait until daylight before tearing our 
fragile social fabric to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the occasional flash of grace or compassion, it's everyone for 
themselves these days as the region cleans up the rubble and attempts to carry 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fights in emergency assistance lines, fraud in food stamp 
transactions. Solo drivers hog the car-pool lanes; tailgating is no longer just 
a sport for the busy BMW driver but a way of life for the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one, but no one has recovered from the quake," said psychologist Lilli 
Friedland, a member of the Los Angeles County Psychological Assn.'s disaster 
response team. "It's the worst that it's ever been. . . . We're talking about a 
survival level here, and people at a survival level have a real problem 
bringing their most courteous selves forward." 
</P>
<P>
 But the behavior played out in lines and on freeways, in shelters and suburbs, 
is more than just a lapse of good manners, an occasional stumble in the social 
sphere. The basic social codes that kept much of Southern California 
functioning as a community are largely gone, sacrificed to fear, the greater 
pull of anxiety over logic. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bad behavior that has replaced our former ethos has one goal, said 
Kirk Murphy, associate physician at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute and 
Hospital: "averting loss in one's own immediate sphere." That probably will be 
the law of the land until freeways are mended, jobs return and anxiety levels 
recede. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol Officer Wendy Moore, who works out of the Newhall 
station, says commuters in her area were a ruthless bunch even before the 
earthquake because they routinely drove for hours under the best of 
circumstances. They are the ones who head up the Golden State Freeway to the 
Antelope Valley each evening in conscious flight from the city and all it 
represents. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, though, with crippled freeways slowing them down even further, 
"they do anything they can to get a second or two quicker, a few car lengths," 
she said. "We've had people go through cones into construction areas, thinking 
they could drive through. . . . Everybody is putting themselves first, ahead of 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State Freeway bypass patrolled by Moore's station is a twisting 
stretch of asphalt that takes motorists onto the so-called Old Road, the former 
California 99, thus avoiding a collapsed freeway overpass. It is so narrow that 
motorists practically must inhale to drive two abreast. The speed limit is 35 
m.p.h., but drivers go at least 50 m.p.h. when they can -- which is not often. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a backup," Moore said as she crept through the snarled traffic 
and out again to where the number of lanes -- and drivers' speed and 
recklessness -- increases. Impatient drivers zig and zag like balls in a 
pinball machine as they fight to get just a little farther, just a little 
faster. "Look, now people are doing 70, 75 now, to make up for lost time. I 
can't say that I wouldn't be doing it myself if I had to do this commute every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 When far-flung commuters switch from the roads to the rails, they may take 
their bad behavior with them. Commuters from the Antelope and Santa Clarita 
valleys -- who have flocked to Metrolink trains in an effort to avoid long 
delays on the rerouted Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways -- are 
textbook cases of what psychologists call the behavior of scarcity. 
</P>
<P>
 What is scarce in their lives is not food or water, shelter or medicine, the 
traditional objects of post-disaster desire. This is Los Angeles, not Bosnia; 
to commuters, a train seat, a passable freeway, time to sleep instead of drive, 
these are the necessities of life that are in scarce supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Novice Metrolink passengers -- especially in their first weeks on the rails -- 
stampeded their way onto arriving trains, mowing down those trying to leave. 
They dueled over available seats, took no prisoners in fights over untended 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy with having to set alarms for 3 a.m. and missing the convenience of 
the automobile, the briefcase brigade has taken out its frustrations on train 
personnel and one another -- particularly because the existing service was 
extended into Lancaster and Palmdale. On many mornings, southbound trains have 
been filled by the time they reached the waiting throngs at the Santa Clarita 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Santa Clarita bunch is the wildest," said A Tuckwilkerson, an attorney 
from Lancaster who boards the train in his hometown for the trip to Glendale. 
"They're rude, they're crude, they act like they own the train." Passengers 
from Lancaster, he said, "are too tired to be rude." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita riders defend their behavior as a daily battle to protect the 
fundamentals of their existence. After all, they say, they're just trying to 
make sure they get to work on time and home again at a decent hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not stand aside and let the 20 ladies behind me on," said Bruce 
Rawitz, a Santa Clarita resident who has been a rail regular for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the unwritten rules of social intercourse carry no jail sentence or 
tangible fine, "we very much underestimate how pervasive those rules are," said 
Jerry Jellison, a psychologist and professor at USC. "There are unwritten norms 
that guide almost every aspect of our behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Times of "natural disaster, scarcity and threat, war, civil unrest" throw our 
normal rules out the window, Jellison said, and cause societies to struggle 
with the rewriting process. Even though normalcy is creeping steadily back, 
parts of Southern California today are still enmeshed in that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 How long it will take for the pressure to ease and behavior to return to 
normal is anyone's guess; those in the mental health field have a wide spectrum 
of opinion on the matter. But the good news, they say, is that we're not fated 
to be terminally brusque, like a city filled with transplanted New Yorkers. In 
fact, some commuting behavior is already beginning to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news, however, is that wholesale altruism could be a long way away. 
</P>
<P>
 "First we had a drought," psychologist Friedland said. "Then we had the trials 
and the riots, then the floods and the fires and the earthquake. Each one takes 
many months to recover from -- emotionally and financially and physically. We 
have not had that." 
</P>
<P>
 And because memories of the quake are still so fresh and some privations will 
continue indefinitely, many Southland residents still feel "a sense of imminent 
threat that is greatly disproportionate to their immediate situation," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And how do they make themselves feel better? By doing something, anything, to 
get back in control, even if it's an illusory sort of dominion. On the Santa 
Monica Freeway, such a reaction helped lead more than 100 solo motorists to 
crowd a car-pool lane the day it opened -- even though they got $271 tickets 
for their troubles, a process that in itself lengthened their drives that day. 
</P>
<P>
 It caused thousands of quake victims to line up at 1 a.m. at food stamp 
offices that didn't open for another six hours. The lines didn't move because 
so many of the desperate cut in -- a mass action that would probably not have 
happened under different circumstances. The ensuing rash of scuffling put Los 
Angeles police on tactical alert. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are constantly cutting in line, and the police aren't doing 
anything about it," said one Sun Valley woman as she waited for food stamps for 
her family. "In six hours, we moved about 20 feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelters are even more of a challenge. Stress runs high, space is at a premium 
and privacy is nonexistent for the hundreds of men, women and children still 
homeless. The new rules are even tougher to write in this hothouse of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not prepared for things like this," said Miguel A. Arturo, a 
county mental health worker recently assigned to the shelter at Granada Hills 
High. "They don't know how to live like this. . . . It's really hard to keep 
the kids quiet. . . . We got people who don't want to shower. You got two 
ladies next to a man who smells bad, and there's nothing you can do. You can't 
call the police. What are you going to say? 'Take him away. He smells bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter staff did call the police, however, to deal with a man who on several 
occasions masturbated after lights out in a room filled with strangers. But 
when no would file a complaint, the police just went away, Arturo said. The 
unwritten rules against public sexual activity lost out to the ones about not 
getting involved. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, shelter life is difficult enough so that even children are aware of 
the deep gulf between communal behavior and how they used to act at home. At 
home, before the quake destroyed her Granada Hills apartment building, there 
were "no rules," said Mary Shomaf, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the high school shelter, "you're not allowed to play ball," she said. 
"You're not allowed to run. You're not allowed to flash a flashlight at night 
because you wake people up. And you can't walk backward at night. I bumped into 
someone once doing that and woke them up." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people try to rise above the constraints and privations, to follow the 
codes that used to govern their behavior before Jan. 17 at 4:31 a.m. But even 
they have a hard time these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemarie Frieze, a Northridge resident recently occupying all of 40 square 
feet (the size of a cot plus a little walking space) at the Granada Hills High 
shelter, goes out of her way to praise her sudden care-givers, those volunteer 
dispensers of food and water, shower and bed, comfort and kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 And she really works at getting along with her neighbors, strangers sleeping 
less than an arm's-length away. It's kind of hard, though, when you live next 
to "Guttermouth," a fortysomething woman whose "every other word is the 
F-word," Frieze said. "When The Mouth starts, I just walk away. That's what you 
have to do."

COLUMN ONE; A GAPING GATEWAY FOR DRUGS; CORRUPTION AND LAX SECURITY MAKE 
NIGERIA ONE OF THE WORLD'S TOP TRANSIT POINTS FOR COCAINE AND HEROIN. NIGHTLY, 
COURIERS FLY OFF WITH ILLEGAL STASHES -- MANY BOUND FOR THE UNITED STATES.

<P>
 The woman blended effortlessly with the hundreds of travelers negotiating the 
maze of security checkpoints, tax collectors, passport stampers and 
bribe-takers at Murtala Muhammed Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a slender, 25-year-old Nigerian with braided hair, dressed in light 
cotton trousers and a T-shirt. She held a ticket for the late-night flight to 
Amsterdam. It was her container of palm oil, a staple of Nigerian cooking, that 
raised the security officer's suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're taking this to Europe?" the officer asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for my boyfriend," she replied. "He's never had a meal cooked in palm 
oil." 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptical Nigerian agents heated the gallon-sized jug of solidified oil and, 
lo and behold, a plastic bag of heroin bobbed to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every smuggler the Nigerians catch, there are hundreds, probably 
thousands, who walk unchallenged through the gaping airport security net. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign drug agents based here estimate that every plane, every night, holds 
at least one passenger smuggling heroin or cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, lax security at the airport and a culture of corruption have made 
this city of 8 million people one of the busiest drug transit points in the 
world, international experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Heroin arrives here in bulk from the Far East, often via Lebanon or Pakistan; 
cocaine arrives from South America. Then nearly all of it is exported, pound by 
pound, on the backs, in the luggage and, increasingly, in the bellies of 
Nigerian couriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nigeria is a major, major heroin trafficking and transit point," said Roger 
Guevara, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 
Washington. "I hate to say anything derogatory about Nigerians, but let's just 
say they're very good at what they do." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, almost 80% of the heroin seized at John F. Kennedy 
International Airport in New York has, at one point or another, passed through 
Lagos, DEA and U.S. Customs officials report. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the heroin seized in the United States is being carried by Nigerians 
or other West Africans. Just a few weeks ago, agents busted a Nigerian drug 
smuggling ring based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nigeria is a safe haven for individuals, drug barons and drug dealers," said 
a Western drug expert with three years' experience in Nigeria. "The reason? 
C-o-r-r-u-p-t-i-o-n." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other foreign drug agents here, he spoke on condition of anonymity. In 
the last year, one American drug agent and one Italian agent have been shot in 
ambushes. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle by American and European authorities to close the Lagos loophole in 
the world drug network has been uphill. 
</P>
<P>
 The American government, citing poor security, banned all direct flights 
between Lagos and the United States last August. In response, the Nigerians 
installed their first airport X-ray machine. 
</P>
<P>
 But American officials say security remains poor. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of the flight ban is expected in March. If the airport isn't 
recertified, the United States is legally bound to suspend all non-humanitarian 
aid to Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 Shutting down direct flights to the United States has only changed the path of 
the drug highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, American experts say, more Nigerians are smuggling drugs into the United 
States through European airports, overland from Canada and Mexico, and on 
flights from the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nigerian government's anti-drug efforts are coordinated by the 4-year-old 
National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, housed in a collection of dilapidated, 
unmarked buildings in a thicket of palm trees on Lagos' Victoria Island. Of its 
2,000 agents, 200 are assigned to the 24-hour airport detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria's drug agency is sharply criticized by foreign diplomats as 
incompetent and corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is especially plagued by cases of confiscated drugs that 
mysteriously disappear. Four agents were sent to jail last year for tampering 
with evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigerian authorities made 279 drug arrests last year and confiscated 135 
pounds of cocaine and 80 pounds of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 But much more got through. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities at London's Heathrow Airport arrested nearly one Nigerian a day 
last year. And those are just the couriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigerian agents have been unable or unwilling to arrest any major drug barons, 
many of whom receive friendly escorts through airport checkpoints and flash 
their enormous wealth on the streets of Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nigerian authorities are doing exactly nothing, except collecting money 
from the drug barons," a U.S. drug agent complained. "It's a disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
 At one border post two months ago, authorities had to fire tear gas to break 
up a dispute between Nigerian customs agents and drug enforcement agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight, it turned out, was over who could extort money from importers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last month, a 560-pound shipment of heroin from Thailand was seized by 
Nigerian agents, acting on a tip from British intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, some of the heroin was reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not condone this at all," said Abiodun Adesola, chief spokesman for 
Nigeria's drug agency. As he talked, loud rock music pulsed from a stereo 
system at his elbow. The sign on his desk read: "A life of drug addiction is a 
dead life." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not drug addiction, of course, but transportation, that is Nigeria's 
biggest problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Although drug use in Nigeria is on the increase, few can afford such an 
addiction in a country of nearly 100 million beset by crippling poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 But the transport business is booming. In recent months, Nigerian drug barons 
have forged into new markets in the rest of Africa, especially in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The DEA has three field agents in Lagos, the agency's only office in 
sub-Saharan Africa. But agency offers of assistance to the Nigerian government 
have, for the most part, been spurned. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Americans gave two drug-sniffing dogs to local agents, for example, 
the animals were never used and eventually died. Nigerians blamed the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigerian officials acknowledge that their efforts to stop trafficking have 
been insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 They blame the country's political travails, which have seen three unelected 
dictators in power over the last year. And they also blame the American 
appetite for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nigeria is not a generator of this drug traffic," said Jerry Gana, the 
government's minister of information. "We are not a nation of crooks." 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that Lagos has become one of the world's leading drug 
conduits "because our laws were not applied firmly in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Adesola, of the Nigerian drug agency, contended that, although Nigeria has a 
duty to stop the drug traffic in Lagos, "the U.S. also has a duty to teach 
people not to use them. This is a problem forced on us by poverty and the ready 
market in the United States and all these developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people are desperate to make ends meet, and they become tools," Adesola 
added. "If you (in the United States) don't tackle the demand, it's difficult 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 While Nigerian drug barons are hardly innocent victims of the world's 
narcotics habits, American officers admit that the promise of a $1,000 cash 
payment can easily turn an impoverished Nigerian into a contraband courier. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Nigeria, you've got 100 million people ready to take that chance," said a 
Western diplomat in Lagos. "And even if they get nailed in London, they still 
get a nice jail cell and good meals. There's an economic incentive right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The lax security network and corruption are only two reasons for the growing 
number of Nigerian drug barons. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. drug agents admit that Nigerians are among the world's most sophisticated 
smugglers -- and the most difficult to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Nigerians ever put their intelligence and energy into legal things, they 
would control the world," said another Western diplomat in Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
 Couriers are promised that, if they are caught, their families will be taken 
care of until they are freed. And they sign a vow of secrecy, which they 
respect, knowing that drug lords could harm their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Couriers undergo rigorous training by the Lagos syndicates. In the drug 
barons' fancy homes, couriers are taught how to avoid being caught, how to 
answer authorities' questions and how to act if confronted. 
</P>
<P>
 They are supplied with high-quality forged passports, which can be obtained in 
a few days in Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
 Swallowing heroin-filled condoms is the most common method of drug smuggling 
here, and couriers often perfect their technique by swallowing grapes. Couriers 
also often use okra soup, a favorite Nigerian dish, to help wash down their 
stash. In fact, an effort to target the "swallowers" in 1992 was code-named 
"Operation Soup Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign drug agents encourage flight attendants on planes leaving Lagos to 
report any passengers who refuse to eat or drink. But they are often outwitted 
by drug lords who flood flights with couriers. Agents call this "the army of 
ants tactic." 
</P>
<P>
 And American agents say Nigerians are now recruiting more women, especially 
white women, to be couriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't just take the average Joe and say, 'Take this to America,' " a 
U.S. agent said. "They are very sophisticated. They've had on-the-job training, 
and they know how to beat us." The Nigerian Connection 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no direct service between Lagos, Nigeria, and the United 
States, there are plenty of flights to European and African cities that have 
numerous daily flights to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 DAILY FLIGHTS to Europe: London: 6 Rome: 5 Brussels: 4 Frankfurt: 4 Zurich: 4

FEMA BEGINS CLOSING ONE-STOP AID CENTERS; EARTHQUAKE: GLENDALE AND SIMI VALLEY 
SITES ARE THE FIRST TO BE SHUT. OFFICIALS CITE DECLINING APPLICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Wednesday began shutting down its 
one-stop assistance centers for quake victims, a day short of today's one-month 
anniversary of the 6.8-magnitude temblor that forced hundreds of thousands of 
people to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday the 21 service centers had distributed nearly $230 million in 
grants and loans and given out more than 340,000 applications -- including 
87,000 to those who walked into the centers, which were opened three days after 
the quake to provide victims one place at which to fill out applications to 
various federal, state and local agencies for emergency aid. Others applied by 
telephone or mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two centers to close were at the Glendale Civic Center Auditorium 
and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley on Wednesday. Centers 
in Santa Monica and two in the Santa Clarita Valley will close Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The center at Calabasas High School will close Saturday, when FEMA begins 
phasing in the second part of its disaster assistance program by opening two 
new Earthquake Service Centers, at 1901 S. Bundy Drive in Santa Monica and 
28460 Ave. Stanford in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Disaster Assistance Centers helped victims fill out applications for 
aid, the Earthquake Service Centers will provide follow-up assistance as 
applications are processed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disaster Assistance Centers are being closed because the number of 
applications is declining, said Rita Kepner, a FEMA spokeswoman. Eventually all 
of them will close to be replaced by 10 new Earthquake Service Centers, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to have the service centers in sectors that will serve the same 
people as the assistance centers," Kepner said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the FEMA operation at the Winnetka Recreation Center, one of the 
busiest, remained crowded, but without the tension or long lines that 
characterized its first days of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Manriquez of the state Office of Emergency Services said the center is 
accepting about 200 new applications daily, compared to about 600 daily during 
the first week. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 people are being helped daily, instead of the 1,100 that were being 
helped each day earlier. Manriquez said the center is already starting to do 
some of the follow-up work that the new Earthquake Service Centers will 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank and Mae Edwards, formerly of Porter Ranch and now renting in Sherman 
Oaks, registered by mail and on Wednesday went to the Winnetka center to hand 
in their applications, a process that took a little more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot easier than I thought," said Mae Edwards, who is seeking 
assistance to rebuild their badly damaged house. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Simi Valley, state and federal disaster aid workers packed up their forms 
at the Reagan Library, where about 90 quake victims a day had been assisted, 
said site manager Lisa Schoenthal. A second site serving Simi Valley victims, 
at the Sycamore Drive Community Center, will remain open indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 The library site's 70 workers will be sent to the Sycamore Drive center and to 
a center in Fillmore, Schoenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 New applicants were still showing up. Father David G. Davidson, pastor of St. 
Patrick's Episcopal Church in Thousand Oaks, came seeking a loan to repair the 
church's pipe organ. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson said he juggled his busy Ash Wednesday schedule to go to the library 
site because it is about five miles closer to Thousand Oaks than is the 
community center. "I knew if I didn't make it in today I'd have to drive even 
farther," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Lyttle, a receptionist who lives in Simi Valley, was looking for a loan to 
replace cracked block walls around her home. Lyttle said she had put off 
applying because she was reluctant to begin the ordeal of repairing the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sycamore center is closer to my house, but friends told me that workers 
here were very friendly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 130 showed up at the Glendale Civic Auditorium, about 50 of them new 
applicants, down from more than 600 a day in the first two weeks after the 
quake, said center manager Clara Feldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just weren't enough applicants coming in anymore," to keep it open, she 
said. "But I think we've taken care of most of the people around here." 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which served a large Armenian population, provided three 
Armenian-speaking workers who will be shifted to centers as needed, Feldberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Jan. 15, more than 340,000 people had registered for assistance by phone 
or in person at FEMA Disaster Assistance Centers, with the majority applying by 
phone, Kepner said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 243,000 people applied for housing assistance, but as of Monday only 
58,106 had been declared eligible. Grants totaling more than $150 million have 
been distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 The HUD program is designed to provide housing for 18 months for people with 
low incomes. Recipients pay 30% of their income toward rent, with the 
government paying the balance. HUD officials must inspect and approve the 
rental properties and a formal agreement must be signed between HUD and the 
landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, 16,554 housing certificates had been issued, but only 5,517 
people had found places to live, and of those, HUD has signed contracts for 
2,009, according to HUD spokesman Scott Reid. 
</P>
<P>
 But most quake victims do not qualify for housing grants, and are referred 
instead to the Small Business Administration for low-interest, long-term loans. 
According to SBA spokeswoman Diane Brady, 283,835 applications have been sent 
out as of Tuesday. However, only 40,570 applications have been completed and 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the returned applications, 2,532 have been approved and provided with loans 
totaling $78.4 million, with the average loan for nearly $31,000 at 3.625% over 
20 years. All but 200 of the loans approved have been for individuals rather 
than businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said another 100,000 completed applications are expected in the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's general procrastination," Brady said. "We always have a big influx 
around the deadline, which is March 18." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 quake killed at least 57 people, collapsed freeways and damaged or 
destroyed more than 45,000 homes. State officials have estimated the total cost 
of the damage at $13 billion to $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has approved $8.6 billion in earthquake relief, the largest 
disaster aid package in the nation's history.

STRONG STORM TO BRING THREAT OF MUDSLIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A strong and complex storm system was poised to strike the coast of Southern 
California before dawn today, raising fears of more destructive landslides in 
areas stripped of vegetation during last fall's devastating brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood watch for the burn areas 
from midnight until noon today. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said that up to two inches of rain could fall in the coastal areas 
and up to four inches in some foothill communities before the system -- 
combining a cold storm from the Gulf of Alaska with warm, moist air from the 
tropical Pacific -- moves to the east sometime this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This system has the potential to cause significant flooding problems, 
especially in the burn areas," the National Weather Service said in a special 
statement issued Wednesday afternoon. "In addition, strong gusty winds are 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, where hillsides burned bare in last October's firestorm are 
especially vulnerable to heavy rains, two firefighters monitored a storm 
tracking computer throughout the night in an emergency command center. 
</P>
<P>
 City public works crews put equipment on standby in case rainfall is heavy 
enough to cause mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials hope that hay bales, sandbags and other measures to divert 
flood water and mud from homes and businesses would keep Laguna Beach 
relatively free of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasts on Wednesday were anticipating light rain to start in Laguna Beach 
in the early morning hours today, Battalion Chief Joe McClure said. But heavier 
rain wasn't expected until about 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the expenditure of more than $450,000 by the city of Malibu on erosion 
control after last October's fires, a similar storm system last week set off 
mudslides that surged through at least 25 homes in the exclusive beachfront 
community. About a dozen residents were stranded by mudslides in Altadena, 
another neighborhood hit hard by the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very busy fall and winter," Inspector Jack Pritchard, a spokesman 
for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said Wednesday. "Right now, 
everything's fine, but if the forecast holds true, heavy bursts of rain could 
mean more trouble in Malibu, or Altadena, or any of the other burn areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the threat of flash floods, the department has deployed its 
swift-water rescue teams, both in helicopters and on the ground. Extra fire 
crews have been sent to Malibu and Altadena and heavy equipment -- including 
bulldozers, dump trucks and skip-loaders -- has been moved into position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sandbags are available at fire stations in the affected areas, but most of 
the sandbagging is pretty much done," Pritchard said. "People have been out 
there all day getting ready. I guess they're pretty much as prepared as they 
can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said the main cold front 
from the Alaskan storm will move across Southern California this morning or 
early this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accompanying the storm is a flow of tropical moisture from near Hawaii," he 
said. "The two elements are coming together over California, and the result 
will be some locally heavy rain and some thunderstorms. I think there will be 
some problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said that in Southern California, the heaviest rain probably will fall 
late this morning and early this afternoon, with scattered showers lingering 
until Friday. The snow level in local mountains is expected to start at about 
8,000 feet, dropping to about 4,000 feet after nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like variable cloudiness will continue through the weekend," Brack 
said. "And there may be some scattered showers again on Sunday and Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 High temperatures in the Los Angeles metropolitan area for the next few days 
should range from the upper 50s to the middle 60s, with lows mostly in the 
upper 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 The top reading at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Wednesday was 69 degrees, 
after an overnight low of 57. Total rainfall for the season stood at 3.37 
inches, which is about a third of the normal total of 9.6 inches for the date 
and about one-sixth of last year's total by Feb. 16 of 19.82 inches. The 
rainfall season is measured from July 1 through June 30.

RIVALS FOR SCHOOLS POST TEST THEMES

<P>
 Two of the major candidates for California superintendent of public 
instruction used the statewide education summit that ended here Wednesday as a 
showcase to test possible campaign themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), who is allied with teachers groups, 
hammered away at the need to change the status quo and criticized Gov. Pete 
Wilson and his education policies. "The No. 1 thing the state does is educate 
our children," she said, but "with this Administration prisons come first." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Maureen DiMarco, Wilson's secretary of education and child 
development, said the top issue facing public schools is crime. DiMarco, a 
Democrat and former Orange County school board member, said efforts must be 
made to curtail campus violence before spending more money on schools. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no formal recognition of the superintendent's race during the 
two-day summit and there was no formal debate between DiMarco and Eastin. Both 
were active participants, however, and each was featured on separate panels. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco and Eastin are among at least 11 candidates who have filed papers 
saying they intend to seek the nonpartisan post in the June primary. The job 
was vacated when state schools Supt. Bill Honig was forced to resign a year ago 
after his conviction on conflict of interest charges. If none of the candidates 
receives a majority in June, the two top vote-getters will face off in the 
November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the education summit was candidate Gloria Matta Tuchman, president of 
the Tustin Unified School District Board of Education and a first-grade teacher 
at Taft Elementary School in Santa Ana, who has made criticism of the state's 
bilingual education program a cornerstone of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth high-profile contestant, Joseph Carrabino, the combative and 
conservative former president of the state Board of Education, is also likely 
to be a force in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate appearances Tuesday and Wednesday, Eastin and DiMarco said they 
expect the contest to become a two-person race, with each of them vying to 
become the state's first woman schools chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who is backing Eastin, 
predicted a close contest with Eastin winning "by an eyelash." Like Eastin, 
Brown is closely allied with the powerful California Teachers Assn., the 
state's largest teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a summit participant, praised DiMarco's credentials but did not 
endorse any of the aspirants. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, DiMarco cited her 25 years of experience in education, from 
parent volunteer and Garden Grove school trustee to consultant to Honig and 
president of the California School Boards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco said her experience serving under Republican Wilson has shown her the 
need to end partisan bickering over the future of education. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, 45, emphasized fighting crime as "the first, overriding issue" facing 
the schools. She supports legislation to curb guns on campuses and boost 
security. Last year, a move by Democrats to divert some parking fine revenues 
to finance school safety programs stalled in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin, 46, criticized Wilson for emphasizing an expansion of the state prison 
system over public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best prevention program against crime is to keep these kids in school," 
said Eastin, chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's really do something about the long-term issue of crime which all points 
back to education. I cannot point to a single nation on Earth that we consider 
more globally competitive because it has the best prison system. Not one." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuchman, the Tustin board of education president, emphasized her opposition to 
the state's bilingual education program, saying it is costly and ineffective. 
Bilingual education programs provide academic instruction in a child's native 
language until the student becomes proficient in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuchman might well appeal to Carrabino's conservative supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 After six stormy years, Carrabino resigned from the state Board of Education 
in 1992 rather than face rejection by the state Senate on his reappointment by 
Wilson. A retired UCLA management professor, the 70-year-old Republican engaged 
in an all-out battle with Honig over control of the education department. Major 
school groups opposed his reappointment, citing Carrabino's racial and 
anti-Semitic remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrabino, of Sherman Oaks, had no formal role in the education summit and 
could not be reached for comment.

ROBERTI TRIES TO RALLY GUN CONTROL BACKERS' SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a telegenic bid to call attention to his political plight, state Sen. David 
A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) on Wednesday trotted out an AK-47 assault rifle and had 
it fired with devastating effect at four watermelons and a head of cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the noisy media event was to underline Roberti's contention 
that he is the target of a recall campaign engineered by groups angry that 
Roberti authored a 1989 law banning assault rifles in California and to rally 
gun control advocates -- and their money -- to his side. 
</P>
<P>
 In brief remarks at the Burbank Police Department shooting range, Roberti 
warned that if "assault weapon extremists" succeed in recalling him it will 
"trigger a nationwide movement" to recall other elected officials who back 
reasonable gun controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall leaders said Wednesday that although 2nd Amendment enthusiasts have 
played a significant role, the recall effort is driven primarily by 
good-government advocates who believe Roberti is a carpetbagger and liberal who 
is soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're all gun nuts, how does Roberti explain people like Jan Miller (a 
victims rights advocate) and Ted Costa (head of a watchdog group founded by tax 
fighter Paul Gann) who are part of our coalition?" said recall leader Russ 
Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating his opponents, who collected more than 20,000 signatures to force 
him into an April 12 recall election, Roberti on Wednesday also showcased 
endorsements by five statewide law enforcement groups of his "Beat the Recall" 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Gatos Police Chief Larry Todd, president of the California Police Chiefs 
Assn., praised Roberti's ban on military-style semiautomatic weapons and urged 
that Roberti's political salvation be made a state and national issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Angele from the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs, the man who 
pulled the trigger in Wednesday's shooting demonstration, called the estimated 
$900,000 cost of the recall election a ludicrous waste of tax money because 
term limits will force Roberti to leave his Senate seat in December anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's effort to turn the recall into a national cause celebre has had some 
success. Sarah Brady, perhaps the nation's best-known advocate of gun control, 
will be the featured speaker at a $250-per-plate March 10 fund-raiser for 
Roberti at the Biltmore Hotel. Brady is the wife of former presidential press 
secretary James Brady, who was critically wounded in an assassination attempt 
against President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Roberti spent more than $2 million to win election to the 20th Senate 
District seat he now occupies, which at the time was foreign turf to the 
longtime Hollywood representative. Despite his huge expenditures, Roberti 
scored only 43% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, going into the recall where he must get 50% plus one to win, Roberti is 
finding that political money is tight. "It's tough raising money now," said 
Roberti, who has filed to run in the June Democratic primary for both state 
treasurer and for a seat on the state Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much going on in California (in the way of political races) that 
it's critical that David reach outside the state for money," said political 
consultant Joe Cerrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent campaign finance reports show that the senator had campaign cash of 
about $260,000 as of Jan. 1, although Roberti said Wednesday that he has about 
$450,000 in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerrell believes Roberti's fund raising is complicated by the fact that the 
senator is a lame duck who is not -- as he was in 1992 -- the powerful head of 
the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should've raised more money for himself when he was (Senate president) pro 
tem," Cerrell said.GUN CONTROL

CORONA MEDFLY SPRAYING CALLED A SUCCESS; AGRICULTURE: THE CITY IS QUIET DURING 
THE FIRST OF UP TO EIGHT AERIAL APPLICATIONS OF MALATHION OVER AN 
18-SQUARE-MILE AREA. APPROACHING STORM MAY HAMPER EFFECTIVENESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the dispute over the aerial spraying of malathion over Corona and Norco 
continues, state agriculture officials declared the first airborne application 
of the Medfly-killing insecticide to be a trouble-free success. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Wednesday that the effectiveness of the malathion might be 
compromised by an approaching rainstorm because heavy downpours may wash away 
the corn syrup bait. But officials plan as many as seven more air attacks on 
the Medfly between now and June to try to eradicate the destructive pest from 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The next aerial spraying will occur in about three weeks, said Larry Hawkins, 
spokesman for the joint state-federal Cooperative Medfly Project. 
</P>
<P>
 A trio of malathion-laden helicopters flew tediously over an 18-square-mile 
area of Corona and Norco for 4 1/2 hours, finishing just after 1:30 a.m. 
Wednesday. Officials from both Corona City Hall and the Medfly Project said 
they were pleased there were no disruptions of the flyovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an extraordinary quiet evening," said Corona City Manager Bill 
Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona City Hall had received several anonymous phone calls from people 
threatening to shoot the helicopters out of the sky as they passed over, 
Garrett said. "I never did think our law-abiding citizens were going to resort 
to those kinds of actions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,500 people called the Medfly hot-line telephone number Tuesday to ask 
about the spraying, and a minority of those leveled complaints, Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was about what we expected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most common subjects of complaints heard by state and city officials 
alike were the number of helicopters over Corona and Norco on Tuesday evening. 
In addition to the three spraying aircraft flying at an altitude of about 500 
feet, and a command chopper that tailed behind, six media helicopters flittered 
above them to shoot video. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten calls up the kazoo about all those helicopters," said Corona City 
Councilman Jeff Bennett. "Everyone thought it was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant complaints to City Hall were allegations that the Medfly 
helicopters spewed the malathion-laced bait outside the designated spray zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins said spray monitors worked through the night to watch where the 
droplets fell and found nothing amiss. The helicopters were directed by a 
satellite guidance system that indicated to the pilots where to begin and 
conclude each pass, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation lasted longer than the expected 3 1/2 hours, Hawkins said, 
because the pilots decided to return twice -- instead of just once -- to March 
Air Force Base near Riverside to refuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the operation began, the city was unusually still. Waitresses at 
local restaurants complained of poor business, and once the flying began, the 
normal flow of calls to the Corona Police Department all but stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The status board is all green," Police Lt. Sam Spiegel remarked at one point 
in the evening. "That means we've got no calls, and every one of our units in 
the field is free. That's unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday morning, local carwashes were busy cleaning vehicles of the 
pinkish-brown droplets, about the size of pinheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona city maintenance crews showed up for work early Wednesday to hose down 
play equipment in city parks and water the grass to dilute the malathion, 
Garrett said. "We want people to feel safe in the parks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett said the city plans to challenge additional sprayings. It maintains 
that the long-term public health effects of malathion are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 The state said the spraying was necessary to keep the Medfly from jeopardizing 
the state's $18-billion agriculture industry.

LONELY VOICE BACKS VOUCHERS AT SUMMIT; EDUCATION: TERRY M. MOE GETS CHILLY 
RESPONSE AT TWO-DAY MEETING. BUT HE SAYS MOST REFORMS URGED AT THE CONFERENCE 
WOULD GET WATERED DOWN BY POLITICS.

 Acting a little like the wicked fairy at Sleeping Beauty's christening, the 
foremost proponent of private-school choice told the California Education 
Summit on Wednesday that efforts to reform public education will fail unless 
they also allow parents to use tax money to send their children to private or 
parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret I'm going to have to play the role of troublemaker (at this) 
love-in," Stanford University economics professor Terry M. Moe said on the 
final day of the gathering convened by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the wicked fairy, at least Moe was invited to this party, which was 
called to talk about making public schools better. But he got a stony reception 
from an audience dominated by the public education Establishment, including 
many teachers, administrators and parents who had helped defeat Proposition 
174, the voucher initiative on last November's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can choose to make all schools excellent before we choose which 
schools to leave," said Inglewood School Supt. George McKenna, the first of 
several panelists to rebut Moe, the self-described "token choice guy" at the 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 174 would have provided tax money vouchers to parents to redeem at 
public or private schools. Critics predicted that it would siphon state money 
from public schools already struggling with tight budgets and increasingly 
needy students. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe said none of the ideas proposed at the summit, like scores of reform 
efforts in the nation over the last decade, will go far enough because they get 
watered down in a political and bureaucratic environment that stifles 
innovation in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the hurdles to improving California schools were in evidence at the 
two-day summit. Even while panelists voiced agreement on many of the general 
ideas, rifts quickly surfaced on the specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the issue of ending school violence, which got a lot of attention during 
the summit. Gov. Pete Wilson said he found consensus for "no more tolerance for 
drugs and guns" on campus and a need to find ways to keep troublemaking 
youngsters in school while separating them from other students. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ronald Prescott, a lobbyist with the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
said there is already competition in Sacramento over how to do it -- 
disagreement, for instance, over whether money should go for such measures as 
metal detectors to catch armed students or for such prevention programs as 
early childhood education. 
</P>
<P>
 Several participants complained that promising reform programs were too 
limited. The state's recent charter schools law, for example, gives campuses 
nearly absolute freedom to reinvent themselves to improve student achievement, 
but is limited to 100 of the state's 7,600 public schools. That is because some 
in the education Establishment and legislators would support only a slow 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Other programs, such as Los Angeles' ambitious, communitywide effort to 
improve student achievement in the nation's second-largest school district, 
cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Roos, head of the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now 
(LEARN), told summit participants that the program, designed for the highly 
diverse student body of 640,000 in the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
took two years to get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "The approach that works for L.A. cannot and should not and will not be shoved 
down the throats of Fresno, Carlsbad and Marin," Roos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit generally got high marks from participants as a way to focus 
attention on education reform, but many said it only scratched the surface, and 
they called for additional sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Slavkin, a Los Angeles Board of Education member, said he fears the 
summit's "cover the waterfront" approach might hinder its effectiveness. He 
said he would have preferred an intensive look at one or two key issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope (legislators) don't go back to Sacramento and start writing laws based 
on just these two days," said Donna Buland, a Sacramento parent who is active 
in school issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert Reich, in an address Wednesday, said that improving the 
schools is the key to a better economic future for California. But he 
acknowledged that is "easy to talk about, very hard to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Reich also announced that the federal government will provide the state with 
$750,000 to help prepare high school students for the job market. Such 
school-to-work programs are a key part of the Clinton Administration's 
education agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's Moe, also a Hoover Institution senior fellow and co-author of a 
book calling for parents to have maximum choice in schools, said he was 
disappointed that the summit "swept choice under the carpet." He said the lack 
of attention to the issue reinforced his view that public school officials 
quash proposals that threaten their position of prominence in fashioning 
education policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although voters soundly rejected Proposition 174, polls show that a majority 
of Californians support the concept of vouchers for private schools. He said 
last fall's ballot measure lost because it had several flaws, including lack of 
protection for public school funding and lack of accountability for private 
schools, which are lightly regulated in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the state's public schools do not show marked improvement soon, he 
said, "in 1996, we'll all be voting on a new voucher initiative" that will not 
have the same flaws.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: A TEACHER WHO OFFERS SOMETHING WORTH LEARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting through Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's education summit, I remembered 
why I never liked school. 
</P>
<P>
 Extracurricular activities, great; classes, get me out of here. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many teachers and principals -- and professors in later years -- were 
elitist, self-righteous, humorless windbags. They droned on and on, spewing dry 
data and mouthing an uncommon form of English, causing my eyes to glaze and 
ears to punch mute. They used uninspiring, overblown words and phrases such as 
"categorical," and "coordinated approach." These days, you hear a lot of 
"governance," "paradigm" and "site-based management." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, I even heard an educator/bureaucrat say "continuum." 
</P>
<P>
 There also was that irksome preaching. You're not using your full capabilities 
. At the summit, it was try harder to come up with more tax money . 
</P>
<P>
 Add to these traits some self-promotion and mix it all with a seemingly 
endless series of boring lectures -- virtually no dialogue, let alone debate -- 
and that's too much of what the two-day education summit was about. 
</P>
<P>
 The format was flawed: Seven sessions, each averaging five speechmaking 
"presenters," followed by 20 "panelists" with prepared remarks, much of it 
repetitive. A monotonous overload for the audience of 1,000 and potential 
home/school TV viewership of up to 6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't blame Brown entirely. A natural showman, the San Francisco Democrat 
occasionally livened things up with his humor. And several times he tried to 
kick the panelists into gear. "Those of us who know everything let you know we 
know everything," he once told the audience, chiding some tedious speakers. By 
Wednesday, he was admonishing panelists to be "relevant" and "react" to the 
presenters -- with little success. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, there was a lot to be cynical about at this second so-called summit in 10 
days -- the first being Gov. Pete Wilson's convocation on crime in Hollywood. 
But as with the governor's summit, Brown's was worthwhile because it forced 
legislators and other decision-makers to focus on California's beleaguered 
schools for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Public education was supposed to have gotten a "wake-up call" to reform from 
last year's school voucher campaign. But it shut off the alarm with a 
$16-million anti-voucher sledgehammer and then dozed off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Establishment got another wake-up call Wednesday from Terry M. Moe, a 
Stanford University professor and articulate leader of the voucher movement. 
Moe predicted that no major reforms will be passed by the Legislature because 
the California Teachers Assn. "is the biggest spending lobby in this state" and 
lawmakers "take their (political) lives in their hands" when they cross the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, he forecast a new voucher initiative for 1996 and warned: "It won't 
look like Proposition 174. . . . It will be pitched at the broad middle of the 
(voter) spectrum and this thing is going to be popular. And the CTA is going to 
get a run for its money." 
</P>
<P>
 That probably was the summit's most provocative speech. But there were some 
others. New Senate leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) suggested revising 
Proposition 13, the sacrosanct property tax cutter, to raise more local funds 
for schools. Retiring Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) proposed a five-year 
commitment to increase state funding by $6 billion annually, thereby boosting 
California's spending on schools to the nation's average. 
</P>
<P>
 For that to happen, there would need to be a significant economic upturn and 
probably a Democratic governor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the summit star was not a politician, a professor, a union leader or an 
administrator. She was a teacher. In fact, California's present Teacher of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra McBrayer, 33, began a public school for homeless children in downtown 
San Diego six years ago. And her speech -- unlike so many others -- was 
riveting. She talked about "children who are gay and are beaten before they're 
kicked out of their homes. Children who are pregnant and are told as long as 
you're pregnant, you can't stay here. . . . Children who are sold into 
prostitution by their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher continued, "I buried another child on Friday. She was 14; tried to 
get away from her pimp, and he shot her five times. . . . I have an expectation 
that every child can learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to Brown, McBrayer said: "We know how to fix it, but now we have to 
start taking action. . . . Education is not about textbooks or ADA. It is about 
caring about children." 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to McBrayer also reminded me of the good teachers I'd had. They 
weren't all babbling nerds. And they're right -- we probably could and should 
find them some more money.

STRONG STORM TO BRING THREAT OF MUDSLIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A strong and complex storm system was poised to strike the coast of Southern 
California before dawn today, raising fears of more destructive landslides in 
areas stripped of vegetation during last fall's devastating brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood watch for the burn areas 
from midnight until noon today. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said that up to 2 inches of rain could fall in the coastal areas 
and up to 4 inches in some foothill communities before the system -- combining 
a cold storm from the Gulf of Alaska with warm, moist air from the tropical 
Pacific -- moves to the east sometime this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This system has the potential to cause significant flooding problems, 
especially in the burn areas," the National Weather Service said in a special 
statement issued Wednesday afternoon. "In addition, strong gusty winds are 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the expenditure of more than $450,000 by the city of Malibu on erosion 
control after last October's fires, a similar storm system last week set off 
mudslides that surged through at least 25 homes in the exclusive beachfront 
community. About a dozen residents were stranded by mudslides in Altadena, 
another neighborhood hit hard by the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very busy fall and winter," Inspector Jack Pritchard, a spokesman 
for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said Wednesday. "Right now, 
everything's fine, but if the forecast holds true, heavy bursts of rain could 
mean more trouble in Malibu, or Altadena, or any of the other burn areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the threat of flash floods, the department has deployed its 
swift-water rescue teams, both in helicopters and on the ground. Extra fire 
crews have been sent to Malibu and Altadena and heavy equipment -- including 
bulldozers, dump trucks and skip-loaders -- has been moved into position. 
</P>

 "Sandbags are available at fire stations in the affected areas, but most of 
the sandbagging is pretty much done," Pritchard said. "People have been out 
there all day getting ready. I guess they're pretty much as prepared as they 
can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said the main cold front 
from the Alaskan storm will move across Southern California this morning or 
early this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accompanying the storm is a flow of tropical moisture from near Hawaii," he 
said. "The two elements are coming together over California, and the result 
will be some locally heavy rain and some thunderstorms. I think there will be 
some problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said that in Southern California, the heaviest rain probably will fall 
late this morning and early this afternoon, with scattered showers lingering 
until Friday. The snow level in local mountains is expected to start at about 
8,000 feet, dropping to about 4,000 feet after nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like variable cloudiness will continue through the weekend," Brack 
said. "And there may be some like scattered showers again on Sunday and 
Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 High temperatures in the Los Angeles metropolitan area for the next few days 
should range from the upper 50s to the middle 60s, with lows mostly in the 
upper 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 The top reading at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Wednesday was 69 degrees, 
after an overnight low of 57. Total rainfall for the season stood at 3.37 
inches, which is about a third of the normal total of 9.6 inches for the date 
and about one-sixth of last year's total by Feb. 16 of 19.82 inches. The 
rainfall season is measured from July 1 through June 30.

FISHER BRINGS QUIET VOICE, CARING HEART TO AIDS CONTROVERSY; HIV-POSITIVE 
MOTHER IS COPING WITH ILLNESS, ATTENDING TO HER FAMILY AND SPREADING THE 
MESSAGE SHE BROUGHT TO THE GOP CONVENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For Mary Fisher -- mother, artist, philanthropist and HIV-positive woman -- 
the moment is now. 
</P>
<P>
 She tries hard not to think about the future: her future, or the possibility 
that her children will face their future without her. When she feels the fear, 
it comes "in that reflective place you find yourself in at night, when you're 
forced to find a quiet time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I allow my work and my children to fill my time, so I don't have to think 
about those things on a daily or hourly basis," she said. "I couldn't get 
through the days if I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Fisher dwell on her medical situation with her two young sons, who 
are now 6 and 4. Neither of them is infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus, which causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing I can do for them is be with them, look them straight in the 
eye, answer their questions as best I can and be here, be involved in their 
lives as best I can," she said. "They know I have a disease. I don't know if 
they're relating it to what their dad had -- and I don't know if I want them to 
relate to it, because I'm not sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to instill my fears -- if I have them -- in my children," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been nearly two years since Fisher, 45, seared the public consciousness 
with her speech before the Republican National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing before her fellow Republicans, she spoke in calm, gentle tones -- but 
delivered a personal story that shocked the hall into silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she reaches people that activists like myself can never reach, which 
is people who respond to maternal warmth and not to yelling," said playwright 
Larry Kramer, a close friend of Fisher's who is a founding member of ACT UP 
(AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power). 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why she is as important as we are, maybe more so," he said. "We're a 
funny pair because she's always saying to me: 'Larry, I wish I had some of your 
anger.' And I'm always saying to her: 'Mary, I wish I had some of your 
compassion.' I see her speeches on TV and say: 'Mary, why don't you get 
angrier?' And she says: 'Larry, I can't.' But I think she's exceedingly 
effective being as she is, and I don't want her to change a decibel." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher challenged the Republican Party to confront the AIDS epidemic with 
candor and compassion and to make the issue its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has traveled the nation, speaking in churches, schools, 
prisons -- wherever there is an audience that can learn from her message: If it 
can happen to me, it can happen to you. 
</P>
<P>
 In many quarters, "people perceive AIDS as a depressing subject and don't want 
to take personal responsibility," Fisher said from the home she now rents in a 
Maryland suburb outside Washington, where she moved her family from Boca Raton, 
Fla., last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They try to make me an exception," she said. "I am not unusual. I am unusual 
only because I am speaking out. . . . The point is, there are a lot of me's out 
there, women with small children who are (HIV) positive, women who are 
devastated, women who are scared to talk about it. I know, because they come to 
me when I am traveling. It's truly amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, Fisher is wrong -- she is unusual in the framework of the AIDS 
epidemic: She is wealthy -- the daughter of longtime GOP fund-raiser and 
Detroit real estate mogul Max Fisher -- and she works for herself at home (she 
creates art using handmade paper) so she has no "workplace problem" with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has enough money to keep her children sheltered, although she has not 
isolated them. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, she is a longtime Republican with impeccable political credentials 
and connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher includes former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and George Bush and their 
families among her closest friends. She once worked in the Ford White House, 
and photographs of Ford and her two sons, Max and Zachary, adorn her living 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 But AIDS is the great leveler, so she is also right -- in many ways, she is no 
exception at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher was infected by her former husband, Brian Campbell, who reportedly was 
at one time an intravenous drug user. He has since died of AIDS. Women infected 
through heterosexual contact have become a rapidly growing population. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said it took a long time for her to come to grips with her infection -- 
and to speak about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discovery that we are HIV-positive tends to divide our lives into 
'before' and 'after,' " Fisher wrote in a newly published collection of her 
speeches, "Sleep with the Angels," subtitled, "a mother challenges AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 The book, she says, "is not just about AIDS, it's about children. It's about 
religion. It's about how we as a people deal with each other, and it's about my 
life, my relationships with others and the unconditional love that's out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer, who is quick to criticize others involved in AIDS activities, has only 
praise and affection for Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible not to like Mary because she is so caring and loving and 
motherly and interested, and because she puts her arms around you and gives you 
wonderful hugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher learned in July, 1991, that she was infected, but she said it took six 
months before she was ready to tell her story publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 After she did, and after she spoke to the GOP convention, Bush appointed her 
to the now-defunct National Commission on AIDS, replacing Earvin (Magic) 
Johnson, the HIV-positive retired Los Angeles Lakers star who quit over what he 
said was an unresponsive Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher also founded the Family AIDS Network, a nonprofit organization 
dedicated to raising AIDS awareness nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The network, she says, plans to give "care-giver" awards this spring because 
"they are the people who take care of us. They are the people who do not leave 
this epidemic." She also said she hopes that the organization can raise enough 
money for small AIDS research grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Fisher has no symptoms and takes no AIDS medication. "I feel really 
healthy, and am doing fine," she said. "As far as I know, everything is good." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said she intends to keep doing everything she is doing for as long as 
she can, speaking quietly and forcefully about the epidemic to whoever will 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can create a dialogue and keep it going, I believe it's the only way we 
can make a difference," she said.

PERU'S PREMIER REPORTEDLY QUITS OVER RIGHTS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peruvian Prime Minister Alfonso Bustamante has resigned over a human rights 
controversy, government sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bustamante quit over enactment of a law last week that sent a sensitive human 
rights case to the military court, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involved 11 army officers accused of killing nine students and a 
professor from La Cantuta University. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers allegedly abducted the 10 people from the army-occupied teachers 
college campus on July 17, 1992, and executed them hours later at a police 
firing range east of Lima. The bodies were buried there and at a dump site. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Wednesday that a military prosecutor has sought prison terms of 
four to 20 years for nine of the 11 defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Supreme Council of Military Justice said that Col. Raul 
Talledo requested the sentences Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers initially were charged in a civilian court. But last week, Peru's 
Congress and President Alberto Fujimori changed the law on jurisdictional 
disputes to allow the Supreme Court to send the case to a closed military 
tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to Bustamante said Wednesday that he resigned after disagreeing 
with that law, widely criticized as interference in the autonomy of the 
civilian judiciary.

RUSSIA TO SPEED ACCEPTANCE OF U.S. DRUGS; MEDICINE: MOSCOW WILL RELY HEAVILY ON 
FDA APPROVAL OF AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICALS. THE PACT IS A LIKELY BOON TO HEALTH 
IN THE EX-SOVIET REPUBLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Embracing U.S. scientific standards, Russia has decided to allow 
near-automatic importation of hundreds of thousands of prescription and 
over-the-counter drugs made by American companies, the Clinton Administration 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision should significantly enhance public health in a country whose 
quality of health care has deteriorated in recent years along with its overall 
economy, officials said. It also could boost long-term profits for U.S. 
pharmaceutical companies, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking just about new, breakthrough drugs but penicillin, 
vaccines, insulin, drugs for hypertension, for polio, for diphtheria. This 
permits them to get even the basic, old-line workhorses," said Mary K. 
Pendergast, a lawyer and deputy Food and Drug Administration commissioner who 
negotiated the memorandum of understanding between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the agreement, completed this week, the Russian Ministry of Health and 
Medical Industry said that it will eliminate virtually all barriers to the 
importation of drugs and biological products that have been approved by the 
FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia imports about $350 million worth of drugs annually -- more than 70% of 
what it needs. But U.S. pharmaceutical firms account for only $7 million of 
that total, according to FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the agreement means "potentially very large" financial gains for 
American drug-makers. The United States does not import drugs from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 As a part of the agreement, the Russian ministry will no longer require U.S. 
firms to conduct clinical trials in Russia of drugs approved for use in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry also will limit its review of such drugs to a 90-day period. 
Until now, there was no limit to the review period and U.S. manufacturers often 
were required to prepare voluminous scientific data -- in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best kind of international cooperation," said Donna Shalala, 
secretary of health and human services. "It can quickly bring some of the 
world's safest and most effective drugs to millions to relieve their suffering 
and improve the quality of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler added, "This is a significant endorsement of the high standards of 
safety and efficacy set by the FDA and the quality of medicines produced by 
U.S. pharmaceutical companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither country has entered into such an agreement before, FDA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year, renewable pact calls for "prompt exchange of information on 
removal of drugs and biological products from the market or restrictions on 
their use." 
</P>
<P>
 Drug industry officials hailed the development. "This milestone agreement will 
help greatly in improving access by Russian consumers to new drugs," said the 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn. "It will streamline the drug approval 
process and should help ease the drug shortage in that country." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great news," added Tony Fiskett, a spokesman for Merck & Co. "But 
whether, and when, that translates into a more viable presence in the 
marketplace remains to be seen -- because of Russia's economy, the political 
system, their ability to pay for and distribute these products."

EX-GOVERNOR KIDNAPED BY MEXICAN REBELS IS RELEASED; REVOLT: HE IS HANDED OVER 
AT THE FIRST KNOWN MEETING OF CHIAPAS INSURGENTS WITH MEDIATORS. HIS FREEING 
CLEARS THE WAY FOR PEACE TALKS. 
</P>

<P>
 Indian rebels late Wednesday released a former governor held hostage since 
Jan. 2, clearing the way for peace talks between the insurgents and the Mexican 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-year-old Absalon Castellanos was turned over to government peace 
negotiator Manuel Camacho and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz in the first known 
meeting between the mediators and the rebels. The hand-over took place in 
Guadalupe Tepeyac, on the edge of rebel-held territory in the southern Mexican 
state of Chiapas. The town has been declared a neutral zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are keeping our promises as men of honor," said Maj. Moises as he and four 
other uniformed rebels released the gaunt but fit-looking Castellanos. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels had said in a communique Tuesday that they were releasing 
Castellanos "for the purpose of promoting the prompt initiation of dialogue for 
peace and dignity that all Mexicans desire." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Camacho and the rebels have said that delays in starting the talks have 
been due to the logistics of arranging security. However, the government was 
also clearly uncomfortable starting negotiations while the rebels held 
Castellanos hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former general and a rancher as well as a politician, Castellanos 
symbolizes the ruling elite of Chiapas and many of the reasons for the 
rebellion. He was considered a hard-liner during his term in office from 1982 
to 1988, unwilling to negotiate with protesters who wanted ranchers to give 
over some of their privately held land to expansion of local peasants' 
semi-communal farms. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels have said that they took up arms only after peaceful means of 
protest, such as demonstrations, failed to effect change. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellano was kidnaped at his ranch in Chiapas, a state bordering Guatemala, 
the day after guerrillas calling themselves the Zapatista National Liberation 
Army took control of four towns. When the army approached, the rebels quickly 
withdrew into the jungle, taking Castellanos with them. His family held a press 
conference demanding that the government take responsibility for any ransom 
demands. No demands came. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Zapatistas issued a communique saying that Castellanos had been 
sentenced to life at hard labor, hauling wood and water, because he had 
mistreated people. However, the sentence was commuted, they added, to allow 
Castellanos to be traded for people then imprisoned under accusations of having 
participated in the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, 38 of the 70 people held in prison in relation to the 
uprising were released on bail paid by the state government.

AS JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS RISES, CLINTON PLANS FOR ADDED CLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hot on the heels of a sanctions threat against Japan, aides said Wednesday 
that President Clinton plans to add a sharp new weapon to his economic arsenal 
in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Japan's Ministry of Finance reported that the nation's trade 
surplus, the flash point for the rising tensions between the countries, rose 
sharply again in January over the same month a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade provision that Clinton aides spoke of -- known as Super 301 -- is 
widely loathed overseas and could lead to more sanctions scraps with Tokyo just 
as the two sides try to navigate their way around a head-on trade clash and 
find calmer commercial waters. 
</P>
<P>
 By renewing the dreaded unilateral tool, Clinton could name countries that he 
deems unfair traders and demand progress in specific sectors by a certain date 
under threat of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure lapsed under the George Bush Administration. Congressional aides 
said it could be renewed as early as today by executive order. However, a White 
House official said the move will not come until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Finance Ministry's preliminary figures, Japan exported $6.1 
billion worth of goods more than it imported in January, up 17% from a 
$5.2-billion surplus in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's surplus with the United States alone jumped 7% to $3.1 billion in 
January from a revised, but not final, $2.9 billion in January, 1993.

HEIR APPARENT IN N. KOREA REPORTED HURT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The leader of South Korea's main opposition party said today that Communist 
North Korea's heir apparent, Kim Jong Il, has been seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The report could not be independently confirmed, and South Korean officials 
cast doubt on its substance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Ki Taek, head of the opposition Democratic Party, told Korean reporters in 
a briefing that he had been told by "a foreign figure" that Kim Jong Il had 
suffered serious physical injury. He did not elaborate on his source. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Rounds, information officer for the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, said embassy 
officials had met with Lee recently. But "we are not the source for Lee's 
statement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Periodic rumors about deaths and injuries of North Korean leaders flow 
through Seoul regularly," Rounds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, the son of Communist leader Kim Il Sung and the No. 2 leader in the 
reclusive totalitarian nation, celebrated his 52nd birthday this week. He is 
referred to as the "Dear Leader." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told that Kim Jong Il was injured seriously so as not to take over 
political power," the opposition leader told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said he had been told by the source that the injury was not illness but 
"an accident . . . like a traffic accident or shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Agency for National Security, South Korea's spy agency, said the report 
could not be confirmed and that it considered it a rumor. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Foreign and Unification ministries also said they distrusted 
the report.

 Dennis Balcombe, pastor at the nondenominational Revival Christian Church in 
Hong Kong, told reporters here on Wednesday that public security officials 
raided an underground church in a house in the central province of Henan. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was staying at the house with six colleagues -- two Americans, two 
Indonesians and two Hong Kong residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The police confiscated their belongings, detained them for several days, then 
"personally escorted" Balcombe to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The other six were released separately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were seized on Feb. 10 . . . and accused Feb. 15 of violating new 
regulations dealing with foreigners and religious activities," Balcombe said. 
"I don't know if this is an isolated incident or an enforcement of a new policy 
to restrict the activities of Christian foreigners working in China." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the State Department expressed concern Wednesday over the 
failure of Chinese authorities to inform U.S. officials of the arrests. 
Christine Shelly said U.S. officials learned of them three days later from a 
relative of one of the detainees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned that Chinese officials did not promptly notify the embassy 
about the detention of the U.S. citizens and that we had to learn about it from 
outside sources," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese government has always had laws against religion, but they are 
enforced inconsistently. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules specifically ban proselytizing by foreigners and forbid churches 
from engaging in what the government calls destructive, unauthorized or 
overseas-financed activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what these detentions and expulsions show is that the regulations 
issued by the (Chinese) authorities last month do indeed signal an increased 
crackdown on unofficial church movements in China," said Robin Munro, Hong Kong 
director of the Asia Watch human rights monitoring organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures come amid growing concern in Washington that China is not living 
up to international human rights standards, which may jeopardize the renewal of 
China's most-favored-nation trading status in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows the depth of the (Chinese) authorities' fear and anxiety about the 
rapidly developing unofficial Christian movement across China, which they see 
as a threat to the society and to the (Chinese Communist) party," Munro said. 
"It also shows that the authorities in China don't really take this MFN threat 
seriously yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Henan province declined to comment on Balcombe's expulsion.

 A prominent immunologist was named Wednesday to head the AIDS research 
programs at the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William Paul, best known for his discovery of a key immune system molecule 
that is attacked by the AIDS virus, will head the NIH's Office of AIDS 
Research. He was named to the post by Dr. Harold Varmus, the director of the 
NIH. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress, under pressure from AIDS activists, last spring reorganized the 
office, giving it more personnel and power to direct federally funded research 
into the viral plague.

 Banking regulators found that Hillary Rodham Clinton did not violate federal 
regulations when she represented the government in a 1987 lawsuit against a 
friend, it was reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Clinton's involvement was confined to two hours," Alan Whitney, a 
spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., told the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper reported earlier this month that Mrs. Clinton, working for the 
Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corp., helped settle a $3.3-million lawsuit 
against a friend and political supporter, Dan Lasater, for $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasater's bond firm was accused of mishandling funds belonging to a savings 
and loan that later failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC reviewed court documents and billing records submitted by the Rose 
Law Firm of Little Rock, Ark., where Mrs. Clinton worked.

SEPARATE GRAND JURY TO BE CALLED IN WHITEWATER CASE; PRESIDENCY: THE REGULAR 
PANEL IN ARKANSAS IS NOT PREPARED TO EXTEND ITS DUTY TO HEAR ALLEGATIONS 
SURROUNDING THE CLINTON REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. on Wednesday persuaded a federal judge to 
convene a separate grand jury to investigate allegations surrounding President 
Clinton's investment in the Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 40-minute meeting with Fiske, U.S. District Judge Stephen Reasoner 
ruled that a new grand jury should be impaneled to work exclusively on the 
Whitewater case because the one now sitting in Little Rock is not prepared to 
continue long enough to hear the Whitewater evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The move underscores the considerable scope and length of the inquiry that the 
special counsel is beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation is anticipated to involve more than 1 million documents, 
200 to 300 interviews and over 20 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and 
other assistants," the judge said in his order. "As such, the duties of any 
grand jury investigating this matter are much more extensive than the court had 
previously envisioned." 
</P>
<P>
 Reasoner noted that the 23-member grand jury now impaneled meets only two or 
three days a month. Its 18-month term expires in May, when a new jury will be 
named to continue hearing other routine federal cases. He said that, because 
most of the current grand jurors are opposed to having their terms extended, a 
second grand jury is justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fiske has declined to estimate how long his investigation will last, 
he told The Times in a brief telephone interview that he has rented an 
apartment in Little Rock for a year and expects to be finished by the time his 
lease is up. He said the three-year lease on his new offices was negotiated by 
the government and "it means nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske, a New York attorney, was appointed last month by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
and assigned to examine the investment that Clinton and his wife, Hillary, made 
with James B. and Susan McDougal in the northwestern Arkansas real estate 
development known as Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, he is trying to determine whether the Clintons paid 
appropriate taxes on their income from the project, whether federally 
guaranteed money from a savings and loan owned by McDougal was used for the 
project or found its way into Clinton's political campaign coffers and whether 
Clinton used his position as governor of Arkansas to benefit McDougal or 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Fiske investigation will look into whether Mrs. Clinton and 
her law firm violated any conflict-of-interest rules by first representing 
McDougal's savings and loan and later acting on behalf of the government after 
the thrift collapsed, leaving taxpayers with a $47-million debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske's request for a new grand jury duplicated a petition filed with the 
court last month by Donald Mackey, a Justice Department attorney assigned to 
the case before the special counsel was appointed. Mackey withdrew his request 
when Fiske's appointment was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the scope and volume of the matters falling within the jurisdiction of 
the independent counsel . . . " Fiske wrote in documents filed with the court, 
"the current grand jury's schedule and the other business of the district 
render an additional grand jury necessary so that such matters may be 
investigated in a prompt and thorough manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Reasoner originally resisted the idea of a new grand jury on grounds that it 
would be costly. But he relented after hearing Fiske's arguments, which were 
presented privately in his chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost of an additional grand jury would be an admittedly large expense -- 
an expense that the court would prefer to avoid," the judge wrote. "However, it 
now appears to be a necessary one. Moreover, the cost of expanding the work of 
the current grand jury to encompass this investigation likewise would be large. 
One way or the other, additional costs will be incurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Reasoner did not say how much he thought the grand jury investigation would 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fiske has yet to officially appoint any assistants, he said he 
expects to be ready to begin presenting evidence as soon as the new grand jury 
is impaneled. He said he will announce five to 10 appointments to his staff 
next week.

GREECE CUTS KEY MACEDONIAN TRADE ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angered by Western recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, 
Greece closed its consulate in the Macedonian capital and cut off the country's 
main trade route Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Athens government claims that Macedonia has designs on Greece's northern 
province, also called Macedonia, and says these claims are reflected in 
Macedonia's name, flag and symbols, which Athens says are historically Greek. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to Macedonia by the name of its capital, Skopje, Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou said that Greece has run out of patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the disintegration of former Yugoslavia, and the creation of the Skopje 
problem, until today, Skopje has not taken a single step showing moderation or 
good sense," he told a Cabinet meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Greek government has decided to suspend the activities of its consulate 
in Skopje, and the suspension of goods to and from Skopje through the port of 
Salonika, excepting those that are absolutely necessary for humanitarian 
reasons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece has no diplomatic relations with Macedonia; its consulate there was 
left over from the breakup of the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of landlocked Macedonia's trade and fuel passes through Salonika, about 
43 miles from its southern border. Alternative routes through Albania and 
Bulgaria are far longer and are over poor roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Macedonia says it has no claims on Greek territory. Macedonian leaders were 
meeting Wednesday night to discuss Greece's action.

CONTROL OF BOSNIA ARMS TO BE TOTAL, OFFICIAL SAYS; BALKANS: NATO COMMANDER 
DECLARES DEADLINE FOR WITHDRAWAL OF WEAPONS FROM SARAJEVO IS UNAMBIGUOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Monday deadline for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from around Sarajevo 
is unambiguous, and U.N. troops will exercise total control of weaponry turned 
in by Bosnian Serb and Muslim-led government forces, the NATO commander who 
would order any air strikes said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Control of weapons means that they are regrouped and collected and under U.N. 
control. If a warring faction wants to use those weapons, it would have to 
fight to get them," Adm. Jeremy Boorda told reporters here, gainsaying 
speculation from Washington that the United Nations might settle for less than 
absolute authority over weapons remaining in the area after the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. commanders in Bosnia-Herzegovina have exactly the same understanding of 
what control means, the American four-star admiral said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mandate hasn't shifted. Our rules haven't shifted," said Boorda, who 
heads the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Southern Command here along with 
the bristling armada of NATO warplanes poised at Italian air bases and on 
carriers in the Adriatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither will the deadline shift, Boorda said. "It's the U.N.'s deadline, and 
it's the NATO deadline. There's no ambiguity about that." 
</P>
<P>
 A NATO ultimatum issued last week and aimed principally at the Serbs gives 
both sides in the struggle over Sarajevo until an hour after midnight Sunday to 
withdraw artillery, mortars and other heavy weapons from within a 12-mile 
radius of the Bosnian capital or turn them over to U.N. peacekeepers. Failing 
that, NATO warplanes -- American, British, French and Dutch -- could strike at 
the United Nations' behest anytime thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO jets flew routine missions over Bosnia on Wednesday as training for 
possible attacks and to enforce a U.N. "no-fly" zone over the former Yugoslav 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the patrolling jets, an American F-16 fighter-bomber, crashed Wednesday 
morning after malfunctioning over Slovenia near that former Yugoslav republic's 
border with northeastern Italy. The pilot ejected safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Boorda, who is favored to become the next U.S. chief of naval operations, 
according to reports from Washington on Tuesday, said he is in constant touch 
with the U.N. commander in Sarajevo, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose could ask for air strikes before Monday if there is new shelling of 
Sarajevo, which has lived under fire for 22 months. A weeklong truce there 
appears to be holding, however, despite minor violations that on Wednesday 
included the killing of a 56-year-old worker by a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts believe that the Bosnian Serbs have as many as 500 field pieces 
and mortars positioned around a city where 10,000 people have died since 
minority Serbs rebelled in 1992 to protest a Muslim-led secession from the 
disintegrating Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Muslim armory is relatively modest, U.N. officers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Boorda's view of how well the ultimatum is respected will be easily measured. 
"I will be satisfied at midnight Sunday if the weapons are under control or out 
of the area. Nothing else is going to satisfy me," the admiral said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closed-door session at the United Nations on Tuesday, Kofi Annan, the 
U.N. undersecretary general for peacekeeping, laid a request for more troops 
and specialized equipment before ambassadors from the United States, Canada, 
Britain, France, Spain and the Netherlands, diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu had been prepared by Rose, who needs soldiers and radar equipment to 
help monitor Bosnian Serb weaponry in the hills around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 American sources also said Annan told the ambassadors that Rose had requested 
2,000 to 3,000 troops and artillery-locating radar. 
</P>
<P>
 An American official present at the session said that "nobody volunteered a 
lot of troops." And he emphasized that the United States did not volunteer any. 
"The United States does not supply ground troops" to the U.N. Protection Force, 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the Clinton 
Administration's policy precludes the dispatch of U.S. ground troops unless the 
warring factions agree to a negotiated peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic sources said that governments could send more troops to Sarajevo 
without convening the Security Council to pass a new resolution authorizing 
them. But Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has had a difficult time 
persuading governments to send more troops. 
</P>
<P>
 However, military analysts said France has agreed to send sophisticated 
counter-battery radar to U.N. forces in Sarajevo to help pinpoint Bosnian Serb 
artillery in the event of a NATO air strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Stanley Meisler, Norman Kempster and Art Pine in 
Washington contributed to this report.

THE BOBBITT CASE; CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF 'THE CULT OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'; THE CASE 
DREW ENORMOUS ATTENTION, IN PART, BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE NOTION THAT IN AMERICA, 
ANYONE CAN BECOME ANYTHING -- GOOD OR BAD, EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Jarriel of ABC's "20/20" offered an exclusive interview with Her -- in 
prime time. Nancy Glass of the nationally syndicated "American Journal" offered 
an exclusive interview with Him -- in two parts! Together, Lorena and John 
Wayne Bobbitt made the cover of People magazine. Vanity Fair devoted 10 pages 
to her story. Court TV covered her trial. When she was found not guilty of 
"malicious wounding" -- as he earlier had been found not guilty of rape -- the 
verdict made front pages coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 What is it about the Bobbitts that so fascinates Americans -- and so 
preoccupies the American media? 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the answer seems simple: Nothing arouses public interest like 
sex and violence. What could be juicier than a story about a woman who cut off 
her husband's penis with a kitchen knife? 
</P>
<P>
 But Barry Glassner, chairman of the sociology department at USC, says there's 
another factor, what he calls "the uniquely American phenomenon of 'the cult of 
the average person.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do people watch Phil Donahue and Geraldo and all those other talk and 
tabloid programs?" he asks. "A big part of it is that the people on those shows 
are portrayed as average except for the one special thing that got them on TV. 
People identify with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Heidi Fleiss," he says. "She's an average girl, not gorgeous, who 
drops out of high school -- and becomes the (alleged) madam to the stars. 
Anyone could do this -- you or your daughter or your neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have studied the news media in other cultures suggest that if, say, 
a woman cut off her husband's penis in almost any other country, the case would 
be perceived -- and covered -- as bizarre, inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, Glassner says, a Lorena Bobbitt would be covered as a "super freak, 
completely off the charts of human behavior." But news media coverage in this 
country has reflected the prevailing sense here that "this could be you, this 
could happen to you," Glassner says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is more fundamental to the American mythology than the concept that 
anyone can be anything," Glassner says. 
</P>
<P>
 You can grow up to be President of the United States . . . or you can grow up 
and get your penis chopped off. 
</P>
<P>
 As Maury Povich, the syndicated talk show host, said in an interview, "Every 
man's hand goes to his crotch" at the mere mention of what Lorena Bobbitt did. 
Narda Zacchino, associate editor of the Los Angeles Times, says that the 
Bobbitt case triggered a "moment of recognition" for many women -- " 'Click . . 
. I have been there; I would love to have done this in my fantasy. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Pat Oliphant's nationally syndicated cartoon on the Lorena Bobbitt jury, 
published in the Los Angeles Times last month, showed all the women grinning 
and all the men covering their groins. The case touched such a vital nerve in 
this country that the New Yorker ran three cartoons on it in one issue last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to the Bobbitt phenomenon than the Everyman and Everywoman 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no coincidence that the common thread connecting most of the major 
personality stories in this country in recent years involve sex: the Bobbitts, 
Fleiss, Michael Jackson, Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuocco, Erik and Lyle 
Menendez, even Bill Clinton and Gary Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Puritans who founded the United States and the Victorians who strongly 
influenced its mores a century later left an enduring legacy; Americans seem 
more uncomfortable talking about sex and, paradoxically, more voyeuristically 
interested in it than are people of many other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But sexual inhibitions have diminished in recent decades, and editors and news 
directors are uncertain about what is and isn't appropriate to print and 
broadcast. We're more open about sex -- some of us, sometimes -- but we're 
still not sure where to draw the line. Condom ads on television? Photos of full 
frontal nudity? Details of rape and sexual mutilation cases? 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the so-called legitimate news media . . . run things that they 
wouldn't have run years ago just because peoples' standards have changed and 
the level of acceptability is different than it was in 1955," says Peter 
Prichard, editor of USA Today. "It's far more acceptable to talk about things 
that people didn't talk about before." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years ago, Prichard says, the Bobbitt case probably wouldn't have been 
covered in the media because it would have been perceived as distasteful. The 
mere mention of the word penis was uncommon, in the media and in polite society 
alike. But today, says Matthew Storin, editor of the Boston Globe, "you've got 
vaginas (and) penises left and right." 
</P>
<P>
 USA Today has put the Bobbitts on Page 1 six times. After her acquittal, 
Lorena Bobbitt, having been interviewed on both "20/20" and "Good Morning, 
America," is said to have received three movie offers -- and requests for 
interviews from 105 news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The transmogrification of the Bobbitts, from unhappy -- and unknown -- couple 
to nationwide pseudo-celebrities, the butt of jokes in newspaper columns and on 
late-night talk shows and T-shirts, may derive in part from the rise of 
feminism. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Jennings, anchor of ABC'S "World News Tonight," thinks American 
feminists used the Bobbitt case to "advance their own agenda." The news media 
helped out by using the "sociological twist" of feminism to justify their 
interest "so we are not just seen to be prurient," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 That "solemn kind of . . . 'Let's make a universal issue out of it (approach)' 
would not have been done in France or in Italy," says Jordan Bonfonte, Time 
magazine bureau chief in Los Angeles and former chief of the magazine's bureaus 
in Paris and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not an uncommon tack for the American media on inherently 
sensational stories, and Zacchino agrees that the Bobbitt case has had "the 
resonance that it has today . . . because of the influence of the feminist 
movement." Like many women, she thinks the issues of rape and wife beating had 
long been neglected in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bobbitt case "took on much greater proportions than just a story of a 
woman who had mutilated her husband," Zacchino says. The case came to represent 
"all oppressed women in marriages where their husbands were abusive to them and 
. . . this fantasy of women to get even with these men." Page 1 Coverage 
</P>
<P>
 When Lorena Bobbitt cut off her husband's penis, the story and their trials 
made Page 1 news throughout the country. One reason: Sexual matters that were 
once taboo are now openly discussed. Another: Longstanding complaints about 
rape and wife-beating gave the story special resonance, especially in the 
United States.

 A 20-year-veteran of the Santa Ana Police Department was shot in the hand and 
arm Wednesday while responding to reports of shots being fired near El Salvador 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested four people, including a 15-year-old youth who surrendered a 
gun and who police believe fired the shots.

 Lt. Robert Chavez, 45, was reported in good condition at Western Medical 
Center, where he was to undergo surgery to remove bone fragments, said Santa 
Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton. Helton said the shooting was the department's 
first in about six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a life-threatening injury," Helton said. "He's in good condition." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four people held in the incident, Helton said, only the 15-year-old is 
expected to be charged.

GUNS STOLEN FROM ROBERTI RECALL LEADER'S HOME; POLITICS: WILLIAM A. DOMINGUEZ 
CALLS THE BREAK-IN SUSPICIOUS. THE STATE SENATOR'S STAFF CITES HIS FIREARMS AS 
PROOF OF THE MOVEMENT'S HIDDEN AGENDA.

 An outspoken gun-control opponent who heads the recall effort against state 
Sen. David A. Roberti has reported the theft of $12,500 worth of guns from his 
Van Nuys apartment -- an incident that both sides in the recall campaign 
brought into the political arena Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 William A. Dominguez, who is also a candidate to replace Roberti in the recall 
election, reported the burglary to police Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Wednesday, Dominguez said 15 guns were taken in a burglary the 
day before, including at least three semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez denied that any of the weapons are illegal or are assault weapons of 
the type banned by a landmark 1989 law authored by Roberti, a Van Nuys 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti has contended that the recall is the work of gun enthusiasts seeking 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez called the break-in suspicious because of his involvement in the 
recall movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really makes me a little nervous," he said. "I'm not a paranoid type, but 
I actually have a feeling it was politically motivated. I'm sure Roberti will 
try to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Roberti's political staff was gloating over the situation, contending 
that the revelation that Dominguez owned so many firearms should discredit the 
recall leadership's claim that they are not agents of gun enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This person is obviously an avid gun collector with an arsenal," said Staci 
Walters, Roberti's campaign press secretary. "The recall proponents say they 
are just good-government activists, but these people are not being truthful. . 
. . It's just a smoke screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters also said the senator was concerned that the stolen weapons might be 
used to commit crimes. She called Dominguez's suggestions that the break-in 
might have been politically motivated "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez, 43, is a systems analyst with Transamerica Insurance Group. The 
Cuban native said he fled his homeland in the early 1960s because he was in 
trouble with the regime of Fidel Castro as a result of his father's political 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez is the leader of the Coalition to Restore Government Integrity, an 
umbrella organization for a number of groups -- some of which are financed by 
gun interests -- that has forced Roberti into a recall election April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez denied that his weapons collection constituted an arsenal, saying: 
"I like antique and collector guns, and I like to shoot. These are not cheap 
guns." 
</P>
<P>
 In the robbery, seven rifles, including three semiautomatics -- among them two 
Chinese-made SKS carbines -- four pistols and four shotguns were stolen, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the pistols was a World War I-vintage Luger worth $1,800, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Richard Blankenship, chief of detectives of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Van Nuys Division, said Dominguez did not have the serial numbers 
of the guns readily available to match against purchase records of pistols 
bought from gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not uncommon," Blankenship said. "We would hope the victim has those 
serial numbers someplace and that we will be able to obtain them, so we can put 
those weapons in the stolen-firearms system and we can greatly increase the 
chance of recovering those weapons down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez said he kept the weapons in a gun safe, which he also reported 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a protection against a casual burglar, not against a professional," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the burglar or burglars pried open a front sliding-glass door. "We 
have some neighbors that saw some things that may or may not lead to suspects," 
Blankenship said. "Obviously, with the dollar amount, there will be a 
follow-up."

BOMBING SUSPECT WAS DUPED, LAWYER SAYS; TERRORISM: DEFENSE CONTENDS IN CLOSING 
ARGUMENTS THAT KEY DEFENDANT IN TRADE CENTER BLAST WAS MANIPULATED BY A 
FUGITIVE IRAQI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A defense lawyer Wednesday described Mohammed A. Salameh, the principal 
defendant in the World Trade Center bombing case, as "a struggling immigrant" 
who was involved only because he was duped by a professional terrorist who fled 
the country hours after the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Robert E. Precht, making the first closing argument for the defense, 
told jurors that the architect of the bombing was Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, an Iraqi 
who has been charged as a fugitive but cannot be found by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Precht claimed that Salameh "was terribly manipulated by Yousef, an evil, 
devious genius who had an Iraqi passport and the wherewithal to conduct a 
terrorist operation on U.S. soil." The explosion in a parking garage below 
street level last Feb. 26 killed six people and injured more than 1,000. It 
closed the trade center for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the other three defendants, who like Salameh are Muslim 
fundamentalists, will make closing statements before U.S. District Judge Kevin 
T. Duffy gives the case to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors have insisted that Salameh and another defendant, Nidal 
Ayyad, a chemical engineer, paid for the purchase of explosives from a joint 
bank account in New Jersey and that Salameh rented and drove a yellow van that 
carried their homemade bomb into the trade center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Precht painted a far different picture, saying that Salameh had very 
little money. Yousef, on the other hand, flew in from Pakistan on a first-class 
ticket and had his own access "to sources of money in this country and abroad," 
Precht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without giving specifics on the funding, the defense lawyer told jurors: "Had 
Ramzi Yousef's activities been traced back to Iraq, not only Yousef but Iraq 
would be the suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities said last year that they had been unable to determine the 
source of financing from abroad. They said that at least $8,500 -- and perhaps 
10 times that much -- had been wired to Salameh and Ayyad from Germany, which 
has a large Arab population, but could not trace the funds further. 
</P>
<P>
 During 18 weeks of trial testimony, the government did not attempt to pinpoint 
how the funds came to Salameh and Ayyad, and the two men did not call any 
witnesses. Defense attorneys said only that the pair had tried to start a small 
business together. 
</P>
<P>
 Precht said that Salameh had come to the United States from the Middle East in 
1988 and worked in a variety of part-time jobs "to stay here by hook or by 
crook. He would not have taken part in a conspiracy to blow up buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 But Yousef, after arriving in September, 1992, on the same flight as Ahmad 
Ajaj, another of the four defendants on trial, "latched onto Salameh," the 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salameh was doing dirty work for another individual (Yousef), who did not 
tell him the full story," Precht said. "He did not know his acts were intended 
to further a conspiracy to destroy buildings in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Precht acknowledged that Salameh rented the van used in the blast. But he 
insisted that Salameh did not drive the vehicle the day of the explosion. "He 
rented it in his own name," the lawyer said. "He had nothing to hide. He was 
innocent of any knowledge of how it was going to be used."

MISSOURI TOWN GETS $5.5 MILLION FOR LEVEE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ste. Genevieve, the historic Missouri town that gained national attention when 
volunteers fought to save its French Colonial homes from last summer's 
flooding, received a $5.5-million federal grant Wednesday to build a new river 
levee. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant covers half of the state and local matching funds required to build 
the flood-control levee. The federal government is paying 75% of the tab, 
estimated to be about $44 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The town of 4,600 people is about 60 miles south of St. Louis.

LESBIAN APPEALS RULING BASING CHILD CUSTODY ON SEX PREFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawyer for a lesbian who lost custody of her 2-year-old son pleaded 
Wednesday with the Virginia Court of Appeals to scrap what he contended was an 
outdated state Supreme Court precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 "To take a category of people and say they don't get to keep their own 
children, that's not what the law of this state is about," said Donald K. 
Butler, the attorney for Sharon Bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
 But a lawyer for Kay Bottoms, Sharon' mother, who was awarded custody of the 
child on Sept. 7, said the 1985 state Supreme Court ruling made it clear that 
children should not be raised by a homosexual parent. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling held that a lesbian "is an unfit parent if she exhibits hugging, 
kissing, pats on the bottom and sleeping in the same bed" with her partner, 
lawyer Richard Ryder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Bottoms, 23, said after the hearing that her son has never seen her 
have any sexual contact with her live-in partner, April Wade. She said in 
September that she and Wade had hugged and kissed in front of the child. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court did not immediately rule in the custody case. A ruling is 
expected within six months, but "no matter how it comes out, this is going to 
the Virginia Supreme Court," Ryder predicted before the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 A circuit judge relied heavily on the 1985 state Supreme Court ruling when he 
awarded custody of Tyler Doustou to Kay Bottoms. The judge gave Sharon Bottoms 
visitation rights, but not in her home and not in Wade's presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said sociological studies since the 1985 state Supreme Court ruling 
have shown that children living with openly gay parents are not adversely 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it comes down to is . . . whether the new evidence about sociological 
impact would be enough to persuade the court to overrule" the 1985 decision, 
Butler said.

INS PLANS $130 FEE FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM APPLICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inundated with applications from political asylum seekers, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service intends to impose an unprecedented $130 fee on 
applicants and to delay their eligibility for work permits. 
</P>
<P>
 An INS official said Wednesday that the money from the fee would allow the 
agency to double the 150 agents assigned to processing the claims, which are 
flowing into INS offices at the rate of 10,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also hopes that the fee, coupled with a 150-day delay in the 
issuance of work permits, would discourage some applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed regulation changes, approved by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, also 
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget -- expected in 
about two weeks -- and are subject to a 60-day public comment period before 
they can be put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS official, who asked not to be identified, said the proposal has 
sparked considerable debate within the Clinton Administration because it 
represents a stark departure from past practices and from the procedures in 
other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 No other country charges a fee to political asylum seekers and the United 
States has never before levied one. 
</P>
<P>
 But the INS official said a backlog of more than 350,000 applications has left 
little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has come down to the reality of getting the additional money for stepping 
up the asylum process or risk never gaining control of the system," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the application backlog, legitimate asylum seekers cannot get their 
cases adjudicated quickly, while others whose claims ultimately would be denied 
are able to enter the country on a temporary basis, obtain work permits and 
remain for long periods of time before they are located and deported. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States grants political asylum to victims of persecution or people 
with a legitimate fear of persecution on political, religious or racial 
grounds. Typically, work permits are issued to applicants while their cases are 
under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the agency approved slightly more than 5,000 applications while 
denying about 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials said people who could not afford the fee would not necessarily 
be denied entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would have to be some sort of provision to consider people who don't 
have the fee," he said. "You can't expect everyone on a boat from Haiti to have 
$130 with them."

REPLAY OF 911 CALL OPENS CULT DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense lawyers played a recording Wednesday of a Branch Davidian's frantic 
plea to "call it off" as a deadly shootout erupted with federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 75 men around our building and they're shooting at us at 
Mt.Carmel," said Wayne Martin, a top lieutenant to cult leader David Koresh. 
"Tell them there's children and women in here and to call it off." 
</P>
<P>
 More than once during the 911 call, Martin referred to the gun battle as an 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're attacking us again! They're attacking!" he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour of the call was played for jurors in the federal trial of 11 Branch 
Davidians accused of murder and conspiracy to murder four Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms agents who died in the shootout on Feb. 28, 1993. Six cult 
members also died. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootout at the Davidians' Waco, Tex., compound began a 51-day standoff 
between the group and federal authorities. It ended with an April 19 fire that 
destroyed the compound. Koresh and 78 of his followers died during that blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers, who opened their case Wednesday after 24 days of testimony 
from more than 120 prosecution witnesses, contend that Martin's phone call 
bolsters their position that the Davidians were trying to protect themselves 
during the gun battle.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DISTRICT SLOWLY GETTING BACK TO BUSINESS; 
AFTERMATH: BURBANK'S OLD MAGNOLIA PARK AREA -- WHERE THE TRADITIONAL AND THE 
HIP MEET -- WAS HIT HARD. SOME STORES HAVE REOPENED; OTHERS HAVEN'T BEEN SO 
LUCKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Behind the boarded-up windows and the doors that don't close quite as easily 
as they did before, a hardy bunch of merchants in Magnolia Park are back in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 In this city -- home to three major studios -- Magnolia Park looks like the 
set for some apocalyptic "morning-after" movie. Plywood still covers display 
windows shattered during the Jan. 17 earthquake, giving some shops on Magnolia 
Boulevard an abandoned look. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumers, take note: These stores are open and ready for business -- at 
least some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were only closed a day and a half," said Rob Veres, owner of Burbank Coins 
& Sports Cards, which has seen about a 50% decline in business since the quake. 
"It's amazing we're doing any business at all, the way my storefront looks. It 
looks like we're closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Other businesses were not so lucky. Some are still in limbo, haggling with 
insurance companies and waiting for loans. Others have had to find new 
quarters. In all, 14 structures are uninhabitable and 58 have been opened only 
to limited access in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were forced to relocate," said Dr. Fred Dubick of Burbank Optometry Group, 
which moved two miles away to West Olive Avenue after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank suffered considerably less damage than many other areas of the Valley, 
but the old Magnolia Park district was hit hard. Some buildings, like Dubick's, 
were made of unreinforced masonry, which is susceptible to quake damage. The 
area includes a historic commercial district where the traditional and the hip 
meet: Mom-and-pop-type thrift stores sit next to vintage clothing boutiques. 
There are health spas and sports card trading shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have reopened say much has changed since Jan. 17. Once-familiar 
faces are no longer around and business is painfully slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not used to it being this way," said Pat Taylor, owner of Hubba Hubba 
Vintage Clothes on Magnolia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting behind her store counter, beneath framed photographs of James Dean and 
Marilyn Monroe, Taylor talked about life on Magnolia before and after the 
quake: The wardrobe artists and eclectic crowd that filled her store on 
weekends, browsing through racks of 1940s' style clothing, and now the long 
days since the quake that have reduced her flow of customers to a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's usually a busy store," she said. "There's a fun kind of energy in my 
store. Those people aren't buying. . . . The only people buying are the ones 
spending other people's money," she said, referring to the studio wardrobe 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the quake, American Way Thrift next door was a lively place too. But 
the quake-damaged store now sits closed, and a handwritten sign says it will 
remain that way "Until Further Notice." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor arrived at her store on the morning of the quake to find her stylishly 
dressed mannequins hanging through the shattered windows. Display cases were 
cracked and costume jewelry was strewn throughout the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like a massacre in here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She cleaned up, replaced her windows and managed to open a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some merchants, money for new windows and time to scout out a good 
deal may not come for a while. Rather than wait, merchants such as Seabrook and 
Ron Ede, who own the vintage clothes store Junk For Joy, opened for business 
four days after the quake -- boarded-up windows and all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make very little money now, but it's OK," Seabrook Ede said. "As long as 
the doors are open and people are still coming in, it's OK. I could have lost 
it all." 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, one can't see the audacious platform shoes or the 
black-velvet chokers topped off with peace-sign medallions, or the '60s wigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ede has managed to compensate for what customers can't see by turning 
the plywood boards into colorful billboards. In bright red, green and yellow, 
they announce a "Shake, Rattle and Roll" 50%-off sale. Money from the sale will 
be used to pay for the new windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have to have boards, they have to look good," Seabrook Ede said. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers have been more supportive since the quake, she said, like the man 
who tried to give her $40 for a belt that cost $12.50. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I'll help you put your windows back in,' " Ede recalled. "It was 
sweet of him, but I can't do it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm losing a lot, but you have to give up something to gain something. People 
are having a good time, getting good stuff. They're helping me and I'm helping 
them. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the quake, Veres at Burbank Coins & Sports Cards had prided himself not 
only on having one of the largest selections, but also on his store's 
organization. Cards were stored in numerical order in boxes -- 3,000 per box -- 
and arranged in a way that made it easy for customers to find exactly what they 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake sent the countless hours of work and organization all tumbling 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost 100,000 cards that were in numbered order hit the floor," Veres said. 
"It was a heck of a 52-card pickup, I tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 After hours of work, the store appears orderly again, but appearances can be 
deceiving. There is still much to do before the store returns to its pre-quake 
state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he's at it, Veres has decided to rebuild the shelves so that they slant 
upward, hopefully making it more difficult for the boxes to be shaken loose the 
next time around. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his trouble, Veres knows that many of his regular customers fared far 
worse. It may be some time before they begin thinking about sports cards or 
collector coins again, Veres said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a lot more important things on their minds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So does Connie Soethout of It's a Zoo, a Magnolia Boulevard store that 
specializes in "every possible stuffed animal you can imagine, from armadillos 
to zebras." 
</P>
<P>
 She and a partner are waiting to find out if the building owner's insurance 
company will give them the go-ahead to reopen their business -- one that had 
hit a rough spot even before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy was not good," Soethout said. "So we didn't need this quake." 
</P>
<P>
 For some merchants, the quake had a ring of familiarity. In 1985, Dubick's 
optometry office and a nearby deli burned down, forcing him to quickly 
relocate. After 11 months the original building was rebuilt and he returned. 
But now the Northridge quake has left the new building with extensive exterior 
damage -- forcing him to flee again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, nine years later, it's like, been there, done that," he said. "I didn't 
panic. I said, 'This is what we have to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after the building was red-tagged by the city, he reopened at a new 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia Park merchants are hoping they'll all be able to do the same. After 
all the frustration and prayers and consoling of one another, they're hoping 
the street will one day regain its lively enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to build this up again," Seabrook Ede said with characteristic 
optimism. "It's coming back!"

ALTERNATIVE OFFERED TO LINK MCA, METRO RAIL; TRANSIT: THE PLAN WOULD PRESERVE 
THE LANKERSHIM SITE FOR A SUBWAY STATION, BUT WOULD INCLUDE ACCESS TO UNIVERSAL 
STUDIOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City transit officials have proposed a compromise for the Universal City Metro 
Rail station that would preserve the planned Lankershim Boulevard site but 
better serve the MCA entertainment complex, potentially satisfying key demands 
by both the multimedia company and county transportation planners. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA has pushed hard to relocate the subway station to the doorstep of its 
Universal Studios and CityWalk complex -- a proposal resisted by county 
transportation planners as too costly and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 But city analysts now say in a report that the new Red Line station could 
remain on Lankershim but should include an entrance on the Universal Studios 
lot up the hill, with some kind of shuttle service between the portal and the 
station proper. Access to the entertainment center would therefore improve 
without the added delays and costs of moving the station directly onto the 
Universal Studios lot, as MCA has lobbied for. 
</P>
<P>
 Both MCA executives and officials of the county Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority said Wednesday that the proposal appears workable, fueling hope that 
the long-running disagreement between MCA and the transit agency over station 
location could be near an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking a very hard look at it. It looks very doable," transit 
authority analyst Judith Wilson said of the report issue last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is probably an 80-to-90% solution," MCA spokeswoman Christine 
Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not perfect -- there are still problems that need to be worked out," MCA 
Development President Larry Spungin said. "But it's a way to get beyond" the 
issues that have bedeviled talks between MCA and the transportation authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few months, MCA has recommended moving the station to its 
property half a mile southeast of the Lankershim site, underneath the Hollywood 
Freeway near Cahuenga Boulevard. The entertainment giant contends that 
ridership of people headed to Universal Studios and the company's CityWalk 
attraction would increase. 
</P>
<P>
 But county transit officials estimated that such a change would carry a 
$41-million price tag and postpone the station's scheduled July, 2000, opening 
by nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the added costs and time would spring from having to buy new land and 
realign tunnels extending the Red Line from Hollywood to Universal City through 
the Cahuenga Pass. The city compromise plan, by keeping the original site, 
would eliminate that need. 
</P>
<P>
 The blueprint calls for the subway station to empty onto the east as well as 
west side of Lankershim so that passengers can hop onto a shuttle system -- 
perhaps a monorail -- up to Universal Studios. Such a system could cost up to 
$20 million, said James M. Okazaki, chief of city transit programs and author 
of the compromise, but MCA would be expected to help defray the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also suggests roadway improvements around Lankershim that would help 
relieve heavy congestion in the area and improve car access to the Hollywood 
Freeway and the Universal Studios lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said her office has already incorporated most of the traffic proposals 
into the current project and that the improvements can be made within its 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her staff is working hard to develop a recommendation on the 
compromise plan as quickly as possible to avoid further delaying construction, 
which was to have begun last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials voted to give MCA until March to come up with a funding plan 
for moving the station onto its lot -- a delay that would cost the 
cash-strapped transportation authority $500,000. MCA executives told the 
authority last week that federal funds might be available, but county officials 
insisted that such funds not be sought if they were originally earmarked for 
earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Okazaki said the city transportation department decided to step into the fray 
and offer an alternative plan when it saw that the impasse between MCA and the 
county agency continued to drag on. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a debate going on, and I just wanted to offer it . . . (as) a 
compromise between the two superpowers, the MCA and the MTA," Okazaki said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; GORE VOWS GOVERNMENT WILL HELP REBUILD CSUN; 
EDUCATION: THE VICE PRESIDENT MAKES NO SPECIFIC COMMITMENT. HE PRAISES CAMPUS' 
QUICK REBOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Aiming to highlight the region's recovery from the earthquake, Vice President 
Al Gore on Wednesday told a crowd of several thousand people at recently 
reopened Cal State Northridge that the federal government will "go all out" to 
assist in restoring the heavily damaged campus. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson said Gore's 35-minute visit, coupled with a 
telephone call Monday from President Clinton, has convinced her that the 
federal government will do its share for the campus, which sustained an 
estimated $250 million to $350 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want you to know that while no one can make everyone whole as a result of 
what happened here, we certainly can go all out to do everything humanly 
possible to do what can be done," the vice president said. Gore, however, made 
no specific commitments of federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said Gore added the CSUN visit to his previously planned trip to 
Washington state at Clinton's request. They said he picked CSUN because of the 
magnitude of its damage and because the campus managed to reopen Monday for the 
spring semester only two weeks late. 
</P>
<P>
 "This college has been hit harder than any college ever in history. And yet 
you have bounced back faster and more completely than anyone," Gore said, 
standing amid some of the hundreds of portable buildings that have become the 
classrooms since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's damage has been called the costliest ever for a U.S. university, with 
virtually every major classroom building on the campus at least temporarily put 
out of use.  
</P>
<P>
 The visit was the latest in a series of gestures by Clinton Administration 
officials designed to convince Southern Californians -- whether victims of the 
earthquake or last year's fires -- that the federal government will fulfill its 
disaster response obligations. The state, because of its large population, is 
politically important to the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials are counting on the federal government to pay 90% of their 
recovery costs, including, for example, the nearly $6 million in rental costs 
for the portable classrooms this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus on Wednesday continued its slow progress toward getting all of the 
several hundred portable classrooms up and running, although some classes still 
were held outside with students sitting under the sun on folding chairs. 
Officials said they were rushing to beat the heavy rain expected to hit the 
region today. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Gore visited the Devonshire Mason Plaza shopping center in 
Chatsworth, where all the major stores and some of the smaller ones were forced 
to close because of earthquake damage. The vice president chatted with the 
owners of about a half-dozen stores, posed for pictures with them and signed 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Magid, manager of the 118,000-square-foot complex owned by his parents, 
said he agreed to host the crowds of state and federal officials and news crews 
that accompanied Gore out of hope the visit would produce some aid. "I want the 
government to service my tenants. Talk is cheap. We'll see what happens in two 
weeks or a month from now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Rodriguez, owner of the Pacific Aquatics West tropical fish store that 
Gore visited first, said his shop has been closed since the earthquake while he 
awaits word on a requested federal Small Business Administration loan. Without 
it, Rodriguez, who had no earthquake insurance, said he won't be able to 
reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, he said, nothing tangible has happened.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; QUAKE LEAVES CENTER WITH NEW CONCERNS 
</P>

<P>
 Family crises don't take a break because of an earthquake. If anything, the 
stress of the disaster can make them worse. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Jan. 17 Northridge temblor badly damaged the Pacoima headquarters 
of El Nido Family Centers, counselors took to their cars and used cellular 
phones in an attempt to stay in touch with more than 400 new parents, troubled 
youth, pregnant teen-agers and crisis-ridden families. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 50 clients, however, simply dropped out of touch, according to 
Patricia Cervantes, adolescent and family life coordinator for El Nido, which 
has served Los Angeles families since 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have, unfortunately, some clients who are completely lost, and we 
don't know where they are," she said. The Pacoima office has relocated to 
donated space in the United Way building at 6851 Lennox St. in Van Nuys, but 
hopes to be able to move back to its repaired building within a few weeks, 
according to Fritzie Davis, El Nido's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated at Van Nuys Boulevard and Dronfield Avenue for more than five years, 
El Nido's Pacoima office has been a prominent landmark for low-income families, 
many of them recent immigrants trying to cope with harsh economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten a little more hectic to get here," Cervantes said. "I know for 
some, they're reluctant to come here because the building is not familiar." 
</P>
<P>
 Landlord Joseph Kashani said Wednesday he expects to complete most repairs to 
the Pacoima building by week's end, but is unsure when he will obtain final 
inspections and approvals from city officials. Davis said she believes El Nido 
will be able to move back in two weeks to a month. 
</P>
<P>
 El Nido has a tape-recorded message on its Pacoima telephone line, directing 
clients to the Van Nuys site or to other areas where some programs have been 
relocated -- such as the Pacoima Community Youth Culture Center at Glenoaks and 
Van Nuys boulevards, and the Vaughn Family Center on Vaughn Street, Cervantes 
said. GEOFFREY MOHAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; MISSION COLLEGE HONORS BLACK HISTORY MONTH

 A musician played Beethoven's Fifth Symphony on the steel drums. Orange and 
black kente cloth decorated the main stage of the conference center.And 
balloons in the African colors of red, black and green lent a festive air to 
Wednesday's Black History Month celebration at Mission College in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 people attended the event, which also featured a rap performance, a 
keynote address on African American music, a poetry reading and a rendition of 
the black national anthem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, coordinated by the Black Students Union and the campus Associated 
Students office, was designed to mark Black History Month, boost African 
American pride and educate people about black culture and history. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest crowd pleaser was clearly the synchronized-dance drill team from 
the Boys & Girls Club of Pacoima. Dancers aged 6 to 18 made the floor throb as 
they pumped and shimmied to the hip-hop. The dancers' energy rippled through 
the audience, which cheered and clapped in time to the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in attendance nibbled on smoked chicken, rice, beans and salad and 
browsed at tables of African-inspired jewelry, purses and scarves and racks of 
African-print clothing and padded coats. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructors mingled with students, and parents tended small children. 
"Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves," said Angela Marcus, president of the 
Black Students Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always want Black History Month to be recognized on this campus," she 
added. "That's a must for us." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the unity," said Michael D. Smith, a business student.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect this from this college because it's so new and so small. The 
black population is bigger than I thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers called the show a success, although attendance was down from last 
year's event. KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ACLU JOINS PROTEST OF SEX ED POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of an abruptly canceled AIDS awareness play at Hoover High School, 
the American Civil Liberties Union has joined several parents in challenging 
the Glendale school district's sex education policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan L. Friel, an ACLU staff attorney, appeared before the Glendale Board of 
Education on Tuesday night to take issue with the policy and the district's 
cancellation last week of "Secrets," a play produced by the Oakland-based 
Kaiser Permanente hospital care organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school board's family life policy as it applies here presents some 
serious constitutional problems," Friel told the five-member board. "You cannot 
regulate the content at all of what the play wishes to express." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ACLU has not filed a lawsuit formally challenging the policy, 
Friel joined some parents and students in urging the board to allow the AIDS 
education drama to be brought back to the campus before the end of the school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the board nor district Supt. Robert A. Sanchis responded to the 
request.  
</P>
<P>
 Board President Jane Whitaker said after the meeting that it's customary for 
the board to refrain from commenting on issues until after it consults with its 
legal staff and hears from others in the community. "I would not attempt to 
answer questions or to do anything until I felt there had been some type of 
adequate period of time for public (input)," Whitaker said. "When it's 
appropriate, I'm sure we will be looking at this." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have said that they closed the curtains on "Secrets" Feb. 7 
-- the day before its scheduled performance -- because it discusses condoms as 
a way to help prevent AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
 The district's policy focuses on abstinence from sex as the only way to avoid 
AIDS, said Gregory Bowman, director of instruction and student services. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friel and Hoover's Parent-Teacher-Student Assn. president noted Tuesday 
night that the 6-year-old sex education policy does not address the term "safe 
sex" and does not prohibit anyone from teaching condoms as an alternative way 
to prevent AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere does this policy statement say we will stress abstinence, or we will 
teach abstinence only," PTSA President Susan Kussman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kussman's daughter, Allegra, a Hoover student, told the board that teen-agers 
should be allowed to choose between learning about the practices of abstinence 
and safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take your heads out of the sand and realize that there are kids at our school 
who are having sex," she said. "What's wrong with learning how to put a condom 
on?" 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 Hoover students and parents appeared at the board meeting in support 
of the "Secrets" play. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-minute production centers on a high school senior, Eddie, and his 
girlfriend, Monica. Eddie learns he has tested positive for the HIV virus, 
while Monica tells her friends that she intends to abstain from having sex with 
her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 A version of the play, seen by an estimated 700,000 students in Southern 
California, will be performed tonight at the Glendale Central Library 
auditorium, said Rick Burke, director of educational theater programs at Kaiser 
Permanente. TOMMY LI

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; METROLINK SHUTTLE SERVICE IS EXPANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shuttle service from Burbank's Metrolink station was expanded Wednesday after 
the Burbank City Council approved $331,000 to pay for additional shuttles and 
new routes needed to accommodate an influx of rail commuters brought on by the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials hope that part of that money will be reimbursed by federal 
earthquake relief agencies. Ridership on the shuttles, previously limited to 
use by companies that are part of a local transportation management 
organization, will be opened to the general public to qualify for the federal 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, shuttle ridership from the Burbank Metrolink station has 
increased by more than 1,000%, from 120 riders a day to as many as 1,450, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Burbank's Media District Transportation Management Organization 
has added five new shuttles -- two with 17-passenger capacities and three with 
44-passenger capacities. The organization now provides the shuttle service to 
employees of member companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council on Tuesday approved $260,000 in funds to help the 
organization expand the service. Of that amount, $150,000 may be reimbursable 
from the federal government. The $260,000 also includes $110,000 to provide a 
necessary local match to a pre-earthquake grant to the organization from the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding has allowed the organization to add three new stops on the route 
between the Metrolink station and the Media District, where many studios are 
located, said Judith Johnston-Weston, Transportation Management Organization 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 New express routes for shuttles from the Metrolink station to the following 
locations were added Wednesday, Johnston-Weston said: the Riverside 
Drive/Alameda Avenue area near Disney Studios, St. Joseph Medical Center and 
Providencia High School; Kenwood Avenue between Alameda Avenue and Buena Vista 
Street, the location of the Burbank Tower office building and the Disney 
Channel Building; and at Hollywood Way and Olive Avenue, where Warner Bros. and 
other companies are located. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council also approved $71,000 for a shuttle to be run by another 
organization, the Burbank City Centre Transportation Management Assn., which 
will work with other employers. That shuttle, when it begins operating, would 
run between the Metrolink station and the Burbank Airport with as many as nine 
stops. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that shuttle service cannot begin until the city signs a contract 
with the Burbank City Centre TMA, said G. William Lundgren, the city's 
transportation administrator. That contract, along with a formal agreement with 
the Media District TMO, is to go before the City Council for approval in a week 
or two, Lundgren said. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: POLICE FOOT PATROLS SET FOR BUSINESS AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers Sunday will begin foot patrols in business areas 
in Sunland-Tujunga, giving police a higher profile and providing more 
protection to this community of 55,000, where residents have long felt 
neglected by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always called ourselves the forgotten stepchild," said Kathy Anthony, a 
local tailor. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, about 75 members of the Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of 
Commerce met with police representatives to set up a business watch program 
that will work in coordination with the new community policing effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders have long complained about the lack of attention that 
Sunland-Tujunga has received, with only one police car permanently assigned to 
the area. In December, the Foothill Division added two more police cars that 
roam through the area but can be pulled off to other assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 The new foot patrols will add two police officers who will walk beats between 
10 a.m. and 3 a.m., said Capt. Gus S. Drulias, who became the Foothill 
Division's commanding officer in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been hiring additional personnel, so I do have a few extra officers 
to deploy around the area," Drulias said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drulias said statistics that show violent crime has been slowly rising in 
Sunland-Tujunga, and the community's isolation from the rest of the city 
prompted him to search for ways to heighten the police presence there. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before that, officers who patrol the Sunland-Tujunga community had 
already taken it upon themselves to get out of their squad cars and into the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of just sitting in my car and waiting for the little red light to 
go on," said Officer Ernst Cabriales, who recently met with about 65 business 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so nice to see an officer and be able to say, 'Hi Ernst,' " said 
Anthony, a 36-year resident, who added that the question among business owners 
is "Have you met Ernst yet?" 
</P>
<P>
 As a police officer, Cabriales said he can do a better job of handling his 
many routine calls if he also is working toward long-term solutions for such 
problems as panhandlers who may be harassing people at a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The black-and-white is in a void, and there is no human interaction," said 
Cabriales, who has been patrolling Sunland-Tujunga for about a year. Although 
he will still be officially designated as being in a patrol car, Cabriales will 
join the foot patrol officers in getting to know the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Drulias said the new community patrols were originally scheduled to start last 
month, but were delayed by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; AID CENTER FOR ASIANS LIFTS THE BARRIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michelle T. Tran lost her job when the Chatsworth beauty salon where she 
worked was devastated by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 With only the income from her husband, a computer technician, the Tran family 
was not able to make rent on their Reseda home this month. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman of limited English skills, Tran said she learned about government aid 
for earthquake victims a few days ago from a Vietnamese-language flyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyer directed her to a federal disaster aid center established Sunday to 
help Asian American earthquake victims at the Chinese Christian Alliance Church 
in Northridge. The temporary center closed Tuesday night after helping about 
150 applicants, most of them Vietnamese and Chinese, according to center 
Manager Virginia Asbelle. 
</P>
<P>
 People who came to the site were matched with an interpreter who accompanied 
them through the entire process of applying for assistance. Interpreters were 
available for a wide array of Asian languages, including Vietnamese, Mandarin, 
Cantonese, Taiwanese, Tagalog and Korean. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to FEMA grants, earthquake victims were able to apply for 
individual family grants -- to replace lost personal property -- and Small 
Business Administration disaster loans at the center. Aid officials also gave 
people a list of telephone numbers they could call for other types of aid, such 
as legal services or contractor licensing information. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very nice if they bring Vietnamese people here to work for us," said 
Tran, who sat at a table waiting for an interpreter. "I (feel) more easy." Her 
two daughters, ages 10 and 13, sat nearby, drawing pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Asian immigrants have been reluctant to seek help at other disaster 
centers because of the language barrier, their unfamiliarity with the American 
system and a cultural aversion to seeking outside help, church and community 
officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason why it has been difficult to estimate the total number of 
Asian Americans affected by the quake, said Hiroshi Yamaguchi, vice chairman of 
the Asian Pacific Islander Council of the San Fernando Valley, one of the 
groups that helped to establish the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard to identify people because they are being helped by their 
relatives," Yamaguchi said. "They don't come out on their own. That's a 
cultural trait. Self-help is their cultural training." KAY HWANGBO

DEFENDANT BRAGGED OF '89 SLAYING, JURORS TOLD; CRIME: RONALD BOSCAINO AND 
BROTHER VINCENT FACE THE DEATH PENALTY IF CONVICTED OF KILLING A NORTH HILLS 
MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ronald Boscaino bragged to friends about abducting, robbing and killing a 
North Hills man, saying the crime "doesn't matter because I'm going to hell 
anyway," prosecutors told jurors Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Boscaino and his brother, Vincent, face the death penalty if convicted of the 
1989 slaying of Sheldon Oppenheim in his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan D. Chasworth accused the brothers of committing "a 
senseless, rather cold-blooded, execution-style murder" when they tried to 
strangle Oppenheim, then beat him, and finally pumped one round from a stolen 
handgun into the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Boscainos' lawyers said the entire case is based solely on 
the statements of Troy Simons, an accomplice who admitted his role in 
Oppenheim's killing but who was allowed to plead guilty to a simple robbery 
charge and will be released from custody once he testifies. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspected of being the man who actually shot Oppenheim, Ronald Boscaino, 32, 
faces 13 charges, including the kidnaping of two other people during a two-week 
crime spree in the fall of 1989. His brother Vincent, 27, faces nine felony 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chasworth said the brothers drove from Tennessee to California with two 
friends at the end of August, 1989, renting a room in a Studio City motel. 
Oppenheim was abducted during the early morning hours of Sept. 24, 1989, as he 
left a bar next door, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four forced Oppenheim to withdraw $300 from an automated teller machine, 
she said, and drove the victim to his residence, where "they tied him up with 
duct tape and laid him face down on the floor of his living room." 
</P>
<P>
 After ransacking the apartment and loading the loot into Oppenheim's own car, 
the Boscainos, Simons and another man known only as "Kevin" then decided they 
had to kill the only witness to the crime, according to Chasworth. 
</P>
<P>
 After trying to strangle Oppenheim, they beat him on the head with his own 
tennis rackets, she said. An autopsy, according to Chasworth, revealed these 
blows "would likely have caused his death." 
</P>
<P>
 But to make sure he was dead, Ronald Boscaino placed a .25-caliber handgun to 
the back of Oppenheim's head and fired one bullet while "holding a pillow over 
the gun in order to muffle it," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Oppenheim's slaying, the Boscainos are charged with 
burglarizing a Sherman Oaks home and stealing a gun that was used in 
Oppenheim's killing the next day. Both men are also charged with abducting 
Kenneth Fromberg in Woodland Hills on Oct. 8 and forcing him to drive them to 
Las Vegas, where they pushed him out of his car along Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Boscaino is also charged with the Oct. 4 kidnaping of Tory Christopher, 
who was abducted in the parking lot of the same bar where Oppenheim was 
kidnaped. Chasworth said Boscaino later put a handgun into Christopher's mouth 
and pulled the trigger, but he could not figure out how to release the safety 
catch on the gun. Christopher was able to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boscainos and Simons were arrested about six months after the slaying. 
Authorities were led to the brothers after "they actually laughed and bragged 
about what they did," and two men reported the statements to police, Chasworth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Troy Simons lied to avoid the gas chamber," said Robert Fefferman, the 
attorney representing Ronald Boscaino. "That's why Ronald Boscaino had the 
finger pointed at him." 
</P>
<P>
 Chasworth called Simons a criminal and a murderer, but she said his statements 
are corroborated by physical evidence.

DISCOUNTED DWP RATES OFFERED TO FIRMS THAT REBUILD IN AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owners of businesses that were severely damaged in the Northridge earthquake 
may qualify for discounted rates for water and power services if they rebuild 
within a year, the Los Angeles City Council decided Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the resolution proposed by Councilman John Ferraro, business owners who 
rebuild by Jan. 17, 1995, within 10 blocks of their previous site can get a 25% 
discount on Department of Water and Power services for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution was designed to give businesses an incentive to rebuild and 
stay in the city. The discounted rates were originally conceived after the 1992 
riots, but so far, fewer than 60 businesses have taken advantage of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake damaged more than 4,000 commercial buildings in the city of Los 
Angeles, including about 1,500 that require substantial repairs before they can 
be occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 A DWP spokesman estimated that the discounted rates will reduce the 
department's revenue by about $2 million annually. But he added that the loss 
would be recovered by slight increases in the bills of other DWP customers. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, businesses must either have been destroyed or rendered unusable. 
In addition, the business must be rebuilt to at least 80% of its former size. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested business owners should apply for the rates with the city's 
Community Development Department.

DEFENDANT KILLED GUARD, EYEWITNESS TELLS COURT; CRIME: THE HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE 
SAYS HE WAS STANDING FIVE FEET AWAY WHEN SEAN DARNELL SLADE SHOT THE VICTIM 
DURING A ROBBERY.

<P>
 Wrapping up their case, prosecutors called the only eyewitness who could 
identify prison parolee Sean Darnell Slade as the man who killed an armored car 
guard during a robbery of a Home Depot store. 
</P>
<P>
 The Home Depot employee testified that Slade, 27, ran up behind Edwin (Eddie) 
Maldonado during a July 20, 1992, robbery that netted $82,000 and fired one 
shot from a 9-millimeter handgun without any warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure that's the man," the witness testified during Slade's 
special-circumstance murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness, now 27, said he was standing only five feet away when the gunman 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado, 26, had emptied the vault at the Foothill Boulevard store and was 
taking a bag of cash and checks to his Sectran Security Transportation truck 
when he was gunned down. Maldonado apparently heard the gunman approaching, but 
he had only started to turn his head when he was shot, according to the 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Other witnesses have testified that the robber fired two more shots into 
Maldonado's head while he was lying on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors urged reporters not to publish the name of the witness, citing 
possible reprisal from others involved in the robbery who remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 During an earlier court hearing, the man testified after donning a hat and a 
partial disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy cross-examination, defense attorney Bruce Hill repeatedly 
questioned the witness about his initial description of the gunman. The witness 
first told police the robber was 5 foot 9 at the most. Slade stands 6 foot 2. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that he gave the description and that he told police a 
photo of Slade only looked similar to the gunman, the witness repeatedly 
identified Slade as the killer Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't forgotten it (his face) since I first saw it," the man said. "It's 
stayed with me." 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Slade would face the death penalty.

BOMB BLOWS OUT CHURCH WINDOWS; CRIME: MORMON BUILDING IS AGAIN THE TARGET OF 
VIOLENCE. ARSON CAUSED $1 MILLION DAMAGE IN 1990; VANDALS HAVE ALSO BROKEN IN, 
PAINTING SLOGANS.

<P>
 A pipe bomb blew out several windowpanes in a Mormon church before dawn 
Wednesday, but the small explosion caused no injuries and only minor damage, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are investigating whether there is any connection between the bombing 
and several other attacks on the church in recent years, including an arson in 
May, 1990, that caused $1 million in damage to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking into anything that might tie these things together, but at 
this point we don't have any evidence that they are connected," said Sgt. Bob 
Parsons, of the LAPD's criminal conspiracy section, which investigates 
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four years ago, a fire set by vandals -- who also apparently smeared 
feces inside the church -- forced the building to close for 18 months, said 
Paul Walker, a church official. Then, about six months ago, vandals broke into 
the building and spray-painted swastikas and "White Power" slogans inside, 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not made arrests in any of the incidents, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sign of the times," said Walker. "You don't know if it's kids or what, 
but there are some weak minds out there. . . . We just have to watch our 
building." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Myler, a regional representative of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, said the church doesn't feel singled out by this latest 
incident because "from what we understand, a Jewish synagogue and some churches 
in this area have been vandalized in recent years. . . . But we can empathize 
with other religious communities who have been on the receiving end of this 
kind of hatred." 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's incident, an explosion about 4:50 a.m. broke several panes of 
thick glass at the church, which was empty at the time, police said. Upon 
arriving, officers discovered an unexploded portion of the bomb that they 
originally believed was a second pipe bomb, said Sgt. Frank Reynoso of the 
Foothill station. 
</P>
<P>
 As a precaution, several houses and apartments within a block of the church 
were briefly evacuated, Reynoso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormon public high school students, who arrive at the church at about 6 a.m. 
each weekday for an hour of Scripture studies before going to their regular 
schools, were told by phone not to come Wednesday, Myler said.

FUGITIVE IS ARRESTED ON CHILD PORNOGRAPHY CHARGES

 Acting on a tip, police in Joplin, Mo., have arrested a Canyon Country man who 
was on the U.S. Customs Service's 10 most wanted list, on suspicion of 
transporting child pornography from Thailand, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Alan Nelson, 45, was arrested without incident Feb. 4, said Joseph 
Charles, assistant special agent in charge of the Los Angeles customs office. 
Nelson had attempted to conceal his identity by growing a beard, dying his hair 
and carrying false identification, Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson had been a fugitive since June, 1992, when he fled from Los Angeles 
after federal authorities seized "numerous photographs" at his home in the 
20000 block of Keaton Street of Thai boys engaged in sex acts, Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested him the same day on suspicion 
of committing lewd acts with a child under 14, according to a joint statement 
released by local and federal law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 An arrest warrant was issued for Nelson in connection with a 29-count federal 
indictment for child pornography, Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson is suspected of hiring four boys in Bangkok to pose for pictures of sex 
acts with themselves and with Nelson, Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the June, 1992, arrest, Nelson worked as a probation officer at Camp 
Scudder in Saugus, a county youth camp. He was suspended for 30 days after his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe that Nelson was part of an extensive underground network 
that trades, sells and shares photographs and videotapes of minors having sex, 
Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was a joint effort of the U.S. Customs Service, the 
Sheriff's Department and the Royal Thai Police, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson waived extradition and was returned to Los Angeles by U.S. Federal 
Marshals late Friday, Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being held without bail at the federal Metropolitan Corrections Center 
in downtown Los Angeles, Charles said.

YOUTH SHOT WHILE EXAMINING FRIEND'S STOLEN GUN

<P>
 A 15-year-old Palmdale High School student who took a handgun to school 
accidentally shot a classmate Wednesday when the teen-agers left school at 
lunch to look at the weapon, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a 15-year-old youth whose name was withheld, was treated at 
Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center for a wound to the upper right thigh.He 
was reported in stable condition Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Denham said deputies detained the youth believed to be 
responsible for the shooting, recovered the weapon and referred the case to the 
district attorney's office for possible criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-age suspect, whose name was also withheld because of his age, was 
turned over to school officials, who suspended him and released him to his 
parents, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth had stolen a .45-caliber handgun from his grandfather's house, 
deputies said. After bringing the weapon to school, he and three friends -- 
including the shooting victim -- left the campus to examine the gun at a house 
in the 3300 block of Viana Drive. The gun discharged while the youth who 
brought it to school was trying to load it, Denham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-age suspect panicked, fled from the house, threw the gun into bushes 
and returned to school, deputies said. The other youths remained at the house 
and called 911 to report the incident. PHIL SNEIDERMAN

KNOCKING DOWN MYTH THAT WOMEN ARE DELICATE CREATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I struck a blow for women's liberation this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A real blow. 
</P>
<P>
 There I was in a Sherman Oaks mini-mall with five normally well-mannered 
suburban women, taking my turn at pummeling a 200-pound boxer while the others 
cheered with unladylike abandon: "The kidneys, sock 'im in the kidneys!" and 
"kiiiiill hiiiiim."  
</P>
<P>
 Every punch we landed on John Arthur's beefy hide was struck against the myth 
that women are delicate creatures who can be toyed with at will. Maybe Lorena 
Bobbitt already proved that, but hers was an underhanded sort of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The women at Billy Blanks' World Training Center would have put up their 
dukes, jabbed at John Wayne Bobbitt's brainless little head and finished him 
off with a satisfying uppercut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like having the power, and when I punch I feel powerful," said Patty 
Tatone, 27, a slim Woodland Hills bookkeeper with long brown hair and muscular 
arms who sometimes takes relish in pretending that the punching bag is her boss 
or her husband, Jim. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it is to vent aggression or tone muscles, women have taken to boxing 
lately with a zeal that has forced the estrogen-challenged to the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the USA amateur boxing sanctioning authority dropped its 
107-year-old ban against women after a plucky 16-year-old from Bellingham, 
Wash., mounted a legal challenge. The teen-ager, Dallas Malloy, went on to win 
the nation's first sanctioned bout between females. This April, women will 
fight in the legendary Golden Gloves tournament for the first time. And many 
local gyms like Billy Blanks', where I recently engaged in fisticuffs, have 
begun offering "boxercise" classes for women. Even world heavyweight champion 
Sugar Ray Leonard has jumped on the bandwagon with a boxing video for women.  
</P>
<P>
 Why in the world have women demanded an equal opportunity to get the stuffing 
punched out of them? The answer is obvious to beer connoisseurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing is like beer used to be before it began easing away from its 
working-class image: underappreciated. And like beer in the past 10 years, the 
new audience for boxing will make it more refined, with the emphasis on more 
subtle qualities like footwork and strategy, not just strength.  
</P>
<P>
 But I was way too busy thinking about how to protect my $5,000 nose job 
Tuesday to dwell on such highfalutin theories. 
</P>
<P>
 My trembling hands expertly taped to protect the knuckles and wrists, and then 
stuffed into heavy red gloves, I took my place in line with my fellow 
pugilists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jab, jab, right!" John shouted as we shadowboxed our way in unison across the 
carpeted gym floor. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a jab? I wondered, then tried a poor imitation of Patty's quick, short, 
straight punches. Moments later, I could barely hold up the weight of the 
gloves, never mind manage a left hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's how a fellow female student managed to crack me one in the nose, 
bending my glasses and injuring my pride, when I let my guard down from fatigue 
while a series of partners thwacked away for what seemed like hours at my 
upraised gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest test was yet to come: Me and each of the other women against 
John, a 6-foot former cop and FBI agent with a third-degree black belt in 
karate who has been shot four times and has the scars to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life, ranking right up 
there with the day in 1969 when I was nearly 13 years old and the authorities 
in Tenafly, N.J., finally let girls wear pants to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better than the time my best friend and I purposely plugged up the 
washing machines in home economics class, sending water cascading into the 
woodworking shop supervised by an ex-Marine who stubbornly refused to let us 
girls take his class. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Blore, a 45-year-old housewife and mother who looks at least 10 years 
younger, has shed 16 pounds and seen her cholesterol level drop 31 points since 
she started boxing a year ago. First into the ring with John, who wears a 
padded vest for protection, she hit him with a flurry of powerful punches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very aggressive person and before this, I had no place to put it," she 
said, sweat pouring off her face. "I think it's made me a lot calmer." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband might disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me to stop jabbing him in the shoulder the other day," Blore said, 
laughing. "I wasn't even aware I was doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Alisa Gooch, 25, a West Hills housewife and mother who stands 5 
feet tall and weighs only 96 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
 "Go, spitfire," the women shouted as Alisa went at John like a feisty 
Chihuahua snapping at a St. Bernard.  
</P>
<P>
 Loxi Greenfield, 33, swam competitively from age 5 until she was 18. She works 
out every day and her 5-year-old daughter already has a red belt in karate, two 
belts away from the coveted black belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get so sore from boxing that I can't do it often," Loxi said, sending me 
into a panic about my lack of stamina. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, it was my turn. 
</P>
<P>
 All eyes upon me, including a few spectators on the sidelines, I screwed up my 
courage and clobbered John with a jab and quick right that wouldn't have harmed 
a flea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smack" went my glove against John's left kidney, a legal move but one that 
prompted me to stop mid-bout, drop my guard and apologize profusely. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're supposed to hurt me," John said, uttering the most radical words a 
woman could ever hear. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to it with glee.

CHARITIES WIN AGAIN AT L.A. OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 800 business professionals volunteered last week at the Nissan Los 
Angeles Open golf tournament, a 68-year-old event that last year raised 
$400,000 for more than 40 charitable and community service projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the Los Angeles Junior Chamber of Commerce, the tournament at the 
Riviera Country Club is the oldest civic-sponsored Professional Golfers 
Assn.Tour event and the Junior Chamber's major annual fund-raiser. The Junior 
Chamber uses the proceeds for its community service projects, which include 
hosting an annual foster family picnic and helping coordinate the L.A. Watts 
Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. became the title sponsor in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteering at the tournament provided Junior Chamber members with not only a 
chance to rub elbows with golf professionals and Hollywood celebrities, but 
also to help disadvantaged youths, said spokeswoman Susan Forte . 
</P>
<P>
 John Archibold, one of the Junior Chamber members who helped at the 
tournament, said that despite the long hours, "it wasn't really work because 
you know it's going to a worthy cause. Plus, it's good people involved and a 
lot of fun."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; INMATE'S SHOOTING APPEARS JUSTIFIED, STATE 
OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although an investigation into Tuesday's shooting of an inmate by a guard at 
the state prison here will take some time to complete, it appears proper 
procedures were followed, according to the state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 The state will not release its firearms policy, but William Gengler, a state 
Department of Corrections spokesman, said guards are permitted to use guns 
"when absolutely necessary." An inmate was hit in the foot with a single round 
from a 9-millimeter rifle Tuesday, said a prison spokesman. The inmate took an 
"aggressive stance," refused repeated orders, and was an apparent threat to a 
guard, said prison officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Gengler said guns are used against inmates as a disabling tactic. The intent 
is not to kill, although there have been inmate deaths at state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards have shot and wounded prisoners three times in the year-old state 
prison, with the two most recent incidents occurring within a week of one 
another. Gengler said because the prison in Lancaster houses maximum-security 
inmates, it is likely additional shootings will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have Level IV (inmates), your chance of having incidents like this 
increases," he said. "Because of the level of prison that's out there (in 
Lancaster), this could happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 All three of the shooting incidents at the prison in Lancaster have involved 
maximum-security inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 and 1991, the most recent statistics available, Gengler said all the 
guard shootings of inmates occurred at facilities housing Level III and Level 
IV inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates are classified based on such things as criminal history, mental and 
physical stability, history of violence and current conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, there were 28 inmates shot by prison staff, according to state 
records. In 1991, the number dropped to 26. Although there were about 100,000 
inmates at two dozen prisons in both of those years, Gengler said the shootings 
only occurred at six prisons in 1990 and at five institutions in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The first incident at the prison in Lancaster involving a guard shooting an 
inmate occurred Nov. 16, 1993, said spokesman Kenn I. Hicks. Two 
maximum-security inmates were fighting and failed to follow orders to stop. An 
officer fired a 9-millimeter rifle, striking one of the inmates in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation, which is mandatory after all shootings, found that proper 
procedures were followed, Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second incident, on Feb. 9, also involved a fight between two 
maximum-security inmates who would not stop on command. One of the inmates was 
struck by a bullet in the shoulder. The investigation of that incident is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's incident, convicted robber Eric Hall refused to leave his cell 
during a routine cell search. He refused verbal commands and also would not 
leave after being struck on the thigh with a baton or being fired upon by a 
rifle shooting wooden blocks.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DRIVERS URGED TO AVOID 2 BUSY INTERSECTIONS

<P>
 Sheriff's deputies urged motorists Wednesday to avoid two busy Antelope Valley 
intersections because of major roadwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said paving work at the intersection of Avenue K and Sierra Highway 
in Lancaster, continuing through 7 p.m. today, will cause traffic delays of up 
to 30 minutes.They recommended that drivers use 10th Street West, Division 
Street and Avenue I as alternate routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Avenue J should not be used as a detour, deputies said, because construction 
work is taking place along that street between Division Street and Sierra 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palmdale, the construction of new Metrolink rails will force the closure of 
Palmdale Boulevard between Sierra Highway and 6th Street East, from 8 p.m. 
Friday through 1 a.m. Monday. Palmdale Boulevard drivers will be diverted north 
and south along Sierra Highway and 6th Street East during this period. PHIL

<P>
 A "park and ride" lot has been cleared for public use starting today near the 
entrance of Ed Davis Park in Towsley Canyon by the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The lot will accommodate motorists using the Golden State Freeway.Supervisor 
Michael Antonovich is scheduled to participate in a grand opening ceremony at 
10 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 The lot, which can hold more than 75 vehicles, is a former parking area for a 
horse stable, said Rorie Skei, spokeswoman for the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy. There is no charge to use the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Once repairs are made to the Golden State Freeway and traffic conditions 
improve, the site will be used by visitors to park horse trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 500-acre recreation area has been closed since the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake damaged the lodge's roof and chimney, triggered landslides along 
trails and cut off public roads leading into the site. DOUGLAS ALGER

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY TO HIRE FIRM TO RIGHT MOBILE HOMES; 
AFTERMATH: AS MANY AS 800 REMAIN WITHOUT UTILITIES, WHICH CAN'T BE HOOKED UP 
UNTIL THEY ARE BACK ON THEIR FOUNDATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 The city will hire a private engineering firm to right hundreds of mobile 
homes shaken from their foundations during the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A month after the temblor, as many as 1,500 residents remain displaced from 
their homes, which cannot be reconnected to gas or water supplies until they 
are placed back on their supports. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has intervened because officials believe that it is taking too long 
for private contractors to get the job done, city spokeswoman Gail Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous that people have been this long without utilities," Foy said. 
"We don't want them waiting any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 10% of the 51,062 mobile homes in Los Angeles County were declared 
uninhabitable as a result of quake damage, sparking renewed interest over 
whether costly safety measures should be required by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Clarita, an estimated 1,800 mobile homes were rocked off their 
foundations, said Kevin Michel, a senior planner in the city's community 
development department. He said between 500 and 800 remain down. 
</P>
<P>
 ICF Kaiser, an Oakland-based engineering firm, will oversee the project. 
Kaiser will subcontract with various firms to right trailers in some of the 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no charge to residents for the work, which includes raising and 
leveling the homes, as well as providing increased wind and seismic bracing. 
Homeowners who have already paid contractors to right their homes may be 
eligible for reimbursement of their insurance deductible or out-of-pocket 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel said officials have encountered difficulty locating residents of some 
of the damaged dwellings to obtain permission to have them fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that they cooperate and get in touch with us, otherwise we 
can't do the work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that restoring the trailers to their foundations and 
making the other improvements will cost between $4 million and $6 million. The 
Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to pick up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 Work is slated to begin next week at Cordova Mobile Homes Estates on Sierra 
Highway in Canyon Country, where as many as one-third of the park's 295 homes 
remain down. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel said he hoped that all the homes would be back on their foundations 
within 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are anxious to get this program off the ground," he said.

OFF THE TICKER: AIRLINE WINNER AT DOG'S DAY IN COURT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A dog may be man's best friend, but in the eyes of the law, he's merely 
baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 So declared a Manhattan federal judge, ruling this week that the 1988 death of 
a 2 1/2-year-old golden retriever that died after more than an hour of 
140-degree heat in an American Airlines cargo hold did not entitle his owner to 
more than the $1,250 maximum liability for damaged cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Gluckman, then 17, said he was forced to undergo counseling after 
finding the dog's face and paws bloodied in an apparent effort to escape its 
cage.

O.C. BUILDER, ROCKEFELLER REALTY JOINING IN PROJECT; HOUSING: AKINS WILL HELP 
DEVELOP 116 HOMES IN SAN GABRIEL VALLEY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO COMPANY'S FIRST 
SUCH VENTURE IN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A partnership led by former Chase Manhattan Bank chairman David Rockefeller 
has joined with an Orange County home builder to develop its first 
single-family housing project in California. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of negotiations, Rockefeller & Associates Realty of San 
Francisco has signed a deal with Akins, consisting of three Irvine home 
building companies, to construct at least 116 homes as part of a 277-acre 
residential project called Ridgemoor in Rowland Heights in the east San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for major commercial projects such as the Embarcadero in San Francisco, 
the Rockefeller group has recently diversified into residential building with 
single-family homes in Arizona and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the Southern California economy will be showing a little life in 
the next three years and housing will be a good place to be if you're in the 
real estate business," said John Taylor, vice president of finance for 
Rockefeller. "California is a laggard in the recovery and I think when home 
prices come back they are going to come back with a vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockefeller group is the latest in a string of developers, such as Centex 
Corp. of Dallas, the nation's largest home builder, and Del Webb Corp. of 
Phoenix, that have announced major moves into the Southern California housing 
market in the last two weeks. Some say the fact that these deep-pocket 
investors are choosing to put their capital here, often in joint ventures with 
cash-starved local builders, is a sign that the Southern California real estate 
industry is starting to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "These developers believe that local real estate values have bottomed and this 
is the time to position themselves for the turnaround," said John Shumway, 
president of Market Profiles, a real estate consulting firm in Costa Mesa. 
"This is a real positive sign. But are we still fragile? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Akins, president of Akins, said the joint venture is part of his 
company's strategy to provide expertise and local know-how to investment 
groups, often from other states, that have bought residential property in 
Southern California and need help to develop the projects. He said the recent 
moves by Rockefeller and Centex are a healthy sign for the local real estate 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are smart investors, not vulture investors. They are people who made 
money in Dallas, Denver and Boston," Akins said. "People are tired of sitting 
on the sidelines and are deciding now is the time to get into the game."  
</P>
<P>
 Besides building the homes, Akins will be responsible for planning, developing 
and marketing other lots at Ridgemoor, a 508-lot development. The homes the 
Akins-Rockefeller team is planning will be priced from $232,000 to $285,000 and 
would begin selling in September. If the Ridgemoor deal is successful, 
Rockefeller and Akins plan future residential development projects together, 
possibly in Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 Akins was started by brothers Bruce and Carl Akins and is considered to be a 
continuation of a family business started in 1948 by their father, Ed Akins. 
The senior Akins later headed Irvine Pacific, the home-building arm of the 
Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 His sons run three companies: Akins Homes, which plans and builds homes; Akins 
Construction, a builder of expensive custom homes such as the personal 
residence of Orange County developer William Lyon in Coto de Caza, and Akins 
Communities, which builds, manages and markets homes for landowners for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had discussions with other builders, but Akins does it all quite well," 
Taylor said. "Also, they are a small, family-owned business and basically, 
we're a family-owned business. There's an affinity there." 
</P>
<P>
 Akins has managed to survive the recession with flexible tactics such as 
finding joint-venture partners to acquire the land on which Akins homes are 
built. As a result, the company does not have expensive loan payments and other 
debt during the life of the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also hires itself out for a flat fee to build housing tracts for 
other developers, such as in the University Hills community at UC Irvine and 
the conversion of 1,500 apartments to condominiums for the Irvine Co. Akins has 
built homes in Tustin Ranch, Rancho Santa Margarita, Mission Viejo and Dove 
Canyon.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Akins built 158 single-family homes and 498 attached units. Akins, a 
private company that doesn't release profit statements, reported sales of $132 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 While Rockefeller & Associates Realty was attracted by Akins' knowledge of the 
Southern California market, the company isn't a stranger to Orange County. It 
made local headlines in early 1990 when it announced plans to build a 13-story 
office building called Central Park Towers in Anaheim. The project was later 
shelved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still own the land, but that project was a casualty of the times," Taylor 
said. "We hope one day to build that building."

LOSS ESTIMATES FOR QUAKE MAY BE $1 BILLION LOW; INSURANCE: S&P RATING AGENCY 
SAYS TOTAL COULD BE CLOSER TO $3.5 BILLION AND THAT SEVERAL SMALL COMPANIES 
FACE FAILURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major insurance rating agency said Wednesday that the industry's official 
loss estimate for the Northridge earthquake -- $2.5 billion -- may be $1 
billion too low. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's Insurance Rating Service also said a number of smaller 
insurers -- particularly those heavily concentrated in California property 
insurance -- are vulnerable to failure, if not from the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
then from catastrophes to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, Farmers Insurance Group, California's third-largest homeowners 
insurer, said it expects its quake-related claims to reach $600 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Steven Dreyer, who prepared the Standard & Poor's analysis, said S&P has loss 
estimates totaling $2.4 billion from 29 companies representing 62% of the 
California property insurance market, including earthquake, homeowners, auto 
and commercial coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 If the remaining 38% of the market suffered proportional losses, he said, 
"we're looking at a total closer to $3.5 billion."  
</P>
<P>
 That would far exceed the $2.5-billion estimate released Feb. 7 by the 
Property Claims Services division of the American Insurance Services Group, a 
trade group that polls insurers to compile official catastrophe loss estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 These estimates concern only losses that will be covered by insurance. The 
total losses are far higher because much of the damage was to uninsured public 
infrastructure such as sewers and highway overpasses and because individual 
earthquake policies have high deductibles and only about one-third of Los 
Angeles homeowners buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 The S&P report said the bulk of earthquake claims will be paid by large, 
multistate carriers such as State Farm and Allstate, whose diversification and 
huge capital bases will make their losses "taxing but not devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the agency also listed a number of smaller insurers with 
what it called "high potential catastrophe exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 The companies have such high concentrations of California property insurance 
business relative to their surplus -- an insurer's financial cushion against 
claims -- that they are "susceptible to financial stress" from the quake and 
future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the list are two Santa Monica-based sister companies, Western 
Mutual Insurance Co. and Residence Mutual Insurance Co., which together wrote 
$40 million in California property insurance premiums in 1992, representing 
435% of their combined surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 That was by far the highest premiums-to-surplus ratio among the 66 insurers 
that S&P surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 But mere exposure to potential losses does not necessarily translate into 
financial shakiness, Paul Rubincam, senior vice president of Western Mutual, 
said in a telephone interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubincam said the two companies, which serve about 110,000 California 
policyholders, expect earthquake claims of $5 million to $6 million. However, 
the bulk of that will be covered by reinsurance -- policies that insurers buy 
to protect themselves against such catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
 The net cost to the two insurers is likely to be only about $1.5 million, or a 
bit less than one-fifth of their surplus, he said. It's a painful blow but not 
life-threatening, Rubincam said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The company S&P listed as having the next-highest catastrophe exposure is 
American Sterling Insurance Co. of El Toro, with a California 
premiums-to-surplus ratio of 183%. 
</P>
<P>
 American Sterling President Michael Thompson said the figure is misleading 
because the company writes virtually no earthquake insurance and expects only a 
single fire-related loss claim from the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 No other carrier had a ratio of more than 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding its projected $600 million in quake claims, Farmers said a 
"substantial" but undetermined portion will be covered by reinsurance. The 
exact amount will not be known until the end of the year because the company's 
reinsurance level is based on a formula comparing the total annual revenue with 
its total annual losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's report puts Farmers in a tie with State Farm for the highest quake 
damage estimate. Next comes Allstate, with an estimated $350 million in claims.

GIANTS IN TOYLAND; A CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRY'S CREATIVITY GAP IS SHOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dr. Dreadful Food Lab, one of the hot new "activity toys" on display here 
at this year's Toy Fair, provides all the ingredients a kid needs to cook up 
gourmet concoctions like Chewy Gummy Bugs, Tasty Monster Skins and Ants on a 
Log. Good fun, for sure, and appealing to what Tyco Toys calls the gross food 
craze. 
</P>
<P>
 To the disappointment of some in the toy business, though, the creation of 
toys these days too often takes place in what might be called the Dr. Hollywood 
Hit Lab. Take a high-profile movie or cartoon series, stir in some impressive 
packaging and a big TV advertising budget and smear it across a product line 
that might run from dolls to cars to board games. 
</P>
<P>
 With luck, the result will be tasty profits -- but without much creative 
nourishment. The toy industry today is dominated by a few big companies selling 
mostly through a few big retailers -- a situation that results in cautious 
product strategies that increasingly rely on high-profile entertainment tie-ins 
or the recycling of proven hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some big-company executives worry that the absence of interesting new 
ideas -- as opposed to interesting new licensing opportunities -- may be 
hurting the business. Wholesale toy sales grew at an anemic 1.6% rate last 
year, far below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a need for more creative introductions, more newness ," said James L. 
Block, senior vice president for marketing at Mt. Laurel, N.J.-based Tyco, the 
nation's third-largest toy vendor. "As the big companies get bigger, they're 
less willing to take risks." 
</P>
<P>
 One need look no further than the clusters of names at Toy Fair to see the 
dramatic consolidation that has swept the toy business in recent years. 
Industry leader Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., now owns Playskool, Kenner, 
Milton Bradley, Parker Bros. and even the Cabbage Patch Kids. El Segundo-based 
Mattel's stable includes Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 To a great extent, these companies rely on generating new sales of familiar 
products: Mattel this year was touting the 35th anniversary of Barbie, bringing 
out a collector's edition of the original doll.  
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro, undaunted by mounting parental concerns about play violence, countered 
with GI Joe's 30th anniversary. Tyco boasted of a full make-over of Matchbox 
cars, a line it acquired last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And when it comes to developing new toys, the big companies increasingly are 
turning to Hollywood. One of Mattel's major plays this year involves 
Universal's movie "The Flintstones." Figures representing John Goodman, who 
plays Fred Flintstone in the movie, will vie with Fred dolls based on the 
original Hanna-Barbera cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's upcoming animated film "The Lion King" was everywhere at the Toy 
Fair. Hasbro, Mattel and other vendors are gearing up to make everything from 
soft, purring lion dolls to board games and play sets based on the theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The licensing frenzy extends far beyond Hollywood movies. Showrooms were 
stuffed with toys linked to TV shows -- everything from Star Trek to Barney to 
the World Wrestling Federation -- and video games such as Street Fighter. Even 
venerable standbys were dressed up in the latest media craze -- would you 
believe Monster Truck Play-Doh? 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the made-for-toy-sales television cartoons, the crucial driving 
force in the "action figure" category, one of the fastest-growing in the 
industry. Lewis Galoob Toys of South San Francisco hopes for a smash hit this 
year with Biker Mice From Mars action figures, developed with the cartoon of 
the same name. "High ratings are absolutely essential to the success of the 
line," Galoob Chief Executive Mark Goldman said. The enthusiasm for action 
figures springs largely from the success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
and their upstart rivals, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The cartoons, in 
effect, teach kids how to play with the toys by giving them a story line. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good commercial formula, but not one that sits well with all parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's highly seductive, but after you get it home it becomes boring. It can't 
live up to all that flash," said Mary Purpura, a San Francisco-based writer and 
mother of four. Toys that allow kids to build their own fantasies are more 
enduring, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The major companies' obsession with mass-market hits may be leaving 
opportunities for smaller players that take such an approach. Said Jacob Miles, 
a former Tonka executive who now heads Minneapolis-based Cultural Exchange 
Corp., which markets toys that acknowledge ethnic and cultural differences: 
"Hasbro and Mattel are looking more at each other than at the market" and are 
vulnerable to creative upstarts. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is hard for small companies to break in, partly because toy retailing 
is dominated by a few mass merchants, led by Toys R Us and Wal-Mart.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder and harder to shop here," lamented Gretchen Van Tassel, a buyer 
for the Carson-based mail-order company Lakeshore Learning Materials. The big 
vendors, she said, "are really only interested in their 15 big buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 And vice versa. Toy Sales 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. toy manufacturers posted a lackluster 1.6% increase in total wholesale 
shipments in 1993, excluding video games. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipments, in millions of dollars: 03,28,08,08 Category 1992 1993 Infant, 
preschool $1,065 $1,091 Dolls 2,009 1,654 Plush 761 870 Male Action 563 709

 Re: What's Next?

<P>
 Can't tell you how sorry I am about Paramount. You know I was rooting for you 
all the way. I mean that. Sincerely. And when John Malone pulled that 
switcheroo to merge TCI into that Baby Bell instead of backing you to the hilt 
-- well, I could have just. . . . It's just like you told the New Yorker -- the 
man's got a Teflon mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But you don't, Barry. I've always said you're the smartest guy in Hollywood. 
The only thing Sumner had over you is money. But, hey, let's be honest -- you 
didn't really want to spend $10 billion for Paramount, did you? Way too pricey. 
That's not you. You're a visionary. You don't just buy media empires, you build 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why everyone's waiting to see what you'll do next. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I know that Ovitz, Berg and the investment bankers are whispering in your 
ear: Maybe you can get Jack Welch to cut a special deal for NBC -- or, now that 
Tom Murphy is back, maybe CapCities/ABC is ripe for an offer. Tribune Co. -- 
with its blend of TV stations, cable and syndication -- also looks tasty. Heck, 
perhaps Sony or Matsushita would be thrilled to offload Columbia/TriStar or 
MCA. Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 But, Barry, you've got to ignore them. Trust me on this. You know all this 
chatter about "content" and "distribution" being the keys to multimedia success 
is just the whiny echo of conventional wisdom. You know better than anyone that 
creating content in the '90s will be easier than it ever was. New technologies 
have radically cut production costs; financing is a snap. And let's face it, 
creative people have always wanted to work with you.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure, having a library is nice -- but, Barry, I never thought you wanted to be 
King of the Reruns. Creating the kind of network genres you did at Fox in the 
1980s won't be a technical or a financial challenge -- just a creative one.  
</P>
<P>
 As for distribution -- hey, you heard Rupert Murdoch snipe at Time Warner's 
Levin about cable access at that panel at Gore's superhighway summit. Let's get 
real. Do you honestly think the feds are going to allow a Ray Smith, a John 
Malone or a Gerry Levin to deny guys like you equal access to their networks? 
No way! Distributors in the future will be compelled to carry services on a 
non-discriminatory basis, or the antitrust folks will have a field day. 
Tomorrow's information superhighway will have to carry all traffic. What's 
more, the Bell Atlantic/TCIs will discover that repaving their information 
highways will be far more costly than they expected. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Barry, you're already in the best and fastest-growing media business of 
all. With QVC, you're not selling "entertainment" or "distribution" or even 
those lovely Dianne von Furstenberg gowns ( do give her my best!). You're 
selling response.  
</P>
<P>
 That's what interactivity is all about -- getting people to respond, getting 
people to pick up the phone and do something or buy something that they 
otherwise wouldn't. Barry, you need to reposition QVC as the direct-response 
company of the New Media Age. You're creating the network software that 
generates direct, measurable responses and transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, you don't want a movie studio or a cable system; you want 
direct-mail companies and telemarketing firms. So don't buy a King World. Snap 
up a top direct-mail firm like Ogily & Mather Direct, Rapp Collins Marcoa or 
Wunderman Cato Johnson. They have the databases, they have the mailing lists, 
they understand print-generated response. Their strengths dovetail perfectly 
with your video capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 So don't buy a CBS. Do a joint equity telemarketing venture with an MCI or 
AT&T. Or acquire, say, Matrixx Marketing from Cincinnati Bell. Heck, BellSouth 
was one of your own backers, talk with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even catalogue companies like L. L. Bean and Williams-Sonoma fit comfortably 
into the direct-response theme. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, take a look at Apple Computer's CD-ROM-based catalogue as a 
possible model. Why not invest in a video game company or two? Everyone from 
MCA to HBO already is, but only you can figure out how to turn video games into 
an on-line, direct-response medium. 
</P>
<P>
 Or consider CUC International -- the fast-growing Stamford, Conn.-based 
company that offers discount buying services. For $50 a year, members can get 
shopping, travel, dining and other discounts. Comp-U-Card has over 20 million 
members, and the company already sells its services through networks like 
CompuServe and America Online. CUC is also part of pilot interactive cable 
ventures with Time Warner and AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, at 45 times earnings, CUC is among the 10 most expensive stocks on 
the New York Stock Exchange. But, Barry, you've already demonstrated that 
you're prepared to pay top dollar to create new media synergies. This could be 
a better buy than Paramount. If you're not careful, maybe CUC will buy QVC! 
</P>
<P>
 The point is not that you should chain yourself to electronic shopping, but 
that direct mail and telemarketing will put your company in a unique position 
to understand audiences -- and customize software for them around the concept 
of response.  
</P>
<P>
 Vendors will love it, advertisers will love it, and, of course, Wall Street 
will love it. You'll be creating new genres of entertainment and interaction 
that can define the media era. Isn't that what you want? Gotta hop. Geez, it's 
Marty Davis on the other line. Should I give him your regards?

IMPACT OF THE PARAMOUNT DEAL; WHAT WILL MALONE -- AND DILLER? -- THINK OF 
NEXT?; ALLIANCES: NOW THAT THE TELE-COMMUNICATIONS CHIEF IS NO LONGER REQUIRED 
TO CUT HIS TIES TO QVC NETWORK, NEW TAKEOVER TARGETS MAY LOOM.

<P>
 Now that the dust is settling from the five-month battle to take over 
Paramount Communications Inc., people are asking again: What is John Malone 
going to do? 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitious chief executive of Denver-based cable TV giant 
Tele-Communications Inc. was a leading force behind Barry Diller's bid for 
Paramount until government regulators said TCI would have to divest itself of 
its stake in Diller's QVC Network Inc. if it acquired the Hollywood studio. 
</P>
<P>
 But Malone, through TCI affiliate Liberty Media Corp., still owns 18.5% of 
QVC, and he is no longer required to pull out of QVC since Diller's bid for 
Paramount has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 As a team, the two could renew their quest for Home Shopping Network. TCI 
holds a controlling stake in the network, which was in merger talks with QVC 
before the Paramount takeover bid. They could also mount a bid for another 
entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone and Diller are said to be on fairly good terms, although Malone kept 
Diller in the dark about a TCI-Bell Atlantic Corp. merger agreement until the 
last minute. Due to antitrust concerns, Diller was forced to assemble a new 
group of partners to replace TCI for the Paramount bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what you get when you deal with Malone," one business associate 
said. "You know he's going to be looking out for himself, but he has very 
strong feelings for Barry." The executive said Malone is likely to support 
Diller in any future strategic move. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from potential ventures with Diller, most observers agree that Malone's 
top priority is still the TCI-Bell Atlantic merger, although there are mounting 
questions about its certitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies have missed three self-imposed deadlines in negotiating a 
definitive agreement -- and at least one source predicts that the deal has only 
a 65% chance of being completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks are going "slowly if at all," one source close to TCI said. "I know 
they're having trouble. The Bell Atlantic stock is down a lot, and there's a 
lot of bureaucracy, and they're having a hard time getting what they want. . . 
. They're not that enthusiastic anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, have the impression that the two-month delay in the original 
merger target is due largely to regulatory and legal details. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get a feeling that there are negotiating problems," said one lawyer 
who has seen drafts of the definitive agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Tom Wolzien, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: "I'm not 
worried. The complexity of this thing and difficulty of sorting it out is 
unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
 In their letter of intent to merge, the two companies set Dec. 15 as the date 
but then sought a six-week extension, pushing the date back to Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 26, Bell Atlantic President James Cullen told a news conference in 
Miami that the companies expected to announce a definitive agreement in about 
two weeks. On Monday, however, Bell Atlantic announced another delay -- with no 
projection of a completion date. 
</P>
<P>
 One complication is assigning a value to TCI's cable holdings, because the 
cash flow of the systems could be affected by the federal government's decision 
to reassess cable TV rates. The rate review could also affect the value of 
TCI-owned programming assets, including Turner Broadcasting, the Discovery 
Channel and Black Entertainment Television. Moreover, Bell Atlantic's stock has 
dropped since the merger agreement, which will weigh on its plans to issue 
shares as part of the TCI purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one observer: "John believes he got a deal for $33 billion, more or less, 
and that's the deal he's trying to preserve." 
</P>
<P>
 According to another source close to TCI, the original $33-billion deal 
negotiated between Malone and Bell Atlantic Chief Executive Raymond C. Smith 
ascribed $25 billion in value to TCI's cable systems, $5 billion to programming 
assets and $3 billion to TCI's cable systems in Bell Atlantic's service area. 
Under federal law, TCI must divest itself of Bell Atlantic area systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reported complications, both companies recently said there remains 
no major obstacle to reaching agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll announce a definitive agreement when we complete the documentation," 
said Robert Thomson, senior vice president of TCI. "This is an extraordinarily 
complex transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 That complexity is underscored by the sight of an army of Bell Atlantic 
executives that has come to Denver to pore over TCI's books. Bell Atlantic has 
leased an entire floor of the Hyatt Regency at the Denver Tech Center to house 
the 100 executives assigned to work on the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 On the TCI side, every manager from mid-level up has been assigned a 
counterpart Bell Atlantic manager to get acquainted with. "They're supposed to 
follow them around," said one executive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to valuing TCI and Liberty, the approximately 13 million cable 
TV subscribers aren't all that come into the equation. The merged company would 
also have to figure out what to do with TCI's 22,000-acre cattle ranch in 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Since an initial euphoric reception of the merger plan -- announced Oct. 13 -- 
Bell Atlantic's share price has tumbled 17%. On Wednesday, the stock closed at 
$54.375, down 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 During this period, however, utility stocks have suffered from interest rate 
jitters, and there is added uncertainty due to a congressional drive to rewrite 
telecommunications policy. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI's stock fell 37.5 cents to $26.25 a share Wednesday. On Oct. 13, TCI Class 
A shares closed at $31.375, up $3.

 Foodmaker Settles Poisoning Suit: The San Diego-based parent of the Jack in 
the Box fast-food chain agreed to pay $1.3 million to the family of a 
2-year-old boy who died from eating tainted hamburger. More than 600 cases of 
E. coli bacterial poisoning were reported in Washington and Nevada during an 
outbreak that began in late 1992. A Foodmaker spokeswoman said fewer than 20 
poisoning lawsuits remain and that "several dozen" cases, including the four 
involving deaths, have been resolved.

 Calgene to Sell Genetically Engineered Cotton: The Davis, Calif.-based 
agricultural biotechnology company said it has received approval from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture to sell without restriction its genetically 
engineered cottonseed.Calgene said its gene-altered cotton, known as BXN, is 
resistant to the effects of the herbicide bromoxynil, used by farmers to 
control morning glory and other broadleaf weeds. Such weeds reduce the 
country's $4-billion cotton crop by 15% annually, Calgene said. It said use of 
BXN should reduce the use of herbicides because chemicals could be used in 
lower doses. But the Union of Concerned Scientists issued a statement 
criticizing approval of Calgene's BXN, saying that switching to 
herbicide-tolerant crops will "deepen U.S. farmers' dependence on toxic 
chemicals."

MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS IN TELECOM VISIT; TECHNOLOGY: D.C. GROUP, LOCAL 
LEADERS DISCUSS ACCESS TO INFORMATION HIGHWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dogging all the hype and cliches about the hoped-for information highway is a 
single troubling question: If we build a cutting-edge, two-way communications 
system, will anyone but the affluent and technologically savvy use it? 
</P>
<P>
 Several Washington bureaucrats paid a visit to Los Angeles on Wednesday to 
hear the California perspective on the future of telecommunications, a pet 
project of Vice President Al Gore. They met with more questions than answers in 
generally amicable but occasionally heated exchanges with dozens of 
academicians, politicians, clinic directors, community activists, homeless 
advocates and telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opening a daylong session at the California Museum of Science and Industry, 
Larry Irving, an assistant secretary of commerce, said the government's role is 
to ensure that "we don't leave some citizens behind in information poverty." 
But he added, "How can we do that when 1 in 14 people in South-Central Los 
Angeles don't have a phone?" 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Latino activists pressed hard the argument that a technologic age 
means little to immigrants who do not have access to a phone, cannot 
communicate with English-speaking operators or do not even grasp that 911 is 
the number to call in medical emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, postponed by last month's earthquake, is the second in a series 
of meetings that Irving and others will hold around the country to size up what 
people need and want in the way of information services. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the suggestions they heard for achieving universal access to 
information: 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) called for no less than providing a 
computer in every home, a la France's ubiquitous Minitel system, which has 
encouraged even 10-year-olds to devise new computer uses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pacific Bell proposed a two-tier rate structure that would let customers pay 
one low monthly rate for such basic existing services as a dial tone and 911, 
or a higher rate that would also cover access to databases and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bong Hwan Kim, executive director of the Korean Youth and Community Center, 
said community-based organizations, if wired for the new generation of 
interactive services, could be a new "infrastructure for empowerment" for 
immigrants and young people. Building telecommunications capabilities into 
affordable housing projects, he said, could help ensure that disadvantaged 
Californians are on an equal information footing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Audrie Krause, executive director of Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a San 
Francisco consumer watchdog, said ratepayers should not be required to pay for 
immense investments in equipment that they might have little interest in using. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the major challenges for regulators," she said, "is to resist pressure 
from (local phone companies) to make ratepayers involuntary investors in an 
advanced telecommunications infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Irving, who ran the session, were David J. Barram, a former Apple 
Computer executive who is now a deputy secretary of commerce, and Federal 
Communications Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett.

 Zenith Chosen by Digital HDTV Alliance: The so-called Digital HDTV grand 
alliance said it selected Zenith Electronics Corp.'s technology as the digital 
transmission subsystem for the high-definition television system it will 
propose to the Federal Communications Commission.The alliance, in cooperation 
with the FCC, last week concluded extensive testing and selected Zenith's VSB 
technology over General Instrument's QAM transmission subsystems. "It's the 
last piece of the puzzle," said Dick Muldoon, a spokesman for American 
Telephone & Telegraph Co., a member of the alliance. The HDTV system is 
scheduled for final verification testing in late 1994 and final field testing 
in early 1995. HDTV aims to provide movie-quality digital images on a flatter, 
larger screen.

HARSH WINTER, QUAKE DRAG DOWN HOUSING STARTS; CONSTRUCTION: RATE SKIDS 17.6% IN 
JANUARY, THE STEEPEST SLIDE IN A DECADE. ANALYSTS CALL IT A LULL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home building took its steepest slide in a decade last month, dragged down by 
the harsh winter and the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said residential construction will remain stuck this month because of 
lingering severe weather but will regain its footing as spring approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing starts skidded 17.6% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 1.29 million units, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline, which matched a similar drop in January, 1991, was the biggest 
since a 26.4% plunge in March, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't like digging holes in the ground when it's that cold," said 
David Lereah, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "February will probably be down for weather-related reasons as well, but 
starts will bounce back," predicted economist Robert R. Davis of Savings & 
Community Bankers of America. "It's a temporary lull." 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown agreed, calling the decline "transient." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that weather-related disruptions to overall economic activity 
suggest a slower first quarter than anticipated, but he maintained that "the 
economy's underlying momentum remains intact." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The West, including California, posted the only increase in residential 
construction, but it was considerably weaker than in December. Starts fell 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that another reason for the decline, in addition to the weather 
and quake, was an upward revision in December starts, from a 1.54-million rate 
to 1.57 million -- the highest since 1.62 million in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even without the earthquake and cold, we considered the December surge to be 
unsustainable . . . and were looking for a moderate fallback in the first 
quarter," said economist David F. Seiders of the National Assn. of Home 
Builders. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts predicted that residential construction will remain strong through 
1994 but will level off at about the 1.46-million fourth-quarter rate. The Home 
Builders are forecasting 1.43 million starts this year, up from 1.29 million in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Although mortgage rates have inched up from their October lows, last week's 
average of 7.21% was still well below the 8.07% of early January, 1993. Lereah 
predicted rates will still be below 8% at year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for building permits -- often a barometer of future activity -- 
fell 7.9% in January, the first decline in seven months. Analysts said the drop 
also was weather-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-family starts dropped 15% to a 1.15 million rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Seiders said construction was merely delayed and that "the only question is 
how fast the postponed activity comes back." The Home Builders are forecasting 
1.23 million single-family starts this year, the most since 1.43 million 
foundations were laid in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment construction plunged 33.8% to a 147,000 rate. But Seiders said that 
"we expect it erratically, but gradually, to move upward." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regionally, the West posted a 0.3% increase in overall starts to a 377,000 
rate, much slower than the 17.9% surge in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question the earthquake caused some starts to be delayed," Seiders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starts fell in the other regions, which were hit hard by winter weather. 
</P>
<P>
 They dropped 32.8% in the Northeast to a 90,000 annual rate, the lowest since 
an 85,000 rate in February, 1991. They had been down 2.2% in December. 
</P>
<P>
 They declined 22.9% in the Midwest to a 262,000 rate, after a 3.7% advance a 
month earlier. Starts also fell in the South by 21.6% to 565,000, wiping out a 
15.9% gain the previous month.

 Broderbund Software Under SEC Investigation: The Novato, Calif.-based company 
is the target of an "informal inquiry" by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission for trading the day before it announced it was being acquired by 
Electronic Arts Inc., a company spokeswoman said.SEC officials declined to 
comment. Shares of the largest U.S. publisher of educational software rose 
about 22% in the three days of trading before acquisition plans were announced 
Feb. 9, leading many analysts to believe that inside information was leaked 
about the transaction. Electronic Arts plans to buy Broderbund for about $400 
million.

 Mexico Cuts Natural Gas Imports: As recently as last year, the country looked 
to be facing an ever-rising bill for natural gas imports, but it has slashed 
imports to zero and is even exporting some gas to the United States, officials 
say. Pemex, the state oil and gas monopoly, achieved the reduction partly by 
reducing its own use of natural gas. Down the road, Mexican demand is still 
expected to show strong growth, and Pemex's ability to meet demand depends on 
tapping the country's extensive resources and greatly boosting investment in 
the gas sector, according to officials.

 Fox Moving "Front Page" to New York: The Fox Broadcasting prime-time 
television news magazine will shift its base from Los Angeles because New York 
is "where the real culture of TV news thrives," Fox TV Stations Inc. Chief 
Executive Les Hinton said. But Fox insiders said the move is really motivated 
by a need to be closer to the "talent pool" of anchors and 
correspondents.Virtually all the network news magazines are based in New York 
and so are many of the syndicated tabloid TV shows. Fox had recently been in 
talks with ABC News' John Stossel, who said one of the reasons he didn't want 
to accept an offer from Fox was because it would have meant relocating to Los 
Angeles.

 Air France Proposes Reorganization: The airline's chairman, Christian Blanc, 
sent a letter to his 40,000 employees proposing a reorganization into a series 
of smaller companies. Blanc, who became chief executive of Air France in 
October, proposed cutting layers of management and decentralizing operations to 
spread responsibility over different geographic zones. The proposal was the 
latest stage in a dialogue Blanc has tried to set up with the carrier's 14 
unions in a search for consensus on savings.

DOW UP, DOLLAR DOWN AMID JAPAN FRICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. stocks rose broadly for a third day, despite concerns about a trade war 
with Japan and anticipation of a report due today on January inflation. But 
utility stocks tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar continued to stabilize as currency dealers awaited word of the 
next step in the trade fight. Long-term bond yields were largely unchanged. 
Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 The market surged at the start, with the Dow industrials up 22 points in 
early-morning trading, after gaining 24 points Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dow slipped later as some investors focused on the potential for an 
escalation in the trade war of words between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close, the Dow was up 9.00 points to 3,937.27. Winners edged losers 12 
to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange and 15 to 11 on Nasdaq, and most other 
stock indexes rose modestly. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the broad market's continuing strength was impressive. Some Wall 
Streeters believe the market is attempting to build a base for another advance 
that would top previous highs set before the Federal Reserve Board tightened 
credit a notch on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a major rally may have to wait on some resolution of the current 
U.S.-Japan trade fight, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the continuing decline in utility stocks remains a problem for some 
market watchers. Historically, falling utility stocks have often heralded 
higher interest rates and, eventually, a bear market. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Dow utility index slumped 2.70 points, or 1.3%, to 212.76, 
the lowest level since the early summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates could be volatile today, depending on the extent of the rise in 
consumer prices in January. The government reports that inflation figure this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Aerospace stocks gained on news of a huge Saudi order for U.S. commercial 
jets. Boeing shot up 2 1/8 to 46 1/2, McDonnell Douglas rose 1 7/8 to a record 
118 7/8, United Technologies leaped 2 5/8 to 71, Rohr added 3/4 to 10 1/2 and 
Rockwell International jumped 1 3/4 to 43 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks in general were strong, continuing their recent streak. 
Phelps Dodge rose 1 to 55 3/8, Nucor gained 1 1/8 to 59 1/2, Reynolds Metals 
was up 1 1/4 to 52 1/8, ITT surged 3 1/8 to 104 and Kennametal rose 1 to 51 
1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tech stocks got a lift after Hewlett-Packard reported stronger-than-expected 
quarterly earnings. H-P leaped 3 5/8 to 89 1/8, Intel gained 2 to 67, Motorola 
surged 3 1/8 to 104 1/2 and Xircom added 1 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
 But Newbridge Networks lost 3 5/8 to 61 5/8 despite reporting that quarterly 
earnings more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health maintenance organization stocks were higher on takeover speculation 
after United Healthcare and Ramsay-HMO agreed to merge. Among California HMOs, 
Wellpoint Health jumped 1 1/4 to 34 1/2 and PacifiCare Class A shares surged 2 
1/4 to 56. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, falling utility stocks included Commonwealth Edison, down 
1/2 to 26 1/2; Houston Industries, down 7/8 to 42 1/4, and Peco Energy, off 1/2 
to 25 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Surgical device maker U.S. Surgical plunged 5 5/8 to 21 1/2. A federal court 
jury ruled in favor of Johnson & Johnson in a patent infringement suit brought 
by U.S. Surgical. J&J slipped 1/2 to 41 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo stocks recovered slightly from the previous two days' losses 
brought on by the trade fight. The Nikkei index closed at 19,052.11, up 77.51 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX index closed at 2,136.61, up 20.99 points, while in 
London the FTSE-100 index gained 24.5 points to 3,417.7. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index snapped a five-day losing streak and rose 
19.64 points to 2,780.23 as 28-day Treasury bill yields fell to a historic low 
of 9.15%. Currency 
</P>
<P>
 Aggressive purchases of dollars by the Bank of Japan helped lift the dollar in 
overseas trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, however, the dollar closed at 103.80 yen, down slightly from 
103.85 on Tuesday but still well above the low of 101 reached Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of new developments in the trade fight between the United 
States and Japan, dealers said many are scrambling to buy back dollars sold in 
a hurry after the U.S.-Japan trade summit collapsed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The next test for the dollar could come today, when the government reports on 
the nation's January trade deficit. That could bring new calls for sanctions 
against Japan or for a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has said it is not interested in using the dollar as a weapon 
in the trade fight with Japan, but many currency traders are unconvinced. Other 
Markets 
</P>
<P>
 Investors found little reason to buy or sell bonds despite a report showing a 
steep decline in the housing industry last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's 30-year bond yield inched up to 6.46% from 6.45% a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said housing starts plunged 17.6% in January because 
of inclement weather and the Northridge earthquake. While lower starts normally 
would indicate a slowing economy, many bond traders expect the housing figures 
to rebound soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market will be tested today with the January consumer inflation 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil continued its slide. On the New York Merc, light, sweet crude for March 
fell 13 cents to $13.93 a barrel. Analysts said the market is poised to test 
the five-year low of $13.75 a barrel set in December. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lumber for March delivery soared $10 to $436.50 on the Chicago Merc as 
traders bet on a spring rebound in housing construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold eased on the New York Comex to $383.60 an ounce, down 20 cents from 
Tuesday. Silver closed at $5.27, up 1.9 cents.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: TOSHIBA SUB-NOTEBOOK LINE HITS MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For several years, Toshiba America led the portable personal computer industry 
with the lightest, most rugged and most powerful PCs on the market. But in 
recent years, the company has fallen behind Apple, Compaq and IBM. Toshiba 
never stopped building well-made notebook and laptop systems, but the machines 
were unimaginative, a little on the heavy side and had come to be a bit out of 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. Toshiba is back on track with its new Portege sub-notebook 
computers. I've been using the $2,599 T3400 monochrome version for a couple of 
weeks, and I'm quite impressed. It's about $100 more and half a pound heavier 
than IBM's ThinkPad 500, but I prefer its design. IBM doesn't even offer a 
color sub-notebook. Toshiba's active matrix color Portege (model T3400CT) costs 
$3,999. 
</P>
<P>
 Both new Toshibas come with DOS 6.0, Windows 3.1 and CommWorks for Windows, 
which lets you transfer files between computers by cable and also serves as 
telecommunications and fax software. 
</P>
<P>
 From a design standpoint, the Portege offers the best of both Apple and IBM. 
Like the Apple PowerBooks, the Portege's keyboard is recessed behind a platform 
where you can rest the heels of your hands. Aside from being more comfortable, 
it makes the machine easier to use if you don't have a desk or tray table to 
rest it on. Like all IBM ThinkPad models, the Portege has a 
pencil-eraser-shaped pointing device (in lieu of a mouse or track ball) that 
sticks up between G, H and B keys, letting you control the cursor with a single 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
 The mouse buttons, located on the palm rest, are large and easy to press. I 
found myself adapting very quickly to this method of pointing and clicking, 
while I've never been comfortable with the track balls built into most notebook 
PCs. I'm especially unhappy with Compaq's track balls, which, on most models, 
are in the upper right corner of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiba didn't just take the best of two worlds. It added some features of its 
own, including a high-capacity lithium ion battery that, according to the 
company, will run a monochrome unit for between four and eight hours and a 
color model from three to six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 I carried the monochrome version on a recent cross-country flight and did well 
for the five hours between San Francisco and Baltimore, although I did turn it 
off during dinner. The unit can be configured to go into a "sleep" or standby 
mode when you turn it off or close the cover. Turn it back on and everything 
comes back as you left it. I left mine in this state for several days without 
fully depleting the battery. 
</P>
<P>
 The monochrome version weighs 4.1 pounds; the color model is 4.4 pounds. It's 
9.9 inches wide, 7.9 deep and 1.8 high. The term sub-notebook generally refers 
to machines that weigh four pounds or less, so they're stretching it a bit. 
Notebook PCs usually weigh in at between 6 and 8 pounds, while laptops, which 
are no longer in great demand, weigh between 8 and 12. There are lots of terms 
to describe heavier portable machines. My favorite is "luggable." 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the size of the machine, Toshiba reduced the space between each key, 
resulting in a keyboard that's about 10% smaller than a standard PC keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a pretty fast touch typist and I did find myself having to slow down a 
little to use this keyboard, but it wasn't bad. Nevertheless, I'd like to see 
an ever-so-slightly larger version with normal spacing between the keys. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The machine has a 486SX microprocessor chip running at 33 megahertz. It comes 
with four megabytes of random access memory, expandable to 20. 
</P>
<P>
 It has a 120-megabyte hard disk and an external 3.5-inch floppy drive. There 
are the usual expansion ports, including a slot for a credit-card-size PCMCIA 
expansion card. PCMCIA cards can be used to add a modem, network adapter and 
other devices. A "port replicator" socket allows users to plug in an optional 
($239) connector that provides access to various external devices, such as an 
SVGA monitor and an external keyboard and mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The T3400 monochrome model has a passive 8.4-inch (diagonal) screen that's 
surprisingly easy to read. Unlike some passive matrix displays, it's able to 
keep up with rapid movements of the cursor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Porteges are more expensive than the competition, but they're well 
designed, rugged and have a very nice feel to them -- factors that can be 
important when considering a portable PC.

$80-MILLION WANG COMPLEX SELLS FOR $525,000 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wang Laboratories Inc.'s $80-million office complex in Lowell has been sold at 
auction for a mere $525,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyer Lou Pellegrine refused to say whom he represented or what is planned for 
the three 14-story buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Four bidders registered for the sale, plunking down $100,000 for the right to 
take part.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not disappointed. This was how much the property was worth today. The 
market establishes the value," said Frank J. Ryan, vice president for 
corporation communications for Wang. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex cost about $80 million to build but is now assessed at $20 
million, Lowell Assessor Sean McFadden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale sheds the last vestige of Wang's bloated former self. The company 
went into bankruptcy in 1992 after it missed out on the personal computer 
revolution. It has transformed itself chiefly into a software and services 
firm.

ROLLWAGEN EXPECTS TO FIND HIMSELF IN CHIPS AGAIN WITH YOUNG FIRM; COMPUTERS: 
EX-CRAY CHIEF ACCEPTED CHAIRMANSHIP OF CHATSWORTH-BASED PMT BECAUSE HE SEES IT 
POISED TO MAKE A BREAKTHROUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's a long way from heading supercomputer giant Cray Research. But for John 
Rollwagen, working for Chatsworth-based Plasma & Materials Technologies Inc. -- 
a small technology company often confused with a blood bank -- is like deja vu 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely fell in love with it," says Rollwagen, who was named PMT's 
chairman last month. "It reminded me so much of Cray in the middle '70s I could 
hardly stand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the local Yellow Pages mistakenly lists it as a blood products 
center, Plasma & Materials Technologies is actually a manufacturer of 
million-dollar machines used to etch materials on the surface of computer 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollwagen, 53, is best known as the former chief executive of Cray, where in 
12 years he presided over the firm's growth into an $800-million-a-year 
supercomputing powerhouse. Last year, he was nominated by President Clinton as 
deputy secretary of commerce, but he left the post before being confirmed by 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the young Cray Research, he says, PMT is a company with a unique 
technology poised to make a breakthrough. In Greg Campbell, 34, one of the 
firm's co-founders, it has a boyish chief executive the same age as Rollwagen 
when he started at Cray. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the year for PMT," Rollwagen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry analysts are dubious. They wonder if Rollwagen -- who will 
continue to live in Minnesota while working only part time at PMT -- can give 
the company a credibility boost in a very tough market and whether the Cray 
magic can work in another setting. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Rollwagen was on a completely different track. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long stint at Minneapolis-based Cray, he was headed for the No. 2 job 
at the Commerce Department. It was, he thought, "an opportunity to make a 
broader contribution and pay something back for what I had received myself at 
Cray." 
</P>
<P>
 But disillusionment quickly set in. 
</P>
<P>
 He figured that Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown "could take care of the 
politics and I could take care of the business, so to speak, of the Commerce 
Department," Rollwagen recalls. "Well, that was naive. I wasn't as much a 
politician as he. I have nothing against politicians, but I'm not one." 
</P>
<P>
 When he resigned in May, Rollwagen considered seeking a top position at a 
company of Cray's stature. Instead, he decided to pursue a different type of 
challenge and lend his expertise to smaller firms. Rollwagen started working as 
an adviser to St. Paul Venture Capital, a financial group that had invested in 
PMT. St. Paul publicized his arrival in its newsletter, and that made 
interesting reading for Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 With a Ph.D in plasma physics from UCLA, Campbell founded PMT in 1990 with one 
of his professors, Robert Conn. They developed a technology for producing 
gaseous plasmas, or ionized gases that, when stripped of their electrons, are 
highly reactive. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, PMT's technology makes a plasma out of chlorine gas. In turn, 
semiconductor manufacturers use plasmas to engrave patterns of electrical 
circuits onto the surface of their memory chips. PMT says its product can 
process more chips per hour than the competition's products. 
</P>
<P>
 Five large companies -- including Applied Materials Inc. in Santa Clara, 
Calif., and Lam Research Corp. in Fremont, Calif. -- command 60% of the 
$1-billion-a-year worldwide market for plasma-etch machinery. PMT is a 
pipsqueak with about a 1% market share. 
</P>
<P>
 G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research in San Jose, says credibility is 
a key issue for any company trying to break into the plasma-etch market: 
"People want to know if they order 100 of these machines, can the company build 
them? Will they go out of business?" 
</P>
<P>
 Privately held PMT, which employs 60 people and sells machines under the names 
Pinnacle and Apex, predicts revenue of $11 million for the year ending Feb. 28.

 Showing Hospitality: Rich Ottaviano, AST Research Corp. senior vice president, 
used UC Irvine's annual executive survey briefing Tuesday to lodge a complaint 
about many civic and business organizations in California.Too many of them call 
businesses only "for a donation, a cocktail party or a golf tournament," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, out-of-state chambers of commerce actively lobby California 
business executives to move to their locales. "Most states and cities are 
acting like Singapore did five years ago," Ottaviano said. 
</P>
<P>
 That means greeting out-of-town business executives at the airport, scurrying 
to find answers to their questions and generally serving as "a professional 
business organization," Ottaviano said.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF NEWPORT BEACH'S LINCOLN IS WARRANTED. OWNER'S LAWYER 
CHARGES 'WITCH HUNT.'

 The Orange County district attorney's office says it is considering an 
investigation that might lead to criminal charges against Newport Beach's 
Lincoln Mortgage & Loan Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Corporations has already filed a civil lawsuit 
accusing Lincoln's owner, Kenneth E. Sarvak, of fraud. Assistant Dist. Atty. 
Joe D'Agostino of the major fraud section said Wednesday that lawyers for the 
Corporations Department on Tuesday informally sent over the results of their 
own investigation, which led to the civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The D.A.'s office will decide whether a criminal investigation is warranted. 
The Corporations Department, which regulates the sale of securities in 
California, cannot bring criminal charges on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're asking us to look at their investigation and see if the district 
attorney's office wants to do a full-blown criminal investigation," D'Agostino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln Mortgage solicited millions of dollars from investors -- many of them 
elderly -- and ostensibly used much of the money to make second mortgages to 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the investors say they assumed their money was safe because they 
thought they were getting part of a deed to the home they were loaning money 
on. But in its lawsuit, the Corporations Department says Sarvak took in more 
money than he had deeds. By last year, he owed investors $30 million but held 
deeds to only about $9 million worth of property, the state contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, says Sarvak, 68. He says he didn't defraud anyone; he merely made some 
poor investments that went sour with the slump in Southern California real 
estate. His lawyer accuses the Corporations Department of having a vendetta 
against Sarvak. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations in the civil lawsuit were enough to persuade a judge to put a 
receiver in charge of another of Sarvak's companies in December. But Sarvak 
managed to have the receiver removed by putting the company into bankruptcy, 
and another judge refused to reinstate her. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Sarvak himself has filed for bankruptcy too, some investors -- there 
are several hundred -- may wind up with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarvak's lawyer said Wednesday that the Corporations Department is on "a witch 
hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 "They've had very little success on their own through the courts, so they're 
giving it to the district attorney to let him have a run at it," said John B. 
Casoria, the lawyer. "They're acting as prosecutor, judge and executioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in the end, Ken Sarvak will come up clean as a whistle."

DEVELOPER, DESIGN FIRM PLAN THEME PARK IN IRWINDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A local theme park development company has teamed with an Irvine design firm 
to explore the possibility of building a major theme park in Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Battaglia, president of Battaglia Associates in Irvine, confirmed 
Wednesday that his company and U.S. Entertainment Centers Inc. of Seal Beach 
are proposing to build a Disneyland-style park.The theme of the attraction and 
the types of rides have yet to be decided, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tentative plans for the park were presented at an Irwindale City Council 
meeting last month. A feasibility study is underway, the partners told council 
members, and several sites are under consideration, the most likely being an 
abandoned quarry off the San Gabriel River Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Battaglia, whose firm has designed theme parks in the Far East, said the 
project could cost as much as $100 million. Funding will be arranged after the 
concept is more fully developed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not going to be a quick solution," Battaglia said. "It will be quite 
a long process." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Southern California already has five major theme parks, Battaglia said, 
there is room for a sixth. In Florida, he noted, a Universal Studios park in 
Orlando has been a success even though it is close to Walt Disney World, with 
its three major parks, and a Sea World park. Visitors simply extend their 
trips, he said, so they can visit several attractions.

O.C. BOOSTERS PERSUADE MANUFACTURER TO STAY PUT; EMPLOYMENT: KNIGHT EQUIPMENT 
WAS BEING WOOED BY OTHER STATES, BUT SWEET TALK KEEPS THE COMPANY'S 100 JOBS IN 
COSTA MESA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County economic development groups scored a win Wednesday as Knight 
Equipment International, a maker of commercial dishwashing and laundry 
equipment, decided to keep 100 manufacturing jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
 William Russell, chief executive of Knight Equipment, said the company had 
seriously considered moving its headquarters out of California. After coaxing 
from various Orange County boosters, however, Russell decided to keep 
operations here for at least three more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a management team, we looked seriously at a number of different 
alternatives, and our Costa Mesa site simply offered us the very best value," 
Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Russell wrote a letter to Gov. Pete Wilson complaining of various 
obstacles in the state and said that his company was being wooed with offers of 
cash and land by other states, North Carolina in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 California's "red team" -- an economic development task force assigned to deal 
with such threats to the state's manufacturing base -- responded with a series 
of meetings. Together with Costa Mesa and Orange County officials, the state 
subsequently promised enough relief to persuade Knight to renew its lease for 
three years, said Charles Wilson, public affairs manager for Southern 
California Edison and a member of the red team. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight, which had a litany of complaints ranging from high workers' 
compensation costs and property taxes to the region's crime rate, was able to 
negotiate a lower lease and win promises of help with equipment financing. 
</P>
<P>
 While businesses do continue to move out of state, Wilson said, local efforts 
managed to prevent the exodus last year of 12 companies with a total of 3,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle isn't over. In a survey released this week by UC Irvine, 38% of 
Orange County businesses said they are somewhat or very likely to move away, 
while 62% said they are not likely to move. That compared to 30% that said in 
last year's survey that they were somewhat or very likely to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is trying to get an early-warning system to find out when companies 
are dissatisfied," said Ken Moore, president and chief executive of the Orange 
County Economic Development Consortium.  
</P>
<P>
 Russell said he hopes to see the state Legislature take further steps to 
reduce costs of making goods in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a guarantee for life," Wilson said. "We have bought three years 
as a window of opportunity to show that the state is serious about economic 
development."

PUTTING TIME ON THE SCHEDULER'S SIDE; SOFTWARE: PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY ADAPTIVE 
INC. OF NEWPORT BEACH AUTOMATES THE TIME-CONSUMING TASK OF CONFIGURING WORK 
SHIFTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a special kind of torture for America's managers and administrators 
who face the thankless task of creating a work schedule for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 As companies hire more part-timers, flex-timers and free-lance workers to 
supplement full-time salaried employees, the job of scheduling them all -- and 
balancing employee preferences against company needs -- is likened to juggling 
dozens of swords. 
</P>
<P>
 To schedulers, comments like "you scheduled me to work on my birthday," or 
requests such as "can I switch from Friday shifts to Thursdays?" are enough to 
make an intricately crafted timetable fall like a house of cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Forbes, president and founder of Adaptive Software Inc. in Newport Beach, 
believes he has a solution: a computer program called PeopleScheduler. Forbes 
wants to liberate schedulers by automating the process with graphics and making 
timetables easily customized and updated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scheduling is more intense now because the work force is changing and people 
want flexibility," he said. "Businesses need to pay attention to efficiency 
now. It makes a real difference to a business in having the right person in the 
right place at the right time. This gives managers control over their schedules 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which operates under Microsoft Corp.'s Windows or DOS formats, 
allows managers to instantly balance the requirements of the workplace with the 
personal schedule needs of employees.  
</P>
<P>
 For instance, if Mary wants to work weekends but the company does not want to 
pay more overtime, the program automatically adjusts for those factors to work 
out a schedule. When a conflict occurs, the program notifies the manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In the program, workers appear as bars on a timeline. The time period can be 
tweaked in increments of five minutes or eight hours for any number of workers. 
On the lower part of the screen, the displays show the names of employees, 
their work group, scheduled start and end times, breaks and type of shift such 
as overtime or normal.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To replace a sick worker, for example, the manager can automatically look up 
another worker's personal preferences and determine whether that person should 
be called in as a replacement. Once a substitution is made, the program 
automatically updates the rest of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The PeopleScheduler program is a timesaver, or maybe a lifesaver, for people 
like Janet O'Donnell, who manages 120 telemarketing representatives who take 
phone orders for baby products seller Right Start Catalog Inc. in Westlake 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell once spent 80% of her day creating work schedules on a crude 
computer spreadsheet. She constantly had to update it because the company 
depends on having 40 or 50 phone representatives available at peak times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I spend maybe half an hour a day on it and delegate it to others," she 
said. "We even kept our schedule together after the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 PeopleScheduler is the first of a series of such programs to be released by 
Adaptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "People see this program and slap their heads and say 'Why didn't I think of 
that before?' " said Forbes, a former United Parcel Service executive. "I got 
the head-slapping idea about four years ago. It's a new category, like a 
spreadsheet or database." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes figured that, as the recession thinned the ranks of middle managers, 
accurate scheduling became a bottom-line issue. Companies had to decide the 
optimum balance of full- and part-time workers and those working flexible 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent White House economic report said that part-time jobs grew three times 
faster than full-time jobs over the last three years. And contingent workers, 
people who work day to day as needed, account for 3% of all jobs, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such trends make scheduling even more difficult. To fully understand the 
challenges of creating a scheduling program, Forbes and his team spent 18 
months of field work to determine what managers needed. 
</P>
<P>
 This provided subtle insights, said Rob Frankel, vice president of marketing. 
For instance, managers wanted to include birthdays as part of the computer data 
on each employee, because many workers take those days off. But policies 
against age discrimination require that the year of birth be kept private to 
protect the employee. 
</P>
<P>
 PeopleScheduler tracks vacation and sick days, overtime, availability of 
employees, special skills, education, attendance, notes on any disciplinary 
actions, shifts traded between employees, break times, and other pertinent 
information. All this data can actually be used, the company says, to produce a 
kinder and gentler schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program will warn you of schedule conflicts that occur if you change one 
person's schedule," Forbes said. "It allows you to call up a list of possible 
replacements and immediately say if a change can be made." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It took Adaptive Software two years to take these principles of scheduling and 
build them into a program. The company launched the program last month at Demo 
'94, a trade show for industry insiders. PC Letter, an industry trade journal, 
gave its top show award to the company. Hundreds of calls for orders for the 
$495 program have come in, Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
 One television news station, KGO-TV in San Francisco, called up to arrange an 
interview with the company and instead placed an order for the program, 
according to a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Louderback, director of PC Week Labs, which reviews computer products, and 
a columnist for the industry trade journal PC Week, said he was impressed with 
PeopleScheduler and expects it will be useful for numerous industries. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike basic office software, such as spreadsheets and word processing 
programs, the market will be limited because PeopleScheduler would be used only 
by a scheduling manager, not every person in an office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, a manager sits down with a lot of yellow sticky notes and labors 
to come up with a schedule," he said. "Every manager is under the gun and with 
things like part-time and flex-time on the rise, employee scheduling becomes 
even more important. This is the first kind of new software category I've seen 
in years." 
</P>
<P>
 Louderback said there are alternatives to PeopleScheduler, but they are 
expensive -- one company wanted to sell one to O'Donnell for $8,000 -- and 
often limited to a specific industry. Because Adaptive thinks its program can 
be sold to numerous industries, the company has priced its product at $495, a 
common price for productivity software. 
</P>
<P>
 Though O'Donnell said she is thrilled with the PeopleScheduler, she says some 
employees have mixed feelings. Some less-than-ambitious workers, for instance, 
don't like the idea that the company can easily keep attendance and mark who 
leaves early. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel at Adaptive says the software is not meant to be used as a "Big 
Brother" monitoring tool. Managers can use it as they wish, but its main 
benefit is to allow managers to quickly approve schedule changes that are more 
convenient for the worker, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Leff, co-chairman of computer distributor Merisel Inc. in El Segundo, 
said he expects his company to distribute the PeopleScheduler software. The 
product is now available via direct mail through an 800 number. 
</P>
<P>
 "There hasn't been much software specifically to address this," he said. "I 
see it as creating a new category just like Aldus PageMaker created desktop 
publishing. I believe a very large number of people will need this." Says 
manager O'Donnell: "I still don't have any time, but at least I don't spend it 
working on the schedule." Adaptive Software at a Glance

 Head-Turning Gimmick: The California Restaurant Assn. will use a giant 
"upside-down chef" to send a message to President Clinton. Attendees at the 
CRA's Southern California Foodservice Exposition at the Anaheim Convention 
Center on March 20 and 21 will write their opinion of Clinton's health care 
plan on a giant figure of an upside-down chef. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying individual messages will be the association's stance on Clinton's 
controversial health care plan: "Employer-paid mandated health care would turn 
the food service industry on its head." 
</P>
<P>
 When they're not jotting a note to Clinton, attendees will have their pick of 
several seminars, including a program on recent immigration developments. The 
seminar will describe the rights and responsibilities of employers who might 
have hired employees who are not legal residents.

THE SCENE: UP FOR THE COUNT; THESE YOUNG MEN ARE REACHING FOR THE RING, AND 
IT'S NOT BRASS. IN AN ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES, THEY'RE GIVING IT THEIR 
BEST SHOT AT THE LA HABRA BOXING CLUB.

 By his peers' standards, Anthony Torres started late cultivating his talent. 
He was already 16 when he began training in a little basement in the South 
Bronx. He figured the streets made him a pretty good fighter and that through 
championship boxing he could get a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not sure what took him so long to get into a gym. Boxing has been sort of 
his destiny, because of a baby photo where he and his dad are both wearing 
gloves. It's his only memory of his father, who killed himself when his son was 
still an infant. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Anthony was beginning to confine his skills to the gym, his mother 
feared that he was hanging with a bad crowd. So two years ago, she sent him to 
Southern California to live with his older brother and sistr-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 The attention Anthony attracted here for his fighting style got him in some 
trouble, but it also got him to check out the La Habra Boxing Club, a 
city-funded program operated as an extension of the Boys and Girls Club of La 
Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 In this dank, former Catholic church, 45 aspiring fighters, mostly Latino, 
train. They range in age from 8 to 32, with 18, including Anthony, being 
groomed for the professional arena. In fact, there is a celebrity among them -- 
former world champion featherweight Jorge Paez, who at 28 is an old-timer, but 
who is waging a comeback this weekend at the Great Western Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Heroes such as Paez and Julio Cesar Chavez are partly the reason why Anthony 
and others at the club spend hours after school and on the weekends jumping 
rope, doing endless abdominal crunches, pounding the speed bag and sparring 
within the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 David Martinez, director of the boxing club since it opened in 1983, knows why 
they get into the ring. "These young, Latino men, many from Mexican barrios 
here in La Habra and the area . . . see their countrymen fight on TV, and they 
think, 'I want to be like him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez says it's also financial. "Boxing is an individual sport. A lot of 
kids can't afford to play on teams because of all the costs involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Since transplanting from New York, Anthony, now 18, has rediscovered school 
and pursued creative outlets such as drawing cartoons and writing rhymes for 
his rap band. And he trains hard for competition in the ring.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've changed a lot since moving here," admits Anthony, a senior at Pioneer 
High School in Whittier. "I used to fight a lot. I still have an attitude. But 
now I let trouble look for me instead of the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although trouble came with the scenery where Anthony's boxing mate Oscar 
Llamas grew up, he managed to escape it. His barrio is in Whittier, ironically 
where Anthony's mom thought her son would be better off. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gang members around me try to pick a fight with anyone, but they don't 
try to pick a fight with me. It's not because I'm into (boxing)," says Oscar, 
whose 5-6 body stands solid at 135 pounds. The introverted 17-year-old says he 
just wasn't a joiner. 
</P>
<P>
 But his homies are responsible for introducing him to his trainer, Ray 
Espinoza, when he was still in junior high. "He was out in the street 
recruiting. My friends weren't interested, but they knew I was, and they sent 
him my way." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Anthony, Oscar first connected to the sport through his dad, who would 
take his 8-year-old son to a gym near work to watch aspiring fighters train. 
The visits gave Oscar "a desire to box that never went away." 
</P>
<P>
 His parents are divorced, but, on the rare occasions that they see each other, 
Oscar's father reminds him to eat right and get enough sleep as part of the 
training.  
</P>
<P>
 His mother insists that he quit and "study to become a lawyer," says Oscar, 
who is finishing high school at Frontier Continuation School. "You know, every 
mother's dream. I wanna show her that I can do this. She thinks I can't. I want 
to show her that she can be proud of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tell her 'once I start making money and buying things you'll think 
different.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar rises at 4:30 a.m. to run five miles before school. He spends most 
Saturday mornings at the club, so Friday nights he usually finishes early. He's 
learned to be more self-assured -- although he's still shy about his 
achievements -- and to stay focused. "They tell me I've got talent. I think I'm 
good, but I don't have a big head. I have confidence in myself. If I lose, it's 
not going to be an easy win." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Anthony, even on days when he'd rather sink into his bed, he endures 
the hassle of getting transportation to the club. While other teens feed on 
junk, the 5-6 fighter had to lose seven pounds this week to make the 125-pound 
limit for a local amateur match Friday. He cranked the salsa music that he says 
"psyches" him up to work out harder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both guys are prepping fiercely right now for state level entries in the 
biggest amateur competition, the Golden Gloves, next month in Los Angeles' 
Lincoln Park.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like boxing because I want to become something," notes Oscar. "I want to 
stay away from drugs, from all the party scene, especially the shootings. It 
keeps me off the streets. I come out of a session, and it's a different world. 
My blood's pumping; I'm all banged up. I come home tired, take a shower and 
burn out for the night. That's my definition of partying." 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, he's been staying at his trainer's house. The move got him 
out of the neighborhood and focused, he says.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ray is like my friend in some ways; sometimes he's like my dad. He and his 
wife aren't really strict, but they give me chores. I now always clean my room, 
wash the dishes," he says wit a laugh. "I'm being responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Both young men are driven by a need to set themselves apart from the rest, not 
unlike a student who spends hours poring over books to earn a degree or an 
artist laboring over the creation of a masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boxing is the most important thing right now," says Anthony, who also spends 
his spare time with some of his brothers and cousins in their rap group, 
Nonsense. Between rehearsals and workouts, he doodles cartoons and hangs with 
his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the women in his life worry about him getting "messed up, or, God 
forbid, brain damaged," he says, the risks aren't enough to dissuade him from 
boxing and pursue one of his other talents. If Shaquille O'Neal can rap and 
play basketball, then why can't he rap and box? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sport. I don't go in there to beat someone up and be bad. Boxing is a 
test of endurance. It just shows what you can do and what you're about," 
Anthony says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q uien es mas macho is also what it's about, although Anthony is reluctant to 
call it a test of machismo. His views trigger his girlfriend to call him a 
"typical man." As he says: "Boxing, it ain't for women. There's no place for 
them boxing inside a ring. I don't know who would pay to see women fight. They 
should stick to tennis or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Like something more graceful, he agreed. Wasn't part of Muhammad Ali's legend 
built on a grace that only emphasized his own strength? But not all is lost to 
primal thinking. Oscar says he thinks the fad of women boxers is cool. "I just 
wouldn't know where to hit her." 
</P>
<P>
 What will set these guys apart from becoming another boxing cliche is that 
they want to avoid ending up like Jake LaMotta, whose life Robert De Niro 
immortalized in Martin Scorsese's 1980 "Raging Bull," Oscar's favorite fight 
flick. Anthony prefers the eternal hope and happy Hollywood endings of the 
Rocky series. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sport," Oscar says. "And it's an art -- even though it's brutal. I 
think about how these guys are beating the hell out of each other for the money 
and to entertain other people. It almost makes me laugh. But I know they're 
just trying to win something, to be a champion. To become a champion at 
anything has to be the greatest feeling a guy can have." 
</P>
<P>
 More significant than the blood they're sure to taste getting there is 
savoring the satisfaction of always giving their best shot.

THE UNIFORM OF PEACE?; A DRESS CODE IN LONG BEACH COULD INSPIRE OTHER SCHOOLS 
THAT FEAR GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Waiting for a ride home from Franklin Middle School one recent afternoon, 
Synath Meas was decked out in an over sized, striped button-down shirt; baggy 
purple jeans; matching purple lipstick, and trendy tan leather work shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 But if officials at the Long Beach Unified School District have their way, 
Synath, 14, and her peers at Franklin will soon wear only black and white to 
class. In an effort to curb gang-related violence, the district board recently 
voted to require all 57,500 students in elementary and middle schools to wear 
uniforms beginning next school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy is the most aggressive yet by a public school district as officials 
across the nation move toward uniformity in the name of safety. Many districts 
have banned gang-style or introduced voluntary uniform policies, but Long Beach 
is the first to issue a districtwide requirement, said Edward Eveland, a board 
member and the policy's architect. 
</P>
<P>
 And others might follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have talked and joked about going to uniforms like the private schools 
have for years," said Phil Kauble, a consultant with the Los Angeles County 
Office of Education. "But once a district like Long Beach raises an issue . . . 
most districts will take a 'look-and-see' policy. People will look to see how 
it's implemented and what the challenges are." 
</P>
<P>
 A bill pending in the state Senate would eliminate potential legal obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the legislation proceeds and is enacted, I think more districts will 
proceed on this tack," said Karin Polacheck, Long Beach board president. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the trend, school administrators say, is simple: Picking the 
right styles and colors each morning used to be a matter of taste and fashion; 
now it can be a matter of life and death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few weeks go by when students go unchallenged because of the way they 
look," Eveland said. "If a gang doesn't recognize you, they say 'Where you 
from?' If you give the wrong answer, they beat the hell out of you or you get 
shot at." 
</P>
<P>
 By eliminating the gang-style clothing often donned by students who like the 
look but are not gang members, officials hope to stop confrontations and 
mistaken-identity violence. Advocates say uniforms are cheaper than regular 
school dress and help blur the distinction between the haves and the have nots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach policy could face legal challenges at the state and federal 
level, and the state Education Code offers little guidance, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The code allows districts to enact "reasonable dress code regulations" to ban 
gang-related apparel but makes no mention of uniforms, said Allan Keown, deputy 
general counsel at the state Department of Education. Keown said districts are 
generally free to take actions not expressly prohibited by the code. 
</P>
<P>
 But schools are not allowed to require students to purchase something to 
attend school, said Susie Lange, a spokeswoman for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been challenged," she said. "Not over uniforms, but over 
instructional materials. It's been upheld every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Eveland believes that the policy is an integral part of stopping school 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to say to the community that school business is serious business," he 
said. "Our job, the scope of it, has widened. . . . We shouldn't have to 
shoulder the load. I'm talking about gangs, sex education, teaching kids right 
from wrong and drugs. As educators, we're not good at those things. We have to 
get back to concentrating on student achievement. And we've known for years 
that behavior is affected by the way kids dress. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as interfering with individual rights, kids don't have the same rights 
in school as they do outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Although district officials expect the policy to be challenged, Eveland said 
there has been minimal backlash so far. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Bill 1269, authored by Sen. Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi), would insert a 
uniform provision into the Education Code. The bill is scheduled to go to 
committee in March, said Wayne Piercy, director of legislative services for the 
Long Beach school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will give us a more solid base in the state for other districts" to enact 
mandatory policies, Piercy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Elementary School Principals, continues to get inquiries 
about uniforms, said Sam Sava, executive director of the 26,000-member 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a slam-dunk issue," he said in a telephone interview from 
Alexandria, Va. "You can't just make a decision and pass a policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sava noted a rise in the popularity of uniform policies from Atlanta 
to Washington D.C., he said the programs were only moderately successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are schools that build an esprit de corps around the uniforms," he 
said. "Others adopt a policy and after a couple of years decide that it's not 
worth the issues it brings up. I don't think having a uniform gets at the basic 
issue of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it keeps no statistics, the California School Boards Assn. also 
reports an increase in interest in uniforms, spokeswoman Patti Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each school in the Long Beach district will be allowed to chose its uniform. 
"We wanted to create a culture at the schools, rather than paint the district 
with a brush," Polacheck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy affects 14 middle schools and 56 elementary schools. High schools 
were exempted from the requirement because board members expected a great deal 
of student resistance, Eveland said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Franklin Middle School, black and white is now the theme, in T-shirts or 
button-downs, pants (black jeans are OK, but not blue), shorts and skirts. 
School T-shirts are also available for about $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Franklin students question the value of mandatory uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 For Synath Meas, it's a matter of freedom of choice. "It's not right, people 
can wear anything they want," she said. "I don't want to always wear black and 
white. I don't like it. I won't wear it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernalee Mailoto, 12, said: "I think black and white is gang attire, too. 
If you look at most gangs, they don't wear red or blue." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to help us, but they're not changing anything," added Meagan 
Kindler, 13. "We'll still get jumped. This is the inner city, it's not going to 
change. You have to change the neighborhoods first; put the kids behind bars 
who belong there." 
</P>
<P>
 Others supported the policy, saying it will make the school -- and the walk 
home -- safer. "It's better than getting shot," said Rodolpho Carrillo, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Collins, Franklin principal and a uniform advocate, said: "School is a 
business environment and this is a way to further enhance that. . . . It will 
eliminate the gang look. When they have 'Wildcats' plastered across their 
chest, they're in my gang. The Franklin posse." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no more important business than the work of getting smart," said Jan 
Leight, principal of the Long Beach district's Newcomb Academy. "We're saying 
Newcomb Academy is your work place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because Long Beach enacted the first districtwide mandate, there are few 
models to learn from. But many Southern California districts have had voluntary 
policies for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District has four elementary schools with 
voluntary policies, said spokesman Pat Spencer, and the Pomona Unified School 
District has 11. Many other public schools have adopted policies of their own 
in Los Angeles and Orange counties.  
</P>
<P>
 "It gets around this gang clothing business and it's worked to lessen the 
theft of clothes in school," said Lange of the state Department of Education. 
"Parents feel it's much cheaper than having to buy a whole wardrobe and it 
lessens the social pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Knight, superintendent of Ravenswood Unified, said her Northern 
California district became the first to adopt the voluntary policy in 1990. 
"The only negative involved . . . is if parents feel something's being imposed 
on them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal poll of Long Beach families conducted by the local Education 
Council of African-American Parents found that 171 parents and students favored 
the policy, while 54 opposed it, said Sharon Diggs-Jackson, the group's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to having uniforms," said Diggs-Jackson, who has three 
children in the district and one in private school. "It's less expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Jacobs, who has two children in Long Beach's public Bayside Academy, 
added: "We had a few parents who were unhappy with (the mandatory uniform 
policy), but for the most part they are behind it emphatically. I wish we had a 
videotape of the kids last year and this year. It's truly amazing the 
difference in attitude. They come to school ready to work and they're 
respectful."

 Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner -- for years an advocate for 
abused, abandoned and neglected children at Orangewood -- was named Children's 
Champion at the first benefit staged by CASA (Court Appointed Special 
Advocates) on Friday at Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 guests watched Steiner receive a large Lucite crayon engraved with 
the CASA logo for his work on behalf of the empowerment of children. 
</P>
<P>
 ( This was a benefit with an eye on efficiency. Organizers promised no 
long-winded speeches and guaranteed festivities would conclude by 10:30 p.m. 
They delivered.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other child activists honored at the affair were Evelyn Gibson, named 
volunteer of the year; Gene Howard, public service honoree, and Donald Boortz, 
community and financial support honoree.

 Joining the Joyners: Olympic gold medalists Florence Griffith Joyner and Al 
Joyner were named athletes of the year on Tuesday night at a gala staged by the 
Padrinos support group of Children's Hospital of Orange County at the 
Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flo Jo" has been called the world's fastest woman for her still-standing 
world record times in the 100- and 200-meter women's track events. She holds 
three Olympic gold medals and two silver medals. Her husband holds a gold medal 
for the triple jump. Peter Ueberroth, organizer of the 1984 Olympics in Los

 Encore: When tenor saxophonist Kenny G appeared with Michael Bolton at the 
Cystic Fibrosis Guild of Orange County's 1992 gala at the Disneyland Hotel, 
more than $300,000 net was realized . 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Kenny G is coming back. (Bolton has other commitments.) On May 27, the 
musician with the long, curly hair and laid-back style will appear before 700 
guests at a gala chaired by Dean Gerrie, Karen Hall and Sue Hook. 
</P>
<P>
 And this time, the Grammy Award winner will likely attend a preconcert 
reception for gala sponsors. "This time around he has a better understanding of 
what we do," says Hook, a long-time activist in the fight against CF, a 
congenital disease of children characterized by frequent respiratory 
infections. "So, chances are good he'll spend some private time with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hook watched Kenny G perform at a New York gala for CF in January. "He told me 
he was really excited about coming back to Orange County," she said. Tickets at 
$250 per person include dinner, dancing, live auction and the performance. 
Patrons who donate $500 each will receive special seating and gifts.

 A jewel of an entertainer: "The Phantom of the Opera" star Davis Gaines will 
perform at the Pacific Symphony Orchestra's "Symphony of Jewels" benefit on May 
7 at the Hyatt Regency Irvine. Also on the bill for the $175-per-person 
fund-raiser is French Canadian pianist Alain Lefevre, who recently made a 
compact disc recording with the orchestra. (Lefevre has been a featured soloist 
with the Montreal, Toronto and Houston symphonies and will soon tour Japan with 
with the Moscow Virtuosi.) The ball will be underwritten by Tiffany & Co. at 
South Coast Plaza. For ticket information, call (714) 755-5788.

 Premiere benefit for Child Development Center: Floss and Ed Schumacher will 
receive the Dr. James Satterfield Award at the first benefit staged by the 
Child Development Center of UC Irvine on Feb. 26 at the Center Club in Costa 
Mesa. Satterfield was a forerunner in research for children with Attention 
Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). 
</P>
<P>
 The Schumachers, who live in Palm Desert, have long been activists on behalf 
of mental health causes in Orange County. They have worked on behalf of the UCI 
Brain Imaging Center Committee and the Foundation for the Retarded.

 If the Long Beach schools' mandatory uniform policy succeeds, it will be 
partly because of people like Dr. Charles Durnin. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board recently voted to require all 57,500 kindergarten through 
eighth-grade students to wear uniforms beginning next school year, without 
providing funds to help underprivileged families pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Durnin, one of almost 350 "business partners" adopted by the district 
three years ago to offer funding and other help to specific schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have businesses across the community that identify with a specific 
school," said Karin Polacheck, school board president. "It's the type of 
personal relationship that brings in money for uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Durnin, an orthopedic surgeon whose son attends private school, donated $2,000 
to Rogers Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been happy with the school system," Durnin said. "The reason my son 
is in private school is that he's an excellent student and there are a lot of 
kids in public school who don't want to learn. Anything I can do to change the 
environment, I'd like to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Rogers were grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was all we needed," said Principal Pat Lawrence.  
</P>
<P>
 Bob Carney, dean of students, said: "We do have a problem with poverty. We 
have kids who can't afford more than one uniform and they're hard to keep 
clean. But now I can sit in my window and spot a stranger on campus and be on 
him. And kids don't have to sweat the gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Uniforms in Long Beach will be different at every school. Most consist of 
pants, shorts or a skirt and a polo-type shirt or blouse in school colors.  
</P>
<P>
 "The uniforms we're discussing are not elaborate, where you would have to buy 
expensive shoes or jackets," said Dick Van Der Laan, a district spokesman. "The 
uniforms cost less than regular school clothing, so parents will save money." 
</P>
<P>
 Two sets of clothing should cost less than $75, Van Der Laan said. In the 10 
Long Beach test schools where voluntary uniform policies were enacted last 
year, Van Der Laan said cost was not a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is relying on business partners, PTAs and churches for funding, 
Van Der Laan said. Although specifics are not yet worked out, one of the goals 
is to equip schools with loaner uniforms that students might use if they arrive 
in street clothes. And while many officials in Long Beach don't expect problems 
with costs, some districts already in uniform have found it difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "My community is quite needy economically; 98% of the families are well below 
the poverty level," said Judith Magsaysay, principal of Pio Pico Elementary 
School in Santa Ana, where a voluntary policy was adopted in 1991 at the 
request of parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the policy has worked well, she said. About 75% of the students own a 
uniform and about 50% wear them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who can't afford it can usually keep up with the colors," she said.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; BEYOND BARRIERS; SCHOOLS: TEEN-AGERS WITH 
DISABILITIES ENTER THE MAINSTREAM IN PROGRAMS ADAPTED TO INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT WENZEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES, Robert Wenzel is a junior at Irvine 
High School in Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most high school students struggle to balance schoolwork, jobs, sports and 
social lives. Students with disabilities deal with those things and more -- 
such as navigating physical barriers and other obstacles, including the 
misconceptions of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of teens with a wide range of disabilities attend regular and 
specialized classes at Orange County high schools; some need no special 
services; others need programs adapted to their individual situation.  
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Berger, a junior at Irvine High School, has osteogenesis imperfecta, 
better known as brittle bone disease. Because his disease causes the bones to 
break if they're even slightly jarred, Berger is confined to a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bugs me a little bit because I can't go to parties and that kind of stuff, 
but it's no biggie," Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgie Mendonca, an aide, takes Berger to and from his classes and lunch to 
protect him from jarring. "The student body has been friendly for the most 
part; nobody's been rude with Ryan," Mendonca said. Still, Mendonca says 
students need more information about those with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students in general need to be made more aware of the differences here on 
campus, and they need to more fully understand and accept these students for 
who they are," Mendonca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andi Drayer, also a junior at Irvine High, has a visual disability and short 
stature as a result of a brain tumor at age 12.  
</P>
<P>
 To help her reading, Drayer uses a magnifier, large-print books and a special 
monitor in the school library that enlarges an entire page of a book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't find it difficult to fit in with everybody else -- I'm just an 
average person," Drayer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school's goal for the special education students is to include them as 
completely as possible in the regular education program," Irvine High School 
principal Gail Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also provide support services in every way possible with instructional 
aides, like computers and instruments to enlarge type for students with visual 
problems," Richards added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although mixing special education and mainstream students is a goal of the 
Irvine Unified School District, that isn't the case in all districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitude of most school districts is that the special education students 
need to be treated differently, and there's usually a reluctance to include 
them in normal academic and social activities," said Nancy Melgares, a program 
specialist in the Irvine Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the Irvine programs for specific conditions are centered at a 
particular school. 
</P>
<P>
 "At University High, there's a program in place to help the hearing-impaired 
as well as the disabled, and different needs are met at both University and 
Woodbridge (high schools) through buses for the students, as well as job 
coaches," Irvine school psychologist Susan Rashap said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to provide an individual educational plan for each special 
education student, and it's tailor-made to meet the strengths and weaknesses of 
each student. We try to provide as much mainstream as possible, and there's 
also individual and small groups working on social skills," Rashap said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest problems, say some students, is getting noticed on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has been very nice and considerate with me. They don't consider me 
a student with a disability; rather, they consider me like any other student on 
campus," said Irvine High special education student Maryam Abdollahi.  
</P>
<P>
 Richards thinks the mainstream approach has been a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard from students and faculty members alike that they appreciate the 
diversity of having special education students in the classrooms, because it's 
another way to look at people as individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 And it has helped others see the whole person. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mainstream students get to know the person inside, instead of making a 
judgment based on the handicapped students' external characteristics," Richards 
said.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; THOSE WHO CANNOT SEE FIND WAYS TO ADAPT; 
ACTIVITIES: THROUGH THE USE OF BRAILLE, COMPUTERS AND AUDIO TAPE, VISUALLY 
IMPAIRED TEENS CAN PURSUE A RANGE OF INTERESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA OKIKAWA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES, Lisa Okikawa is a senior at Cypress High 
School in Cypress. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Blanks, 17, is a chess player, music fan and honors student at Anaheim 
High School. From promoting the chess club he and another student founded to 
pursuing an interest in guitar, Blanks is by any standard an extremely active 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also blind. 
</P>
<P>
 Though visual impairment can drastically alter life, adaptive techniques allow 
for Blanks and other teens to participate in a wide range of activities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Orange County Braille Institute in Anaheim, classes range from adaptive 
cooking to country line dancing to gardening. Blanks is a member of the Braille 
Institute Youth Group, which offers activities that include rock-climbing and 
surfing and classes to promote self-esteem as well as personal skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanks is one of seven visually impaired students at Anaheim High, which has 
had a visually handicapped program for about 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anaheim (high school) has a class where (texts) can be put into Braille. 
There is a lot of equipment and technology . . . so it's not as hard as people 
think," Blanks said. A computer class is held for the visually impaired so 
students can learn on a special type of computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanks, who has honors classes in U.S. history and English, studies with the 
help of textbooks in Braille and materials on tape. "Tape takes up less space. 
Braille is a lot bulkier, but when reading Braille, you can just go to the page 
and find (what you're looking for). 
</P>
<P>
 "When you first learn (Braille), you learn each letter and each number. 
Braille is a lot bigger than print, and they have contractions to write more in 
less space," said Blanks, who began learning to read Braille at age 3. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born with glaucoma, which can damage the optic nerve. "They said I 
could see for a few months, and then it went away totally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do things people might not think I'm able to do, like shooting baskets, and 
I like a lot of TV shows," Blanks said. "When you're born blind . . . that's 
the way you're used to having things. . . . It's much harder for people who 
weren't born blind," Blanks said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Those who lose their sight after having had vision usually find it a difficult 
transition. The modification of life varies with each person. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends a lot on their background," said Marajean Davis, a counselor at 
the Orange County Braille Institute in Anaheim. "Sometimes it's trust . . . 
because they no longer have vision to confirm things. Giving up and letting go 
of who you are and how you did things . . . learning the new you. Some people 
think they're going to get their sight back. Denial is a thing they have to 
overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 One Anaheim student who lost her eyesight described her experience this way: 
"I was such a visual person, so it's harder to make that adaptation to sound," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to know about colors and the setting around me or on TV. I miss seeing 
people's expressions. I miss not being able to read and write. It was a hard 
adjustment," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Losing one's sight is often similar to the grieving process after losing a 
person to death, according to Davis.  
</P>
<P>
 Usually the first emotion is plain shock, followed by denial, depression or 
anger. "Then it comes time when they start to learn or accept their loss," 
Davis said. "Accepting doesn't mean liking it . . . they have to accept its 
reality, which means coping." 
</P>
<P>
 Small things they once took for granted, such as nonverbal cues between 
people, are lost, making communication more strenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has seen "very few people who haven't really lost a lot of self-esteem 
when they lost their sight." 
</P>
<P>
 If dealing with vision loss, Davis says, "Give yourself permission to grieve 
your loss. You're not crazy because you want to cry or be depressed or angry. 
Find positive ways to get rid of your anger. If you don't go through that 
grieving process, you postpone it, and it can build up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are so many misconceptions, those unfamiliar with blindness are 
sometimes uncomfortable or afraid around a visually impaired person. 
</P>
<P>
 "To overcome a fear, you need to experience it. The visually impaired person 
isn't contagious," Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
 One common assumption is that the person lives in darkness. However, only 10% 
of the visually impaired are totally blind. "Ninety percent of those classified 
as blind have light perception of some kind and have some kind of vision," 
Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the first thing a seeing person notices about them is their use of a 
guide dog or white cane, the visually impaired want to be known as people 
first, not as being blind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blind people are people, like everyone else," Blanks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have all the problems of other people, all the feelings and 
capabilities. We're not a different race; we're just like everyone else!" 
</P>
<P>
 Davis adds: "When we say 'a blind person,' we take away from their 
person-hood. It points out their disability before the person." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim student who is dealing with the loss of her sight said she wishes 
that there could be more training in how to treat the visually impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my experiences, places like hospitals don't know what to do because they 
don't come across visually impaired people very often. Therefore, we aren't 
helped the way we should be. We are either ignored or spoken to loudly," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should remember that we could do just about anything anyone else would 
do. It may just take us a little longer . . . it's all in (our) attitude."

 "Of course! Because if they didn't, who would serve us our greasy Big Macs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Hofstetter, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Loara 
</P>
<P>
 "No, because having a job is really stressful, and the money isn't worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Alvarez, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Santiago 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, they're practicing for leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Dung Ha  
</P>
<P>
 freshman, Saddleback 
</P>
<P>
 "No, unless you're a senior who's slacking." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Reisdorf, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 "Learning doesn't come only from the classroom. If a job doesn't interfere 
with schoolwork and grades, it is a good experience. I'm a bank teller and 
student, but it's not for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Monette, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Rosary 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the question is should teens hold a job; I believe many 
students feel it is a necessity to have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Gallagher, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Capistrano Valley  
</P>
<P>
 "No, they shouldn't, because it messes up your grades." 
</P>
<P>
 David Lindberg, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it teaches responsibility. You don't have to mooch off your parents 
or friends for money." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Harrell, 16 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 "School should always be your first priority, but if you can keep up with 
both, then go for it. In the future you have to balance a career and a family, 
so this will give you an advantage because you already have some experience. 
Also, when you're out of high school and looking for a new job, you already 
have a lot of work experience. Your application will be more impressive 
</P>
<P>
 than someone who has never worked. I think as long as it doesn't affect your 
grades, you should do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Silvia Serna, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends. I think kids should get involved with school activities, but if 
their family needs the money, I guess they don't have a choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany Alvis, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Kennedy  
</P>
<P>
 "No. Teens should maintain a high academic level. Only weekend jobs would be 
acceptable, or possibly summer jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Paras, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "They should if they want to and need the money, but they shouldn't be forced 
to unless money is an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Newkirk, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can keep up the responsibilities that they have in the process, then 
I think that getting a job is a good choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Jumi Pak, 16 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Los Amigos 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we need money. Why shouldn't we keep a job?" 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Tolen, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Westminster  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, if they can work it into their schedule without interfering with their 
classes. School is definitely more important, because it will lead to more 
permanent jobs than anything you could have now." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie Cammack, 16 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Fountain Valley  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, because you get to meet new and exciting people." 
</P>
<P>
 Adele Aguirre, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Canyon 
</P>
<P>
 "Depends on the situation. Some can handle it, but others may not be able to. 
Their grades can drop. It is a good way to teach students responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanie Lee, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Marina 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think teens should because it takes up too much time." 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Held 
</P>
<P>
 freshman, Saddleback 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a job is a big responsibility, and if you believe you can handle it, 
then you should. School should always be the No. 1 priority though." 
</P>
<P>
 John Doan, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Ocean View 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think teens should hold a job while in school. High school is an 
important time in your life to concentrate on your studies." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Joag, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, El Dorado 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, because real-world lessons are taught." 
</P>
<P>
 Lam Nguyen, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Saddleback 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, if they want or need the money. But it should not be a job that takes 
too much time or is so demanding that they can't keep up in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Breanna Poston, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Foothill 
</P>
<P>
 "In my case, having a job keeps me busy; it helps to prevent me from acquiring 
the 'couch-potato syndrome.' Having a job also teaches me how to budget my 
time. It is also important to have money in your pocket for those emergencies, 
when you're bored out of your mind and want to do something other than staring 
into the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Barbieri, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 "Students should have the opportunity to work during the school year. If a 
person has the need to work to better themselves, more power to them, but 
they're going to have to reorganize and prioritize work, school and social 
life. A person should always have an option to do so, but why rush it if you 
have the rest of your life to work?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mina Vasquez, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Rosary 
</P>
<P>
 "Some can; some can't. It's a matter of how well they handle daily tasks." 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Mar, 14 
</P>
<P>
 freshman, Loara 
</P>
<P>
 "Some teens, like me, are trying to earn money for college. As long as my 
grades don't fall, there's no harm." 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Nguyen, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Santiago 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are capable of it, then more power to them. But their education 
should be put first." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Soto, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, El Modena 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, some people have to because of financial reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Ai-Tien Chau, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Westminster 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that a job shows a sense of responsibility. It also allows you to 
earn your own money and not have to depend on your parents and makes you more 
independent. I only wish I had the time for an after-school job."

 Administrators at Canyon High School in Anaheim have decided to conduct breath 
analyzer tests of students at school social and athletic events if they suspect 
the students have been drinking.  
</P>
<P>
 Only students who show unusual behavior, have an odor of alcohol, have been 
reported by others to have been drinking or who are in possession of alcohol 
will be tested with the hand-held, portable alcohol breath analyzer, according 
to the student newspaper, the Smoke Signals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to have to use it," assistant principal John Besta said. "Don't 
come (to a social event) if you've been drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy was in effect at the Winter Formal on Feb. 4, but school 
administrators found no cause to give the breath test to any students.

 High school playoffs for winter sports start this week, and there is no 
shortage of hot contenders: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mater Dei will try for a third consecutive Southern Section boys' basketball 
championship. The Monarchs are ranked second in the nation by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 * The unbeaten Brea Olinda girls seek their sixth consecutive section 
basketball title and fourth straight state championship. Also headed into the 
playoffs undefeated is Woodbridge, but the teams aren't on a collision course; 
they compete in different divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marina enters the girls' soccer playoffs ranked No. 1 in the section and 
county. The Vikings shared the Division I title with Claremont last season. In 
boys' soccer, defending Division II champion Santa Ana Valley and Division IV 
co-champions Santa Margarita return as unseeded entrants. The county's 
top-ranked team, Corona del Mar, is seeded fourth in Division IV. 
</P>
<P>
 * Calvary Chapel looks to make it back-to-back section and state wrestling 
titles, and El Modena hopes to improve upon last year's Division I runner-up 
status.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; MAKING A DIFFERENCE A WORLD AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM ABRAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES, Jim Abrams is senior at Santa Margarita 
High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While most of the world has watched the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina with a 
feeling of helplessness, a determined few have taken action and made a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are Mazen Faysal and Ruba Kharuf. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita High School sophomores were inspired when Randy McCord, 
their world history teacher, posted articles from The Times about Sonia Hagel 
of Huntington Harbour. Hagel, through the organization Operation Second Chance, 
has made repeated humanitarian trips to the former Yugoslav republic to aid the 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Faysal and Kharuf, both Muslims, sought support for Hagel's efforts from 
others at their Catholic school in Rancho Santa Margarita and in surrounding 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to help because it seemed like a practical way to reach out to the 
victims," Kharuf said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone trees were established to hospitals throughout Orange and Los Angeles 
counties in hopes that donations of hospital bedsheets or gowns, a rare 
commodity in the war zone, could be made. McCord started a daily money 
collection in his history classes and launched a letter-writing campaign to 
support hospital victims injured in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Within five months, Faysal and Kharuf had gathered more than 400 hospital 
bedsheets and gowns. Last Friday, they packaged those supplies, hundreds of 
letters and about $130 and drove them to Santa Monica, where Operation Second 
Chance is located. The donations will be sent to a desperate hospital in the 
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 McCord had high praise for the work of Faysal and Kharuf, citing their efforts 
as an excellent example of hard work and charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Faysal offered this advice to others: "Try to get involved with something; as 
long as you're involved, it matters. You don't have to be powerful or have a 
lot of money to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if he is glad the project is over, he replied, "For me this in not 
the end, when the war is over I'll stop. I just hope more high schools can give 
opportunities like this." 
</P>
<P>
 For additional information on the program call (310) 458-2849 or write to 
"Operation Second Chance," Sonia Hagel, 7605 Santa Monica Blvd., No. 685, West 
Hollywood, CA 90046.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; MY TURN; WHEN STARS FALL FROM GRACE, THEY BRING 
IDEALS BACK TO EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER BEAUVAIS, Jennifer Beauvais is a junior at Mater Dei High School in 
Santa Ana. This article first appeared in the school newspaper, the Scarlet 
Scroll. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many famous personalities become idols for youth. However, when those ideal 
people are involved in negative things, an unhealthy message may be conveyed to 
their young fans. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of fans, stars of the screen, sports world, radio or politics may 
seem perfect. But what is the idolizer to think when his or her favorite star 
falls from grace? Sometimes the pressure of trying to be perfect may be enough 
to make them fall. Fans experience shock, awe and confusion over what their 
idols have done to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age girls hooted with adoration when River Phoenix appeared on the movie 
screen in such features as "Stand by Me" and "My Own Private Idaho." Last fall, 
the 23-year-old actor died of a drug overdose, shattering their image of him 
and of their own immortality. Many teen-agers felt disbelief at the death of an 
actor so close to their age. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar disbelief was felt when revered NBA basketball player, Earvin (Magic) 
Johnson, disclosed that he was HIV-positive, a precursor to AIDS. His admirers 
were many and they said he existed as a model for achievement and self-esteem; 
many had modeled themselves after him. Johnson redirected his position in the 
spotlight when he decided to campaign to find a cure to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The music group Queen produced many songs that are still listened to today. 
Their songs, "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions," have become 
traditional fight songs for sports games. But it was a sad shock when lead 
singer Freddie Mercury died of AIDS. His musical accomplishments were 
celebrated by a group of well-known musicians on a TV special and Americans 
everywhere keep his music playing. 
</P>
<P>
 The public watches and wonders at the soap-opera lives of stars. All too 
often, the public's idealized images of these famous people is spoiled.  
</P>
<P>
 The public's eyes grow wide with shock when celebrities such as superstar 
Michael Jackson and child-entertainer Pee Wee Herman find themselves in 
negative categories. They bite their lips when the Prince of Wales cheats on 
his wife. They shake their heads when stars marry in what looks like a 
mismatch. And they wonder why models such as Kate Moss set the trend of being 
as thin as a wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many fans enjoy idolizing their favorite people, satisfied and inspired 
by what they see. Others are disappointed when these famous personalities turn 
to drugs, sex, excruciating diets or are involved in other scandals that are 
ethically degrading. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the scandals just the publication of the imperfections of the human 
character, or do they reflect the negative perceptions of society? 
</P>
<P>
 The individual must decide.

WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THE 'PHILADELPHIA' STORY?; MOVIES: A LAWSUIT ALLEGING 
THE FILM'S IDEA IS BASED ON A REAL CASE HAS AROUSED CURIOSITY ABOUT THE ORIGINS 
OF THE TRISTAR FEATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To hear TriStar Pictures tell it, the idea for the Academy Award-nominated 
screenplay for "Philadelphia" was developed in 1991, two years after director 
Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Ron Nyswaner first began brainstorming a movie 
about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But the studio's account, disseminated in publicity materials and countless 
articles about the current film, apparently leaves out a few details, including 
independent producer Scott Rudin's ("The Addams Family" and "The Firm") 
connection with the high-profile project, the first major studio film to 
address the subject of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, many people in Hollywood were surprised to learn that 
Rudin was named -- along with TriStar, Demme, Nyswaner and producer Edward 
Saxon -- in a breach-of-contract lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in New 
York by the family of the late Geoffrey Bowers, a New York lawyer who fought an 
AIDS discrimination battle bearing striking similarities to the story told in 
"Philadelphia." The movie stars Tom Hanks, who was also nominated last week for 
an Oscar, and has grossed $50.5 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on behalf of the studio and the other defendants, TriStar has called 
the Feb. 1 Bowers suit "completely groundless and absolutely without merit." No 
formal answer to the lawsuit has yet been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a truism in the entertainment industry that just about every successful 
movie will spawn at least one lawsuit, and most of these cases do not get very 
far. Whether or not the Bowers suit, to be tried under New York State contract 
law and federal trade practices law, turns out to be an exception, it has 
already aroused curiosity about the origins of "Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 Two knowledgeable sources, who insisted on anonymity, have told The Times that 
Rudin initiated the project and brought in Nyswaner but dropped out when Demme 
became attached. For some reason, they say, the Oscar-winning director of "The 
Silence of the Lambs" did not want Rudin on board. Demme almost always 
collaborates with Saxon, his partner in the Clinica Estetico production 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 A former executive at Orion Pictures, where the project was developed before 
it was acquired by TriStar, confirmed that the movie originated with Rudin. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio President Marc Platt has declined to discuss the case, nor has the 
studio permitted the other defendants to comment. (Although Rudin has a 
production deal at Paramount, calls to him were returned by TriStar's publicity 
department.) 
</P>
<P>
 One participant in the movie, Tom Stoddard, a lawyer with AIDS who used to 
specialize in HIV discrimination cases, attacked the Bowers family for filing 
the latest suit. Stoddard served as a consultant on "Philadelphia" and has a 
cameo role in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I view this lawsuit as nothing more than greed," Stoddard said. "I don't 
think there's any basis for this lawsuit, but even if there were, it is an 
immoral and irresponsible act to try to punish the folks who made a movie that 
can only improve the world that mistreated their son." 
</P>
<P>
 In court documents, the Bowers family traces "Philadelphia" to 1988, when 
Rudin, perhaps after reading about the case in the news media, first approached 
them and told them he wanted to make a movie based on the young lawyer's 
struggle against his law firm, the largest in the nation. Rudin attended a 
session of the Geoffrey Bowers hearing before the New York State Division of 
Human Rights, traveled to Massachusetts to talk with Bowers' friends and family 
members, and flew one of Bowers' attorneys to Los Angeles for further 
discussion, the family contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers himself had died the year before at age 33, shortly after testifying in 
his employment discrimination case, which took seven years to be resolved. Last 
December, his estate was awarded $500,000 by the human rights division. (The 
law firm, Baker & McKenzie, has said it plans to appeal the order.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rudin is not listed in the credits for "Philadelphia," and TriStar contends he 
was not involved in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 But a source close to Rudin acknowledged to The Times that the producer did 
meet with Bowers' survivors and attorneys and had talked to Nyswaner about 
writing a script based on the Bowers case. Rudin and Nyswaner had collaborated 
previously on "Mrs. Soffel" (1984) and on a project called "Pink Boy" that was 
never made. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowers deal fell through, the Rudin supporter said, when Rudin and the 
family could not agree on terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowers family, however, alleges that Rudin struck an oral agreement with 
them to make a movie of Geoffrey's story. Subsequently, they say, he 
transferred these rights to Orion Pictures, where he had two other projects in 
development with Platt, who was then executive vice president of that studio. 
TriStar, in turn, acquired the rights in 1991 after Orion declared bankruptcy, 
according to the suit. By this time Platt had become president of TriStar and 
continued to oversee the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudin had told staff members that he planned to turn Geoffrey Bowers' 
experiences into a movie. One former employee said Rudin was "very upset" by 
Demme's rebuff. "It made Scott crazy to have Demme not like him," this source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Medavoy, Platt's boss both at Orion and -- until last month -- at 
TriStar, said: "I was gone from Orion when that thing was developed. . . . 
There's no question it was a fictional story." Medavoy resigned from Orion in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowers family's complaint, however, describes a series of events that 
allegedly occurred in 1992: 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Bowers' attorneys, Robert Balsam and Daniel Felber, learned from news 
accounts that TriStar was planning to make a movie, with Demme directing, about 
a lawyer who was dismissed from his job because he had AIDS. At that time, the 
movie's title was "Probable Cause." 
</P>
<P>
 When the attorneys asked Rudin about "Probable Cause," he referred them to 
Platt, saying he was no longer involved in the movie. In the course of "several 
conversations," Balsam recounted the project's history to Platt and requested a 
copy of the screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Platt never responded to Mr. Balsam's statements, ignored his request for a 
copy of the screenplay and avoided any further discussions with him," the 
complaint states. 
</P>
<P>
 In publicity materials issued before the movie opened last December, the 
studio described the origin of "Philadelphia" this way: "(Director Jonathan) 
Demme and (screenwriter Ron) Nyswaner first discussed the story idea four years 
ago. They had each learned that someone close to them was suffering from AIDS. 
. . . It took two years of Demme and Nyswaner sending articles back and forth, 
trading books and talking to family and friends to work out a compelling 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment lawyers say the Bowers family's case is likely to hinge on two 
questions: whether the existence of an implied oral contract can be proved; and 
whether "Philadelphia" contains elements that go beyond what is in the hearing 
record and are unique to Geoffrey Bowers' experiences. Material from the 
testimony could well be deemed in the public domain -- free to be used without 
a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike California, New York takes a "limited and restrictive" view of implied 
contract rights with regard to creative material, said New York-based 
entertainment litigator Charles Ortner. "What New York does is essentially look 
at the issue of novelty and originality." 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a very difficult case for the plaintiff to prove," Ortner 
predicted. "Ultimately, if they don't convince the judge or jury that they have 
an enforceable contract and that their story is unique and original, it's going 
to be very difficult to get recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Felber said in a telephone interview that "Philadelphia" mimics the Bowers 
case in at least 20 instances. Like Andrew Beckett, the lawyer portrayed by 
Hanks, Bowers was fired by his tony law firm after he developed Kaposi's 
sarcoma lesions on his face. Both the fictional character and Bowers attempted 
to use makeup to disguise the telltale signs of AIDS. In real life, just as in 
the movie, Bowers no longer had visible lesions on his face when he testified 
in his human rights division hearing, and stunned onlookers when he bared his 
chest to reveal the disfiguring marks. Bowers, like Beckett, said his law firm 
falsely accused him of poor performance in order to get rid of him. 
</P>
<P>
 These similarities, however, could have been gleaned from the hearing record, 
Felber acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other parallels that could have been passed on only by Bowers' 
friends and family, according to Felber. The complaint alleges, for example, 
that Geoffrey's brother Charles confided to Rudin that Geoffrey had expressed 
concern about how the discrimination case, one of the first of its kind, would 
affect the family, especially his mother. "My mother would never be ashamed to 
see one of her kids refuse to sit in the back of the bus," the complaint quotes 
Charles as telling his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Philadelphia," Beckett's mother, portrayed by Joanne Woodward, allays her 
son's worries by using the same analogy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these similarities, Stoddard maintains that another discrimination 
suit, this one actually filed by a Philadelphia lawyer, could just as easily 
have served as the basis for "Philadelphia." The late Clarence Cain 
successfully sued Hyatt Legal Services Corp., claiming AIDS discrimination, 
after he was fired in 1987. Unlike Bowers and the fictional Beckett, however, 
Cain ran a regional office of a multistate chain of low-cost legal clinics and 
was sacked after he informed his employer he had the disease. In addition, Cain 
came from a very poor family -- he was the first of 10 children to attend 
college -- and he was black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had extensive conversations over a period of a year and a half with the 
people producing 'Philadelphia,' and we repeatedly talked about the issue 
generically of AIDS discrimination," Stoddard said. "I brought to bear 
knowledge that I had of the Cain case and implicitly the Bowers case, and a 
host of other employment cases that I know. Tom Hanks' story is not the direct 
reflection of (any particular case). It's just not." 
</P>
<P>
 But even people who are skeptical of TriStar's claim that "Philadelphia" is 
entirely a work of fiction are troubled by the question of why the family 
cannot produce a written agreement -- especially because the plaintiffs include 
Felber and Balsam, law school classmates of Bowers who represented him in the 
discrimination case. Felber said he and the Bowers family were preoccupied with 
their AIDS discrimination fight and the prospect of making it known to a wider 
public. "Everyone is so cynical now in these times," he said. "Someone comes to 
you and says, 'Your message should get out in another forum.' Are you going to 
say, 'I want cash up front?' I go ballistic when people say, 'You're a lawyer, 
why didn't you get it in writing?' "

HOLY COW! NBC ELBOWS IN ON BART; HOW 'MAD ABOUT YOU' FOUND SUCCESS IN ROUGH 
TIME SLOT VS. FOX'S 'THE SIMPSONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When NBC programming chief Warren Littlefield called the producers of "Mad 
About You" last year to tell them he'd scheduled the quick-witted adult comedy 
at 8 p.m. Thursdays against "The Simpsons," one of TV's hottest shows, "a lot 
of people hung up on me," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, after five months going head-to-head with Fox's cartoon darling, no 
one is mad -- in either sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is thrilled. I'm tickled that we're doing so terrifically," said 
Paul Reiser, who created the series with Danny Jacobson and stars in it with 
Helen Hunt. "The surprise is that we're growing and growing and doing better 
than even NBC had hoped to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, after a lackluster first year jumping around the schedule, "Mad About 
You" has flourished in its second season at 8 p.m., even though its creators 
have always maintained that the comedy about a young married couple was 
designed for 9 p.m. or later. So far this season, the comedy has outperformed 
"The Simpsons" 13 out of 20 weeks, including the last eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believed at NBC that there was an appetite for a smart adult comedy in 
this time period," said Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment. "We really 
felt that 'The Simpsons,' as strong as it's been in the past, really is a 
younger show and a little bit more male."  
</P>
<P>
 He added that it has been a dash of sweet revenge doing to Fox what the fourth 
network once did to NBC. In 1990, Fox shocked the television world by moving 
"The Simpsons" to Thursdays against NBC's "The Cosby Show" -- the longtime 
top-rated series that had spearheaded the network's prime-time dominance in the 
1980s. "The Simpsons" never beat "Cosby," but it cut a big chunk out of its 
audience. And when "Cosby" retired, "The Simpsons" took over the lead in the 
time period and NBC's Thursday night ratings juggernaut slipped badly. 
</P>
<P>
 But up against "Mad About You" this season, "The Simpsons" has seen its 
audience share decline by 3 points from last year. "Mad About You" -- which 
aired on Wednesdays and Saturdays last season -- meanwhile has climbed from 
attracting 16% of the available audience to 23% in recent weeks. And NBC's 
Thursday lineup -- which includes "Wings," "Seinfeld" and "Frazier" -- has been 
a blockbuster for the network, up 40% over last season in the advertiser-prized 
18-to-49-year-old demographic, Littlefield said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a special sweetness and a smile on my lips each Friday," Littlefield 
said of his success in beating Fox. "I can't deny that there's a great 
satisfaction to what we've accomplished, especially because if we would have 
stood up at the beginning of the year and said Thursday nights are back and are 
going to be stronger than ever, they would have locked us up and thrown away 
the key." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Grushow, president of Fox Entertainment Group, acknowledged NBC has made 
a strong recovery from last season when it aired the poorly rated "A Different 
World" and "Rhythm and Blues" in the 8 p.m. hour.But in terms of grabbing Fox's 
target 18-49 demographic, "The Simpsons" is still doing big business, he said, 
and its overall rating is almost the same as what it was when Bart and Co. were 
on the cover of Newsweek in April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow points up two obstacles that might have hampered both the show and 
Fox's overall performance on Thursday nights this season. Following "The 
Simpsons," ratings on Fox plummet. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he said, "The Simpsons" has a new set of writers this season, and it 
may have taken a while for them "to get their sea legs." Second, Fox's 
expansion to seven nights of programming a week forced it to spread out its hit 
shows, diluting the power of the 8-9 Thursday hour from last season, when "The 
Simpsons" was paired with "Martin." 
</P>
<P>
 But he expressed confidence in the staying power of "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every network executive has a lot of problems with television series, but 
this is one of those fortunate situations where we don't," Grushow said. "The 
show has been sharp and terrific this season and I'm confident that it will 
continue to perform in the time period for years to come. We just renewed it 
for three more years." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson, the executive producer and co-creator of "Mad About You," said one 
reason the series may be doing better this season is because it is better, 
creatively. The emotionally loaded banter over little things -- "the things 
that are said while brushing the teeth or ordering food in a restaurant" -- is 
still the heart of the show, he said, but it is more skillfully dropped into 
larger stories this year, rather than being the primary focus itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we are hurting 'The Simpsons,' because I always thought that 
the people who like our show are a different audience," Jacobson said. "But 
'The Simpsons' has been on for five years and people might be ready to try 
something new. Especially for teen-agers who want to watch something with their 
parents, this is a good, very sexy, very loving show for them. It's an adult 
show, but there is a lot about what it's like to be in a good, supportive 
relationship that younger people can hang onto as well." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lesson for Littlefield to hang onto too. The TV dictum that the 8 
p.m. hour must feature shows that will appeal to kids and the whole family is 
probably outdated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of this show has absolutely changed that idea," Littlefield said. 
"And you can look at a night like Tuesday, where we are really struggling (with 
such youth-oriented shows as "Saved by the Bell"), and it might not be a bad 
idea to use this smart, wonderful adult lineup as a model for success on other 
nights."

POP NOTES / MIKE BOEHM: CLUB TO OFFER 'UNPLUGGED'-TYPE LIVE MUSIC

 Jerry Roach made his mark on Orange County music history as the owner of the 
Cuckoo's Nest, the fabled club in Costa Mesa that gave rise to the local punk 
rock scene in the late '70s and early '80s. Now, after several years working in 
real estate, Roach is promoting music again -- but in a far less raucous vein. 
</P>
<P>
 Roach, who also ran the Radio City rock club in Anaheim during the '80s, now 
is the owner of the Capo Beach Old Town Mexican Cafe y Cantina in Dana Point 
and is about to add live music to the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Missiles of October, the roots-rock band from Laguna Beach that is one of 
Orange County's finest, will inaugurate the restaurant's 150-capacity listening 
room with shows Friday and Saturday from 8:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. There is no 
cover. The Missiles will be back Feb. 25; the Girls, a harmony trio, play Feb. 
26. 
</P>
<P>
 Roach says he is "trying to do music in a different way" than he did in the 
wild, punk past. "I'm trying to develop a kind of unplugged thing, with quality 
musicians in a comfortable place where you can hear good music and not have to 
pay $25. It's the little joint on the corner." He wants to hear from acts that 
fit the bill and are interested in a South County gig. The Old Town is at 34235 
Doheny Park Road. (714) 496-2560

 GOOD VIBE: What once was just a hangout for Vinnie James and other 
artistically inclined denizens of cafe society now is becoming a serious weekly 
showcase for music, poetry and art. 
</P>
<P>
 James, a veteran singer-songwriter, has organized Vibe for the Tribe, an 
every-Tuesday arts soiree at Midnite Expresso, 201-D Main St. in downtown 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled how Vibe began: "I was just hanging out, and we'd get the guitars 
out and sit on the couch and play. It just kind of evolved, and I went to the 
owner and said, 'Let's do something.' " The weekly series began Feb. 8. James 
is a regular performer. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the coffeehouse gigs have been healthy for his own creative mood. 
James' recording career has been stalled since 1991, when he debuted with a 
strong album for RCA, "All American Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dealing with that whole (major label) scene, I got away from who I am," said 
James, who since losing his recording contract has toured occasionally as an 
opening act for such headliners as Sade, Tina Turner and Carole King. "I had to 
get back down to the street again, hang out with the people and forget the 
whole money thing and the commercial art thing and dealing with managers. It 
just stifles art. Lately, I've been pumping out the music. It's been a good 
thing for me, really medicinal." 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is free to Vibe for the Tribe, which starts at 8:30 p.m. 
Information: (714) 960-5858. Musicians, poets and artists interested in being 
booked can call (714) 576-7325.

OBJECT LESSONS ON BEING FEMALE; ART: AT A LECTURE ON THE VIENNA SCENE, SCULPTOR 
ILSE HAIDER COMPARES AUSTRIAN ARTISTS' SOMETIMES BLATANT AND SOMETIMES OBLIQUE 
COMMENTS ON WOMEN'S ROLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Obliging a photographer's suggestion, Ilse Haider lay down on the floor of a 
gallery at Newport Harbor Art Museum next to "Always Honeymoon," her 
suggestively pulsing bath-mat sculpture, concocted from myriad Q-Tips and a 
motor. 
</P>
<P>
 The willowy Austrian artist realized the photographer still wasn't quite 
satisfied. "Shall I take my clothes off?" she asked impishly, with a toss of 
blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the lecture room, Haider, who turns 30 next year, offered an engaging 
slide talk about members of the younger generation of Austrian female artists 
whose work she admires. (Her Monday noon talk, complementing the exhibition of 
U.S. and Austrian female artists, "The Seventh Wave," was presented in 
cooperation with the art department at UC Irvine.) 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, Haider explained, the cultural mecca of Vienna became a 
cultural vacuum. It wasn't until the 1950s that a new form of expression 
developed: the Aktionismus (action) group, whose anarchic, nihilistic work had 
parallels with "happenings" in the United States and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Lassnig, who incorporated the female body in her paintings, and Valie 
Export, whose performance art incorporated sexually provocative actions, were 
the key women in Viennese art of the '60s, Haider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, despite a relatively small number of commercial galleries and 
collectors, the Viennese art scene benefits from state support and the city's 
new prominence as a hub linking Western Europe with the former Eastern Bloc 
countries. But in place of a homogeneous art movement, Haider said, artists 
take "particularized positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the women whose work Haider showed are dealing -- sometimes 
blatantly, sometimes obliquely -- with issues pertaining to the objectification 
of women by contemporary society. Some also share an interest in combining 
disparate or new media and in using imagery from popular culture. But their 
styles and approaches differ radically. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual imagery, covert or blatant, appears in this work. By isolating and 
framing such cliches of femininity as the satin linings used for perfume 
bottles, Maria Hahnenkamp "reappropriates the erotic" to her own ends, Haider 
said. Elke Krystufek photographs herself in pornographic poses to address the 
"structure of patriarchal power." 
</P>
<P>
 Other women artists allude more indirectly to feminist issues. Dorothee Golz 
(the only artist Haider discussed -- other than herself -- whose work is 
included in "The Seventh Wave") makes minimalist sculptures that incorporate 
household objects -- with their implicit relationship to women's work -- in 
unsettling ways. She told Haider that she is engaged with "the thin line that 
divides the art object from the everyday object, the functional from the 
non-functional." 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists Haider discussed are primarily concerned with perception, 
language and the reproduction of images. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigitte Kowanz makes sculptures from glass, nuts and bolts, and light -- 
allowing the viewer to see both the mechanics of the pieces and their 
transformation into dematerialized, meditative images. Eva Schlegel's new 
series (at Shoshana Wayne Gallery in Santa Monica) consists of large glass 
panels printed with deliberately out-of-focus texts that create "a tension 
between regarding them as a text or an image," Haider said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Christine Meierhofer's "Little Big Difference," the flat, comic strip-style 
paintings turn out to be photographs of real people wearing makeup that 
imitates the sketchy shorthand of cartoonists. 
</P>
<P>
 Haider saved her work for last. After graduating from the Akademie der 
bildenen Kunste in Vienna, she spent two years at the Royal College of Art in 
London, studying with sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with a blend of photography and sculpture, she initially made humorous 
pieces incorporating a three-dimensional background (such as "Suzy and the Last 
Supper," in which the image of a violin-playing friend of hers is incorporated 
into a kitschy plaque of the Leonardo painting). Then she started making works 
that involve the disjunction between the "one-eyed" vision of the camera and 
normal vision, as well as between glamorized and mundane images of women. 
</P>
<P>
 By using film emulsion to transfer the image of a nude woman to a field of 
clothespins, Haider obtained a broken, almost pointillist effect. Like a 
hologram, the image plays hide-and-seek with the viewer-voyeur, who has to find 
just the right vantage point for the image to be readable. Clothespins, of 
course, are the unglamorous implements of the hausfrau.  
</P>
<P>
 In her current work, Haider employs Q-Tips and media images of women, often 
from the '50s, which represent "the myth of modern life in the second half of 
the 20th Century," she said. The flip side of the work is the 
"household-oriented" nature of the process Haider uses. "I iron the photo on 
the Q-Tips," she said. "It's hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Two "towels" made of the cotton swabs hang over a plastic rack in Haider's 
"Such Lovely Beachwear," her other piece at Newport Harbor. The images of women 
on the reverse sides of the towels are partially obscured -- another 
voyeuristic effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Haider said the work has to do with "the atmosphere of the bathroom, where 
women improve themselves with beauty products" and the notion of the bathroom 
as a place devoted to cleansing and relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she finds it difficult to talk about more recent works, like "Always 
Honeymoon." In these pieces, she said, "I am starting to introduce something a 
little more enigmatic -- the breathing of the motors -- but I cannot fully 
articulate what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Seventh Wave" continues through Sunday at Newport Harbor Art Museum, 
850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday 
through Sunday. $4 general, $2 seniors and students, free for everyone on 
Tuesdays. (714) 759-1122.

MIGHTY CLOUDS FLOATING ON A GOSPEL REVIVAL; POP MUSIC: THE GROUP, IN IRVINE 
TONIGHT, IS RIDING HIGH. BUT LEADER JOE LIGON TAKES IT IN STRIDE, KNOWING THAT 
SUCH HIGH POINTS CAN BE FLEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Joe Ligon, riding out a 34-year career of ups and downs has always been a 
matter of keeping the faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Ligon is leader of the Mighty Clouds of Joy, a gospel group that has its share 
of high points -- three Grammy Awards, a handful of hit R&B singles in the '70s 
-- as well as some slow spells. The group, which blends classic gospel with 
contemporary pop flourishes, will perform at the Irvine Barclay Theatre 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Mighty Clouds, the latest career jump-start came late last year, when 
they were featured in a widely publicized, monthlong series of concerts with 
Paul Simon in New York City. They performed three numbers with Simon (including 
"Loves Me Like a Rock") and one song alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who took part included the South African a capella ensemble Ladysmith 
Black Mambazo, singer Phoebe Snow, former Simon partner Art Garfunkel and even 
Steve Martin, in a comic cameo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fabulous, and the press was great," Ligon said in a telephone 
interview. In fact, the publicity from the Simon shows has resulted in a flurry 
of concert gigs at colleges and other venues for the Mighty Clouds. "After 34 
years, our career has really taken off again," he said. "It's like a new 
birth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Clouds of Joy started their career in 1960 in Los Angeles, where 
original members Ligon, Johnny Martin, Richard Wallace and Elmo Franklin 
attended Jefferson High School together. Ligon and Wallace are joined in the 
current lineup by Wilbert Williams and, the group's most recent addition, 
Michael McCowin. 
</P>
<P>
 At times reminiscent of such R&B shouters as Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding, 
at others recalling the silkiness of Curtis Mayfield, lead singer Ligon 
patterned his vocals after the Rev. Julius Cheeks of the Sensational 
Nightingales, a top gospel draw in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 As the popularity of black gospel wavered in the '70s, the Mighty Clouds 
switched to a mainstream pop label (ABC Records) and wove elements of 
contemporary R&B into their sound, scoring two minor hits on the pop charts: 
"Time" and "Mighty High." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were one of the first groups to do contemporary gospel, and we got 
criticized for it," Ligon said. Since, then other groups -- from the Winans to 
Take 6 -- have followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 While the gospel purists were sniping from one side, some in the record 
industry were trying to get the group to make the switch to secular music, as 
others from Teddy Pendergrass to the Staple Singers had done. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of temptation," Ligon said. The group did cover some 
mainstream hits (all with "positive" messages, Ligon said) but in the long run 
have remained committed to gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just four or five guys who want to sing gospel music," Ligon said. 
They've crossed over into secular venues, opening for everyone from the Rolling 
Stones to Aretha Franklin, but maintain their message. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not millionaires, but we weren't looking for that when we went into 
gospel," Ligon said. "All we wanted to do is make a comfortable living, which 
we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Their repertory today can range from traditional numbers to newer rave-ups. 
Their 1990 live album, "Pray for Me," which won a Grammy Award, includes a new 
arrangement of "What a Friend We Have in Jesus," alongside James Cleveland's 
rousing "Can't Nobody Do Me Like Jesus" and Franklin's "Nobody Can Turn Me 
Around." All the singers take solo turns, but it is Ligon's roar of a voice 
that usually plays against the tight harmonizing of the other members. 
</P>
<P>
 The '80s saw a big rise in the pop-oriented white Christian music market, 
while some contemporary and traditional black gospel artists complained that 
they were being neglected by gospel music labels. Ligon said he tried to steer 
clear of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't jump on that bandwagon," he said. "We don't expect to be Amy Grant. 
. . . We didn't dwell on that too much. We just do what the Mighty Clouds can 
do and pray for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Ligon believes black gospel is undergoing a new surge in interest, especially 
on the strength of contemporary choirs and tributes by some secular performers 
to their gospel roots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Clouds, meanwhile, are drawing better than ever on their busy 
schedule (some 200 dates a year), despite the fact that they haven't recorded 
an album of new material in several years. Ligon expects to remedy that this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that black gospel is being accepted. There are record companies that, 
when I first started, wouldn't touch gospel music" that are signing gospel 
artists now, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doors are being opened, and gospel is on the rise," he said. "That lets 
me know I'm still where I need to be, in gospel music." 
</P>
<P>

4242 Campus Drive, UC Irvine. $12-$20. (714) 856-6379. * Times Link: 808-8463

DANCE REVIEW; ACROBATS BALANCE GRACE AND RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two troupes of Chinese acrobats representing opposite ends of the political 
spectrum are touring the Southland this week. One is from the People's Republic 
and one is from the Republic of Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taiwanese group, the Chinese Golden Dragon Acrobats, appeared Tuesday at 
the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, and almost any act on their 
program could be sampled to find the essential ingredients that make this 
art-form appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 But consider one of the less flashier ones, called Water Meteors, in which 
small saucers filled with water are suspended at the ends of a rope that is 
spun, tossed into the air and caught again, without a drop being spilled. Well, 
almost without losing a drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the tension, the risk, the grace, the simplicity of means and the 
emotional uplift resulting from defying forces everyone in the audience 
understands, that is common to almost all of the segments, which here show few 
innovations. Not that that is really a liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the sense of risk is proportionately -- breathtakingly -- higher in the 
sequence in which blindfolded men dive through hoops lined with knives and 
fire. Or when Feng-Hsian Liu bends in half an iron rod leveled at his Adam's 
apple by hurling his body at it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the viewer's anxiety level, too, rose a few degrees higher than 
usual in the Pagoda of Chairs because this year, the acrobat who ascended the 
perilous structure (Bin-Chung Poon) did not make use of a safety wire. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on grace, correspondingly, took primary place in the women's 
Ribbon Dance or in any of the many choreographed poses that began and ended 
their appearances, even as assistants to other acrobats. 
</P>
<P>
 But usually there is a mix of all ingredients in varying proportions and 
emphasis, as acrobats manipulate or juggle teacups, plates, large jars, a table 
or a kind of yo-yo with their feet or heads or even on the backs of their 
necks. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when first one and then another of the women spinning three plates at 
the ends of three rods held in each hand dropped some of them, the accidents 
merely confirmed that there was no trickery involved. It almost seemed 
intentional to prove that this was a human endeavor, and that the obstacles 
overcome everywhere else were legitimately overcome.

CLUB REVIEW; ALPHABET THE DEEJAY MAKES A TASTY MARTINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After just three weeks, Martini -- the new name for the recently revamped 
T-Room on Melrose Avenue -- is on its way to becoming L.A.'s nightclub of 
choice. Since these trend decisions are made with dizzying speed, the time to 
check out the upscale venue is now, before the lines outside become too grim. 
</P>
<P>
 The '50s-style Pan-Am lounge look and red-paneled walls that defined the 
T-Room are gone. Martini's decor is more subtle, but a close look at the 
whitewashed walls -- with vinyl albums embedded in them -- hints at the club's 
main attraction: its music. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of L.A.'s best deejays are already spinning at Martini, the most 
memorable set currently occurs on Tuesdays, when the deejay known as Alphabet 
starts off his eclectic set with jazz records such as Bob James' "Nautilus," 
taking listeners on an aural tour of the be-bop and cool-jazz records that 
provide so much of the sampled music in rap. 
</P>
<P>
 He then begins a fusion of old school and new school hip-hop, playing such 
songs as Gang Starr's new "Mass Appeal" back to back with Funkadelic's "Knee 
Deep." Maintaining a primarily East Coast flavor, he then highlights Boogie 
Down Productions' "South Bronx" and a Tribe Called Quest's "Electric 
Relaxation" before throwing in one of dancehall's hottest songs, Mega Banton's 
"Sound Boy Killing." 
</P>
<P>
 A word of caution for early risers: Alphabet's skillful, not-by-the-book 
approach to deejaying makes it difficult to exit the dance floor before closing 
time.

TEACHING THE FRENCH ABOUT TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 15 years ago, I watched a chef in Paris demonstrate dipping candied 
orange peel strips into chocolate when another student asked how to make 
chocolate-dipped strawberries. The chef's immediate response was: "Why would 
you want to do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 To him, the tangy taste of strawberries did not seem to complement the flavor 
of chocolate. Still, to please the student, he proceeded to dip strawberries 
into chocolate. Most of the students liked them. Even the chef admitted that 
they were " pas mal " (not bad). 
</P>
<P>
 I discussed this flavor combination with other French chefs, who reacted as 
our chef originally had. Chocolate and strawberries were simply not a popular 
pair in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they had become a favorite combination in restaurants and pastry shops in 
the United States, and magazine articles featured chocolate-strawberry 
shortcakes, chocolate cake rolls with strawberry filling, chocolate ice cream 
topped with strawberry sauce and chocolate cheesecake with strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I find chocolate a delicious partner for ripe strawberries. 
There's another advantage -- a few of these chocolate-dressed berries turn out 
to be a fairly light low-calorie dessert. After all, only a thin, delicate 
coating of chocolate clings to each berry. 
</P>
<P>
 Chocolate-dipped strawberries are very easy to prepare. Just make sure that 
the berries are not wet; moisture from one berry could cause the bowl of 
chocolate to harden before you finish dipping the other berries. Pat the rinsed 
berries dry with several changes of paper towels before you dip them in the 
chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 I always use fine French, Belgian or Swiss chocolate for dipping strawberries. 
Since the chocolate is not mixed with other ingredients, choose the best 
chocolate you can get. Good-quality chocolate contains a generous proportion of 
cocoa butter, which gives the chocolate the desired fluidity for easy dipping. 
</P>
<P>
 You can dip the berries in either dark or white chocolate. For an especially 
festive dessert, I like to prepare double-dipped strawberries: I dip a berry in 
white chocolate, let it harden, then dip its tip in dark chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-stemmed berries are sold at the market for dipping. The green stems are 
pretty and helpful when you dip the berries, but I prefer smaller strawberries 
because they are often sweeter. Besides, with large berries, you feel like 
you're eating so much berry that you hardly taste the chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, the French seem to be coming around: On a recent trip I came 
across a patisserie window displaying chocolate mousse cake with strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For an even quicker dessert, dip the berries in fine-quality melted chocolate 
at the table and eat them while they're still warm.  
</P>
<P>
 CHOCOLATE-DIPPED STRAWBERRIES 
</P>
<P>
 10 large or 20 small or medium strawberries with stems and leaves 
</P>
<P>
 3 ounces bittersweet, semisweet or white chocolate, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse strawberries, leaving stems on. Pat completely dry with paper towels. 
Let dry on paper towels on rack 30 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Melt chocolate in small, deep bowl set over hot water over low heat, stirring 
often with rubber spatula. Remove bowl of chocolate from pan of water. Cool 
chocolate, stirring very often, until it still flows but is thick enough to 
adhere to berries. White chocolate should feel cooler than body temperature. On 
instant-read thermometer, it should reach 84 degrees. Dark chocolate should 
feel slightly cooler than body temperature, or 88 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat 1 strawberry dry again with paper towels. Dip pointed end of each berry in 
chocolate, so that half berry is coated. Gently shake berry and let excess 
chocolate drip back into bowl. Set berry on tray lined with foil or wax paper. 
Dip remaining berries. If chocolate thickens, set briefly over hot water so it 
becomes fluid. Refrigerate berries 30 minutes or until chocolate sets. 
Carefully lift berries from foil to loosen, then replace on tray. 
</P>
<P>
 Dipped strawberries can be kept uncovered 2 to 3 hours in refrigerator. Remove 
from refrigerator about 10 minutes before serving. Makes 10 large or 20 small 
dipped berries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a delightful three-tone confection to serve as dessert after a rich 
meal. It's also a lovely accompaniment for ice cream, or a fresh, colorful 
addition to a tray of petits fours or chocolates. Use fine-quality chocolate.  
</P>
<P>
 DOUBLE-DIPPED STRAWBERRIES 
</P>
<P>
 10 large or 20 small or medium strawberries with stems and leaves 
</P>
<P>

 College basketball -- The Associated Press reported erroneously Tuesday that 
Kentucky pulled off the greatest comeback in college basketball history, 
trailing LSU by 31 points before winning, 99-95. The report was based on an

Tulane led Duke by 32 points before losing a game in 1950.

3 -- HOUR TOUR: RESTORED MISSION INN BOASTS RIVERSIDE'S COURT OF PAST RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, Anne Michaud is a staff writer for The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The closets in the older rooms at Riverside's Mission Inn hint at its early 
grandeur. They are cavernous, built to hold travel trunks and clothing enough 
for weeks-long visits. 
</P>
<P>
 From the turn of the century to World War II, the inn was a resort 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
 In its earliest days, it was a two- or three-day coach ride from Los Angeles. 
Having made that journey, people stayed a while. 
</P>
<P>
 The inn was worthy of visits by presidents (Theodore Roosevelt and Taft) and 
presidents-to-be (Nixon and Reagan). 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the inn has been quiet. For most of the 1980s, it was closed. And, to 
be truthful, it had been decaying for decades before that. At one time, the 
oldest of the hotel's wings was used as a dormitory by UC Riverside students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Inn has since undergone a $40-million restoration and reopened a 
little more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This eclectic inn, whose rooms rent for $85 to $180 per night, boasts of 
architectural styles ranging from Medieval European to mission-era California 
to the Orient. It is once again worth a special trip. 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 to 3: The Mission Inn Foundation, a nonprofit group dedicated to the 
preservation and exhibition of the inn and its artifacts, offers 90-minute 
tours every day but Monday. The tour begins in a tree-shaded courtyard 
surrounded on three sides by the U-shaped inn. This area was originally named 
Court of the Birds, and it was home to parrots and macaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds were so tame that they traveled on the shoulders of Frank Miller, 
the inn's early owner, developer and host. Images of macaws are still found 
throughout the inn, in such unlikely places as shower stalls and stained-glass 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 In his later years, Miller toured the world and sent artifacts back to the 
inn. Evidence of his travels are paneling from a 17th-Century Belgian convent, 
a Steinway Centennial piano, church pews from Westminster Abbey and a 
5-by-18-foot wood carving titled "Mandarin's Journey." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also modeled the inn's later wings on the architecture he saw in Europe 
and Asia, as well as on California missions. Highlights are the Spanish Patio, 
the Ho-O-Kan Room and the St. Francis Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour finishes in a commercial section of the inn. It housed a barbershop 
at one time and now is home to the Mission Inn museum. 
</P>
<P>
 If your tour guides forget, remind them to tell you about the escaped circus 
elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 3:45: From the inn's museum, follow the pedestrian mall (Main Street) 
across 7th Street. On your left, you will find the California Museum of 
Photography. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a wonderful museum, vital and intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibits on display, now through March 20, are of photos taken by homeless 
children in Washington, D.C., and in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington project, titled "Shooting Back," was organized by photographers 
and artists there. They taught children age 5 to 17 in shelters to use 
35-millimeter cameras. (A 30-minute video on view at the museum tells the story 
of the project.) 
</P>
<P>
 The result is frank pictures of life in shelters -- images that might have 
eluded an outsider. There are about 100 in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 The local version of "Shooting Back," called "Helping Hands in the Inland 
Empire," seeks to show that there are impoverished families in places other 
than big cities such as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 3:45 to 4:30: After seeing the museum, stop for a beer, and maybe an early 
dinner, at the Riverside Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
 This restaurant brews six of its own beers. You can buy a three-beer sampler 
for $3 or try all six for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is filled with sandwiches, salads and wood-oven-baked pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices run about $6 to $8 for an entree. The Riverside turkey sandwich ($5.95) 
is a treat.

FREEDOMS: THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE ACLU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The letter from Andrea Saenz (Times, Feb. 3) was very impressive.It is 
encouraging to know that there are such young people who are aware of their 
freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution and are courageous enough to be 
outspoken about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenz may be interested to know that there exists an organization called the 
American Civil Liberties Union. One purpose of the ACLU is to offer legal 
assistance, when possible, to those who are willing to defend our Bill of 
Rights.
