THEATER REVIEW; PROBLEMS MAKE FOR LONG 'NIGHTFALLS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playwrights are prone to write plays about certain ills of society. But in his 
"Nightfalls in L.A.," writer-director John Ferzacca has decided to take 
everything amiss in the City of Angels and put it all into one interminable 
pageant. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no kitchen sink here, but that's about the only thing missing. There's 
an illegal immigrant, a homeless Vietnam vet, kids killed on the streets, 
riots, earthquakes, a serial killer from a dysfunctional family, a drag queen 
who does Marilyn Monroe, an out-of-work actor, a philosophizing cop who can't 
hide his racism, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 The work looks as though Ferzacca, who teaches theater at Orange Coast College 
and directs the school's current production of "Nightfalls," had a few one-acts 
and sketches about L.A. hanging around and decided to throw in some filler and 
make it into a very long play. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's not a play. It's a bunch of bits and pieces that rarely match each 
other in tone or style, most of them in monologue form, and that don't fit into 
any coherent, overall shape. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Saturday Night Live"-type sketch about a French tourist trying to find his 
way to "The Phantom of the Opera" with the help of non-English-speaking 
Angelenos contrasts with a very serious moment with a well-to-do Vietnamese 
grad student telling the homeless vet about the student's debt to America and 
its troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Very randy translations to an ethnically mixed class of a simple English 
grammar lesson on the proper use of "lie" and "lay" and the past tense of 
"hang" get laughs, while the illegal immigrant's tirade about women being raped 
and beaten still echoes in the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferzacca directs this cliche-ridden bouillabaisse on David Scaglione's 
multipurpose set with some style, but as director, he can't overcome his 
problems as playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within the large framework, there are some insightful moments that could be 
enlarged into meaningful works on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Deeh Moore is wonderful as a South-Central mother worried about her 
teen-age daughter (Wanda D. Saint Juste) and son being out late, even though 
she knows they are really good kids. It has a twist ending and an impact that 
might warrant further exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 The serial killer is a character in what is already a pretty solid one-act 
that floats by itself in the middle of the evening. P.J. Agnew is the Man who 
is terrifying a rather formidable Abducted Woman (Angela J. Combs), and their 
performances, along with some mysterious and insightful writing, make this the 
highlight of the production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only through-line is a running series of scenes between the out-of-work 
actor (Todd Kulczyk) and a woman (Leslie Rowe) who wants to make it big on game 
shows. They both keep the spirit of their scenes high, but they're flailing at 
"Love, American Style" dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel J. Combs as the drag queen and Lynn Laguna as a hooker obsessed with 
being Monroe's daughter are also effective in a pointless replaying of a tired, 
old tune. 
</P>

MUSIC REVIEW; MANUEL BARRUECO: QUIET BUT PERSUASIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult to know where to begin in describing Manuel Barrueco's recital 
Sunday on the bare stage of Memorial Hall at Chapman University. The veteran 
Cuban guitarist did so many things right, and a mere report wouldn't do him 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The results, it's safe to say, were magical. In a strong program, sponsored by 
the Orange County Guitar Circle, of mostly mainstream, mostly Spanish music, 
Barrueco gave an object lesson in music making on the guitar for an 
appreciative audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtle persuasion, not dazzling fireworks, was his method. To open, he played 
the Suite No. 7 by Silvius Leopold Weiss with such soft grace and pointed 
detail that these little Baroque dances lit up vividly. 
</P>
<P>
 Cicero himself might have learned something from the way Barrueco played 
Granados' "Zarabanda" and Turina's Sonata, the ebb and flow, light and shadow, 
whisper and thunder of their arguments perfectly gauged to draw the listener 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sor's Variations on a Theme by Mozart, Barrueco's guitar turned into a 
singing instrument, as he used strategically placed vibrato and glowing tone to 
create smooth, curved melody. 
</P>
<P>
 Within this musician's small but purposefully controlled dynamic range, 
Albeniz's "Asturias" became not a raging fire, as some guitarists would have 
it, but a poem of quiet urgency, all the more effective for being suggestive 
rather than explicit. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all this great music -- at least, Barrueco made it sound that way -- 
Chick Corea's "Sometime Ago" couldn't be saved from its own tired use of 
Spanish-music cliches, though as a display of his technical accomplishment, it 
served the guitarist well enough. 
</P>
<P>
 In encore, Albeniz's Tango in D sounded anything but cliched, in a poised and 
seductive reading.

 Conan's Report Card: NBC is content with the performance of Conan O'Brien thus 
far, contrary to reports that the network is considering pulling the plug on 
the low-rated late-night talk-show host, according to Rick Ludwin, vice 
president of late-night programming. "We're satisfied with the show and the 
growth it's showing," Ludwin told The Times. "Conan has improved as host, and 
the ratings (are increasing). We've said all along that what we wanted to see 
was growth -- both creatively and in the ratings. It's slow growth, but up is 
better than down, and we're seeing signs that the college audience, who were 
the first to discover David Letterman, are tuning in to Conan." Some sources 
speculate that O'Brien, whose 12:35 a.m. show is produced by "Saturday Night 
Live" creator Lorne Michaels, will have another year to prove himself. Ludwin 
said there was "no magic date" for renewing O'Brien's pact. MOVIES

 'Bridges' for Beresford, Eastwood: Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment 
confirmed Monday that Bruce Beresford ("Driving Miss Daisy") will direct and 
Clint Eastwood will star in the film version of Robert James Waller's 
best-selling book, "The Bridges of Madison County." The Warner Bros. Film will 
be produced by Spielberg and Kathleen Kennedy ("The Color Purple"). . . . 
Meanwhile, Amblin also said Monday that it will withdraw all its films from 
distribution in Malaysia, which last month refused to show Spielberg's 
"Schindler's List" unless several scenes depicting sex and violence were cut. 
"The reason for this decision is the irreconcilable gulf that exists between 
our belief in cultural and artistic freedom of expression and the Malaysian 
government's desire to curtail that freedom through censorship," Amblin said in 
a statement.

 Wilder's Austrian Homecoming: Director Billy Wilder got a warm reception when 
he returned over the weekend to his native Austria, in his first trip back 
since 1958. Wilder, 88, whose movies include "Some Like It Hot" and "Sunset 
Boulevard," was one of tens of thousands of Jews to flee Vienna before Austria 
was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938. Wilder was visibly moved Sunday night by a 
toast by Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, who said he hoped Wilder would 
get to know "a new Austria." ART

 Video Artist Picked for Biennale: Long Beach video artist Bill Viola, who was 
recently featured in a major exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art/San 
Diego, has been chosen to represent the United States next year at the 
prestigious Venice Biennale. Viola, who was selected by the National Endowment 
for the Arts, follows sculptor Louise Bourgeois, who represented the United 
States in 1993. Previous U.S. representatives include installation artist Jenny 
Holzer and painter Jasper Johns. Viola is said to be creating new site-specific 
video and sound installations for the Biennale called "Buried Secrets."

 Banned From Cuba: HIV-positive writer Mark Zolun, who collaborated with Los 
Angeles artist Robert Millar on 12 works selected for the fifth Havana Bienal, 
was denied entry into Cuba for Saturday's opening of the exhibition. The 
country has had a strict policy of mandatory HIV testing and quarantines for 
those with HIV and AIDS. In the works, which are accompanied by Zolun's text 
about homosexuality and living with HIV, Millar makes paint by mixing his own 
HIV-negative blood with Zolun's. Millar refused to attend the exhibition after 
Zolun was denied entry. The artists have offered to donate the works "to the 
people of Cuba," through the country's contemporary art center, the Centro 
Wilfredo Lam. Other current and former Los Angeles artists selected for the 
Bienal, which runs through June 30, are Karen Atkinson, Ed Bereal, Carl Cheng, 
Albert Chong, Johnny Coleman, Richard Glazer Danay, John Outterbridge, Alison 
Saar, Betye Saar, Lezley Saar and Pat Ward Williams. QUICK TAKES

JAZZ REVIEW; JIM HALL DEMONSTRATES GUITAR BRILLIANCE AT BAKERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guitarist Jim Hall, a former Angeleno (he first came to prominence here, in 
1956, with the Chico Hamilton Quintet), made one of his rare visits from New 
York on Sunday, when he played for an overflow house at the Jazz Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has been compared to everyone from Charlie Christian to Django 
Reinhardt, Hall has long since developed his own persona, characterized by a 
sensitive, often subdued sound and by uniquely ethereal compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 When he plays a subtle melody such as "Skylark," one is left wondering: What 
was that substitute chord he just used? Did he modulate without our noticing? 
Yet when the tune is based on a simple handful of chords (as in "Street Dance," 
a calypso piece written by Sonny Rollins, with whom he worked in the 1960s), 
his ingenuity still shines through. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's "Joao," named for Joao Gilberto, captured the Brazilian spirit without 
attempting visceral duplication. "Subsequently," dedicated to Hamilton, was one 
of Hall's more daring works, with hints of Ornette Coleman in its puckishness. 
</P>
<P>
 His accompanists were Scott Colley, a bassist whose support on solos were 
consistently rewarding, and Bill Stewart, a fine drummer who occasionally 
tended to become a little intrusive. Overall, though, the group achieved a 
commendable unity worthy of its boldly brilliant leader. If he has not yet 
entered the jazz Hall of Fame, his recent work, both in person and on record, 
will do much to expand the fame of Hall. LEONARD FEATHER

TV REVIEWS; LOVE AND LOSS IN 'SARAJEVO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two bodies lay on the cratered, rubble-strewn road like a pair of limp 
dolls some child forgot. But they were very human, and very tragically murdered 
in the senseless cross fire of bullets and destruction that filled the Sarajevo 
air during the civil war between Christian Serbs and Muslim Bosnians. Bosko 
Brckic and Admira Ismic died, as lovers, in each others' arms, Serb and Muslim 
in unforgettable liebestod . 
</P>
<P>
 "Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo" is John Zaritsky's and Virginia Storring's 
wrenching exploration for "Frontline" of what brought Bosko and Admira 
together, and what eventually made them dare to escape their cherished city as 
it was drowning in blood, recrimination and self-hate. Rarely has television 
depicted the human cost of war with such vivid intensity, overshadowed with a 
terrible sense of inevitability. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosko and Admira fell in love at 16 just as the world was falling in love with 
Sarajevo, home of the 1984 Winter Olympics. Reflective of the city's 
multiethnic spirit, the lovers' families grew very close, despite their 
different backgrounds. The teens, in essence, were creating a larger family 
crossing religious and ethnic boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 But like a bad dream of Admira's grandmother, who remembered the World War II 
carnage between Croats, Serbs and Muslims, the old hatreds resurfaced at the 
end of the Cold War. War in Croatia, to the north, eventually spread to 
Sarajevo. (We see the first dramatic shots fired, by Serbs, into a multiethnic 
crowd demonstrating for peace.)  
</P>
<P>
 The Montagues and the Capulets of the Balkans were once again at each other's 
necks, and this Romeo and Juliet were suddenly in an awful new world. 
</P>
<P>
 The twists and turns on the way to tragedy are surprisingly complex, bitterly 
ironic and better left unrevealed. But few images better sum up the war tale's 
horror than Bosko's old school buddy-turned-criminal, Celo, recalling his 
attempts as a city defense force commander to arrange the couple's escape -- or 
Bosko's and Admira's mothers, still shaken at their cruel loss and so 
emotionally open in front of the camera that it is almost too much for the 
television, or the viewer, to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and 
KPBS-TV Channel 15, and at 8:30 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. ROBERT KOEHLER

ROYAL BALLET'S FINALE: A TROUBLED 'DREAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ballets that Frederick Ashton created for Anthony Dowell took the art of 
classical partnering to new  
</P>
<P>
 levels of sophistication -- levels that dancers after Dowell have not always 
found congenial. In the final two Royal Ballet performances of Ashton's "The 
Dream," Sunday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, two otherwise fine 
Oberons ultimately came to grief in the great "Nocturne" pas de deux that 
crowns the work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, Bruce Sansom offered a distinctively sulky, aristocratic 
interpretation of Oberon, and he brought plenty of power and freedom to solo 
passages. These qualities vanished, however, in the pas de deux where he not 
only looked effortful but seldom connected in emotional terms with Viviana 
Durante as Titania. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfailingly gracious and secure, Durante explored a narrow, curiously sedate 
notion of the role: a failure of imagination more than dancing. At the same 
performance, Anthony Bourne never proved fast, light or sharp enough for an 
ideal Puck, but Peter Abegglen -- who had danced Puck the previous evening -- 
provided a remarkably playful, sympathetic and detailed portrayal of Bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday evening, Tetsuya Kumakawa danced Oberon opposite the previously 
reviewed Sarah Wildor. Displaying the phenomenal virtuosity that had marked his 
performance of Puck the previous afternoon, Kumakawa also acted persuasively, 
showing Oberon as a volatile nature-spirit. However, his dancing in the pas de 
deux began prosaically and ended somewhere near glum exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no reason why Puck can't be as tall as Oberon, but Philip Mosley 
smeared too many steps and body-shapes to be accounted successful in the role 
on Sunday night. A mostly new set of mortal lovers added to the interest of 
this last performance in the Orange County engagement, with Nicola Tranah and 
Gary Avis spirited as Helena and Demetrius -- but Muriel Valtat achieving a 
special comic delicacy as Hermia. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewed earlier in these pages, Ashton's "Tales of Beatrix Potter" completed 
both programs. The company's professionalism minimized the impact of two 
accidents at the matinee. In "The Dream," an unscheduled exit by the child 
playing the Changeling Indian Boy forced Sansom to retrieve him offstage for 
the resolution of one of the ballet's key plot points. Later, the dollhouse bed 
collapsed under Mosley as he jumped on it during the second mouse episode of 
"Beatrix Potter."LEWIS SEGAL

TV REVIEWS; 'GETTING GOTTI' HAS FRESH FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mob watchers may want to check out "Getting Gotti," not so much for what it 
says about John Gotti the Teflon Don but for its portrayal of a vulnerable and 
corruptible justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenarist James S. Henerson's largely absorbing and little-known mob story 
wisely makes Gotti (Anthony Denison) a secondary player.Instead, it focuses 
more freshly on an assistant D.A. (Lorraine Bracco, playing real-life 
prosecutor Diane Giacalone) who fights withering hostility (including the FBI) 
in a seven-year battle to nail the crime boss and six associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Stylistically, director Roger Young doesn't break new Godfather ground, but 
the casting of the puffy, pasty-faced thugs and snitches is unusually 
authentic. And the opening sequence, in which the screen alternates between 
parallel "family" rituals, hurls the viewer into the nightmare story of the 
prosecutor and her arrogant, slippery prey. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the movie demythologizes the mob world. At one point Bracco 
sneers to frustrated colleagues: "Let's cut through all the romantic, 
mysterious crap -- 'The Godfather' . . . Al Pacino looking soulful. These 
gangsters are cases of arrested development." 
</P>
<P>
 An Italian American who grew up at the same time and hails from the same 
Queens neighborhood as Gotti, the heroine is outraged that names like Gotti, 
Gambino and Capone are more celebrated "than Puccini, Verdi and Michelangelo." 
</P>
<P>

'NAKED LADY' SNEAKS IN A LITTLE LESSON

 Play it again, Pancho. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Pancho Villa and the Naked Lady," at Los Angeles Theatre Center's 
downstairs Theatre 3, the famous bandit/revolutionary is like Humphrey Bogart 
in Woody Allen's "Play It Again, Sam" -- a fantasy figure from the past who 
materializes in order to give advice to a modern man about his relationships 
with women.

 Villa's advice stinks. He is depicted as -- quite literally -- a lady-killer, 
and contemporary women don't have to put up with his machismo. Mexican 
playwright Sabina Berman implants this mildly feminist statement inside her 
comedy, now in its U.S. premiere in an English translation by Ruben Garfias, 
produced by Bilingual Foundation of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks as if Berman's strategy went something like this: Lure the male 
chauvinists into the theater with a titillating title (in fact, the lady in 
question is naked emotionally, not physically), make them laugh, then sneak in 
a little lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 That lesson seems awfully little in 1994 Los Angeles, where this production 
has been set. Not many of the people who go see this production would ever 
consider looking to the likes of Pancho Villa for advice about women. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the performances in Margarita Galban's staging are almost as obvious 
as the lesson -- gestures and jokes are underlined and overstated. All that 
mugging produces fewer laughs, not more. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is stuck with a somewhat odd structure. At the beginning, Gina 
(Margarita Stocker) -- a successful chorizo entrepreneur -- is the central 
character more than her sometime suitor Adrian (Garfias), a professor whose 
specialty just happens to be Pancho Villa. By the end, however, Adrian has 
taken over the play so much that Gina isn't even in the last scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the play is the tug of war between the two of them, with Gina 
demanding a commitment and Adrian resisting, guided in his strategy by the 
spirit of Villa (Ciro Suarez). Adrian behaves abominably. At one point Gina 
herself imagines a scene with Adrian's mentor Villa -- but only so that Villa's 
mother (Vetza Trussell) gets the chance to berate him. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in Act Two, Gina finds a younger man (Javi Mulero) and dismisses 
Adrian for good. Adrian still wants her, but when he pursues her he's 
intercepted by Gina's friend and partner Andrea (Alejandra Flores), the 
granddaughter of one of Villa's adversaries. The last scene of the play is the 
foiled seduction of Adrian by Andrea, with Gina presumably off somewhere 
enjoying her new life. 
</P>
<P>
 While every character gets more or less what's coming, the absence of Gina at 
the end is felt. Adrian's reprehensible qualities are too exaggerated for the 
audience to care much what happens to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfias' performance begins to endow Adrian with a measure of breezy charm, 
but that little breeze is eventually blown away by the gusts of his toxic 
behavior. And Stocker is so intent on establishing the stress of Gina's affairs 
that she neglects to show us why Adrian would ever get involved with her. 
</P>

 We are writing in response to a "Letter to the Editor" from Ray Boston, 
published in the April 26 Los Angeles Times, Valley Business section, 
concerning his dissatisfaction with telephone service at 20th Century 
Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 We appreciate Mr. Boston's comments and apologize for his inconvenience.We 
certainly agree that the level of phone service at 20th Century following the 
Northridge Earthquake was, at times, below our standards. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the regular volume of automobile and homeowner claims, we 
received 40,000 earthquake-related claims in the first few weeks following the 
earthquake. (By comparison, total homeowner claims of all kinds in 1993 totaled 
only 28,000). Handling this tremendous volume of incoming calls was complicated 
by the fact that our headquarters building and several area field offices were 
damaged by the earthquake. Although our activities have returned to normal, the 
total number of calls received by our company continues at a greatly increased 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two months, we have dedicated all of our resources to taking 
care of these claims. Because of these efforts, about three-quarters of the 
40,000 earthquake-related claims reported have been concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 We know it has been a very difficult and trying time for everyone affected. We 
have 2,500 employees working hard and smart to get these earthquake issues 
resolved and conduct business at proper service levels.

 Hanging in there: Soon after chiropractor David Reuben's ad appeared on a 
billboard in normally sleepy Saugus, the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station 
received an emergency call from a passerby. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller reported "that someone was noosed and hung up there," said 
Sheriff's Lt. Tim Peters. "We rolled a unit out there Code 3" -- red light and 
siren. 
</P>
<P>
 What the deputies found, instead, was a mannequin hanging by its fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen other passersby also phoned the sheriff's station in 
February. The billboard created so much controversy that the city even explored 
whether the daredevil mannequin was violating any codes -- deciding that it 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 And how did Reuben react to the negative publicity? Well, his neck didn't get 
out of joint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any PR's good PR," he pointed out, adding that his goal had been to "get 
people to notice us." 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben theorized that some of the initial criticism came from motorists who 
were already angry over being trapped in traffic on San Fernando Road, which 
had become an alternate to quake-crippled freeways. He added: "Ninety-nine out 
of 100 people we've talked to thought it was a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the mannequin has become pretty much an accepted part of the 
Saugus community. "We haven't received any calls for a long time," Lt. Peters 
said. "It's lost its shock value." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben plans to take down the billboard at the end of the summer with another 
eye-catching show. "We're going to have a dummy-drop ceremony," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A hermaphroditic dummy: Reuben, by the way, says that it wasn't easy finding a 
mannequin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to go to the Downtown (L.A.) garment district and find a piecemeal 
one," he disclosed. "It's really half man and half woman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frilly chain: Frank Jacobs of Burbank called to say that a female friend of 
his received a chain letter that purred, "This is a Pretty Panties Exchange. 
Send one pair of panties, preferably sexy ones, to the person listed at No. 1 
and send a copy of this letter to six of your friends in a Manila envelope. . . 
. You will receive 36 pairs of pretty new underwear." 
</P>
<P>
 The sender of the plea signed her name, along with the designation: "Size 5 
(thong)." 
</P>
<P>
 We've noticed that chain letters asking for money invariably warn that an 
unnamed general in the Philippines once failed to respond and died soon 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panty chain appeal was less threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be the one who is responsible for spoiling the fun and stopping the 
flow of panties," the letter pleaded. "It is not fair to those who have 
participated." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs' friend, incidentally, would identify herself only as: 
</P>
<P>
 "Size 8." 
</P>
<P>
 And:  
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't be caught dead in the thong panties." miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 A reader sent us a magazine story about a disastrous earthquake that struck 
Sicily in 1693, underlining the phrase, "at 4:30 in the morning on Jan. 9." We 
sense an every-301-years trend. So we've circled the entire month of January on 
our 2295 calendar, just to be safe.

SACRAMENTO WATCH; POORLY TIMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The timing could not be worse. As California grapples with yet another budget 
shortfall, an independent citizens commission has granted California's elected 
legislators a hefty 37% pay increase, to $72,000 a year.Few would argue against 
the premise that raising the compensation for legislators might help lure 
qualified candidates, who might not otherwise be able to afford to leave their 
jobs to serve in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 And the increase, which will cost about $2.5 million a year, must come out of 
the Legislature's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Citizens Compensation Commission was created by voters when 
they passed Proposition 112 in 1990 as part of a reform package. The goal was 
to enable legislators to make a living without having to rely on outside 
honorariums. The passage of legislative term limits, also in 1990, made this 
even more important. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission last granted a legislative pay increase to the current $52,500 
(from $40,816) in 1990. It put off further increases because of state budget 
problems. This year it granted the raise after reviewing salaries of other 
state officials, including judges. The total compensation package, which 
includes a car allowance, health benefits and a tax-free $101 per diem to cover 
living expenses when the Legislature is in session, will be about $100,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the pay hike is a done deal, legislators would be well-advised to 
decline the raise, which they can do. All such gestures are sure to be 
favorably remembered by voters when they go the polls in June and November.

MANDELA'S HEARTENING OUTREACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela, will be inaugurated 
today. Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will be 
among the dignitaries and heads of state who will bring good wishes and plenty 
of foreign assistance to Pretoria. At least 1 billion viewers will witness this 
historic moment on television. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been an astonishing two weeks for the 75-year-old Mandela and his 
African National Congress. He has presided over a nonviolent transfer of power, 
a rare outcome for most political revolutions. He has become president of a 
country that imprisoned him for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 President Mandela is fashioning an admirably inclusive government.  
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, on the floor of a Parliament that had always been off-limits to 
blacks, Mandela hugged his most potent black adversary, Zulu Chief Mangosuthu 
Gatsha Buthelezi. The rivalry between Buthelezi's Inkatha and ANC supporters 
has killed more than 15,000 South Africans in the four years since Mandela was 
freed. That embrace, coupled with Inkatha's showing in the election that allows 
Buthelezi to appoint three ministers to the multiparty Cabinet, should help 
reduce hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC will hold the most power because Mandela won the right to appoint 18 
to the Cabinet. He chose Thabo Mbeki, a veteran ANC leader, as his first deputy 
president. Longtime supporter Joe Slovo, the white leader of the Communist 
Party, holds the health and welfare portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 By virtue of the National Party's strong second-place showing, former 
President Frederik W. De Klerk will become a deputy president. De Klerk also 
chose several prominent holdovers from his tenure to the Cabinet. One is Derek 
Keys, a successful businessman, who will keep his job as minister of finance. 
Another key appointment is Roelf Meyer, the white minority government's chief 
negotiator during the talks that led to the transition to democracy, as 
minister of constitutional development. Their place in the new Cabinet should 
reassure wary potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
 President Mandela's new coalition government will expire in five years -- long 
enough for the racially and politically integrated Cabinet to set the tone for 
power-sharing in the new South Africa. It is off to an auspicious start.

GOV. WILSON AND IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Skelton misses the point in his column (May 2) when he argues that Gov. 
Pete Wilson is bashing the system, not immigrants. Although the governor's 
rhetoric on this issue has suddenly taken a turn toward moderation -- 
attributable to the efforts of organizations such as Proponents for Responsible 
Immigration Debate and Education (PRIDE) -- he continues to frame the issue in 
a fashion that leads to immigrant bashing. The governor continues to insist 
that immigrants come for services and thus cost taxpayers money, and he 
continues to avoid the real pull factor: We provide jobs for immigrants and 
exploit their labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The "lure" for immigrants is not education or emergency medical care, but jobs 
that employers are more than happy to provide. Thus, immigrants support our 
economy, not take away from it. Indeed, one must ask what alternatives the 
governor proposes to eliminating these so-called "lures." How can he prefer 
that children be on the streets rather than in classrooms? How can he support 
the denial of emergency medical and prenatal care that would lead to a 
deterioration of the public health?

 * Regarding Skelton's column: As a non-Hispanic minority, I acknowledge myself 
as a bigot with the decency to overcome the stereotypes in this racially 
diverse state. Wilson's sick and tired choice of topic appalls me: Hearing the 
word "border" in his speech shows him as an anti-Hispanic opportunist. 
</P>
<P>
 Can somebody tell Wilson that although Hispanics compose a substantial number 
of illegal immigrants, there are other nationalities (Chinese, Filipino, Irish, 
to name a few) that are notorious for their illegal entry to the United States? 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration is not the root of California's economic woes; poor state 
funds management is. I'm all for having the federal government paying for the 
housing illegal immigrants until they are shipped back to where they came from, 
but Gov. Wilson had more than enough time to "bash the system" during his term. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * The position taken by Wilson to sue the federal government to pay for what 
illegal immigration costs California may be unpopular, but it makes sense. It 
is one of the functions of the federal government to protect our borders. It is 
not doing so. I am not against immigration (I migrated to this country myself) 
but I am against unregulated and illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials may juggle their figures all they want to prove that 
illegal immigration has nothing to do with the financial plight of our cities, 
our counties, and our state; I (and many people like me) do not believe them. 
We live in this state and we can see that illegal immigration is one of the 
causes of our financial crisis.  
</P>
<P>
 We are running out of money at a time when we need more money than ever to 
combat a rising crime rate not only by increasing police, building more prisons 
and stiffening sentences, but above all by improving education and creating new 
programs that will offer our youth opportunities to acquire marketable skills 
and become productive citizens (rather than pushing dope or joining a gang). It 
is difficult to achieve these goals, but it will be a little easier and we will 
have more resources to allocate to our youngsters if we stop importing a good 
number of them from abroad.

 In asking the question, "Is the West Blinded by Religion?" (editorial, May 1), 
The Times revealed its own religious blind spot. Calling the "U.N. rescue of 
Muslim Somalia from famine and anarchy" a refutation of the Muslim Public 
Affairs Council's claim that the "United Nations is effective only when it acts 
against Muslims" is specious.Unlike the Bosnians, the Somalians were not 
victims of Christian aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 years of research on the history of Christianity and racism, I have 
yet to find a case in which the West has effectively opposed a Christian 
nation's oppression of non-Christians. Western culture is driven by the 
Christian dogma that all other faiths are false and therefore all other 
cultures are inferior. That dogma was a justification for not only those famous 
European battles with Muslims, but, when reinforced by the Christian mandate to 
spread the word, for every Western intrusion into the polytheistic world where 
two-thirds of the Earth's people live.

USE OF FORCE IN HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By threatening the use of military force in Haiti (May 4), President Clinton 
has begun to learn how to deal with unreasonable totalitarian dictators. Raoul 
Cedras will never concede without a fight, because he knows that too many 
people want to kill him for his crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the black market in fuel and arms, total control of the Haitian people 
through terror, and no trade sanctions on food, the Haitian military has 
everything it needs to ride out even stepped-up economic sanctions. Military 
force constitutes the only viable way to oust Cedras, end the humanitarian 
catastrophe and re-establish the democratically elected government. Without 
military force, the Haitian military will continue to terrorize the population 
with public executions, disappearances, kidnapings, tortures, mutilations and 
rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 By leaving Aristide supporters with their faces missing on the streets, Cedras 
reminds the Haitian people that he has control. Risking navigation of wooden 
rafts over shark-infested waters and interdiction, political refugees fleeing 
for U.S. shores remind the United States that Clinton's policies have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnia crisis should have taught Clinton that empty threats have no worth. 
The Haitian crisis will probably teach him that economic sanctions will fail 
against countries with no economy to speak of. Who knows what will fully teach 
Clinton to deal with unreasonable totalitarian dictators, if both the history 
of Neville Chamberlain and the present aftermath of the Governors Island 
agreement have failed.

HEED MALADIES OF GULF WAR VETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 3% of the nearly 700,000 Americans who served in the Persian Gulf War 
theater in 1990 and 1991 have reported they are suffering from a variety of 
serious and in some cases crippling ailments, including memory loss, fatigue, 
rashes and muscle and joint pains. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources of many of these problems remain a mystery, though it's likely 
that exposure to such chemical products as fumes from burning oil wells and 
depleted uranium used in munitions and armor plating may be among the causes. 
It also seems increasingly likely that at least some of the reported health 
problems can be traced to the use of certain drugs administered to counteract 
the feared use by Iraq of chemical and biological agents. In an effort to 
protect the health and lives of uniformed personnel, the U.S. military may have 
inadvertently done some of them serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Three drugs have drawn particular notice. One is licensed only for the 
treatment of myasthenia gravis, a chronic muscle disorder. Another is approved 
to protect against anthrax. The third is a still-unapproved vaccine to combat 
botulism. At the request of the Pentagon, the Food and Drug Administration 
granted waivers to use the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy in retrospect to question this decision and the subsequent broad 
administration of drugs that were either unproved or narrowly intended for the 
treatment of a specific disease. But these actions can't be divorced from the 
context in which they occurred. Iraq had used chemical agents before, against 
Iranian forces and against some of its own rebellious citizens. There was every 
reason to try to protect U.S. forces against such a hideous contingency. 
</P>
<P>
 Clear links between the illnesses suffered by some Gulf War veterans and the 
chemicals they may have been exposed to have yet to be proved. But clearly 
thousands of veterans are suffering, and many charge that the Department of 
Veterans Affairs has done little to ease their plight. We don't know how much, 
if any, bureaucratic indifference there may be. We do know that the 20,000 or 
so Gulf War veterans who have reported serious service-related ailments have a 
moral claim on their government to get straight answers about the illnesses and 
how they can best be treated.

STUMBLING TOWARD A SHOWDOWN?; CLINTON NOTCHES UP PRESSURE ON HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton moved a step closer to resolving the domestic political 
problems Haiti is causing him by tapping former Rep. William H. Gray III as his 
special envoy to that nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, head of the United Negro College Fund, will replace Lawrence A. 
Pezzullo, a U.S. Foreign Service officer whose efforts to help negotiate a 
settlement to the long and frustrating Haitian crisis were notably 
unsuccessful. With the ouster of a career diplomat in favor of a former 
congressman, there can be no clearer sign that, for now, the domestic 
ramifications of Haiti's turmoil have taken priority over foreign- policy ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Haiti had become a political embarrassment for Clinton. Since 
taking office the President has been in the acutely uncomfortable position of 
maintaining a Bush Administration policy on Haitian refugees that candidate 
Bill Clinton had condemned. The hard-hearted policy allows the U.S. Coast Guard 
to return refugees intercepted at sea to their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy has come under fire from African Americans as well as refugee 
advocates. Contrasting it with the welcome mat the United States still has out 
for refugees from the Castro regime in Cuba, some critics even labeled the 
Haitian refugee policy racist. That criticism took a dramatic turn when 
prominent African American activist Randall Robinson, head of the 
foreign-policy lobbying group TransAfrica, protested with a hunger strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus it was no coincidence that Clinton, in announcing Gray's appointment, 
also said he is ordering a policy change. Henceforth, Haitian refugees will be 
accorded asylum hearings at sea, rather than being automatically returned to 
authorities in Haiti for what could be a very cruel fate. Even if that results 
in asylum for only a few more Haitian refugees than is currently the case, the 
symbolism of Clinton's action was enough to persuade Robinson to end his 
dramatic fast after 27 days. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Clinton may have resolved his domestic problems with regard to 
Haiti, he and the United Nations must still find some way to leverage the 
military junta that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991 from power 
so that Aristide can return from exile. Last week's U.N. decision to impose 
tighter economic sanctions was necessary. But those sanctions must be given 
some time to work before a suggested next step is seriously considered: 
military action against the Haitian junta by either a U.S., U.N. or even an 
exile force. 
</P>
<P>
 For while U.S. forces are fully capable of ousting the thugs who control Haiti 
-- and that would surely be satisfying to many -- military action might only 
compound the challenge of nation-building for a post-junta government. Thus far 
the Clinton Administration shows no signs of having cracked that part of the 
daunting Haitian dilemma.

OUTPOURING FOR PRESIDENT NIXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The outpouring of sadness over Richard Nixon's death is probably more a result 
over a loss of our past, rather than a loss of the man. Nixon was President 
when cultural diversity meant either you were part of the Establishment or a 
member of the hippie counterculture. He was President during a time when 
Americans feared inflation rather than crime and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a President you either loved or ridiculed, and it seemed that all 
Americans were somehow involved in our nation's destiny -- that is not the case 
today.

 * In reviewing the comments made about Nixon, I remember my own personal 
experience involving his presidency. In 1969, after I and my wife had moved to 
California, my mother and father (who had remained in Brooklyn, N.Y.) both 
became critically ill. As a result, my younger brother had to leave college to 
operate my father's one-man gas station and to otherwise assist my parents. 
</P>
<P>
 By leaving school, my brother lost his student deferment and, predictably, 
soon received an induction notice to report for the draft. In frustration, I 
sent a two-page telegram to then-President Nixon setting forth the relevant 
facts. Within days, I received a response from the President's secretary, an 
acknowledgment from the Selective Service System and a notice that the draft 
board would hold a special hearing in Brooklyn. My brother was then granted a 
hardship exemption and, as he left the hearing room, he noticed that my 
telegram to the President was sitting on the top of the board's file. 
</P>
<P>
 We will always be grateful to President Nixon for assisting us in our hour of 
need. Nixon was many things to many people but, for our family at least, he was 
presidential and caring in every real sense of the word.

PLATFORM; WHAT KIDS 'TELL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MABIE SETTLAGE teaches 7th- and 8th-grade science at G.W. Carver Middle 
School, Los Angeles. She responds to one objection raised in the controversy 
over the California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) testthat the required 
personal writings may be an invasion of privacy: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children often volunteer very personal information in regular classroom 
assignments. And if a child is seriously worried, it can be good for a teacher 
to know that and try to help.Under the state curriculum, 7th-grade science 
covers substance abuse. Sometimes my students write about such things as a 
parent who is alcoholic. This gives me a chance to talk with the student; I 
might tell him or her that alcoholism is a disease, and it's not the child's 
fault a parent is drinking.  
</P>
<P>
 What adults must understand is that they can't base their thinking on the way 
things were; these kids must confront things about sexuality, substance abuse 
and violence that their parents didn't have to deal with until they were 
adults.  
</P>
<P>
 I believe parents worried about our society are concentrating on the wrong 
targets. To me, the real culprits are the companies -- the advertisers and the 
media and entertainment moguls -- who have broken down the barrier between 
childhood and adulthood. For instance, showing pre-pubescent children in 
designer clothes and sexual poses, they try to empower kids to pressure their 
parents into spending money. This so-called market strategy has tremendously 
undermined America's moral values, as well as the confidence in adult authority 
that children need.

SOUTH AFRICA OFFERS ITSELF AS A MODEL; MANDELA: 'THROUGH DEMOCRACY, (MAKING) 
THE WORLD SAFE FOR DIVERSITY' IS A KEY GOAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NELSON MANDELA, Nelson Mandela's commentary was excerpted from the 
forthcoming The Post Cold War Order: Views of the World's Political Power 
Elite, a compilation of essays edited by Keith Philip Lepor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are, to use a famous phrase from another transition in history, present at 
the creation. Because this is so, there is a need to develop a sense of 
orderliness in the world. To do so, a direct link needs to be established 
between responsible membership of the community of nations and global stability 
and progress. The converse is also true; if countries want to enjoy the rights 
of community, they need to act responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Philosophers teach that the rights of citizenship follow from the sharing of 
values in the common cause. As we prepare for the new century, each country 
needs to build upon a set of common properties that will aim to anchor it 
within the ambit of a legitimate new world order. 
</P>
<P>
 The test of South Africa's foreign policy in this context will be found in the 
quality of its domestic politics. My government wants South Africa to be a 
symbol of a world in which diverse people can live in peace. The quality, too, 
of the government will be reflected in our foreign policy. South Africa will be 
among those countries whose efforts are to promote and foster democratic 
systems of government. This is especially important in Africa, and our concerns 
will be fixed on securing the spirit of tolerance and the ethos of sound 
governance throughout the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa's global destiny is linked to maintaining vigilance around the 
same precepts that united the world against apartheid, which were able to 
distinguish between principle and prejudice, which separated ethics from 
expedience, ingenuity from ineptitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the world community is in search of stability, our experience suggests 
that we dare not relinquish the commitment to human rights in international 
affairs. Global change has, if anything, heightened the salience of the issue. 
The unfolding tragedies, from Sarajevo to Rwanda, whose images are the 
lifeblood of the electronic media, underpin the importance of respect for human 
rights in securing our common future. 
</P>
<P>
 While governments should be mindful of the high ideals of human rights, they 
should be conscious of a democratic realism that surrounds the issue, too. The 
neglect of human rights is a certain recipe for internal and international 
disaster. The powerful secessionist movements that are found throughout the 
world are nurtured by neglect. The erosion of national sovereignty by global 
forces, from trade to communications, has been accompanied by an increase in 
the means to ensure its separateness: The right to differ has, tragically, 
become the fight to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 The violent breakup of states points to the horrors facing countries in Africa 
and elsewhere that are not prepared to accept that diversity is integral to the 
human condition. These failed states will fall prey to greater internecine 
strife that will sap, if not destroy, the potential of their people. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe this fate beckons my own country. They are thoroughly wrong. Few 
people on Earth have experienced intolerance as have South Africans. Even in 
the darkest days of apartheid and the most tragic moments of our turbulent 
transition, South Africans of all colors and creeds have, with great courage, 
shown respect for difference. A central goal of South Africa's foreign policy, 
like its domestic politics, will be to promote institutions and forces that, 
through democracy, seek to make the world safe for diversity.

PERSPECTIVE ON CRIME; OPEN SCHOOLS AT NIGHT FOR SAFE FUN; GET KIDS OFF THE 
STREETS AND INTO COMMUNITY-STAFFED PROGRAMS. IT WILL BE CHEAPER THAN BUILDING 
MORE PRISONS.

(Atheneum, 1993).

<TEXT>
<P>
 How many prisons must California build before we learn there's a better place, 
right inside our communities, to reduce violence and gang activity? Open up 
schools at night. Light up the gyms, the computer labs, the study halls. Invite 
young people off the mean streets into a safe haven. Bring adults in as 
coaches, study advisers, someone to talk to. Build community around the schools 
by opening the schools to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe, productive after-school programs are a sensible crime-prevention 
program. And far less costly than prisons. The state will spend an estimated $2 
billion incarcerating "three strikes" offenders. But many youths never get to 
swing a bat on a real baseball diamond. Street corners are their field of 
dreams -- and nightmares. With no team to join, they form a gang. With no 
coach, they look up to the neighborhood drug dealer. Instead of developing life 
skills, they advance in violent crime. Without a role in the community, they 
become its predators. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools are the only public asset in many neighborhoods. But after 3:30 p.m., 
these valuable classrooms, gyms, labs and playgrounds sit empty. The playing, 
the learning, the experimenting moves to the streets, the alleys, the latchkey 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Two legislative proposals, one state and the other federal, offer some relief. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, State Sen. Lucy Killea (I-San Diego) and Assemblywoman Dede 
Alpert (D-Coronado) have proposed legislation that would enable school 
districts to keep schools open until 8 p.m. on weekdays, 10 p.m. on Fridays and 
Saturdays.  
</P>
<P>
 "We would provide kids with the kitchen table many of us had when we were 
growing up," says Harry Weinberg, San Diego County Superintendent of Schools, 
who conceived the initiative. Each school district would design its own 
program. Participation would be voluntary. The state would provide supplemental 
funds. The budget analysis isn't complete, but costs could be kept low by 
involving volunteers, community agencies, clubs and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) has included in the pending crime bill a national 
"community schools initiative" to open schools to community groups. The Senate 
bill also authorizes $400 million for after-school programs -- a tantalizing 
funding source for California.  
</P>
<P>
 Although state and federal initiatives are crucial, these programs can be 
started on a shoestring budget. A few years ago, Emory School in South San 
Diego Bay managed to offer Spanish, music, dance, drama, science, jump-rope 
competition and rocketeers for $15,000 per school year. But, as is often the 
case, the state-lottery funding vanished and Emory had to drop the program.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, many extracurricular programs were jettisoned in the rush to 
get "back to basics." Band, theater and recreation programs were cut because 
they didn't teach the three Rs. But group activities do teach three Rs -- 
respect, responsibility and relationships.  
</P>
<P>
 Kids without jobs, chores or parents to monitor homework are deprived of 
attention but rich in leisure -- tycoons of time, with only chump change in 
their pockets. Without attachments to family and community, they are prey to 
destructive influences. Drugs, alcohol, vandalism, rape, drive-by shootings all 
become leisure-time activities.  
</P>
<P>
 Can after-school programs really make a difference? So many schools are 
already embattled by their own crime and budget problems. Overwhelmed 
administrators understandably ask: Won't adding after-school activities be the 
straw that breaks the camel's back? 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't have to, if enough people are willing to come forward and lend a 
hand. We can't afford not to try. We face a crisis that goes beyond education 
and strikes at the heart of our communities. If we do not use resources of our 
neighborhoods to raise children, if we do not spend time -- not just money -- 
to tutor, coach and counsel them, then we all will be prisoners in our homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdown in public safety has shaken our confidence in social 
institutions that, many believe, have failed to provide either justice or 
security. So we put our faith in penal institutions. A decade ago, California 
spent twice as much on the state universities as on prisons; now, after 
building 19 prisons but only one university campus, funding is equal. Do we 
really consider jailers a better investment than teachers? 
</P>
<P>
 The playground after school is a good place to learn in safety what too many 
of our children are trying to learn the hard way on the streets: to stand up to 
bullies; to avoid drugs; to feel strong enough to stop running and face up to 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Open up the schools tonight, and maybe we won't need so many prisons tomorrow.

bombs will be dropped on your military headquarters in Pale." (Gen. William 
Westmoreland must read such lines with an ironic smile.) Scarcely less urgent 
in their demands to throw gasoline on the ethno-religious conflict have been 
conspicuous members of the liberal left and self-professed socialists, as with 
a call to bomb the Serbs from the late Michael Harrington's Democratic 
Socialists of America. 
</P>
<P>
 This dementia has a sinister momentum. Just as, after World War II, liberals 
pioneered Cold War politics, so too now do their heirs urge a course of Western 
policy calculated to exclude Russia from any constructive politico-military 
initiative. The crucial Russian role in bringing about disengagement in 
Sarajevo is studiously ignored. Russian offers to send a large peacekeeping 
force to Bosnia are left to hang, while all real decisions are monopolized by 
NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to save the U.N. peacekeeping role and, more important, the lives 
of Bosnians, is to have a much larger U.N. peacekeeping force, with Russian 
troops matching the Western contingent and no corresponding influx of 
Americans. For any Serb, the NATO forces are now irrevocably aligned with the 
Croatian-Muslim confederation.  
</P>
<P>
 There are excellent reasons for any sensible person not to want U.S. ground 
troops involved. Such troops are always commanded by officers answering to the 
Pentagon and not to the U.N. chain of command, unless such a command is itself 
entirely subordinate to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton bears grievous responsibility for Bosnia's travails. He has 
consistently kept alive the Bosnian leaders' hopes that the West would forcibly 
intervene on their side to assert their control of all the territory they 
claim. Here's where Clinton and all those along the "bomb the bastards" 
coalition join hands. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that the Muslims have endured the worst suffering and dislocation 
in the former Yugoslavia, but those who urge that the killing field be leveled 
by lifting the arms embargo and arming the Bosnian government should realize 
the implications of their call. The project of President Alija Izetbegovic and 
the Muslim military faction that controls him is to reconquer the whole of 
Bosnia. This can be done only by driving large numbers of Serbs and Croats from 
their homelands -- echoing the bloody evictions suffered by Muslims -- 
indefinitely extending the horrors by which additional thousands of Muslims as 
well as Serbs and Croats would die. 
</P>
<P>
 The "arm the Bosnians" crowd has bought into the claim that the Izetbegovic 
government represents the will of all the Bosnian communities and is legitimate 
-- despite the refusal of the Serbian third of Bosnia's population to have 
anything to do with it -- merely because the NATO powers gave it diplomatic 
recognition in 1992. All the fraught problems of how best to construct a 
post-Yugoslav Bosnia -- problems best entrusted to an interim U.N. protectorate 
-- are swept aside by the laptop bombardiers with their terse advisories to 
rain down explosives or rush in arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Their hysterical campaign has met with scant opposition. Among the few 
critical voices has been that of Simon Jenkins, a British journalist writing in 
the weekly Spectator. Jenkins, who gave us the useful term laptop bombardiers , 
noted that the bombing of Gorazde "met a need, indeed a craving, for a wider 
war in Bosnia that seems to lie deep in the subconscious of the Western media." 
This is true, too, of most Western liberals. And what will they say when 
Macedonia, or the whole of the Balkans, goes up in flames? 
</P>
<P>
 We don't need appeals for bombs from liberals (whose calls for "precision 
strikes" display a remarkable failure to learn from 20th-Century military 
history) but pressure for a political settlement among all the Bosnian 
communities, a settlement that will necessarily involve compromise by each 
party and that could involve both temporary partition and confederation.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; SHEFFIELD HURT IN LOSS, BROWNING IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Marlins might have lost something Monday night at Miami, while the 
Pittsburgh Pirates might have found something. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida All-Star Gary Sheffield partially dislocated his left shoulder and 
starting pitcher Ryan Bowen injured his left side in a 9-5 loss to the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning pitcher was Alejandro Pena, who missed the 1993 season because of 
an injured right elbow. Pena earned his first victory since July 21, 1992, with 
two innings of one-hit relief for the Pirates. "I was having my problems the 
last two years, but I'm still here," said Pena (1-0). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a survivor, a hard-working guy. I take good care of myself and I think 
that's what got me back here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marlins also learned that relief ace Bryan Harvey, scheduled to come off 
the disabled list this week, pulled himself from a minor league rehabilitation 
assignment because of tightness in his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield, batting .312 with 12 homers and 33 RBIs, was injured trying to make 
a diving catch in right field on Tom Foley's double in the sixth inning. He 
will undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging exam today. "It looks like we could 
lose Sheff for a while," Marlin Manager Rene Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen (0-5) felt pain on his second pitch, but stayed in the game for six 
innings. He will have X-rays today, and Lachemann said he might miss a start. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 3, San Diego 2 -- In his 300th major league game, Tom Browning of 
the Reds broke his left arm while making a pitch in the sixth inning at San 
Diego and had to be carried from the field on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bases loaded and a 0-and-1 count against Archi Cianfrocco, Browning, 
a left-hander, made what seemed like a normal delivery. But the ball wobbled 
off well to the left of the plate and he collapsed, clutching at his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 He lay motionless for about five minutes and his eyes were closed and his 
mouth was open when he was carried off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The wild pitch allowed Ray Holbert to score and give the Padres a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds tied it when Bret Boone doubled leading off the seventh and scored on 
Brian Dorsett's single. Dorsett moved around on Barry Larkin's sacrifice bunt 
and one wild pitch by Pedro Martinez (0-1), then scored on another wild pitch 
for a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning allowed two runs on four hits in 5 2/3 innings and had held San Diego 
hitless until left-hander Phil Plantier homered leading off the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Montreal 4 -- David Segui homered in the eighth inning off Mel 
Rojas to lift the Mets to a victory at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Segui's home run, his fourth, with two out broke a 4-4 tie and sent New York 
to a fifth victory in six games. Rojas (2-1) had struck out his first three 
batters, including Bobby Bonilla with one on in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 12, Colorado 5 -- Barry Bonds hit the third grand slam of his 
career in the third inning at San Francisco, where the Giants overcame a 
team-record five homers by the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds' homer off Armando Reynoso (2-3) was his eighth homer of the season. 
Matt Williams added his major league-leading 14th homer in the sixth, a 
three-run drive off Marcus Moore. Williams has eight homers in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 7, Philadelphia 2 -- Fred McGriff drove in three runs with a home run 
and double as the Braves beat the Phillies at Atlanta in the first meeting of 
the two teams since last year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff and Mark Lemke keyed a four-run first inning with two-run doubles, and 
Terry Pendleton and David Justice added solo home runs for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, St. Louis 3 -- The Cubs, 1-12 at Wrigley Field, evened their road 
record at 8-8 as Eddie Zambrano hit two two-run homers at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Trachsel (4-2) struck out nine. In his previous start, Trachsel was on 
the mound when the Cubs ended their club-record 12-game home losing streak.

 T-Bill Rates Hit 2 1/2-Year High: The Treasury Department sold $12.1 billion 
of new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.32%, up from 4% last 
week. Another $12 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 4.81%, up from 4.41%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since they sold for 4.39% on Dec. 2, 1991. The six-month bill rate was the 
highest since they averaged 5.04% on Oct. 28, 1991. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 4.43% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,890.80, and 5% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,756.80. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill Auction

 THE 48-HOUR WHO: Work crews started setting up the stage early Monday morning 
for "The Who's Tommy," which opens tonight at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. "It's the most lavish Broadway production we've ever had," says 
spokesman Greg Patterson. "They're working round the clock to be ready." . . . 
Only a few tickets remain for the touring rock opera, which runs tonight 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 FINALLY BREWING: There's something else new at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center besides "Tommy." The house has started selling coffee for the first 
time. . . . It wasn't served before out of fear that it would stain the carpet 
of the pristine facility. But new executive director Tom Tomlinson ordered up 
the brew. "People just love it," Patterson says. It's available on the terrace.

 FOR JIMMY: Chapman University officials wanted to throw a dinner to honor 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley for heading up its committee to renovate Founders 
Hall. Riley agreed, on one condition: That the dinner -- Wednesday night at the 
Irvine Hyatt Regency -- be a fund-raiser for the renovation. The hall will be 
renamed Roosevelt Hall -- for Riley's friend and former congressman James 
Roosevelt, a longtime Chapman trustee until his death in 1991. The event, which 
will include Roosevelt's widow, Mary (above, with her husband), is likely to 
raise about $100,000.

 VOTE FOR CAPITALISM: It was the only mishap on a recent successful visit by 
two visiting Chinese officials: One of them left under a hotel pillow a purse 
containing U.S. and Hong Kong dollars, valued at more than $1,500. A maid at 
the Desert Palm Suites in Anaheim found it and turned it in. The America China 
Business Society in Anaheim, which arranged the visit, helped get it back to 
them. . . . The society's director, Jonathan Zhong Ding, says the visitors were 
touched. He calls it "a sharp contrast to what was taught to their generations 
in China regarding capitalism."

REALTOR ON STAND IN WYNN CASE; KIDNAPING: LONGTIME FRIEND TELLS OF PRIME 
SUSPECT RAY CUDDY'S PURCHASE OF $20,000 WATCH AND ATTEMPT TO BUY $200,000 
FERARRI. FBI FOUND $500,000 IN RANSOM MONEY IN WITNESS'S GARAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ray Cuddy bought a $20,000 watch, schemed over the cash purchase of a $200,000 
car and hid $500,000 in ransom money in the garage of a longtime friend 
following the Kevin Wynn kidnaping, a witness testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy has been identified by the government as the ringleader in the July 26 
kidnaping of the daughter of casino mogul Steve Wynn. Kevin Wynn was released 
unharmed two hours after her father paid a $1.45-million ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 The government contends Cuddy went on a spending binge in Newport Beach, 
Calif., while his two alleged associates in the crime, Jacob Sherwood and 
Anthony Watkins, gave out thousands of dollars in $100 bills to friends in 
their hometown of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The second week of the high-profile trial began Monday with the government 
producing a key witness, California realtor Spyro Kemble. He told of his 
dealings with Cuddy, his longtime friend, in the days following the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI found $500,000 of the ransom money in Kemble's garage among boxes 
Cuddy had stored at the Newport Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
 The $500,000 was introduced as evidence Monday, displayed in five clear 
plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said he had known Cuddy since 1980, and had loaned him more than 
$20,000 in the past three years. He said Cuddy had obtained a $500,000 judgment 
in a lawsuit, and was emotionally devastated when the award was reversed on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble testified he received a call from Cuddy on July 27, and met him at a 
Newport import car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Cuddy told him: "Our ship has come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said he understood the remark to mean "the lawsuit was finally over; 
Ray had received his money." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy planned to pay cash for a $200,000 Ferarri, Kemble said, until the 
dealer informed him he would have to file certain forms with the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt uncomfortable, and sought an alternative plan," Kemble testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said Cuddy was "obsessed" with the white Ferarri and had talked of 
buying it when he settled his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That auto represented vindication to Ray," the friend testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said Cuddy began opening checking accounts at different banks for 
$9,000 to $9,500 each -- staying below the $10,000 cash deposits that would 
require reporting to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy also talked to a broker about depositing funds in the Cayman Islands, 
but dropped the idea when he learned the company would investigate the source 
of his funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said he was not suspicious of the sudden cache of $100 bills because of 
the claim of the lawsuit settlement and Cuddy's penchant for dealing in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about receiving a lawsuit settlement in cash, Kemble said Cuddy "just 
smiled." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray had always dealt in cash his entire life," Kemble said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said Cuddy owed him $20,000 but gave him $35,000, which was to include 
a loan until some real estate transactions closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said Cuddy went on a spending spree in Newport Beach, paying $20,000 
for a watch, $2,900 for two men's suits, "in excess of $2,000 or $3,000" for 
cowboy boots and a belt made out of ostrich skin, and $3,000 for a designer 
suit for Kemble's fiancee. All the items were purchased with $100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said FBI agents questioned him more than a dozen times about his 
relationship with Cuddy, in which he denied having anything to do with the 
kidnaping or having any prior knowledge of the crime.

U.S. HIGH COURT REJECTS GACY'S EXECUTION STAY; APPEAL: REBUFF IS SECOND IN DAY. 
ANOTHER PLEA BY MAN CONVICTED OF KILLING 33 BOYS AND YOUNG MEN IS NOW BEFORE 
ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court rebuffed an eleventh-hour effort Monday by lawyers for 
John Wayne Gacy to halt his execution, more than a decade after the gruesome 
discovery of a makeshift graveyard under his home led to his conviction for 
murdering 33 young men and boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy, 52, was scheduled to die by injection shortly after 12:01 a.m. today at 
the maximum-security Stateville Correctional Center, 35 miles southwest of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-judge federal appeals court panel in Chicago rejected an earlier 
effort Monday to block the execution. Gacy's lawyers had another appeal pending 
before the state Supreme Court, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Monday, in downtown Chicago, hundreds of singing, laughing people, 
some wearing party hats and others dressed as clowns, marched through downtown 
in celebration of the impending execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy was convicted in March, 1980, in one of the nation's worst serial killing 
cases. Most of the bodies were found buried in the crawl space beneath his 
ranch-style Norwood Park home. 
</P>
<P>
 Families of Gacy's victims maintained a tense vigil waiting for word of his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been waiting for this for 14 years and when it's over with it will be a 
relief," said Harold Piest, father of Gacy's last victim, Robert Piest, whose 
disappearance led to Gacy's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, the execution celebration, called a "Gacy Day Parade," was put 
together by Don Wade, an on-air personality at WLS radio in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want America to see how most people feel about criminals," Wade told the 
crowd from his perch on the base of a large outdoor Picasso sculpture that 
dominates Daley Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd engulfed a lonely stand of about eight death penalty protesters and 
swamped a previously scheduled D-Day 50th anniversary musical celebration, 
where a young man dressed in a World War II sailor's uniform crooned "I'll Be 
Seeing You" and other period pieces, trying vainly to be heard above the roar 
of the Gacy crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens in that crowd carried signs reading "Gacy -- stick it to him," in 
reference to the lethal injection. Others sang: "Well Hello Gacy, it's so nice 
to have you right where you belong," to the tune "Hello Dolly." 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy was flown to Stateville by helicopter early Monday from the Menard 
Correctional Center in Southern Illinois, where he spent 14 years and two 
months in a windowless cell on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy had asked to meet with relatives and a priest, and requested a last meal 
of fried chicken, french fries and fresh strawberries, Corrections Department 
spokesman Nic Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six law enforcement officials and a dozen reporters were invited to witness 
the execution. Prison officials barred both of Gacy's relatives and the 
families of his victims from the execution chamber, citing security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy's plea to the federal appeals court contended, among other things, that 
he is mentally incompetent, that the state's execution method is 
unconstitutional and that he was out of town when 16 of the murders were 
committed.

2 PLEAD GUILTY TO SALES OF FAKE JET PARTS; COURTS: EXECUTIVES OF FONTANA FIRM 
ADMIT SELLING SUBSTANDARD ENGINE LINERS FOR USE IN SMALL, PRIVATE AIRCRAFT. THE 
INVESTIGATION BEGAN WITH A 1992 RAID OF AN OXNARD COMPANY. 
</P>

<P>
 A federal fraud investigation prompted by a 1992 raid of an Oxnard firm led 
Monday to guilty pleas by two aircraft parts brokers, who admitted selling fake 
engine parts for small private jets. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokers -- executives at Ontario Air Parts in Fontana -- pleaded guilty to 
conspiring to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration and private aircraft 
companies by selling cheap, counterfeit jet engine liners from Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 James A. Fishback Sr., 60, and Earlene C. Christenson, 45, also acknowledged 
buying from now-defunct Dixon Aircraft Components of Oxnard worn military 
engine liners and illegally selling them for use on civilian jets, such as the 
Lear jet. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea bargain entered in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, prosecutors 
said they will recommend sentences of six months in jail and a $250,000 fine 
for each defendant and a $250,000 fine against the Fontana company, which is 
owned by Fishback. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishback's attorney, Richard Sherman of Los Angeles, said the company is 
cooperating with the government investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been some things that have not been handled properly," Sherman 
said. But the defendants "are not dangerous or dishonest people." 
</P>
<P>
 The brokers sold to six companies about 60 substandard engine liners for small 
jets capable of carrying up to 20 passengers, prosecutors said. Nearly all the 
liners have now been recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is serious because (defendants) circumvented the FAA scheme of 
regulation, which is designed to ensure that all civilian aircraft parts are up 
to specifications," Assistant U.S. Atty. George B. Newhouse said. "There is a 
huge risk that these parts may fail in flight." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of federal safety checks was particularly significant in this case 
because engine liners are so important to a jet's operation, authorities said. 
The liners separate the extreme heat of fuel combustion from an engine's moving 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no airline crashes have been attributed to counterfeit parts in this 
country, the use of unapproved parts is seen by experts as a significant 
problem worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 An aging Norwegian charter plane crashed in 1989 at least partly because of 
unsanctioned parts, killing 55 people, said Howard Aylesworth of the Aerospace 
Industries Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, six small general aviation planes have crashed because 
of the failure of parts not approved by the FAA, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All airplanes are manufactured to very, very high tolerances of safety," 
Aylesworth said. "But unapproved parts compromise that margin of safety. They 
create an unknown safety condition." 
</P>
<P>
 FAA spokesman Joe Doubleday, however, said he is not aware of the general 
aviation crashes cited by Aylesworth. He said counterfeit parts are a concern 
but have not proved to be an actual safety hazard because so many backups are 
built into jet aircraft systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have found no crashes or equipment failure linked to parts sold 
by the Fontana brokers or refurbished by Dixon Aircraft, Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's convictions bring to 62 the number of fake-aircraft-parts cases 
successfully prosecuted by federal authorities during the last two years, said 
Dennis Dutch, a top investigator at the Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Counterfeit parts were his office's top priority for the last two fiscal years 
because of a surge in complaints in 1991, Dutch said. Inquiries have resulted 
in 92 indictments nationwide. About 150 more cases remain active, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fontana case follows by six months a Los Angeles grand jury's 50-count 
federal indictment of Rudolf Augustus Dixon for defense fraud. His small Oxnard 
firm was closed after a raid two years ago by agents from the FBI, Department 
of Defense and Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon Aircraft, which repaired worn engines for the U.S. Air Force's largest 
cargo plane, the C-5B, was indicted on charges of failing to do required 
repairs, falsifying maintenance records and overcharging the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon, 57, who remains free on bail, was also charged with selling worn-out 
and obsolete engine parts to commercial airlines. His case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fontana case grew directly from evidence gathered in the 1992 raid. 
According to federal charges, Fishback telephoned Dixon in 1990 to get him to 
modify military engine liners used in Air Force F-5 jet fighters so they could 
be installed in civilian jet engines. 
</P>
<P>
 The military and civilian engines are similar because both are manufactured by 
General Electric Aircraft Engines in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dixon informed Fishback that the modification could not be lawfully performed 
under FAA regulations," the charges allege. But Dixon agreed to make the 
modifications anyway, prosecutors charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a conspiracy that lasted at least from 1989 through 1992, 
Fishback's firm bought numerous military engine liners from Masbe Corp. of 
Taiwan, removed identifying stickers and sold them for $7,500 as General 
Electric parts, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fontana firm made about $2,000 extra on each Taiwanese part but perhaps 
double that on each worn military part altered by Dixon, Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drug dealers might look enviously at some of these profits," he said. 
Prosecutors listed only two fraud victims in court documents -- Jet Sales 
Leasing Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, and Airwork Corp. of Millville, N.J. But 
authorities said evidence shows the other companies also received the 
counterfeit liners. 
</P>
<P>
 Other leads from the Dixon search are still being pursued, said Gary Auer, FBI 
agent-in-charge in Ventura County. The inquiry began in 1991 when a Dixon 
employee told authorities of widespread cheating at the company.

PLANNERS MAY RESTRICT ADULT STORE SITES; VENTURA: THE PANEL WILL CONSIDER 
LIMITING SUCH BUSINESSES TO A FEW INDUSTRIAL AREAS. SOME CHURCH GROUPS WANT 
THEM BANNED ENTIRELY. 
</P>

<P>
 Two years after a proposal to open an adult-oriented business raised a furor 
in Ventura, planning commissioners will consider Tuesday a permanent ordinance 
banning such businesses in all but a few industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the streets where adult theaters, bookstores and other businesses 
could set up shop are located south of the Ventura Freeway, roughly between 
Victoria Avenue and Arundell Avenue, city planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has had an interim ordinance for the last two years that allowed a 
pre-existing adult-oriented business on Main Street to continue operating, but 
prohibited any new such businesses from opening anywhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members approved the interim law after church groups and downtown 
merchants objected to a request to open an adult-oriented business near the 
Ventura County superintendent of schools office on Main Street in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance prohibits adult-oriented businesses within 500 feet of 
schools, homes, churches, parks, or anywhere else children might congregate.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can eliminate (adult-oriented businesses) because of the 
First Amendment, so this seems like a reasonable compromise," Planning 
Commissioner Chuck Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law "would not set anything in stone," said Mitch Oshinsky, a city 
planner. In theory, adult-oriented businesses could locate in any of the 
designated areas, but in practice, the city would consider each request on a 
case-by-case basis, Oshinsky said.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance restricts adult businesses to certain industrial zones 
and recommends specific blocks within those zones, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those areas include the neighborhood around the intersection of Callens Road 
and Market Street, targeted for light-industrial uses, and some blocks along 
Palma Drive, near its intersection with McGrath Street. Also designated are the 
area around the intersection of Walker Street and Saratoga Avenue, and some 
industrial blocks near Stanley Avenue, just west of Ventura Avenue and near 
California 33.  
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants along Callens Street, the largest area designated for 
adult-oriented businesses, said an adult bookstore or theater would not be a 
problem for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business is wholesale, we have a warehouse here, so we don't get walk-in 
traffic and I wouldn't particularly care," said Sandie Arruda, manager of the 
Peruvian Bead Co. on Callens. "I don't think it would make any difference to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Link Teffeteller, who owns a dental laboratory down the street, said even 
though he might not like to have such a business next door, he would not 
object. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, no one wants to be next door to an adult-oriented business," 
he said. "But as a businessman, I would never want to dictate to private 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides," Teffeteller said, "the reality here is yes, this area would be a 
long way from the younger population." 
</P>
<P>
 But some church group members say they are unhappy with the proposed law 
because it stops short of banning adult businesses from the city entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants that in their community, except for those who stand to profit 
from it," said Associate Pastor Jonathan Stockstill of Gold Coast Baptist 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockstill said city officials want the sales tax revenue from the adult 
businesses, and are thus reluctant to drive them out of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stockstill said he expects his 100-member congregation and other churches 
in Ventura to oppose the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll definitely mention it this week to our church," Stockstill said. 
"Churches can mobilize fairly quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The only existing adult-oriented business in Ventura is Three Star Books on 
Main Street. The shop, which has curtains shielding its windows and door from 
outside view, has not caused trouble in the neighborhood, some nearby merchants 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Cassio, manager of Three Star Books, said the store only admits people 
over 18 and tries to attract as little attention to itself as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't advertise, we're very low-key," he said. "We catch people at the 
door and ask them for their IDs all the time. We're really careful about 
carding people." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Commission will vote on the ordinance Tuesday, and their 
recommendation will then go the City Council, which will hold two public 
hearings on the ordinance in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearings are scheduled for May 16 and May 23. If passed by the 
council, the ordinance would go into effect 31 days after approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Peggy Y. Lee contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: The Ventura Planning Commission will meet tonight at 7 in the City 
Council chambers at City Hall, 501 Poli St. The meeting is open to the public.

ZUKOWSKI CRITICIZES CITY SALE OF PARCEL; THOUSAND OAKS: THE COUNCILWOMAN 
ADVOCATES MORE SCRUTINY OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS AFTER SOME LAND IS SOLD AT A PRICE 
SHE CONSIDERS TOO LOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Angered by the over-the-counter sale of a potentially valuable piece of land, 
Thousand Oaks City Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski on Monday called for greater 
council oversight when the city sells surplus land. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski said she intends to raise the issue at tonight's City Council meeting 
because, she said, the current process is vague and limits public 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put this on the agenda because if we're selling (property), it should be 
made available to anyone," Zukowski said. "I don't want to see us giving 
preferential treatment to any particular buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 But other city officials said the current system offers safeguards against 
favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 "How the city handles the sale of a property is always up to the discretion of 
the City Council," City Atty. Mark Sellers said. "If they want to put it up to 
bid, that's their option." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose last week when Zukowski learned that the city had appraised, 
and then agreed to sell, an abandoned house and 7,200-square-foot lot on East 
Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The city bought the property five years ago when Hillcrest Drive was widened 
from two lanes to four. The property was advertised briefly but was not listed 
with a real estate broker or put up for public auction, Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Newbury Park business owners Steven and Billy Cotts privately 
purchased the property for $97,000. Zukowski said city staff put the deal 
together without council input. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski questioned the sale because she felt the purchase price was low, 
given recent zone changes that have allowed greater development of neighboring 
properties. Last week, for example, the council approved a 45-townhome 
development on a parcel a few blocks from the city-owned land. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city had sold its parcel based on its development potential instead of 
its current zoning for single-family houses, she said, the city could have made 
more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Local realtors also said they were unhappy about the process the city used to 
appraise and sell the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a lot of people who would have been interested in that 
property, had anyone known it was up for sale," said Joy Reznick, a Thousand 
Oaks realtor. "I don't understand why some properties are put up for public bid 
and others are not. That seems inconsistent to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers said the council could have handled each case however it wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Planning Commissioner Linda Parks said she agreed with Zukowski 
that more oversight is necessary. In other cities, Parks said, the Planning 
Commission oversees the sale of surplus property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that right now what we've got is an inconsistent and confusing 
policy," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to proposing guidelines to formalize the sale of surplus land, she 
said the council should also consider using several appraisers instead of just 
one. And she suggested putting appraisal contracts out to competitive bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a type of approach that could be very easily manipulated, and that's 
of concern to me," she said last week. "We're dealing with public funds and 
public assets here. A single appraisal does not protect public assets." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sellers said that putting appraisal contracts out to bid could backfire 
because, in the appraisal business, "reputation and knowledge are more 
important than the lowest bidder." 
</P>
<P>
 And he said authorizing several appraisals would waste both time and money. 
Appraisals generally take two to three months to complete.

ELECTIONS / VENTURA COUNTY SUPERVISOR; LOH SAYS TOUGH STANCE ON ENVIRONMENT 
SETS HER APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to development issues, Ventura County supervisor candidate Trudi 
K. Loh wants to make it clear that she's the alternative candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 One of five people competing for the 2nd Supervisorial District seat being 
vacated by Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, Loh said it is her tough environmental 
stance that "sets me drastically apart from my opponents." 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Loh said she believes the county and its cities should strictly 
adhere to their development guidelines and "stay out of our open spaces and 
stay out of our greenbelts and stay off of our hillsides." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying that we shouldn't develop anything," said the Thousand Oaks 
resident. "I just believe if you zone something a certain way, it ought to stay 
zoned that way." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Loh said she would not have supported the 1992 approval by the 
Board of Supervisors of the giant Ahmanson Ranch housing project planned for 
eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 And she said if elected to the seat that covers Thousand Oaks, Oak Park and 
Port Hueneme, she will oppose any request by the developer to extend its 
agreement with the county. The developer is scheduled to turn over three 
mountain properties owned by entertainer Bob Hope to park agencies by 1995 
before proceeding with the project. So far, only one of Hope's properties has 
become public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't turn over those properties by 1995, the deal is gone; it 
evaporates," Loh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate said if opponents of the Ahmanson project are successful in 
their legal battle to overturn the board's decision, and if the development 
were to come back for reconsideration, she would oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh also opposes the development of a new county landfill, preferring instead 
to explore other alternatives for disposing of trash. Those options include 
advanced recycling and composting programs or, perhaps, shipping waste by rail 
to another county or state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen nothing to convince me that we need another landfill," Loh said. 
"And putting one in the mouth of Weldon Canyon is absurd to me." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of San Diego investors is collecting signatures to qualify a November 
ballot initiative that would let voters decide whether a landfill should be 
developed at Weldon Canyon near Ojai. If successful in acquiring a permit for 
the dump, the investors would then sell off their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, that's the environmental equivalent of a drive-by shooting," Loh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her tough environmental stance, Loh, 37, said she believes her views 
are very much in line with those of her Conejo Valley neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself as someone who reflects the views of the majority of the 
people who live here," said Loh, an attorney who gave up her practice five 
years ago to rear her children. "We all come here and stay living here because 
we like the natural beauty of the environment we live in." 
</P>
<P>
 But Loh, who has been endorsed by environmental groups such as the Sierra Club 
and Save Open Space, also makes it clear that she is not opposed to all 
development. After all, she points out, Thousand Oaks businessman and developer 
Larry Janss is her campaign finance chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Janss -- whose family so far has donated more than $2,000 to Loh's campaign -- 
said that developers understand that Loh represents managed growth, rather than 
no-growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she is thoughtful and reasonable in her environmental concerns," 
Janss said. "I think individuals who happen to make their grocery money through 
development see that we just can't go willy-nilly and spread the sprawl 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 But some Thousand Oaks business leaders said that Loh's alliance with groups 
such as Save Open Space, which supported VanderKolk in 1990 but then dropped 
that support when the supervisor voted for the Ahmanson deal, would hurt her 
with the local business community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Save Open Space is against development, period," said Steven Rubenstein, 
executive director of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. "Personally, I 
don't think it's going to be to her advantage. People are looking for a 
balance. They don't want anybody too radical either way." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Councilman Frank Schillo, one of Loh's opponents, said he 
believed Loh's views on zoning are unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a real problem with blanket statements that affect an individual's 
property," he said. "There's always some sort of exception to an individual's 
property rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Loh said protecting land zoned as open space is not radical, but responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people in this community who are developers who know me and they 
are not going to panic when I get elected, because they know I'm a rational 
person with an open mind," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Loh is firm when it comes to zoning. "If you buy a piece of property 
that's zoned for no development, and you don't get it up-zoned, well, that's 
the risk you take. That's your problem. You should have been aware of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting the environment isn't Loh's only concern. In fact, she says, it 
wasn't even the reason she entered the supervisor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 What propelled her into action, Loh said, was a Feb. 3 brawl at North Ranch 
Park near her home that led to the shooting of two Westlake High School 
students. The same week, a 14-year-old student was stabbed to death at a Simi 
Valley junior high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there has been a series of events that have occurred over the last 
six months that I perceive as a real change in violent crime in this area since 
I moved here" in 1981, Loh said. "I think everyone perceives that it's a 
problem and they want it to be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Loh said that protecting the county's law enforcement budget will 
be one of her top priorities. She said she would also work to implement 
assistance programs in schools for at-risk students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think morally it's not only the right thing to do, but financially it's the 
thing to do," said Loh, who is not clear on where the money would come from to 
pay for such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas of public safety, Loh -- who has been endorsed by the county 
firefighters union -- said she backs a plan for the Fire Department to 
establish its own paramedic program. The county is now served by three private 
ambulance companies, including Pruner Ambulance, which serves the Conejo 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh said she has called 911 on four occasions for medical emergencies 
involving her children and that in every case it "was the Fire Department who 
was there first." She also pointed out that a recent study showed that 
ambulance response times in Oak Park are inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not knocking Pruner as a private ambulance service," she said. "What I'm 
saying is that the decision on whether we have firefighter paramedics ought to 
be made on what's good for the public and not whether that's a good business 
decision for a private company." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have maintained that the county cannot afford to establish a 
firefighter paramedic program. But Loh said that such a program could be phased 
in gradually and eventually pay for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I called 911 for my own family, I got the bill from Pruner, not the 
county," Loh said. "If we have our own paramedics, we could be billing for some 
of those services and the money would go right back to the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, whose husband Irving is a cardiologist in private practice, takes a more 
cautious approach to the issue of whether the county should add a $30-million 
outpatient wing to the Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has sparked opposition by the medical center's neighbor, 
Community Memorial Hospital, which views the county hospital as an emerging 
competitor for private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh questions how the county can move ahead with the hospital expansion 
without knowing how President Clinton's health reform package will affect the 
health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "To sink a lot of money into building facilities that may not operate 
optimally under that new system would not be smart," Loh said. "What we need to 
do is make sure we use the existing facilities, physicians and health care 
delivery people to the maximum, whether that's public or private." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she believes establishing a commercial airport at Point Mugu could 
help county businesses, Loh said she would want to limit the number of flights 
and ensure that noise is not a problem for surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think on balance it's a good thing to do," Loh said, adding that she would 
like more time to study the proposal before taking an official stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh's critics say she has an uphill battle because she has no name recognition 
or government experience. They also note that she is the only registered 
Democrat in the nonpartisan race within a predominantly Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh's rivals are Schillo, former county Supervisor Madge Schaefer, taxpayer 
advocate H. Jere Robings and Malibu rancher Carter Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern raised about Loh's candidacy is her focus on issues concerning 
Thousand Oaks, rather than the county as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trudi is very bright, but I think some of the concerns she has" would be 
better resolved at the local level, said David Williams, president of the 
Ventura County Deputy Sheriff's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to understand when you're a supervisor, you're in charge of 
countywide issues," said Williams, whose union has endorsed Schaefer. "And what 
may be good for Thousand Oaks, may not be good for Port Hueneme." 
</P>
<P>
 But Loh said her concerns do extend beyond the boundaries of Thousand Oaks, 
pointing out that she opposed Schillo's plan for the city to break off from the 
county system and form it's own fire department. 
</P>
<P>
 As for her lack of government experience, Loh said she sees that as an asset. 
She said if elected she would bring with her skills she acquired from her 13 
years experience as a business lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a lawyer for a lot of large corporations," she said. "Pretty much what 
they came to me to do was solve their problems quickly. And that's what I am is 
a problem solver." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the firefighters' endorsement, Loh has also been endorsed by 
Thousand Oaks City Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski, the Tri-Counties Central Labor 
Council and the local chapter of the National Women's Political Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 "She exudes honesty, freshness and energy at a time when we need that," Janss 
said of Loh. "The other candidates in the race have been around before. They 
know how the system works. They know the good old boys and where they need to 
be scratched. We don't need anymore of that." Profile of Trudi K. Loh

Ventura County Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, whose 2nd District seat includes 
Thousand Oaks, Oak Park and Port Hueneme.

JUDGE WILL WAIT TO RELEASE PAPERS IN THORNTON TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has decided against releasing a grand jury transcript and other court 
documents in a high-profile Thousand Oaks murder case until after he hears a 
motion next month to move the trial to another county, his secretary said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath's announcement comes just 10 days 
after he said that he intends to unseal the documents in the murder case 
against Mark Scott Thornton and enforce the public's right to inspect them. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents would allow the public to get a more complete picture of the 
circumstances surrounding the death of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan, who 
police say was kidnaped and fatally shot by Thornton last September. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan, 34, was the mother of a young son, and her death drew widespread 
public attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times, joined by the Ventura County Newspapers, asked the judge on April 
30 to release the public records. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath did not return a reporter's phone call seeking comment on his decision 
to delay release of the documents until after the June 3 change-of-venue 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury on Dec. 6 indicted Thornton, charging him with murder under a 
special circumstance -- kidnaping -- that could send him to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, prosecutors were granted court permission to have the grand jury 
proceedings sealed. All other documents, including routine motions filed by 
lawyers in the case, were also kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing to discuss the security measures to be used when the defendant is in 
the courtroom also was closed to the public, as were statements prosecutors 
filed in January explaining why the case is especially aggravated. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Glen A. Smith, representing The Times, expressed disappointment in 
McGrath's decision to delay release of the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The records should not have been sealed from the outset," said Smith, noting 
that prosecutors never showed why they needed to keep the public away from the 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris, who requested the seal on the documents, 
said he is trying to protect the defendant's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith said there is no proof that unsealing the records would jeopardize 
Thornton's ability to have an impartial jury hear his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judiciary is an arm of the government. The defense is being provided at 
taxpayers' expense, and the district attorney is a public servant," Smith said. 
"And yet, the public is being kept at arm's length." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton's attorneys could not be reached for comment.

TALK ISN'T CHEAP; SCHOOLS SEEK CITY FUNDS FOR ANTI-DRUG MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside Ann Siple's classroom at Camarillo Heights School, 30 fresh-faced 
sixth-graders told stories the other day -- tales of drugs, alcohol and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, most 11 and 12 years old, recounted their brushes with people 
who either were selling or using narcotics, or pushing gangs as a way to be 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Kim Larson, the school's Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education (DARE) officer, was hoping to generate such dialogue to keep her 
young students off drugs and out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 But unless officials can find about $135,000, Larson's message will not reach 
children in the other eight schools of the Pleasant Valley School District next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, citing budgets too tight to initiate the program, are 
asking the city of Camarillo to pick up the tab -- a request the council will 
examine during a special study session on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are at the point where they are starting to confront some very 
serious problems," Larson said. "It would be a shame if we couldn't get this 
message across based on expense." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County pays most of the costs of DARE at Camarillo Heights because the 
school is in county territory. The district wants the city to pay for expanding 
the nationally known anti-drug program to its other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just comes down to having more priorities than funds," said Howard 
Hamilton, associate superintendent for the district. "I think we were as 
shocked by the costs as was the council. Still, we believe this is an important 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Charlotte Craven said that while she appreciates the need for 
such a program, she cannot easily justify the city bearing the burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned that we may not have the kind of money it will take to fund a 
program like this given other responsibilities," Craven said. "I'm also 
concerned about the overall effectiveness and would like to see how this 
program has impacted juvenile arrest rates in other cities where DARE has been 
established." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ken Gose said that city coffers will be tight because of expected cost 
increases for police and other city services next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically, I have a bit of a problem with our paying for what is 
essentially an educational function," Gose said. "I still need to study this, 
but I would have a hard time seeing us pay more than 50% of what they are 
asking." 
</P>
<P>
 But Senior Deputy Rick Barber, who supervises DARE programs in western Ventura 
County, said several cities in the county -- including Thousand Oaks, Ventura, 
Ojai, Fillmore and Moorpark -- pay all or part of the program's expenses for 
their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question it's expensive, but we wanted to give the city a sense of 
the whole ball of wax," Barber said. "We believe that ultimately, the costs 
will be significantly less -- probably under $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Barber, a veteran street cop, said one of the key aspects of the program is 
helping young people learn decision-making skills and taking responsibility for 
the consequences of their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people need to remember is that the dollars they are putting into a 
program like this now will save them a great deal more later in terms of both 
dollars and lives," Barber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late one morning this week, Larson quizzed the sixth-graders in Siple's 
classroom. They responded as if they were game show contestants, trying to be 
first to blurt out the right answer and collect valued DARE stickers for their 
notebooks, or perhaps even win a prized backpack emblazoned with the red 
program logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson said the exercise is designed to be a fun method of getting students to 
remember what they should do if someone offers them drugs or alcohol or asks 
them to join a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Lewis, 11, said she's learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of fun when Deputy Larson comes to our class, but I think we 
learn a lot too," Leslie said. "I think she's teaching us some important 
things. When you listen to her stories about the kids she's seen on drugs or in 
gangs, it really makes you think." 
</P>
<P>
 H FYI: The Camarillo City Council will conduct a study session on the DARE 
funding request at 5 p.m. Wednesday at City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive.

2 TELL OF 'TORTURE SESSION' AT ABUSE TRIAL; TESTIMONY: WESTLAKE NEIGHBORS SAY 
SHOUTING DREW THEIR ATTENTION TO GARAGE, WHERE THEY SAW CHARLOTTE RUSSO BEATING 
HER DAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo was seen last year punching her teen-age daughter into 
submission inside the family's Westlake garage, slugging her in the head, face 
and body with a closed fist, two neighbors testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the beating, the neighbors testified, Russo's daughter offered no 
resistance, simply moaning and crying as her mother repeatedly struck her. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression was it looked like a torture session, rather than a discipline 
session," Peter Kozak told a Superior Court jury hearing the 52-year-old 
mother's child-abuse trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozak and his wife, Jackie, were the first two witnesses to take the stand 
Monday as the dramatic trial entered its third week. It was their call to 
sheriff's deputies after the alleged incident last May that triggered the 
child-abuse prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kozaks, who testified that they feared for the teen-ager's life, said 
their attention was first drawn to the garage by the screams of Richard Russo, 
the girl's father. 
</P>
<P>
 From the sidewalk, they testified, they could hear him yelling at his daughter 
at the top of his voice. Charlotte Russo, they said, was trying to quiet him 
even as she carried out the assault on her daughter, they testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "What sounds was the girl making?" Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona asked Jackie 
Kozak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very guttural wail," she answered. "A very ugly sound. Definitely 
somebody in pain and struggling. There was some sobbing, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, testified both Kozaks, the girl -- 15 at the time -- never 
defended herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the thing that seemed strange," Peter Kozak said. "Typically, if 
you're getting hit, you're going to try to block the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony followed the girl's own testimony during the last two weeks that 
her mother imprisoned her in the bathroom of the family's racquetball court, 
often striking and biting her, and forcing her to eat the same meal -- either 
oatmeal or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches -- four times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo, 52, faces one charge of felony child abuse for allegedly 
biting the girl and one count of misdemeanor for reportedly locking her in the 
racquetball court for months on end during 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's testimony focused entirely on the events that led to the May 24 
arrest of Russo and her husband last year. Richard Russo, a stockbroker, 
already has pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of child abuse and was 
sentenced to 30 days in jail and three years probation. He still denies abusing 
the girl, but a family lawyer said he entered his misdemeanor plea to keep his 
broker's license. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kozaks testified that they were strolling past the Russos' nine-bedroom 
home when they heard a man repeatedly scream inside the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The garage door was closed, but Peter Kozak said he and his wife could still 
see inside the structure from the sidewalk through its windows. Richard Russo 
appeared to be agitated and "bordering on out of control," Kozak testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo was pulling her daughter by her neck or shoulders and striking 
her, he testified. At the same time, he testified, the mother kept trying to 
quiet down her husband in an apparent effort to keep neighbors from knowing 
about what was taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl did not cry, but sounded like "an injured animal," Kozak said. He 
said even from his distance of several hundred yards he could tell she was 
gasping for air. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what was he (Richard Russo) saying?" Corona asked. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'I'm not going to stand for this one more minute!' He said it over and 
over," testified Kozak. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozak said he called deputies because he felt the girl was in a 
"life-threatening situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who was adopted by the family at the age of 1, was taken from the 
Russo home last year and has been living in foster care ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, Kozak said he could not explain why the girl did not 
suffer serious injuries from the alleged beating. 
</P>
<P>
 He maintained the blows she allegedly suffered were severe, however. Pictures 
taken by deputies show the girl had scratches on her arms, face and chest and a 
bite mark on her right arm.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 2 DOZEN SIGN UP ON LAST DAY TO REGISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About two dozen people went to the county elections office Monday to take 
advantage of the last day to register to vote in the California Primary next 
month, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was business as usual," said Bruce Bradley, the assistant registrar of 
voters for Ventura County."We had more people coming to get their absentee 
ballots than people coming in to register." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said his office received more than 1,000 pieces of mail Monday. "But 
most of those seem to be changes of address or party, rather than affidavits 
(of registration)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 366,000 people are registered to vote in Ventura County in the June 
7 election, a precursor to the fall ballot that will decide the next governor 
and a host of local and other statewide offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, Republicans and Democrats are fairly evenly split. Bradley said 
there are 145,468 Republicans and 140,778 Democrats registered to vote in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers will change slightly by next week, after elections officials 
process the registration applications still arriving in the mail, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance of the registered voters in the county are split between the Green 
Party, the American-Independent Party, the Libertarian Party, the Peace and 
Freedom Party, miscellaneous parties and those undeclared, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 10 years in Ventura County, less than 45% of those eligible to 
cast ballots in the primary election have turned out to vote. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; NEW RED CROSS OFFICE TO SERVE EAST 
COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a need highlighted by last year's wildfires and the Jan. 17 
earthquake, the American Red Cross opened a second county office Monday in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt for some time that the size of the population warranted a local 
presence out here," said Brian Bolton, executive director of the Ventura County 
Red Cross Unit."Then when the firestorm and the earthquake hit, it seemed clear 
that it was time to open a center in the eastern part of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the office space was unexpectedly easy: the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency and the state Office of Emergency Services, which share a 
disaster relief office at 59 Tierra Rejada Road, donated the 1,000-square-foot 
space to the relief agency. The Red Cross will be able to stay free of charge 
as long as FEMA and OES remain, which should be at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful that by then we will have really demonstrated our services and 
be able to generate some community funding," Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolton said about 17,000 people use the agency in the county, including 
volunteers who take life-saving classes and those who receive disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
 A smaller space, which Bolton said would be used for meetings and training 
programs, is being provided to the agency by the city of Simi Valley at a 
reduced rental rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was booming after only a few hours at the new office, with people 
signing up for first-aid workshops and volunteering to staff the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're anticipating that we'll get a lot more business in the community now 
that we're here," District Manager Diana Grace said. "We're always looking for 
more volunteers, and this will just be so much more convenient for everybody in 
this part of the county." MARY F. POLS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 7 COUNTY SCHOOLS WIN STATE AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven Ventura County schools are among 180 middle schools and high schools 
across the state that have been named California Distinguished Schools this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo Middle School in the Ventura Unified School District; Medea Creek 
Middle School and Oak Park High School in Oak Park Unified; Charles Blackstock 
and E.O. Green schools in the Hueneme Elementary district; Monte Vista 
Intermediate in the Pleasant Valley Elementary district, and Thousand Oaks High 
School in Conejo Valley received the state honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks High School Principal Keith Wilson attributed his school's 
success to the combination of parents, students and faculty. "They deserve the 
recognition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that five of the schools were named distinguished 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Medea Creek and Blackstock won the honor two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But since that time, the state has changed its criteria for selecting 
distinguished schools. 
</P>
<P>
 When the state Department of Education launched the distinguished-school 
program in 1985, it awarded the honor mainly on the basis of students' scores 
on statewide assessment tests. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, however, California students did not take any statewide assessment 
tests for education officials to use as criteria for the 1993 awards. 
</P>
<P>
 So in 1993, the Education Department began to bestow the distinguished-school 
honor based mainly on how well schools implement the state's curriculum 
guidelines. This year, state education officials also put some weight on 
schools' performance last spring on the new California Learning Assessment 
System exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The state names distinguished elementary schools in alternate years to middle 
and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 13 elementary schools in Ventura County received the award: 
Weathersfield in the Conejo Valley district; Bard and Sunkist in Hueneme; Mar 
Vista in Ocean View; El Rancho and Los Primeros structured schools and Las 
Colinas in Pleasant Valley, and six schools in Ventura Unified: Juanamaria, 
Junipero Serra, Lincoln, Loma Vista, Portola and Saticoy. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; NEW CONTRACT LOWERS CABLE SERVICE RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley will take control of local cable television rates under a contract 
approved Monday by the City Council that also lowers the cost of basic service 
by 12 cents and offers greater cuts for other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting to regulate rates for the first time in 10 years, the council voted 
unanimously in favor of the contract with Comcast Cablevision, a move that cuts 
basic cable television rates to $23.59 a month for the city's 26,472 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing before the vote, Comcast Vice President Jeffrey Carlson 
said, "Before this is done, the average consumer -- across the board here -- 
may see an overall reduction of 23% in rates." 
</P>
<P>
 However, resident Ralph Abruscato protested that the rates are much higher 
than those in some other cities. "I see other communities around the country 
getting the same quality of service for a cheaper rate," Abruscato said, citing 
rates of $18 per month down to $11 per month in some cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sandi Webb said she was approving the contract under protest. 
"People don't have a right to TV," she said. "It is a commodity just like 
anything else, and I just have real problems with us regulating the price and 
how many channels . . . I think the government should just keep its nose out." 
</P>
<P>
 The rate decrease, coupled with larger reductions dictated last year by the 
Federal Communications Commission, has reduced the monthly cost of basic cable 
service in Simi Valley by 16% since Sept. 1 -- from $27.99 per month to $23.59, 
said Joe Hreha, the city's deputy director of environmental services. 
</P>
<P>
 Equipment rental rates also have dropped 30% under the new contract, Hreha 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract also reduces hookup costs by about 29%. Homes that are not 
wired for cable will cost $33.76 to hook up, down from $47.31; and homes 
already wired will cost $25.82 to hook up, a decrease from the $36.18 fee 
charged previously. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC deregulated the cable television industry in 1984, allowing cable 
providers to set their own rates. Congress reversed that decision in October, 
1992, by enacting the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, 
allowing franchising authorities such as cities to regulate cable rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will re-examine cable television rates every December to 
adjust them for inflation and other factors, Hreha said. MACK REED

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; NEW ZONTA CLUB SERVES WOMEN OF WEST COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a long time, members of the Zonta Club have jokingly referred to it as 
"the world's best-kept secret." 
</P>
<P>
 But the president of a newly chartered Ventura County chapter of the 
75-year-old service club says it is time for more people to find out about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have heard about the Soroptimists and Rotary Club, but they go, 'Zonta 
who?' " said Loma Siegel. "When I heard about what they do, I knew we needed a 
club here." 
</P>
<P>
 Zonta is a service club whose goal is to promote the status of women as well 
as serve the communities around them, Siegel said. Similar in organization to 
traditional men's service clubs, the first Zonta Club was founded in 1919 in 
Buffalo, N.Y., as a way for women to meet, make connections and serve their 
communities, said Martha Desch, a club spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, women could watch, but were not allowed to participate in the 
men's clubs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zonta is now an international organization with 1,100 clubs in 61 countries, 
Desch said. The Zonta Club of Conejo Valley is 22 years old, she said. It 
traditionally sponsors the Special Kids Day at Conejo Valley Days, when 
children with disabilities have the carnival all to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel and others decided last year to open a Zonta Club that would be more 
convenient for west county residents and workers, she said. The Zonta Club of 
Ventura County, headquartered in Ventura, was chartered March 25, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Desch: "It's nice for us to have another club right in our back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's next meeting is at 7 p.m. Wednesday at the Hilton Inn in Oxnard, 
she said. For information, call Desch at 498-2127. 
</P>
<P>
 Members are planning fund-raisers, including a picnic in July and a country 
fair in September, Siegel said. Money from the events will be used to help 
local philanthropic organizations that deal with women and women's issues, 
including battered-women's shelters and rape crisis counseling, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ventura County Zonta clubs are hoping to co-sponsor the annual Salute to 
Women awards, Siegel said. The awards normally are presented by the county's 
Commission on Women, but budget cuts have forced cutbacks and the awards 
ceremony needs private money, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zonta Club of Conejo Valley has 22 members; the newest club in the west 
county has about 25. But both clubs are always looking for new members, Siegel 
and Desch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership is not limited to professional women and includes homemakers and 
college students, Siegel said. "We try to strike a balance." KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER DELEGATING AUTHORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A task force charged with streamlining the agenda and meetings of the Oxnard 
City Council is recommending that the city delegate authority for so-called 
routine matters to the city manager and other staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to decide today whether to grant City Manager Thomas 
Frutchey sweeping powers to negotiate land deals, administer personnel changes 
and approve salary and benefits packages for his employees without the specific 
approval of the City Council, which is now required. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the task force, formed in December and made up of various 
department heads, recommend that the council approve the changes to shorten the 
meetings and decrease staff time dedicated to preparing lengthy agenda reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Department heads in the city also would be granted authority now reserved for 
the City Council, under the proposal to be discussed today. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, managers would be allowed to approve fee waivers, new street 
names, lease renewals, service agreements, and award bids under a certain 
amount, should the council approve the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also would allow city staff to avoid writing most consent-agenda 
reports that now must be reviewed by at least three offices before being 
forwarded to council members for routine approval. Instead, the staff will 
provide brief summaries of scheduled items. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Thomas E. Holden, who said Monday he had not yet decided how he 
will vote, said he could see merits to paring the size of the agenda and 
whittling down the often-lengthy council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intention of the recommendations are worth exploring," Holden said, 
"because we definitely have a problem in the amount of staff time and the 
resources we use to make certain decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Holden said some of the proposals -- such as one allowing the city manager 
to negotiate salaries and land buys -- need more serious review by the City 
Council. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 2 SUSPECTED AVOCADO THIEVES CHASED, JAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A suspected avocado thief who was chased 100 feet down the side of a canyon by 
three deputies and a police dog had to be saved by a Ventura County sheriff's 
rescue team after he, the dog and deputies got stuck and couldn't climb out. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit began about 10:10 a.m. when the foreman at Brokaw Nursery at 2977 
Sexton Canyon Road noticed that a pair of men driving a truck had entered the 
orchard through an unlocked gate, said Deputy Lance Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreman locked the gate and called deputies, who used a trained police dog 
to find the suspected thieves in the orchard, Brooks said. With 800 to 1,000 
pounds of avocados in his truck, Benito Reyes, 22, surrendered, but the other 
man took off running, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks said Thomas Jennings, 25, led him, two other deputies and the dog about 
100 feet down the side of Sexton Canyon north of Ventura. There, Jennings 
surrendered after the dog bit him a few times and he injured his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very steep incline," said Brooks, who also got tangled with a thatch 
of poison oak. "You could go down, but you couldn't get out." 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies radioed for help and were pulled up by ropes, Brooks said. 
Jennings was placed in a litter and carried out by ropes, with the help of a 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings was taken to the Ventura County Medical Center, where he was treated 
and released into the custody of sheriff's deputies, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were arrested on suspicion of grand theft and were being held at 
Ventura County Jail. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; WOMAN, 31, FATALLY SHOT IN HER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard woman who was shot to death at her home on Mother's Day was 
identified Monday as Victoria Ramey, 31, who neighbors said was an unemployed 
mother of a 5-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramey died about 9:30 p.m. in her home in the 800 block of La Canada Avenue in 
Oxnard. Police later arrested Gary Michael Rose, 25, who called police about 
the shooting and surrendered to them at the Ramey home. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose was being held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police listed Rose as an Oxnard resident, friends of the victim said 
Rose had recently moved from Indiana and had been staying with Ramey for the 
last two weeks while he looked for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really liked to help people," said James Darpino, 20, of Oxnard, a Ramey 
friend who once rented a room from her in the home. "He was staying with Vickie 
until he could get a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors said they would never suspect that Rose would hurt 
Ramey. Although neighbors said Ramey was engaged to be married to another man 
at the time of her death, they said she and Rose had been engaged a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed to be a real calm and collected guy," said Nadine Watson, 19, a 
friend and neighbor of Ramey. "He was the type of person who would walk away 
when he was steamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Ramey has a 5-year-old boy who lives with her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Mother's Day killing, Ventura police were searching Monday for Raul 
Cervantes Viveros, 46, who is suspected of shooting Juan M. Vargas in a dispute 
over loud music. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, a 31-year-old landscaper and father of three, was shot in the mobile 
home park where the family lived, as his wife watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Viveros left in his vehicle, which was located later Sunday in the Wagon Wheel 
area north of Oxnard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the shooting occurred after Viveros had asked Vargas to 
turn down music playing from his home. When Vargas refused, Viveros allegedly 
came back and shot him in front of the victim's mobile home, just off Victoria 
Avenue, near the Ventura Freeway. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SAN NICOLAS ISLAND; ARMY DELAYS STUDY ON MISSILE 
TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A study that details how planned missile testing off the Ventura County 
coastline would affect the environment has been delayed until fall, U.S. Army 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is the final step necessary before the Army decides which of four 
sites around the world will be selected to test missiles such as the Patriot -- 
first made famous during the Persian Gulf War when it knocked down incoming 
Iraqi Scud missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Army spokesman Ed Vaughn said the delay was caused by the service's need for 
additional research at two of the four proposed sites being considered for the 
testing program. 
</P>
<P>
 Local environmental activists have decried bringing the missile testing 
program to Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, fearing the effect of spent 
booster rockets, air pollution and other potential threats to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn said the Army plans to conduct about 100 tests starting later this year 
and running through the year 2000. The testing process involves launching an 
offensive missile and then sending a defensive missile to destroy it. A variety 
of defensive intercept missiles will be evaluated during the program. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the California site, the Army is considering sites in New 
Mexico, Florida and at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the Central Pacific 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 If the western site is chosen, defensive missile tests would be conducted 
primarily off of Navy-owned San Nicolas Island, but also from Vandenberg Air 
Force Base in Santa Barbara County and San Clemente Island off the Orange 
County coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn said last week the final environmental impact report is now scheduled 
to be released publicly next fall. A final decision on the site will be 
announced 30 days later. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CONTRACT DRAWN UP FOR VISITORS BUREAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura city officials are drawing up a contract that would make the city's 
Visitors & Convention Bureau more accountable for its finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the city supplies the bureau's $360,000 annual budget, but the 
bureau reports directly to its own board of directors, made up of Chamber of 
Commerce board members. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new contract, the bureau's director would give monthly progress 
reports and comprehensive quarterly reports to the city's new Tourism and 
Special Events Committee. The committee would also approve the bureau's 
operational budget, preapprove anyone the bureau contracted with for services, 
and preview each year's marketing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city put this together because tourism is such a large part of the local 
economy and because the city is directing more effort toward developing the 
tourism industry," said Debbie Solomon, a city staff member working with the 
tourism committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau's longtime director, Russ Smith, died suddenly last month, and the 
bureau's contract with the city is up for renewal next month, making this an 
opportune time for the city to rethink its relationship to the bureau, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff and committee members described the proposed contract last week to 
the three City Council members who sit on the city's Finance Committee. The 
council members approved the changes to the contract, leaving the committee to 
now draw up a new contract in conjunction with the bureau, and then present it 
to the full council for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Alviani, president of the Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber supports 
the concept of rewriting the bureau's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would encourage that kind of oversight," he said. "I think it's great."

ABUSE OF PUBLIC TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In my view, Dist. Atty. Mike Bradbury is a man of vision, courage and ability, 
however, Mr. Bradbury's recent blanket disqualification of Judge (Lawrence) 
Storch from hearing criminal cases is, in my opinion, an abuse of the public 
trust held by this powerful governmental official. 
</P>
<P>
 I am alarmed by the district attorney's decision to disqualify an extremely 
able judge who has a well-earned reputation for being tough, but fair, when 
handling criminal cases. I am even more alarmed when the district attorney's 
office makes comments to the media dismissing as "soft on crime" anyone who 
dares to criticize their position. Making personal attacks on their critics, as 
they did against retired Judge Willard when he took Mr. Bradbury to task, is 
itself an abuse of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, judges must perform their duties in a highly charged atmosphere, 
one brought on by a case's particularly high profile. 
</P>
<P>
 For the district attorney to deliberately create additional pressure on the 
judges of Ventura County by threatening to disqualify them when they do not 
rubber stamp the district attorney's position is simply wrong and unworthy of 
an otherwise excellent district attorney's office. The court should not be 
bullied by the public, by the defense or by the district attorney himself if 
real justice is to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Storch deserves an apology, as do those who have spoken in his defense 
and themselves been publicly criticized by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 We wonder why the district attorney did not advocate the removal of Judge 
Storch from his criminal assignment after the judge refused to honor the 
district attorney's commitment for probation for Mr. Charles Bothwell, a 
convicted murderer. In using his own judgment, Judge Storch sent him to state 
prison.

 Dist. Atty.Michael D. Bradbury has now run up against the latter. In spite of 
the fact that, as one deputy district attorney recently remarked, "We need our 
jobs. Some of us have 15 years invested," along with the fact that Mr. 
Bradbury's reputation for "getting even" is well-known among those who work for 
him, some of his most senior deputies have had the courage to say "no" to one 
of his edicts. Correctly so. 
</P>
<P>
 Some short time ago, Mr. Bradbury's authority was "crossed" by one of the most 
experienced and professional judges on the Ventura County Superior Court. The 
result of that failure to do exactly as Mr. Bradbury desired was a written memo 
distributed to all attorneys in the district attorney's office ordering them to 
disqualify that judge in all criminal cases. A number of the most experienced 
trial deputies in the office have refused to follow that order. More unusual is 
that in at least one instance, a senior attorney in the district attorney's 
office has also broken the "code of silence" which has permeated the internal 
politics of the office since Mike Bradbury became district attorney. Mr. 
(Peter) Kossoris is to be commended, as are those other deputies who have 
commented on the issue without being named, since they knew well that Mr. 
Bradbury will make serious efforts to find out who they are.

THERAPY GUIDELINES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Your recent article about Dr. Jerome Evans losing his license after having sex 
with his patient prompts me to inform your readers that the state of California 
has published a booklet, "Professional Therapy Never Includes Sex." This 
pamphlet can be obtained by writing the Department of Consumer Affairs, 1020 N 
St., Sacramento 95814, or by calling the Board of Psychology at (916) 263-2695. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual contact between therapist and patient is now a crime in this and many 
other states. Quoting from the above booklet, the "law applies to two kinds of 
situations: the therapist has sexual contact with a client during therapy, or 
the therapist ends therapy to start having sexual contact with the client." 
This behavior is a crime because it is a well-researched fact that this breach 
of trust on the part of the therapist can severely damage the patient's mental 
health. It is always the therapist's responsibility to maintain appropriate 
boundaries in the psychotherapy, since the therapist is in a position of power 
and the patient is vulnerable.

 I applaud the Medical Quality Assurance Board for yanking the license of 
Ventura psychologist Jerome Evans. Justice has finally begun to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Jerome Evans recommended to the Ventura County family law court that 
my then 5-year-old son, Josh, attend two schools 400 miles apart each month so 
that his client, my ex-spouse, could see the child one week per month. It was 
ordered and my son became the first child in the United States, to our 
knowledge, to ever be ordered to do such. The child suffered greatly in his 
academic and social life as a result of Evans' recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 I filed a complaint against Jerome Evans with the Medical Quality Assurance 
Board. It has taken seven years, but Jerome Evans has finally received his just 
reward. Taking him out of the court arena will certainly make a few of our 
children safer and allow them happier, more peaceful childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to strongly encourage readers who are suffering at the hands of 
unethical professionals that the courts have "given" them to take action. There 
are proper channels that do work. If you believe there is an ethical conduct 
problem with a court-appointed attorney for your child, file a complaint with 
the State Bar of California at (800) 843-9053. Likewise, if there is an ethical 
conduct problem with a psychologist, contact the Medical Quality Assurance 
Board. You can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 When I told my now 12-year-old son that Evans lost his license to practice, 
Josh looked at me and yelled "YES!"

CLAS RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a concerned parent, I have noticed that the people who spread the malicious 
rumors and misinformation regarding our school district's sex education 
curriculum are also the same people who are now spreading the same type of 
distorted information concerning the CLAS examinations. Who are these people, 
anyway?

 I am calling on all you liberals out there to take a closer look at the CLAS 
test. It is time for us to band together with the conservatives who have good 
reason to be hopping mad. This whole deal sounds like a chapter out of Orwell's 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 It is more than just the content of the stories, it is the questions. They are 
subjective and personally intrusive, designed to psychoanalyze the students, 
pick their brains, as it were. Names are on the tests, along with the parents' 
occupation (which the elementary teachers are required to write in). In this 
manner, CLAS solicits permission from the students to use their answers 
somewhere else. For example, to give info to potential employers. They are not 
paying the students for this service. The students, who are minors, waive their 
rights without fully understanding them. The test scores are put on a statewide 
database without the permission of the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Why has the state Department of Education threatened teachers and 
administrators with pulling their credentials? Why are the rights of parents 
and taxpayers being threatened? This test costs millions. There are schools in 
need of textbooks, school supplies, computer equipment, more teachers and 
smaller classes, but there is no money for these necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an Assembly Bill 2637 and a Senate Bill 1788 that will extend 
parental rights as per Education Code 60650 beyond the Jan. 1, 1995, cutoff 
date. If these do not pass, that portion of the parental rights will be gone. 
The Senate Bill 1788, in fact, has already been killed in committee by state 
Sen. Gary Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge you to contact your legislators to let them know how you feel about 
this legislation. Also, let your school board know as soon as possible before 
it's too late.

PEOPLE: MOTOROLA EXECUTIVE TOPFER TO JOIN DELL AS VICE CHAIRMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Dell, after an amazing decade of taking his personal computer company 
from a dorm room to the top ranks of the industry, on Monday named a 
telecommunications executive to help him lead it. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton L. Topfer, president of Motorola Inc.'s land mobile products sector, 
will become vice chairman of Dell Computer Corp. on June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Topfer, 57, will report to Dell, who at 29 is the youngest chief executive of 
a Fortune 500 company. The two will form the new post of chief executive, to 
which the rest of the company's executives will report. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement caps 18 months of senior-level hiring by Dell, starting with 
Chief Financial Officer Tom Meredith in November, 1992. On several occasions, 
Dell has expressed the need to surround himself with people experienced in 
operating multibillion-dollar companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're running a $3-billion business. It's pretty easy to see with me that's 
the first time I've ever done that," Dell said in a telephone interview from 
his Austin, Tex., office. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Steve Eskenanzi at Alex. Brown & Sons in San Francisco said, "Dell's 
continuing to build a management team and infrastructure commensurate with 
becoming a $5-billion to $10-billion company." 
</P>
<P>
 "This just adds some seasoned management experience from a high-growth 
business," said Antoine Tristani, analyst at SouthCoast Capital in Austin. 
"Dell has made it clear it sees the industry's future growth is in mobile 
computing and communications." 
</P>
<P>
 Topfer will end 23 years with Motorola. In addition to leading mobile 
products, he was a corporate executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure that Dell would give me a lot of opportunities and challenges to 
keep me young," Topfer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell "will focus more and continue to drive the vision in computer development 
and marketing, where his skills are," Topfer said. "I'll probably initially 
focus more on the operations issues, as well as some of the international 
growth opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Dell started the company in a dorm room at the University of Texas and 
pioneered direct sales as a chief way to sell PCs and retain customers. The 
company now is the nation's sixth-largest personal computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
 It stumbled last year when it misjudged an advance in the sales of laptop 
computers and had trouble with costs due to rapid growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell shares slipped 6.25 cents to $25.81 on Monday on the Nasdaq.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND JAMES BATES: COMPANY TOWN; HUIZENGA PUNCHES THE PAUSE 
BUTTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Would you buy a used strategy from this man? Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. 
Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga is apparently set to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Viacom Inc. merger in ruins, people close to Blockbuster do not 
foresee another major alliance in the near term. Instead, they look for 
Huizenga to refocus on building his worldwide video rental empire, while 
continuing to diversify into sports and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 One well-placed source says all of the available suitors have already taken a 
look at the company and backed off, despite rumored deals involving Walt Disney 
Co. or one of the Baby Bells. While access to Blockbuster's cash flow and 
control of the video rental business are strong lures, the company's $8-billion 
to $9-billion price tag appears to be a turnoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's attracted people to them is their cash flow, which will grow very 
rapidly over the next four or five years," said one Wall Street source. 
"Another thing that draws people to them like a moth to the flame is the 
concept of control (of the video rental business). In retailing, that kind of 
control is like a siren call. But it's a very expensive merger." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of other partnerships started surfacing earlier this month, when it 
became clear that the Viacom deal was in serious trouble. The two companies 
technically have until Sept. 30 to make the marriage work. But with Viacom's 
stock still reeling from the impact of its $10-billion purchase of Paramount 
Communications Inc., hardly anyone expects the deal to go through. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Blockbuster is more likely to recoup some of its $1.85-billion 
Viacom investment -- which was critical in helping Viacom defeat QVC Inc. in 
the battle for Paramount -- through small ventures. There's talk of turning 
Viacom's Showtime pay TV network into the "Blockbuster Network" and 
distributing Viacom video games through the retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster declined to comment on its plans, with one company source saying 
that "only Wayne knows what will happen." But Chief Financial Officer Gregory 
Fairbanks denied that annual cash flow -- estimated at $650 million to $700 
million and growing -- will be significantly drained. 
</P>
<P>
 The $600 million in Viacom preferred stock that it bought is pretty much a 
wash since it pays a dividend of about $30 million a year, offsetting payments 
for debt borrowed to buy the stock, Fairbanks said. The $1.25 billion borrowed 
to buy 23 million shares of Viacom Class B common stock does drain some money 
off in interest, although Fairbanks said it's not enough to hurt the company's 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with the investment in Viacom, we have the financial resources and cash 
flow available that would be necessary to finance all of our growth plans as a 
stand-alone entity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That would include such things as building new video stores, financing growing 
film and television production activity and making acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Bibb, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., estimates it will cost 
Blockbuster about $88 million to service the debt taken on to buy the $1.25 
billion in Viacom shares, which should not be a problem since cash flow has 
been growing at a strong 30% a year. He agrees that the investment should not 
hinder expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The extra debt they need to carry for the Viacom securities is not going to 
slow them down at all," Bibb said. "They still will open all the stores they 
plan to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Blockbuster's stock may take some time to recover -- its shares sank 75 
cents to $25.125 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, compared to a peak 
last year of $34.25 a share -- Bibb says he likes the stock's growth potential. 
He predicts Blockbuster will return to the strategy of building a diversified 
family entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was already on a diversification drive when Viacom came along, 
having acquired Music Plus and controlling the newly merged Spelling 
Entertainment and Republic Pictures. With the Florida Marlins baseball team, 
the Florida Panthers hockey team and as the new outright owner of the Miami 
Dolphins, Huizenga is one of the nation's top sports moguls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say Blockbuster will remain a force to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want a vehicle to leverage their distribution strength. They are the 
largest buyer of Hollywood product on the planet," Bibb said. He speculated 
that one of the possibilities could involve buying exclusive video rights for 
Blockbuster stores. The company is also known to be pursuing deals to 
co-finance movies with leading producers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Hollywood executives say the company's long-term future is hard to 
project. While Huizenga has consistently denied that movies-on-demand pose a 
near-term threat to his business, some contend that he undercut his position by 
agreeing to the Viacom deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the Viacom merger showed was that he wanted to cover himself on content 
side more aggressively than he let on to everybody," one source said. "That 
kind of smoked him out on his rhetoric. Now does he go back to his knitting, or 
does he do another big deal?" 
</P>

 Dive guys: Two of the first patrons to test the waters at Dive, the new 
restaurant co-owned by director Steven Spielberg, were MCA Chairman Lew R. 
Wasserman and President Sidney J. Sheinberg. The two were spotted at the 
Century City eatery over the weekend. There was no word on what they thought of 
the food, but it will take a lot of meals to repay Spielberg for the combined 
profits MCA has realized from his "Jurassic Park" and "Schindler's List."

PROPERTY VALUES: HOME LOANS WITH LOW DOWN PAYMENTS ARE BACK IN VOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High-leverage, low down payment loans are growing in popularity -- again. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the losses being sustained by lenders who are foreclosing on homes 
where the borrower's equity has evaporated, lenders are now making new loans 
with only 3% and 5% down payments required. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more low down payment loans today than ever before," said John 
Lucas, vice president of ARCS Mortgage Inc. in Van Nuys, a Bank of New York 
company. The Federal National Mortgage Assn. (Fannie Mae), a federally 
sponsored agency that insures lenders on residential mortgages, is offering at 
least half a dozen low down payment programs, in cooperation with the 
California Housing Finance Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the loan programs has its own rules. Some loans require that the 
borrower be a first-time home buyer; some require that the borrower not have 
owned any real estate in the last three years. There are various loans based on 
certain income limits, while others instead are limited to certain geographic 
areas. There are also loans with sales price and loan limitations, while other 
loans have no such restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller the down payment, the greater the loan balance and the more income 
needed to qualify, of course. But debt and income ratios are somewhat more 
lenient these days, Lucas said. Lenders, in conjunction with Fannie Mae, are 
providing first-timer buyers with the chance to get certified by attending home 
buying classes. After certification, borrowers can spend up to 33% of their 
income on housing instead of the more usual 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is a time when many people have the opportunity to buy with a very low 
down payment," Lucas said. "The sad thing is that many renters could have 
enough for one of these programs, but they aren't trying because they think 
they won't qualify. My advice to them is to try." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing many more highly leveraged loans," said Ann Carlton Bose, 
president of both Estate Funding Inc. in Woodland Hills and the California 
Assn. of Mortgage Brokers' L.A. County chapter. "There are several different 
programs available with just 5% down," she explained. And these loans amounts 
can run up to $400,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a selection of 3%-down loans, said Bose. Fannie Mae, for 
example, has different programs available that allow the borrower to put 3% 
down and get a loan of up to $203,150. Another 2% of the down payment can come 
from family or friends. Even the lender can kick in the extra 2% by charging a 
higher interest rate over the course of the loan and essentially refunding 2% 
of the purchase price to the borrower for part of the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannie Mae's Community Homebuyers program also allows buyers to get into a 
home with no reserves set aside for the first several months of mortgage 
payments and other expenses -- as are required for most loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some loans have a maximum income of $53,250. Other Fannie Mae loans are 
restricted instead to certain low-income target areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A low down payment loan program is offered by several private lenders as well. 
One, a Countrywide Funding-sponsored loan, is available with as little as 3% 
down, and there is no income limit for borrowers within the city of Los 
Angeles, said Ralph Mozilo, executive vice president of Countrywide Funding 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical borrower is an individual who is paying a mortgage that is pretty 
similar to his or her rent, Mozilo said. Mozilo directs his underwriters to be 
flexible, he said. "I want our underwriters to not just be credit scorers. We 
are all going through a learning process. There are things other than numbers 
that we have to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past we would hardly ever list a 5% (down payment) loan because 
borrowers would call us to complain that the loan wasn't really available," 
recalled Earl Peattie, president of Mortgage News Co. in Santa Ana, publisher 
of the weekly Home Mortgage Guide. "Now, these loans are actually available." 
</P>
<P>
 The two drawbacks to a low down payment, Peattie said, are that the borrower 
needs to borrow more, and that there is a higher private mortgage insurance 
premium. PMI is required for most low down payment loans and can range from 1% 
to more than 2% of the principal balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers can employ all sorts of strategies when they don't have much money for 
a down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans can qualify for Veterans Administration-backed loans of up to about 
$184,000 with basically no down payment at all. A certificate of eligibility 
from the VA is required. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Housing Administration loans of up to $151,750 are available to just 
about anybody -- there's no income limit. There is, though, an up-front 
mortgage insurance premium of about 2.25% of the loan amount and additional 
monthly, or mutual mortgage insurance (MMI), which is different from PMI. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers and some lender/owners are offering special low down payment 
incentives too. At Forest View Estates in Sylmar, 22 new homes are being 
offered to buyers starting at $206,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers can get in the door with just 3%, or $6,180. Another 2% of the down 
payment is being made by the lender as a subsidy. The catch, though, is that 
the 30-year, fixed interest rate is about 9.5%.

ANGELS LOST, ON THE FIELD AND OFF, 11-3; BASEBALL: NEW BALLPARK IS IMPRESSIVE, 
BUT MAGRANE ISN'T AGAINST RANGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels walked around The Ballpark at Arlington on Monday as if they were 
8-year-old kids visiting Disneyland on spring break. 
</P>
<P>
 They stood with their mouths open, eyes bugged out, and kept nudging one 
another to make sure no one missed anything. The visiting clubhouse was so 
outrageously large that there actually was a sign that read: "Where to go if 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble was no one provided the Angels directions once they got onto the 
field, and they looked hopelessly lost in an 11-3 setback to the Texas Rangers 
in front of 35,407 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 It took three innings before Angel starter Joe Magrane got his bearings, and 
by that time, the Rangers rudely welcomed the Angels into their new home with a 
commanding 5-0 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Jose Canseco had a two-run home run and knocked in four runs for the Rangers, 
and Juan Gonzalez knocked in three with a double and triple.. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels never did look comfortable, much less confident, in their first 
game in this $189-million stadium. By the time the game ended, they figured 
Arlington Stadium wasn't so bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ballpark in Arlington," Angel infielder Spike Owen said, "what kind of 
name is that, anyway? I think the name should have been, 'The Corral.' You 
know, come play the boys in the corral. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, 'The Ballpark in Arlington,' come on." 
</P>
<P>
 Said designated hitter Chili Davis: "It looks like a lot of wasted space to 
me. I guess in Texas, they have to make everything big, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who have lost 20 of their first 33 games, offered no excuses for 
their play. Yet, it's a bit hard to get prepared when you spend the pregame 
meeting asking questions: "How do you get to the field? Where's the trainer's 
room? Hey, has anyone seen the bathroom in this place?" 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers was sitting behind the desk in his luxurious office 
when second baseman Harold Reynolds walked by, stopped, started, and turned 
around again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor Harold, he's been lost going through here three times," Rodgers said. 
"Good thing he didn't go through that door or he'd be stuck in my (bathroom)." 
</P>
<P>
 The new ballpark, which has stolen features from every place from Fenway Park 
to Tiger Stadium to Comiskey Stadium to Camden Yards to Yankee Stadium to 
Kauffman Stadium, certainly has attracted the curiosity of Angel officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel President Richard Brown, Vice President Kevin Uhlich and General Manager 
Bill Bavasi took tours of the stadium. There will be city officials from 
Anaheim arriving Wednesday, with tours scheduled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a great place," Bavasi said. "It's a bit maniacal, but you can't help 
but love it. It's certainly something we'd be interested in doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, already preparing for the possibility of the Rams' departure, are 
toying with ideas of refurbishing Anaheim Stadium. They would love to tear out 
20,000 seats, convert Anaheim Stadium back into a baseball stadium, and draw up 
a new lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the older guys got more excited with this place than the young guys," 
Rodgers said. "I don't think anyone in baseball like that other (stadium). 
</P>
<P>
 "They've tried to incorporate a bunch of different looks. That's what you'd 
think a stadium in California would look like with so many transplants in our 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, no one can blame Magrane for not caring for the new scenery. It 
doesn't matter if it's Arlington Stadium, The Ballpark at Arlington or a 
mausoleum, there's not a left-hander in the game that relishes facing this 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't match up too well against them," Rodgers said, "not with that 
right-handed power. That's why Will Clark will hit .900 this year. Everyone 
will pitch every right-hander they can against this club." 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, making his second start of the season since recovering from 
arthroscopic elbow surgery, didn't have enough control to give himself a fair 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw only 57 strikes out of 111 pitches, and walked five batters, yielding 
six hits and five earned runs in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little stiff out there," Magrane said, "but hopefully next time it 
will be better. This is still the latter half of spring training for me because 
I wasn't able to strengthen my arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still very confident of going out there and giving us a damn good chance 
to win, but my control has to be better." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Manager Kevin Kennedy was glad Canseco is better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jose is back," Kennedy said. "He worked his tail off last winter to get his 
form back to the Jose Canseco of two years ago. He's going to be one of the 
best players in the league this year if he's not already."

MORNING BRIEFING: KNICKS STAY COOL, BUT BULLS FRY IN NEW YORK'S PRESSURE COOKER

 Before the Eastern Conference semifinal between the Knicks and Bulls, 
columnist Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times said the pressure to win would 
be on New York, not Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the baggage and stress and civic demands have been dropped in the lap of 
the Knicks," Mariotti wrote. "They are the ones who have to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their coach, the obsessed Pat Riley, has worn it on his face all season. In 
turn, so have the players, who must endure the textbook mental torture of Riley 
and sometimes get very sick of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure? The Bulls squandered a 15-point lead in losing to the Knicks on 
Sunday.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; UP CLOSE, RICHTER SAVES 4-3 VICTORY FOR RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Undeterred by Kevin Hatcher's fluke, 140-foot goal earlier in the first 
period, New York Ranger goalie Mike Richter stopped Hatcher's screened shot 
from much closer in with 15 seconds to play Monday to preserve a 4-3 victory 
over the Washington Capitals and send the Rangers to the NHL Eastern Conference 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers beat Washington, 4-1, in the best-of-seven series after sweeping 
the New York Islanders in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kinds of things happen," said Ranger forward Adam Graves, who scored 
two goals, of Richter's first-period lapse. "We didn't think anything about it. 
We didn't say anything in the dressing room. We just went out and worked hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The work paid off for New York, which had the NHL's best regular-season 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hardest workers was Brian Leetch, who scored the game-winning goal 
with 3:28 to play to cap a four-point night. 
</P>
<P>
 Leetch, who set up the Rangers' first three goals, all in the first period, 
broke a 3-3 tie when he took a pass in the slot from Sergei Zubov and beat Rick 
Tabaracci with a forehand shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get the puck to settle down," Leetch said. "There was an opening. I 
had to be patient, and I went in and found a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first goal scored against Tabaracci, who had made 24 consecutive 
saves in relief of starter Don Beaupre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers advanced to the conference finals for the first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 2, Boston 0 -- In the Devils' biggest game of the season, Coach 
Jacques Lemaire gambled with a couple of lineup changes, including inserting 
Martin Brodeur at goaltender. Brodeur stopped 22 shots in shutting out the 
Bruins at East Rutherford, N.J., pushing them to the brink of elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Millen and Bob Carpenter scored in the second period as New Jersey took 
a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series in which 
visitors had won every game until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brodeur had four point-blank stops, including two in the first period.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; GILMOUR: WEAK ANKLE, STRONG HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toronto defenseman Bob Baun's courage in scoring the game-winning goal on a 
broken ankle in the sixth game of the 1964 Stanley Cup finals is part of hockey 
lore. 
</P>
<P>
 Maple Leaf center Doug Gilmour is adding a chapter this spring, playing 
magnificently despite a painfully swollen right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he can stuff his sore foot into his skate boot, Gilmour must ice it. 
Then he undergoes therapy. Then he winces. A lot. But he unfailingly plays an 
aggressive two-way game, usually playing double shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the injury -- a tendon damaged when he tangled with Gary Suter in Game 
5 of the Leafs' first-round series against Chicago -- Gilmour plays on the 
power play, kills penalties and takes key faceoffs. Oh, and he leads playoff 
scorers with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
 His one-goal, four-assist performance Sunday in Toronto's 8-3 rout of the San 
Jose Sharks was timely. Had the Maple Leafs lost, they would have faced a 3-1 
series deficit tonight before a hostile San Jose crowd. Instead, Gilmour, who 
has two goals and 11 points in the series, brought them even at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm never surprised by anything Doug Gilmour does," Shark Coach Kevin 
Constantine said. "He's one of my favorite players. He'd be in my top two or 
three players in the league. He's kind of a small guy who does big things." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Toronto winger Mark Osborne: "He's truly a remarkable competitor, and we 
feed off that as a team. A lot of great players play with their hearts, and 
that takes over when they're hurt. That's what Dougie is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmour insists that his valor doesn't come close to matching Baun's. But he 
acknowledged he's in near-constant pain and can't push off with his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accelerating from 10 feet is a problem and that's my biggest thing," he said. 
"If I'm in the corner, I want to get out quickly and get a jump. . . . I have 
good days and some that aren't so good. Sure, you're going to have a little bit 
of pain, but you've got to suck it up. This time of year, you've got to work 
hard." HE'S A LOCK 
</P>
<P>
 When Coach Scotty Bowman was locked into a room next to the Detroit Red Wings' 
locker room before a playoff game, none of his players rescued him. A team 
employee told Detroit reporters he heard players say, "No, keep him there," 
when Bowman yelled to be released. 
</P>
<P>
 If Sergei Fedorov hadn't been with him, the joke went, Bowman might still be 
imprisoned. An arena worker freed them. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, Bowman might as well have stayed in there because -- sacrilegious as 
it sounds -- he was outcoached by Constantine. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman made his first mistake before the playoffs. Against the advice of 
General Manager Bryan Murray, Bowman played his usual lineup in the meaningless 
regular-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the team, "This is our most important game of the season. If we win, 
we'll have home-ice advantage against Pittsburgh in the Stanley Cup finals." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was important, all right, but for the wrong reasons. Fedorov 
aggravated a head injury, Steve Yzerman sprained his knee and Keith Primeau 
injured his left shoulder. Those three contributed little in the Red Wings' 
seven-game loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman also chose to sit on a 3-1 lead in Game 4, a decision criticized by his 
players. Loudest was Paul Coffey, who said the offense-heavy Red Wings should 
have kept attacking the Sharks. Playing a style they neither liked nor excelled 
at, they lost. Bowman also tried to instill a defensive style in Game 7 and 
lost that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone takes the fall, Murray will go before Bowman. Everything is on hold 
until owner Mike Ilitch decides whether to sell the team in order to recoup 
some of the money he's losing as owner of the Tigers. WHAT A DEAL 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Rangers twice tried to trade Alexei Kovalev, to Quebec two years 
ago in a package for the rights to Eric Lindros, and again this season, when 
they thought Vancouver's Petr Nedved could fill a void at second-line center. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the best deal they never made. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they moved Kovalev from right wing to the middle, where he thrived. 
He's a good puck handler and can quickly shift gears to jump ahead of defenders 
and draw penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was moved back to right wing in Monday's series-clinching victory 
over Washington, Kovalev and linemates Steve Larmer and Stephane Matteau had 
collected 25 points, including 11 by Kovalev. That's quite an improvement from 
last season, when he wasn't deemed good enough to play for the Rangers' 
American Hockey League farm team in its last playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a very patient teacher," said Ranger Coach Mike Keenan, who at least 
had the grace to laugh at himself. DREAMING ON 
</P>
<P>
 The recent statement by Gunther Sabetzki, president of the International Ice 
Hockey Federation, that he won't sanction an Olympic tournament with "dream 
teams" of NHL players, is nothing but a power play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabetzki had said he would leave office after his current term, but U.S. 
hockey officials believe he wants to run again. Withholding approval of the 
dream-team format gives him a bargaining chip for the next election. 
</P>
<P>
 IIHF rules allow professionals to play in the Games, so there's little 
Sabetzki can do to prevent the change if the various national hockey 
federations approve -- and if NHL owners agree to shut down the league so 
players can participate. 
</P>
<P>
 He can only cause trouble over the proposed two-tier setup, which calls for 
six European teams to compete for two Olympic berths. Canada, the United 
States, Sweden, Finland, Russia and the Czech Republic would qualify 
automatically. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 The Comsat Corp., which owns the NBA's Denver Nuggets, is looking into buying 
an NHL team and moving it to Denver. Both teams would play in a new arena to be 
built in Denver's Platte Valley. The company is targeting the Whalers, who 
almost left Hartford once before. . . . The post-mortem has begun in 
Pittsburgh, where as many as 10 players and Coach Ed Johnston might be gone. 
"Those hunger pangs that have existed in the past didn't exist this year," 
Penguin President Howard Baldwin said. "As an organization, we have a mandate 
to find out why." 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver Canuck Coach Pat Quinn says the Dallas Stars are taking cheap shots 
at Pavel Bure. Maybe so. But that doesn't excuse Bure's vicious elbowing of 
Shane Churla, which drew a laughable $500 fine. . . . The Stars are 
disappointed with defenseman Derian Hatcher's passive play. . . . San Jose's 
Igor Larionov, Johan Garpenlov and Sergei Makarov collected 21 points in seven 
games in the first round, but they've been held to four points in four games by 
the Maple Leafs. Peter Zezel's defensive play is the main reason. 
</P>
<P>
 After the New Jersey Devils had drawn crowds of 13,878 and 17,205 to the 
19,040-seat Meadowlands Arena for their first two games against Boston, Bernie 
Nicholls suggested the Devils would never succeed there and ought to move. It's 
too bad fans there don't appreciate Coach Jacques Lemaire's efforts.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FINALLY, HELP AVAILABLE FOR RODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Angels had only 32 players on their 40-man roster because 
of the organization's lack of talent. But if someone starts to struggle now, 
Angel Manager Buck Rodgers knows he has plenty of candidates available. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pitchers John Farrell (4-3, 3.06 earned-run average) and Russ 
Springer (2-4, 3.40 ERA) are ready to be called up, and first baseman J.T. Snow 
is batting .291 with four homers and 21 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is why when Rodgers was asked if he'll continue to play Eduardo 
Perez (.200), no matter how long he struggles, Rodgers shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not here thick or thin," Rodgers said. "Nobody is, unless I get a 
10-year contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers said there is no need to call up a pitcher now, but for the first time 
since he has been with the Angels, he at least has options. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't even want to bring John Farrell with us last year, but we didn't 
have anybody else," Rodgers said. "Then, we didn't want to keep him, but we 
still didn't have anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, things have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel pitcher Mark Langston was given clearance to start Wednesday against the 
Texas Rangers, just 30 days after undergoing arthroscopic elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did he have? Dr. Spock come over and zap the bone chips out of there?" 
Ranger starter Bruce Hurst said. "That's incredible. I had my surgery 17 months 
ago, and I'm just getting back now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels will activate Langston on Wednesday, and are expected to make room 
for him on the roster by optioning reliever Bill Sampen to triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 They also will move Mark Leiter's start back to Saturday to accommodate 
Langston. Joe Magrane will be pushed back to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Eduardo Perez, who has a sprained ligament in his left hand, 
took 25 swings in the batting cage Monday and is scheduled to start tonight for 
the first time since May 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lewis Yocum is scheduled to fly into town Wednesday, and he will then 
re-examine Perez and make a determination if he needs to be placed on the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad played 23 years and never went on the DL," Perez said, "I don't want 
to start that now. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's going to hurt me, and I'm not at my fullest, I should go on the DL. 
I'm not going to go out there if I'm not helping the team." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Brian Anderson, who broke his left thumb Friday night, was examined 
Sunday and was informed that he could be back within four weeks, instead of six 
weeks as originally projected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Chris Turner, who has not started a game in a week, will return to the 
lineup tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, who is batting .119 this season, has been working the last few days in 
an attempt to resurrect his batting skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a little bit of a brain cramp," Rodgers said, "so we've given him time 
to work it out." BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; BUTLER'S LEFT THUMB MERELY BRUISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a long night for Brett Butler, but the news made it worth it. Butler, 
who suffered an injured left thumb during Sunday's game when he was squaring to 
bunt, suffered only a bruise. After returning to Los Angeles with the team, 
Butler went directly to Centinela Hospital Medical Center, where X-Rays were 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "A buddy of mine picked up (Butler's wife) Eveline and me from the airport and 
by the time we got home it was about 1 in the morning," Butler said. "They 
drained it and gave me a couple of pain pills and I slept with my arm up all 
night and got to the stadium about 3 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler has only been on the disabled list once in his career, in 1987, when he 
suffered a broken middle finger on a bunt attempt and sat out for a month. 
Monday, he played with a rubber guard on his thumb.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort, who pitched in seven of the 10 games on the recent trip, had 
a closed-door meeting with Manager Tom Lasorda and pitching coach Ron 
Perranoski before Monday's game. Dreifort converted three of five save 
opportunities on the trip, and got the loss in one game. He had a 7.56 
earned-run average over 8 1/3 innings. Overall, he has pitched more than any 
reliever, with a 3.48 ERA in 21 innings and four saves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about how when I'm 1-and-2 or 0-and-2 in the count, I need to be 
able to punch them out instead of getting a ground ball," Dreifort said. "Being 
in the bullpen, you don't have a chance to work out things a lot, and you have 
to have a crash course in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, who is the closer while Todd Worrell is sidelined, has an effective 
sinker, but that is also the pitch three San Francisco Giants hit for 
run-scoring singles in the ninth inning of Sunday's game.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I get up in the pen, there are some things I can work on," Dreifort 
said. "Maybe instead of just throwing, I need to learn how to throw to the 
right spot." MARYANN HUDSON

 * Today's pairings (at Studio City Raquet Center): Woodland Hills Taft (14-0), 
last year's Division 4-A runner-up, takes on University (15-0), at 2 p.m. Van 
Nuys (13-1), last year's 3-A runner-up, plays Bell (16-0) in the other 
championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year's finish: Led by No. 1 singles player Rafael Huerta, Chatsworth 
defeated Taft, 19 1/2-10, for the 4-A title, while Marshall won its third 
consecutive 3-A title by defeating Van Nuys 18 1/2-11. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: University sends a senior-dominated team against a Taft squad 
without any seniors playing singles. Taft's top two singles players are 
sophomore Dylan Mann and freshman Golan Sassoon. "Mann is probably the best 
singles player in the city," said Tom Anderson, University's coach. University, 
which won the 4-A title in 1992, is led by No 1 singles player Jay Jackson. In 
the 3-A final, Van Nuys is led by No. 1 singles player Steve Park, who 
transferred from Granada Hills this year. Bell has won 85 of 91 individual 
matches this season and is led by No. 1 player Jose Cardenas and the No. 1 
doubles team of Jose Ruiz and Oscar De La Rosa. GREG SANDOVAL

 The Munchkins are smiling in State College, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Ramon Hernandez of the Penn State men's volleyball team spiked 38 
kills in the face of the Wicked Witch of the West, UCLA, on Saturday to win the 
NCAA men's volleyball championship, the little people of the volleyball world 
haven't stopped dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State won, 9-15, 15-13, 4-15, 15-12, 15-12, in the NCAA final at Allen 
County War Memorial Coliseum in Ft. Wayne, Ind., in a comeback that set the 
volleyball world on its ear. 
</P>
<P>
 A news release issued by Penn State (25-3) afterward said, "Expect to see 
signs erected on all roads leading to State College, Pa., saying, 'Welcome To 
State College -- Volleyball Capital of the United States.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Western schools have dominated the sport. And UCLA (27-2), the 1993 national 
champion, has been the most dominant of all. Al Scates, UCLA's coach, has a 
record of 837-132 in his 32 years at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State's national title is the first for a non-West Coast team in the 
25-year history of volleyball's final four. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter suggested to Tom Peterson, Penn State's coach, that it was the 
biggest upset in volleyball history, Peterson said it seemed like a dream come 
true. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a once-in-a-lifetime, fairy-tale story," he said. "It's history. 
Just to be part of that history is pretty special." 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, however, they are suggesting Penn State not change any road signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives everybody hope, I guess, now that the West has finally been beaten," 
Scates said. "Of course, we hope to crush those hopes again next year and put 
things in their rightful perspective once again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For junior Jeff Nygaard, UCLA's star opposite hitter, knowing that he has 
another chance next year is no consolation for Saturday's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretty much haven't slept since that night," he said. "I can't get my mind 
off it. I kind of feel like I have wasted seven months of my life. If we win 
next year, it will still be a thorn. . . . Then we'll look back and say we 
should have won this year. It is always going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Nygaard was voted the American Volleyball Coaches Assn. player of the year 
this season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Embers are still smoldering over the NCAA men's volleyball committee's 
unprecedented decision to award the at-large berth for the final four to a team 
from the Midwest, Indiana-Purdue Ft. Wayne, rather than to a team from the 
West, Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Leland, Stanford athletic director, has sent a letter to the NCAA, 
expressing his concern over the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stanford had lost at Ft. Wayne (20-7) in a regular-season match, 
Stanford (20-9) had a stronger schedule and better record against common 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ruben Nieves, Stanford coach: "They made the wrong decision. If you look 
at all the information . . . . I just don't see how they could have come up 
with what they came up with." 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility is that the selection committee chose Ft. Wayne hoping that 
having the host school in the tournament would boost attendance. Bob Hiegert, 
the Cal State Northridge athletic director and a member of the selection 
committee, denied that attendance was a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the committee's reasoning, it is no comfort to Stanford senior Canyon 
Ceman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started off in disbelief and it's slowly progressing into anger and 
outrage," Ceman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ft. Wayne's performance at the NCAA tournament -- the Mastadons were beaten 
three consecutive games by UCLA in the semifinals and then again by Ball State 
in the consolation match -- seemed strong evidence in support of Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation volleyball coaches will have a conference 
call on Thursday to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 USC added women's water polo as a varsity sport last week in an attempt to 
bring the athletic department closer to compliance with Title IX, a federal 
statute that mandates gender equity. USC now conducts 10 sports for men and 10 
for women. Still, the addition raised sports opportunities for female athletes 
at USC only three percentage points to 36%, which falls far short of the 
athletic department's goal, 45%. "We'll take the painful steps that it requires 
in order to get there," said Lisa Love, USC associate athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 How does Allen Fox, Pepperdine men's tennis coach, feel about having to play 
in a newly formed regional qualifying tournament this year instead of advancing 
directly to the NCAA championship tournament? "This regional thing has worked 
exactly the way the people that instituted it have planned," Fox said. "The 
plan was to get in more of the weaker teams and get rid of as many better teams 
as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth-ranked UCLA will play host to the NCAA Region VIII tennis qualifying 
tournament, which includes 10th-ranked Pepperdine, this weekend. Top-ranked USC 
has received an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament May 21-May 29 at Notre 
Dame. . . . The NCAA women's tennis tournament will be held Friday through May 
21 at Athens, Ga.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD; HARVESTING RECRUITS THROUGH COMBINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The business side of sports continues to creep into high school athletics, 
with 700 local football players expected to attend Reebok's preseason combine 
Saturday at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
 The players will be evaluated in tests measuring speed, strength and agility 
before more than 50 college coaches, including representatives of most Pacific 
10 Conference schools. The results will be tabulated and mailed to every 
Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
 Reebok, formerly the title corporate sponsor of the California Interscholastic 
Federation, picks up the tab. Attendance is free but by invitation only. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the combine attracted 500 athletes. The overwhelming response 
prompted Reebok to bring the event back for a second year and hold similar 
events around the nation. Many athletes believe this gives them a chance to be 
discovered, and college coaches welcome the opportunity to evaluate so many 
players in one place. 
</P>
<P>
 High school coaches have mixed feelings about the combine, which is modeled 
after ones held for college players before the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Engilman, Sylmar's coach, has sent many players to the college ranks in 
recent years and is cooperative with recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand why this is being held," Engilman said. "It really helps out the 
college coaches. But I prefer my players to be recruited the old-fashioned way. 
I want recruiters to come watch game film and talk to the school staff. This 
(combine) makes it too much of a business." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Coach Steve Grady said he made the combine information available to his 
players, but neither encouraged nor discouraged their attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a kid wants to go and see what he can do, that is fine," Grady said. "But 
I also tell them, a good or bad performance there isn't going to make or break 
them. The good players will get noticed." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Bark, publisher of Cal-Hi magazine and a combine organizer, said he fears 
recruiters will look at a player's height, weight and 40-yard dash time and 
evaluate only on that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I also found that a number of kids made names for themselves last year 
who weren't even being recruited," he said. "If we can help one kid get a 
scholarship, then I think it is worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 High school coaches are finding themselves under increased scrutiny, with 
publicity-conscious administrators often acting before the facts are in. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, a number of coaches have been reprimanded or relieved of 
their duties for a variety of alleged incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hamilton, boys' basketball coach at Anaheim Servite, was suspended last 
winter for allegedly getting into a scuffle with an official after a game. 
Hamilton has since been reinstated without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Bradshaw, boys' basketball coach at Simi Valley, received the same 
punishment last season after he allegedly pushed down one of his players during 
a game. He also has been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest incident involves Mike Scyphers, Simi Valley's veteran baseball 
coach. Scyphers was suspended from coaching duties last week while school 
administrators investigate charges of financial and disciplinary improprieties. 
The suspension could have waited until there was some evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing wrong with punishing a coach who has broken rules and used 
poor judgment. But coaches should not be judged before allegations are proven. 
Such practices can seriously harm reputations. Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Violent incidents continue to plague high school sporting events. Last week, 
Reseda baseball player Alonzo Arreola was suspended for punching Chatsworth 
shortstop Bryan LaCour during a postgame handshake. LaCour was punched in the 
stomach and knocked to the ground. In another incident, Anaheim Katella 
softball Coach Rhonda Weyer was ejected in a game against Anaheim Esperanza 
after allegedly knocking down an official and pushing an opposing player. . . . 
Two of the nation's top basketball prospects signed letters of intent last 
week. Brandon Jessie, a forward from Ventura College and Huntington Beach 
Edison High, selected Utah, and center Jerod Ward of Clinton, Miss., signed 
with Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section boys' and girls' swimming finals will be held this 
weekend at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. The Division I finals are Friday at 7 
p.m. and Divisions II and III are Saturday beginning at noon. . . . The City 
Section boys' volleyball finals are Friday at Cal State Northridge, beginning 
with the Division 3-A match at 5:30 p.m. Times' Top 20 Baseball Poll

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; BORG FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO BE BJORN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Bjorn Borg is finished playing top-level tennis, as he has indicated, he 
didn't go out in a blaze of glory. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning to the sport in 1991 after an eight-year absence, the 
five-time Wimbledon champion and six-time winner of the French Open never 
climbed higher than No. 762 in the ATP Tour computer rankings, losing all 12 of 
his matches before deciding at the end of last year to limit himself to senior 
tournaments and World TeamTennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Still trim and fit as he approaches his 38th birthday on June 6, Borg said he 
sometimes felt lost as he tried to regain his form. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you stay away for a long period of time, it's difficult to find yourself 
on the court or to play with a lot of confidence," he said last month in 
Anaheim, where he joined Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Mats Wilander for a 
senior tournament. "It's almost like you forget how to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Borg's goal was to again play at Wimbledon and in the French Open, he 
never did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing or winning, that was not the main thing," he said. "Obviously, I walk 
on the court trying to win, but I had fun playing tennis again. That was the 
major thing, the most enjoyable thing for me." 
</P>
<P>
 And the results? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the end of the world," said Borg, who wears his long hair, flecked 
with gray, in a pony tail. "It's not like I'm sleepless. I would be 10 or 15 
years ago, but today it's not the most important thing for me in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Connors, though, said all that losing frustrated Borg. He said Borg probably 
expected too much when he launched his comeback with the same brand of wooden 
racket he had used to win the French Open, the last of his Grand Slam titles, 
in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "He left for eight years, so he went back eight years and everybody else went 
ahead eight years, so he's 16 years behind, the way I look at it," Connors 
said. "He stayed in shape, but not grinding out matches and playing competitive 
tennis, it's difficult. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "And even though I'm sure he stayed in touch with tennis, he wasn't in the 
mainstream. He came back and tried to play with the same equipment, and 
everybody else was playing with rackets as big as this room." 
</P>
<P>
 "To all of a sudden come back and see that and play against it . . . . had to 
be a tough thing for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Borg quickly switched to a graphite racket, but the losses continued to mount. 
His last match, a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 loss to Alexander Volkov last November at 
Moscow, might have been Borg's most encouraging, but didn't change his plans to 
end his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not my last match," he told reporters in Moscow. "Just my last match 
. . . in the big league." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Careful what you wish for: Connors and McEnroe were considered childish, their 
behavior a detriment to the game, when they ruled tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 The current No. 1, gentlemanly Pete Sampras, is called boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take what you get," Connors said. "Nobody's ever satisfied, are they? 
When we came along, tennis was much different. We got it out of the country 
clubs and got the masses in there, so that 20,000 people would come and watch 
in person and millions of people would tune into the television." 
</P>

 People's choice: Along with Winona Ryder, Paul Newman, Julia Roberts, John 
Kennedy Jr., Meg Ryan and 44 others, MaliVai Washington is included in People 
magazine's list of the 50 most beautiful people in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote People of the No. 28 player in the ATP Tour rankings: "Forget gangly 
John McEnroe and Pete Sampras; the tennis body (and legs) of today belongs to 
hard-hitting, hard-to-miss MaliVai Washington, 24. The up-and-comer . . . . 
cracked the men's top 20 last year, thanks to a rocket serve and a rock-like 
physique.

Poitier. All the ladies are crazy about his quads. He's the Quad-Squad guy.' "

 U.S. team captain Tom Gullikson, who announced last week that Pete Sampras and 
Jim Courier will play singles in the Davis Cup quarterfinals against the 
Netherlands July 15-17 at Rotterdam, probably won't choose a doubles team for 
at least another month. "None of the American teams have really played that 
well together this year," he said. . . . Pam Shriver, contemplating retirement 
from singles competition, will play singles in the French Open for the first 
time since 1983. "That will be comic relief for anyone who wants to come and 
watch," said Shriver, winner of five French Open doubles titles.

VALLEY/VENTURA ROUNDUP; SCHLENDER WINS J.C. GOLF TOURNAMENT

 Kelly Schlender of Ventura College won the 36-hole Junior College Individual 
Golf Championship on Monday with rounds of 71 and 78 at Mission Viejo Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlender finished in a tie with Aki Amaya of Saddleback College and 
Birmingham High. Amaya also had rounds of 71 and 78. 
</P>
<P>
 The tie was settled by a card-off, using each player's performance over the 
final nine holes as a sudden-death playoff. Amaya's triple-bogey on the 15th 
hole gave Schlender the victory.

<P>
 The Westlake and Hart high school golf teams qualified for the Southern 
Section team finals by winning their respective regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake shot a 374 and finished two strokes ahead of San Marcos in the 
Northern regional at Rancho Maria Country Club in Santa Maria.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Western regional, Hart (387) tied for first place with Loyola at Royal 
Vista Golf Course in Walnut. Hart's Steve Farris tied Ted Oh of Torrance for 
first place among individuals with a 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura finished fourth in the Northern regional, 11 strokes behind third-place 
Sunny Hills. Brandon Jones led Agoura with a 71.

 Lawrence Trygstad, an attorney representing the Simi Valley High baseball 
players, said Monday he will file his request today for a temporary restraining 
order that could return suspended Coach Mike Scyphers to his position this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The request will be filed this morning in Ventura County Superior Court in 
Ventura, Trygstad said, and a hearing could be scheduled for this afternoon or 
Wednesday morning. If the order is granted, Scyphers could return to the team 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The players contend that Scyphers' suspension so late in the season damages 
the team. He should be allowed to coach pending the outcome of a police and 
school district investigation into possible financial and disciplinary 
improprieties, according to the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, returned to school Monday to teach driver's education and 
physical education. He had not taught since he was suspended as baseball coach 
last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of parents who support Scyphers have scheduled a meeting with Supt. 
Mary Beth Wolford and Principal Kathryn Scroggin for Wednesday morning at the 
school district office. JEFF FLETCHER

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FINALLY, HELP AVAILABLE FOR RODGERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Angels had only 32 players on their 40-man roster because 
of the organization's lack of talent. Now, Manager Buck Rodgers knows if 
someone starts to struggle, he has plenty of candidates available. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pitchers John Farrell (4-3, 3.06 ERA) and Russ Springer (2-4, 3.40 
ERA) are ready for the big leagues, and first baseman J.T. Snow is batting .291 
with four homers and 21 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers says there is no need to call up a pitcher, but for the first time 
since he has been with the Angels, he at least has options. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't even want to bring John Farrell with us last year but we didn't 
have anybody else," Rodgers said. "Then, we didn't want to keep him, but we 
still didn't have anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, things have changed." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Angel pitcher Mark Langston was cleared to start Wednesday against the Texas 
Rangers, 30 days after undergoing arthroscopic elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ranger starter Bruce Hurst: "That's incredible. I had my surgery 17 
months ago, and I'm just getting back now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels will activate Langston on Wednesday, and are expected to make room 
for him on the roster by optioning reliever Bill Sampen to triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Perez, who has a sprained ligament in his left hand, took 25 swings in 
the batting cage Monday and is scheduled to start tonight for the first time 
since May 4. . . . Angel starter Brian Anderson, who suffered a broken left 
thumb Friday night, was examined Sunday and was told he might be back within 
four weeks, instead of six weeks as originally projected. BOB NIGHTENGALE

SADDLEBACK WINS STATE GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>

 Saddleback figured it could get off to an early lead in the State community 
college golf tournament because the Gauchos were playing at one of their home 
courses -- Mission Viejo Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Bill Cunerty and his players said they were amazed by their 12-shot 
advantage (375 to 387) over second-place Monterey Peninsula after 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Saddleback went on to win the tournament with a 36-hole total of 
770. Monterey (795) was second and Palomar (797) third. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth State title for Cunerty, in his 13th season. It was also the 
first time in 17 years that the host team has won the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really proud of them," Cunerty said. "This is a special group. They work 
harder than any team I've had and that's hard to say because of some of the 
groups we've had." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Aki Amaya tied for the morning low round with a one-under 71 on 
the 6,814-yard course. He had two birdies in the round. 
</P>
<P>
 He shot 78 in the afternoon round and finished tied for first with Kelly 
Schlender of Ventura. Schlender also shot 71-78 and won the medalist honor on a 
card playoff. Schlender had also shot the low round May 2 at Santa Ana Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya, from Van Nuys Birmingham High School, had never shot better than 78 at 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of surprised, but I had a lot of luck," he said of his 71. "The 
team title is great, that's what I was thinking about all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Justin Grandy (75-79) and Jason McDaniel (76-78) tied for fifth 
overall at 154. 
</P>
<P>
 Colin McElderry (79-79) and Jerome Valentin (75-83) shot 158 and Jason Reeder 
(78-81) shot 159 for Saddleback, which also won the Orange Empire Conference 
and Southern California tournaments on the two previous Mondays.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTES; PANEL RECOMMENDS BASEBALL GET LARGEST SHARE OF FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A Cal State Fullerton student athletic advisory council has recommended that 
baseball get the biggest share of the $500,000 to be generated by a student fee 
referendum that will benefit the Titan sports program beginning this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Bill Shumard, who has resigned the position effective May 
31, said Monday the group's proposal will go to university President Milton A. 
Gordon to be used in the budgeting process. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard said the student group recommended that baseball receive $70,000 from 
the student fees. Other fund allocation recommendations: soccer, $55,000; men's 
basketball, $53,000; women's volleyball, $50,000; women's gymnastics, $40,000; 
track and cross-country, $40,000; wrestling $30,000, women's basketball, 
$28,000; softball, $28,000; women's tennis, $12,000, and fencing, $10,000. 
Other proposed allocations: $40,000 for publicity and advertising, $34,000 for 
the Sports Club Council and $10,000 for the pep squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the students did a good and thorough job of exploring the issues 
involved and honoring all our sports," Shumard said. He said he was "surprised 
and disappointed" that the men's basketball did not fare better in the 
recommendations, however. Shumard said when he resigned his position last week 
that he feels the school's basketball program should be better funded.

 Cal State Fullerton's Jeff Ferguson was named national player of the week by

five home runs and 12 RBIs. He was seven for seven in one of the New Mexico 
State games, a Big West record for hits in a game. 
</P>
<P>

COUCHED IN LUSTY MIND GAMES, THRILLER IS OUT TO MAKE CHARTS; DISSOCIATED 
STATES, BY LEONARD SIMON ; BANTAM; $21.95, 336 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL NEIMARK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This book is a guilty pleasure -- a psychological thriller that's nearly 
impossible to put down, yet leaves you feeling empty and irritated afterward, 
as if you'd just watched a TV "Movie of the Week" when you were really in the 
mood for Hitchcock's "Spellbound." 
</P>
<P>
 Written by a practicing New York psychoanalyst who was formerly on the faculty 
of both City University and Rutgers, the novel serves up all the latest and 
most lurid cliches of incest, murder, infidelity, multiple-personality 
disorder, Oedipal madness and courtroom drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is a clever one: Jake and Claire are New York psychoanalysts married 
to each other. Each gets a mysterious new patient. They soon discover that he's 
the same man -- a murderer who was sexually abused by his father, kills only 
married couples and suffers from multiple-personality disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jake he's Arthur Moss, an emotionally dead businessman with inexplicable 
headaches; for Claire he's Adam Maliver, a sensitive artist suffering from 
depression. But Arthur and Adam are just two among a whole bedlam of 
personalities inside the "real" man, Felix Kiehl. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiehl functions as the core personality, and he happens to be a financial and 
computer genius who has registered each of his multiples with a different 
Social Security number and investment broker. All have made killings in the 
stock market; Kiehl is so rich he can play out his game of murder at his 
leisure. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire and Jake, in contrast, are typical Manhattan shrinks who live on the 
Upper West Side and spend weekends in the Hamptons playing tennis. Claire's a 
straight Freudian, Jake an eclectic therapist. Their 10-year marriage is in 
trouble and nearly breaks under the stress of being stalked by Kiehl, who sees 
in every couple he murders a surrogate mother and father. Before they know it, 
Claire and Jake are on opposite sides of a national courtroom drama, where 
Kiehl is being tried for murder as well as his astounding white-collar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in jail and in court that "Dissociated States" begins to wallow in the 
maudlin stuff of supermarket tabloids. Claire treats Kiehl before the trial, 
experimenting with hypnosis on the spur of the moment. It's an instant success 
and makes Claire wonder: Does he really have multiple-personality disorder? Or 
is it the best twist on the insanity plea she's ever run across? Out tumble 
personalities like Maura, a woman-child who asks Claire, 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Do all men have those things?' 
</P>
<P>
 'I'm not sure what you mean,' Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 'Those things they poke with.' 
</P>
<P>
 'Do you mean penises?' 
</P>
<P>
 'Do all men hurt children with them?' " 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons Claire risks treating the mad and murderous Kiehl is that 
she's got a crush on his gorgeous high-stakes lawyer, Mary Buchanan. 
"(Claire's) clearest feeling was that she was in love. It didn't frighten her . 
. . she'd been analyzed well enough to know those buried corners of herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan, in turn, is as cold as the killer she's defending, a woman whose 
"goal in life is to poison everything" because as a young, troubled woman she 
was "manipulated by a psychiatrist and used by him for anything he chose. . . 
."  
</P>

 And, just to add spice to the Oedipal stew, Claire has been having an affair 
with her teacher, analyst Max Dorfmann, for 10 years: "It was no secret that 
she was the daughter he never had. It was no secret that he made up for the 
neglect of her alcoholic father. The secret was how well it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 In this book, wherever there's a father or a father figure, there's sex and 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a lay reader, one who has never laid down on a therapist's couch, is 
going to wonder. If this were a psychoanalyst's comic revenge on a profession 
that has exasperated and exhausted him, it might fly. But Simon's sendup of 
psychology is both sloppy and self-indulgent, even for a commercial thriller. 
As a professional he must know that multiple-personality disorder is a rare 
clinical entity; that we are in the midst of an enormous crisis in therapy 
because therapists are now being sued for using questionable hypnotic 
techniques -- techniques in which they've been poorly or never trained -- to 
"unearth" memories of sexual abuse and nonexistent multiple personalities. The 
disorder has become a darling of pop culture, and Simon knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's annoying at best to see a psychoanalyst running as fast and hard as he 
can after a potential bestseller without bothering to portray the psyche with 
the least dollop of realism. This is a thriller that expertly pumps you up and 
ultimately leaves you deflated.

 Down Time starts at bedtime. The kids' bedtime. Time to relax and pad 
downstairs for a cup of tea.Feet up, television on, splayed out on our comfy 
green sofa with a steaming cup of tea melting the day away. Perhaps a decadent 
snack we've managed to hide from the kids. Peace and quiet, a little 
conversation with the man I love. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I chat about our day, emptying our minds of worries and cares. 
Tea mug in hand, uninterrupted by bellowing toddlers or chatty salesmen, I can

AMGEN TAKEOVER TALK FUELED BY RISE IN STOCK; INVESTMENT: SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE 
BIOTECH GIANT, WITH ITS SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS, WOULD BE TOO COSTLY AN ACQUISITION 
FOR ALL BUT THE LARGEST PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is biotechnology giant Amgen Inc. ripe for a takeover? 
</P>
<P>
 The recent jump in Amgen's stock price "would indicate that some people are 
asking that question," said Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology 
Stock Letter in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 But many analysts consider an acquisition of Thousand Oaks-based Amgen, the 
world's largest and most profitable biotechnology concern, unlikely. "In the 
pharmacy business, companies don't get acquired very often unless they want 
to," McCamant said, because scientists might leave after a buyout. And Amgen's 
chief executive, Gordon Binder, has previously said he doesn't want the company 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The run-up in Amgen's stock, along with similar gains in the stocks of other 
pharmaceutical and biotech companies, came after the announcement last week 
that Switzerland's Roche Holding Ltd. would acquire Palo Alto-based Syntex 
Corp. for $5.3 billion, creating the world's fourth largest drug firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal has fueled speculation that more pharmaceutical industry 
consolidation would follow. Stocks in that industry have been battered in the 
past year due to concern that health-care reform would include drug price 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Since May 2, when the Roche-Syntex deal was announced, Amgen's stock has risen 
from $40.50 a share, to Monday's closing price of $43.13. But that is well 
below Amgen's peak of $77.75 a share in December, 1992. And Amgen's market 
value, now about $5.8 billion, is still a bargain compared to the princely $10 
billion it once commanded. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent increase in Amgen's stock price could also reflect an awareness 
that some drug and biotechnology stocks are undervalued after their long 
pounding, analysts said. And in a favorable sign for the industry, last week 
the Clinton Administration indicated it would not oppose keeping price 
restrictions on "breakthrough" biotechnology drugs out of any health-care 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen would be a tempting takeover target because the patents on its two 
blockbuster biotechnology drugs, Epogen and Neupogen, don't begin expiring for 
another 10 years. But that's also a reason Amgen wouldn't be as vulnerable to a 
takeover as Syntex was, analysts said. Syntex lost patent protection in 
December on its leading product, the arthritis treatment Naprosyn. 
</P>
<P>
 And to pay a premium similar to what Syntex shareholders are to receive, a 
suitor for Amgen would have to bid $8 billion to $9 billion, said analyst David 
Stone at the investment firm Cowen & Co. in Boston. Only a few of the world's 
largest drug concerns, such as Merck & Co. or Eli Lilly & Co., could 
contemplate an acquisition of that magnitude. According to recent news reports 
Lilly considered a run at Amgen, but passed because it would be too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one factor that would work against Amgen in an unfriendly takeover 
attempt is that only 3% of its stock is owned by current, or former, Amgen 
executives and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite concerns over a slowing of Amgen's earlier red-hot growth, the 
company's profits keep rising. In 1993, Amgen earned a record $383 million on 
$1.3 billion in revenue. In the first quarter of this year, its profit rose 5%, 
to $93.5 million on a 17% rise in revenue, to $364 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen also throws off a lot of cash. Value Line estimates Amgen's cash flow 
this year at $462 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The two drugs that have fueled Amgen's growth showed solid sales gains in the 
first quarter. Sales of Epogen, which fights anemia in dialysis patients by 
boosting red blood cell production, rose 20% from a year earlier. Neupogen, 
Amgen's infection-fighting drug that stimulates white blood cell production, 
showed a 15% sales increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen is hoping to find a third breakthrough drug -- and spent a record $255 
million last year in research and development -- but so far all its prospects 
are in early stages of development. 
</P>
<P>
 McCamant suggested that Amgen might itself buy another, smaller biotech firm. 
Such a company might have a promising product, but a shortage of cash needed to 
endure the lengthy and costly process of bringing a drug to market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen's Binder declined to be interviewed regarding the recent takeover 
speculation, or whether Amgen would be interested in buying another firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen's strategy so far has been to enter arm's-length development deals and 
joint ventures with other companies in its quest for a new product, and in 
recent months it has announced a series of licensing and research agreements. 
Last month it made an equity investment in Alanex Corp., a San Diego start-up 
firm with whom Amgen is collaborating to design small-molecule drugs for 
treating neurological disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Amgen announced a long-term research agreement with the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a collaboration with Los Altos 
start-up Amcell Corp. to develop cell-separation technologies that might be 
used to treat cancer and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 One treatment Amgen is developing with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. in 
Tarrytown, N. Y., has shown promise in early stages of testing. Called 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor, it is a protein that would be used to treat 
Lou Gehrig's disease and other degenerative diseases of the nervous system. The 
first clinical trials with human patients began in October, and preliminary 
results are expected by the end of the year. The pre-clinical data "was very 
positive," said Amgen spokesman David Kaye, although he cautioned against 
raised expectations. Even under the best of circumstances it would be at least 
three years before the drug could be marketed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amgen's biggest problem, having launched the biotech industry's two most 
successful products, is what do they do for an encore," Stone said.

TRAINING PROGRAM TAKES HEALTHY CUT AT UNEMPLOYMENT; JOBS: GLENDALE PROGRAM 
CONCENTRATES ON A SINGLE INDUSTRY -- MEDICAL CARE. VERDUGO PRIVATE INDUSTRY 
COUNCIL EXPECTS 75% OF GRADUATES TO BE PLACED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Often, fewer than half the people in federally funded job-training programs 
end up finding a job. But the Verdugo Private Industry Council of Glendale 
thinks it put together a better job-training program by concentrating on a 
single industry: health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-five people have been trained in the Glendale program, out of 400 who 
participated in this statewide pilot program aimed at health-care jobs, and 
organizers expect 75% of them to find jobs at an average pay of between $8 and 
$9 per hour. That contrasts with earnings of about $5.43 per hour for average 
welfare recipients trained through the Verdugo council's other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was "a life saver," according to laid-off Lockheed worker Mary Ann 
McGann. After seven months on unemployment, McGann earns $8.40 an hour as a 
medical assistant, greeting patients, answering phones and handling paperwork 
for a Toluca Lake cardiologist. That's a big drop from the $16 an hour McGann 
earned at Lockheed examining blueprints and ordering materials. Still, she 
said: "Without this (jobs) program, I wouldn't have gotten a real job again. 
Now I have a chance to build on something, to move up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale program, now in its final stages, was part of what's called the 
Health Careers Opportunity Program, a two-year job-training program by the 
state Employment Development Department and the Office of Statewide Health 
Planning and Development, funded with $3 million from the U.S. Department of 
Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 50 students who have come through the Glendale program, 33 have found 
jobs so far. The other 15 are still finishing their classes, but nine of those 
have found jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The council designed the program according to recommendations from local 
hospital officials, who suggested classes to produce workers "tailor-made to 
order," said Lee Downing , head of program development for the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The program hired community college teachers to run the classes, which 
concentrated on computer and clerical skills, as well as medical terms, how to 
handle specimens, assess patients, plus basic math skills. In addition, the 
program offered an enticement to employers by offering to subsidize half the 
trainees' salaries for the first 10 weeks they worked. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also aimed at getting more minorities and multilingual workers 
into health care. But it is also being hailed as an example of how investing 
more in job training, for a longer period, can pay off better than most 
traditional federally funded job training programs, which traditionally favor 
quick and basic courses in low-level job skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few of the participants, such as McGann, were on unemployment 
rolls, most were single minority mothers on welfare. Some had never really held 
a job. Others had been through several government-funded job-training programs, 
but were still unable to find work. 
</P>
<P>
 Katrin Gabri, 32, had been on welfare for four years after emigrating to this 
country from Iran. A single mother, she is now an occupational therapy aide at 
Glendale Adventist Medical Center, earning $7.88 per hour. Being on welfare for 
years left her depressed and demoralized. With two children to care for, she 
couldn't afford to attend school, but was able to attend the one-month training 
course offered by Verdugo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I just want to jump ahead, I want to get an occupational therapist 
license," she said. "When you work . . . you are someone in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Jonathan Clardy, 27, who was living off unemployment benefits, the program 
gave him his first permanent, full-time job as a switchboard operator for a Van 
Nuys Medical Group earning $1,200 per month. He recently moved into a new 
apartment. "For the first time, I don't have a roommate anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are jobs that have some stability, possibility for career advancement, 
reasonable wages and fringe benefits. They are desirable jobs," said Tom Nagle, 
director of the state Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the program's apparent success are two years of hard work that put 
organizers' resourcefulness and patience to the test. Chris Rodemich, program 
director and nursing instructor at Glendale Community College, said it was "one 
of the most difficult things I have ever done." 
</P>
<P>
 Her duties included scrutinizing applicants for signs of drug addiction, and 
she often received phone calls at home at night from students in crisis. She 
even found herself scanning the want ads for jobs on her free time, seeking 
openings for her charges. "It was hard to get them out of my mind," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodemich believes the key to the program's success was less its emphasis on 
health-care careers than its attention to the student's mental health. Besides 
extensive discussion of self-esteem issues in class, participants were given 
counseling and attended group therapy sessions.  
</P>
<P>
 Students were provided everything from help with transportation to uniforms 
once they were hired. Some were even offered confidence-boosting haircuts, 
make-overs and manicures before job interviews. Several participants said these 
side benefits helped them more than the job training. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helped me more morally than anything," said Anna Bohnhof, a 51-year-old 
Burbank woman who once worked as a clerk for a railroad company. Bohnhof had 
been looking for work for more than a year. "I was losing faith in myself. I 
didn't know which direction to turn." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She now works as a patient-care service aide at Childrens Hospital, earning $8 
per hour, enough to support herself and her 14-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Downing said the Verdugo council has applied for grants from the federal Labor 
Department to continue the program, which is now expected to end in November 
when the pilot money runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, after explosive growth in the 1980s, the health-care industry 
has gone through rapid consolidation in Southern California and lost 3,900 jobs 
in the last 12 months, according to Jack Kyser of the Economic Development 
Corp. of Los Angeles County. But analysts said that the kinds of jobs the 
Verdugo council offered training for will continue to grow as health-care 
providers rely increasingly on lower-paid aides and technicians to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing a growth in complexity in jobs at the entry level," said Robert 
H. Pola, manager of human resource development for Kaiser Permanente's Southern 
California region. The advent of patient-centered care has meant hospitals and 
clinics increasingly need hourly workers who possess diverse skills that they 
can learn in a few weeks of training. Kaiser's Bellflower hospital has just 
begun a similar training program of its own, Pola said.  
</P>
<P>
 The kind of workers the Glendale program trained "is something that would be 
very valued," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such jobs may not offer luxurious living. But for at least one graduate of the 
Glendale program, it has more to offer than most hourly jobs -- even those 
coveted aerospace jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this 10 times better," said McGann, the former Lockheed worker. "I 
feel like I'm helping people. It's more satisfying -- better than putting an 
L-1011 in the air."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SEC FILES SUIT AGAINST 3 VALLEY RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Valley residents, including a former Mickey Mouse Club Mouseketeer, have 
been sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fraudulent 
stock-buying practice known as "free riding." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed in U. S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday, 
named Burbank resident Darlene Gillespie, 53, an ex-Mousketeer and registered 
nurse, as one of a trio who allegedly violated federal securities laws by 
purchasing stock in 1992 and 1993 without the means or intention of paying for 
it. Gillespie has filed for liquidation of her debts through personal 
bankruptcy in federal court, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named as a defendant is Jerry J. Fraschilla, 56, president of 
Northridge-based Pacific Southwest Corp., a real estate and financial services 
company, and a resident of Sherman Oaks at the time of the alleged SEC 
violations, according to the lawsuit. Both Fraschilla and Pacific Southwest are 
also in bankruptcy liquidation, the complaint says. He and Gillespie co-own a 
company called Top Gun Ventures, through which Gillespie controls stock 
brokerage accounts, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
 The third defendant is Fraschilla's brother-in-law, Tarzana resident Michael 
Andrews, 32, who worked for a Pacific Southwest subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the complaint, from August, 1992, through May, 1993, the 
defendants placed purchase orders to buy stock in a publicly traded company 
called Unique Mobility through five brokerage firms under margin agreements, 
meaning they borrowed money from the brokerages to pay for the trades. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defendants allegedly never paid for the stock purchases, or wrote bad 
checks for the amounts owed. In some cases, the lawsuit states, the defendants 
would place orders through a brokerage firm to purchase the shares in their 
accounts with other firms that were being liquidated after they didn't pay for 
their trades. When making the stock purchases, it says, the defendants also 
misrepresented their incomes and net worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Losses on various accounts opened by the defendants that were suffered by 
stock brokerages ranged from about $1,000 to $64,500, the complaint states. The 
brokerages include PaineWebber Inc., Advest Inc., Seidler Amdec Securities 
Inc., Oppenheimer & Co. and Kemper Securities Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC seeks a court order barring the defendants from future securities law 
violations, repayment of profits and losses avoided on the stock trades cited 
in the complaint plus interest, and other monetary penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate legal dispute involving Gillespie was settled earlier this year. 
The former Mouseketeer had sued Walt Disney Productions in Los Angeles Superior 
Court in 1990, claiming that Disney took advantage of her young age when she 
signed a contract in 1955 to perform on the Mickey Mouse Club TV show. A Walt 
Disney spokesman said the suit had been "mutually resolved and the terms are 
confidential."

VALLEY HOUSE SALES RISE, PRICES DECLINE IN APRIL; REAL ESTATE: SINGLE-FAMILY 
HOUSE SALES TOTAL 987, HIGHEST FOR APRIL IN FIVE YEARS. BUT SELLERS SUFFER AS 
THE AVERAGE HOUSE PRICE WAS $219,700, LOWEST SINCE 1987. 
</P>

<P>
 The local housing market had its busiest April in five years. But in terms of 
prices, it was the worst April in seven years -- as prices for single-family 
houses plunged to 1987 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by bargains and still-low interest rates, 987 single-family houses 
changed hands in April, up 30% from 762 houses sold in April of last year, 
according to the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-family house sales in April continued a yearlong trend of rising 
activity, and were up 44% from the 684 houses sold in March. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pickup exacted a heavy cost to sellers, as the average price of a 
single-family house sold last month was $219,700, down 16%, from $260,000 in 
April, 1993. The realty board said that was the lowest monthly average since 
April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the median price last month of a single-family house was $179,000, 
down 12% from $204,000 in April, 1993. The median price is the point at which 
half of the houses sold for more than the figure and half sold for less than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the steep drop in prices is that foreclosures in the Valley 
remain high. Properties repossessed by banks are often dumped at fire-sale 
prices. The average price is also dropping because houses with minor structural 
damage from the Northridge earthquake are being sold "as is" at a big discount, 
said Jim Link, the realty board's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, sales of condominiums, however, failed to keep pace with 
single-family houses. Condo sales totaled 128 last month, up 39% from 92 in 
March but down 17% from 155 in April, 1993. Besides being cannibalized by 
strong house sales, condo activity has slowed even more after the earthquake, 
brokers say, because many condos were toppled by the 6.8-magnitude temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of a condo sold last month was $132,400, a 9% drop from 
$144,900 in April, 1993. The median price fell 12% in April, to $115,000 from 
$130,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still very much a buyers' market," Link said, "but buyers will lose the 
upper hand as active listings fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Active listings of houses and condos, already at their lowest in many months, 
plummeted 36% in April, to 6,280 properties from 9,794 in April, 1993. The 
inventory of houses for sale usually rises as summer approaches, but 
surprisingly, last month's listings were down 4% from March listings of 6,533. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the nose dive in prices has discouraged some homeowners from putting 
their houses on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate executives were not encouraging. "Sellers must realize that this 
is where the market will remain for sometime," said Link, although he added 
that he expected prices to stabilize and perhaps even to rise slightly soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Link and real estate brokers say they expect the pickup in activity to 
continue through the summer. The realty board said that in April pending sales, 
or the number of escrows opened, stood at 1,097. That was up 27% from 862 a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley realty group, the largest in California, has 7,800 members from 
North Hollywood to Calabasas. Its figures generally do not include sales of new 
homes.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: OXNARD OUTLET MALL WILL DOUBLE SIZE SOON AFTER OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A factory outlet mall scheduled to open in Oxnard next month has been so 
successful in attracting tenants that it plans to double its size by breaking 
ground on a second phase within 60 days, an official of the project reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Factory Outlet, just off the Ventura Freeway between Rice and Rose 
avenues, has already leased 90% of its 48 stores to such well-known tenants as 
Benetton, Fila, Geoffrey Beene, The Gap and Bugle Boy, according to Keith 
Kennon, a partner in the center's developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to build another 45 units on adjoining property," he said. "We 
hope to have the second phase open in time for Christmas." The initial center 
will hold its grand opening June 10, 11 and 12, he said. Kennon is a principal 
in US Outlets of California Inc., which is building the center as a joint 
venture with Fru-Con Development Inc., a St. Louis firm that specializes in 
financing outlet malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants of such centers are mainly clothing manufacturers that sell their own 
products at discount prices. The initial phase of Oxnard Factory Outlet 
contains 150,000 square feet of retail space and was built at a cost of $16 
million. The proposed expansion, which has already been approved by planning 
officials, would double the space, Kennon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard project won a race with a potential rival that has been proposed in 
Camarillo. The latter hasn't yet been built.

 Residential projects in the first quarter amounted to $74.1 million, up 54% 
from a year earlier, while commercial and industrial construction totaled $49.3 
million, up 26%. 
</P>
<P>
 And the California Assn. of Realtors says sales of existing single-family 
houses in the county during March more than doubled the year-earlier level, 
rising 110%. 
</P>

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: 2 LOCAL FIRMS TO INSTALL SOLAR-RUN PHONE SWITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Ventura County firms -- Siemens Solar Industries and GTE California -- 
have joined in installing North America's first solar-powered telephone routing 
switch. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit, called a digital loop carrier, will bring phone service to a remote 
cluster of 20 homes in San Bernardino County.The community has no commercial 
electrical service and no available telephone lines. A solar, or photovoltaic, 
unit was chosen to power the switch because it would have been too costly to 
run electrical and telephone lines to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Siemens Solar, based in Camarillo, provided the solar cells used in a special 
switch produced by a sister company, Siemens Stromberg-Carlson. GTE California, 
based in Thousand Oaks, said it is considering solar-powered switches as "an 
ideal solution" for meeting rural customers' needs.

SOUTHWEST LIFTING AIRPORT'S BUSINESS; BURBANK FACILITY'S ONCE-SAGGING TRAFFIC, 
REVENUE ARE TAKING OFF, LED BY THE AIRLINE'S RECENT BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines' money-making operations have put the rest of the troubled 
airline industry to shame. But Burbank Airport couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the no-frills, low-cost shuttle operator, which began service at 
Burbank four years ago, the airport's once-declining traffic has boomed and its 
revenues are at a record high. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest started at Burbank Airport with 16 daily round-trip flights to 
Oakland and Las Vegas, and that's since grown to 48 flights a day to five 
cities -- more than any of the other half-dozen carriers left at Burbank. Last 
year about 2.7 million people flew Southwest at Burbank, accounting for nearly 
two out of every three passengers at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Burbank Airport's passenger count totaled 4.3 million in 1993, up 60% 
from 1989 -- a higher percentage increase than any other commercial airport in 
the Los Angeles area. Southwest's traffic has helped fill up Burbank Airport's 
parking spaces and boosted sales of hot dogs and beer, as well as the landing 
fees the airport gets from airlines every time their planes touch down at 
Burbank. As a result, the airport's revenue was $21 million in its fiscal year 
that ended June 30, 1993 -- up from about $15 million four years earlier -- and 
revenue is up again this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, this boom came during the state's recession. "I can only fathom 
what would have happened if we had been in a bullish economy," said Thomas 
Greer, executive director of the airport, formally known as the 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer's glee, though, is tempered by the fact that there are risks in relying 
too much on one customer. For 30 years Burbank Airport depended heavily on PSA, 
like Southwest, a commuter airline. But in 1987, amid the turbulent era of 
deregulation and fare wars, USAir bought PSA and then began to retrench at 
Burbank Airport, beginning a slowdown at Burbank that only stopped with 
Southwest's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying so much on one airline could make it tougher for Burbank Airport to 
get bond financing for its long-delayed $200-million project to build a bigger 
terminal. "If you're in the hands of a single airliner, it does make you a 
little nervous," said Dick Mudge, president of Apogee Research, a Maryland firm 
that consults on airport economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Greer isn't worried. Though Southwest won't comment, Greer thinks the 
carrier is more likely to expand than contract at Burbank. The Dallas-based 
company is the industry's most profitable airline, last year having earned $154 
million on revenue of $2.3 billion. And in its 23-year history, Southwest has 
pulled out of only two airports -- Beaumont, Tex., because of a lack of 
traffic, and Denver's Stapleton because weather delays were expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if Southwest abandoned Burbank, Greer is betting that some other 
carrier would take its place. Burbank Airport is easier to get in and out of 
than Los Angeles International Airport, Greer says, and there are 2.5 million 
people who live within a 15-mile radius of the 64-year-old Burbank Airport. 
"The market is there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. But it took a low-cost airline like Southwest to tap that market. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Gill, Burbank Airport's public relations director, vividly recalls 
Southwest's inaugural flight to Oakland on April 16, 1990. The mood was festive 
inside Southwest's familiar burnt-orange Boeing 737, as Southwest Chairman Herb 
Kelleher, dressed in the airline's new beige uniform, passed out bags of 
peanuts to a full aircraft. But what Gill remembers most was Southwest's fare: 
$59 for an unrestricted one-way ticket to Oakland, compared with $180 for other 
airlines then serving that route. "That was a clear indicator of what was going 
to happen," Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight, demand for travel surged at Burbank from passengers like Michael 
Ernst, a Fremont businessman who says he doubled his trips between Oakland and 
Burbank, to twice a month, after Southwest arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pay half as much so I can fly twice as much," he said. Ernst also likes it 
that Southwest has 13 daily shuttles from Burbank to Oakland, and his 
unrestricted ticket (now $69 one-way) allows him to take any one of them if 
seats are open. "If I finish a meeting early, I can hop an earlier flight," he 
said on a recent afternoon at Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's arrival at Burbank forced other carriers to slash their prices. 
But the pressure was too much for some airlines. In May, 1991, USAir withdrew 
completely from Burbank, giving up its 15 flights and the Northern California 
market to Southwest. "It was strictly economics," says Bryan Enarson, USAir's 
director of airport affairs. USAir is loaded with the highest operating costs 
of any major U. S. carrier. "Routes from Burbank weren't profitable," Enarson 
said. "And Southwest just continued that effect." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Delta, another major carrier that is now in the process of laying off 15,000 
employees, abandoned Burbank Airport last year, and others have slimmed down 
since Southwest muscled in. American Airlines dropped all six of its flights 
from Burbank to San Jose, United Airlines halted flights to Oakland, and 
America West reduced the number of shuttles to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some disadvantages versus Southwest," admitted Joe Hopkins, a 
spokesman for United, currently the second-largest carrier at Burbank Airport 
with 12 daily flights to its two major hubs, San Francisco and Denver. 
"Southwest has had an impact on our business." 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest, the nation's eighth-largest carrier, makes money where its rivals 
can't because of its low operating costs. A Southwest pilot, for example, flies 
70 hours a month versus 50 hours for a United pilot, and Southwest uses fewer 
employees per aircraft, while carrying more passengers, according to a recent 
Commercial Aviation Report. 
</P>
<P>
 By specializing in short haul flights, Southwest avoids the huge expense of 
maintaining expensive hub systems, and keeps its planes in the air more often 
because it has few connecting flights. Southwest doesn't serve meals and gives 
no advanced seating assignments. In the 1990s, Southwest has been the only 
major American airline to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, Southwest flies out of eight airports, including LAX, 
and it is the dominant carrier at Ontario Airport, with about 40% of the market 
there. Later this month, the airline will begin service at John Wayne Airport 
in Orange County, with 15 daily flights to Oakland and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's start-up at John Wayne could cut into some of Burbank Airport's 
business, just as Burbank has lured travelers from LAX through Southwest's 
cut-rate fares. From 1989 to 1993, as Burbank Airport's passengers surged by 
60%, or 1.6 million people, in that same period, the number of LAX's domestic 
passengers remained flat. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other markets Southwest has entered, Burbank Airport has seen a surge in 
demand for leisure travel. Jerry Hernandez of Santa Paula says that he had 
always driven five hours across the desert to visit Las Vegas. But on a recent 
afternoon, Hernandez was waiting for a Southwest flight to Las Vegas at Burbank 
Airport. Why? A round-trip ticket to Las Vegas for $65 under a Southwest 
special two-for-one deal. "It just makes more sense," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest won't talk about future plans at Burbank, but airport officials hope 
the airline will soon add flights to Tucson, Albuquerque and Salt Lake City. 
Last year Southwest bought Salt Lake City-based Morris Air, another low-cost 
carrier, giving it entry into the Pacific Northwest market. "Who knows where 
else we'll open up?" says Robin Cobb, Southwest's station manager at Burbank 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's reticence makes Robert Garcin, president of the Burbank Airport 
Authority, which owns the airport, a bit uneasy, given that so much is riding 
with Southwest, including plans to build a new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcin and other airport officials have long dreamed about a new terminal 
building that would replace the current one that, under new federal standards, 
is too close to the runways. But concerns about airport noise and contamination 
on a proposed site have stalled the project. Airport officials still say the 
terminal will be opened in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The new terminal will probably cost at least $200 million. The airport now has 
about $20 million in cash, but the bulk of the funding is expected to come from 
a revenue bond issue. And that will depend on Burbank Airport's ability to 
generate sufficient passenger traffic and revenue, which will be boosted this 
fall when the airport will probably start imposing a $3 "passenger facility 
charge" on airline tickets of all outbound passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcin worries that the airport's reliance on Southwest could backfire when it 
comes to issuing bonds. "If I were a bond buyer, I'd like to have more than one 
carrier," he says. "We've put an awful lot of eggs in one basket, and it's a 
problem we'll have to face." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, Burbank has little choice. Garcin and others at the airport have 
been trying hard to woo new carriers to Burbank and encourage others already at 
the airport to expand. But with most other airlines struggling and afraid to go 
head to head with Southwest, airport officials admit they're not having much 
luck. The one carrier that Burbank Airport was close to attracting was Morris 
Air, but then Southwest bought it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expansion at Burbank isn't in the cards," said Al Becker, a spokesman at 
American Airlines, which is down to just three daily flights from Burbank, all 
of them to its major hub in Dallas. "It's perfectly understandable that Burbank 
Airport wants diversification," he said. "But there's just no way we can 
compete" with Southwest for the California market. 
</P>
<P>
 Other rivals, including United, Delta and Continental, are trying to launch 
low-cost, short-haul clones of Southwest. But it's far from clear when and 
whether they would be able to challenge Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer, the airport's director, says he wishes Burbank had more competition. 
"Yes, it bothers me that Southwest dominates the airport," he said, only to 
quickly add: "But it is Southwest. If we're going to have a dominant player, 
we're lucky we have the one that's making money." BURBANK AIRPORT'S GROWTH 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inaugural flight at Burbank Airport in April, 1990, Southwest 
Airlines has become the dominant carrier at this regional airport. In four 
years the profitable, low-cost, shuttle operator has quadrupled its passenger 
traffic at Burbank to more than 2.7 million. Southwest's success at Burbank has 
filled up the airport's parking spaces and concession stands, and has meant 
more fees that Burbank Airport gets from airlines every time they land, all of 
which has helped lift the airport's once-flagging revenues to a record high.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: INCOMNET REPORTS $598,945 QUARTERLY PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Incomnet Inc., a Woodland Hills telecommunications company, reported a profit 
of $598,945 for the first quarter that ended March 31, rebounding from a loss 
of $1.1 million in the same period a year earlier. The profit was on a record 
first-quarter revenue of $7.89 million, an increase of more than sixfold from 
$1.21 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the surge to a turnaround in National Telephone & 
Communications (NTC), a subsidiary it acquired two years ago. NTC buys excess 
capacity on fiber-optic cable lines in bulk from major telephone companies. It 
then sells the phone capacity at discount prices to customers through a network 
of independent sales people, most of whom work from home. This sales system, 
introduced during the last six months, has doubled the number of NTC customers 
to 100,000, the company said.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: 1ST-QUARTER EARNINGS RISE 8% FOR PINKERTON'S INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pinkerton's Inc., an Encino provider of security services under the Pinkerton 
Security & Investigation Services name, reported an 8% increase in 
first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the $1.33-million profit in the quarter that ended March 25 included 
a net, after-tax gain of $1.3 million from the settlement of lawsuits, 
Pinkerton's said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the gain, start-up costs of new accounts and additional expenses to 
expand its security force for General Motors Corp. reduced profits in the 
quarter, the company said. Profit margins were also hurt by price competition, 
the company said, which limited its ability to raise prices to offset higher 
insurance and payroll tax costs. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Pinkerton's earned $1.23 million. The company's revenue in the 
latest quarter was $191.5 million, up 17% from $164.3 million in revenue the 
previous year.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MEDICAL PROPERTIES INC. REPORTS DEEPER LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Medical Properties Inc., an Encino real estate investment trust, said its 
fourth-quarter loss widened to $4 million, from a loss of $743,000 in the same 
period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the big loss in the quarter ended March 31 was due mainly to 
the write-down of $2.4 million in property values to their estimated actual 
values, plus an $800,000 provision for additional reassessment of a medical 
building in La Mirada by Los Angeles County.Revenue for the fourth quarter was 
up 55%, to $289,000 from $186,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of 1993, Medical Properties' loss tripled to $10.6 million mainly 
because of a write-down of $7.4 million in property values. Revenue for 1993 
totaled $1.19 million, up from $557,000 in the prior year.

L.A. COUNTY RECORD WORST IN HIV DETECTION PROGRAM; AIDS: RESULTS ARE THE LOWEST 
AMONG SEVEN URBAN AREAS GIVEN FEDERAL AID. HEALTH OFFICIALS CHALLENGE 
COMPARISONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County counseling and testing program for the AIDS virus 
requires more money per test and turns up a lower percentage of cases of HIV 
infection than other such programs in the country funded by the federal Centers 
for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures obtained by The Times from the CDC, which pays for most of the 
county's HIV counseling and testing program, show the county had the worst 
record of identifying HIV cases among the seven major urban centers receiving 
special CDC funding grants during 1992, the last full year for which results 
are available. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, New York City, which established the highest rate for finding 
cases of HIV infection, conducted 46,564 HIV tests during 1992, compared to 
25,779 for Los Angeles County. New York identified 2,971 HIV positives, in 
contrast to 345 for the county -- a "hit" rate of 6.4% versus 1.3%. New York 
achieved its results on a grant of $4.9 million; Los Angeles County received 
$4.5 million, according to the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Houston, which received about one-third as much money as Los Angeles 
County did in the same year, performed 25% more tests and identified three 
times as many cases of infection, according to the CDC figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, where non-county health agencies receive a flat $35 from the state to 
do HIV tests, there are also sharp differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Full-year statistics are not available for 1993, but a partial-year analysis 
prepared for the county's HIV Health Services and Planning Council showed that 
the city of Long Beach, which has its own public health department, was 
discovering infections at a rate significantly higher than the county's -- 
2.07% compared to 1.3% -- at a much lower cost: $414,000 over a nine-month 
period for Long Beach compared to $2.2 million over an eight-month period for 
the county. Even though Long Beach spent substantially less and serves a much 
smaller geographic area than the county program, it conducted more tests -- 
8,646 compared to 8,619. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Community Services Center conducts 
about 1,000 tests a month and reports HIV-positive results about 9% of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health officials complain that such comparisons are 
simplistic and do not take into consideration the population the county deals 
with or the far-flung regions it must serve in the 4,000-square-mile region. 
They say the costs of their testing and counseling program are pushed up by the 
need to serve a wide-ranging clientele who are at high risk for infection but 
who often balk at taking the test when approached at county health centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say that broad target population is part of the problem. The 
county, they contend, should concentrate primarily on those at high risk for 
HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
 The county "isn't getting results," complained Michael Weinstein, president of 
the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and the spearhead of criticism of the county's 
testing program for the human immunodeficiency virus. "That's a tragedy because 
half the people in this county who are HIV-infected don't know it. To break the 
chain of infection, you need to find the infected person, get them into 
treatment, and educate them about safer sexual practices." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Weinstein and other members of the fiscal committee of the HIV 
planning council voted to recommend that the county be asked to take $1 million 
of its testing money and use it to give anonymous tests, which are considered 
less expensive and more likely to turn up positive results than the 
confidential tests the county currently gives. 
</P>
<P>
 Under confidential testing, the identity of the person receiving the test is 
known and the test results become a permanent part of his or her health record. 
County health authorities vow that they keep the results a strictly private 
matter between them and the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Anonymous tests are considered far more attractive to people who believe they 
may be infected because they do not carry a risk of harmful repercussions, such 
as the loss of a job or health insurance. It is generally acknowledged that 
anonymous tests consistently turn up higher rates of positives than 
confidential tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Another recommendation by the planning council committee was that the county 
spend $35 per test, the same rate that other agencies receive from the state 
Department of Health Services for giving the HIV test, along with pre- and 
post-test counseling. The study undertaken for the HIV planning council 
disclosed that during the first eight months of 1993, the cost per HIV test at 
county health centers ranged from $77 to $300, depending on how many tests were 
performed by each clinic and how many hours were being spent by the staff doing 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can't do it for $35, then they should give the money to someone who 
can," said Steve Toth, an administrator with a private AIDS program in Long 
Beach and a member of the fiscal committee who voted for the change with 
Weinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the fact that Los Angeles County has the second-highest number of HIV 
and AIDS cases in the country, trailing only New York City, and the relative 
success of other programs, Toth said the county's test results "suggest to me 
they are testing the wrong population." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed by his critics, John Schunhoff, director of AIDS Programs for the 
county, recently released a lengthy defense of the HIV testing program, 
stressing that it targeted people who come to public clinics for treatment of 
tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases or prenatal counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Schunhoff said many hours are devoted to AIDS education and counseling that 
never turn up in test results, but that it was important to continue trying to 
reach groups of people who ordinarily would not get an HIV test. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that the county spends more than other programs on HIV testing 
because county clinics already are understaffed and the large CDC grant was 
necessary "to staff all clinics and offer HIV testing." Without the money, 
Schunhoff warned, the clinics might be forced to stop offering HIV counseling 
and testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gary Richwald, chief of the county's program on sexually transmitted 
diseases, said that a "hit" rate of 1% sounded low, but actually was 
respectable considering that the county numbers were generated from a group of 
people who were not likely to walk in off the street for an HIV test, as was 
the case in community clinics. Many of the people who tested positive for HIV 
initially turned up at the county clinic because they were suffering from 
syphilis or some other sexually transmitted disease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At our sexually transmitted disease clinics, we are treating the poorest of 
the poor. Our clinics are the clinics of last resort. When they come in we have 
a lot to talk about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richwald said it is crucial for county health authorities to be able to 
continue conducting confidential tests because knowing a person's HIV status is 
critical in deciding a course of treatment for a person suffering from other 
diseases, such as syphilis. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ron Valdiserri, the deputy director of the CDC's division of sexually 
transmitted diseases and HIV prevention, said the federal agency had no 
performance measurement on its grants for HIV testing and counseling. No 
guidelines exist on how many tests were to be administered, at what price, or 
how many HIV-infected people the health agencies were expected to find with the 
millions in federal dollars they receive, Valdiserri said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that all seven cities were given the same basic contract, or 
blueprint, on how they were to run their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend that one reason for the county's low rate for detecting 
infected people is that it is not testing in the right places. Valdiserri said 
that health departments receiving the grants were directed to provide the tests 
"at sites where (health workers) are likely to encounter individuals at risk 
for HIV infection." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he had no problem with the county's approach of testing at clinics 
that did prenatal counseling or saw patients for sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the (county's) counseling served a risk reduction or health education 
purpose," he said, "then the money was not wasted." Test Results 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control provided health agencies in 
seven target metropolitan areas with special cash grants to test for the AIDS 
virus. One source estimates that there are 25,000 people in Los Angeles County 
infected with the human acquired immunodeficiency virus who don't know it. Here 
are the results, showing the number of tests given and how many of the subjects 
tested positive for the virus. 04,23,08,11,14 LOCATION TESTS POSITIVES CDC

WILSON, EDUCATION AIDE ASK REVIEW OF CLAS EXAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL and CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adding a big new voice to the spreading controversy over the California 
Learning Assessment System, the Wilson Administration has called for an 
independent review and a financial audit of the pioneering exams, which the 
governor's education adviser said were "seriously flawed." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can no longer wait for the Department of Education to act on its own to 
resolve the public's concern and restore confidence to the CLAS exam," Maureen 
DiMarco, Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary for child development and education, said 
in a statement released late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the CLAS tests, Wilson said: "It appears that the execution of 
this good idea has been disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
 His letter to Auditor General Kurt Sjoberg asked that the review pay 
"particular attention" to the procedures used to develop the test questions and 
to the process used by the education department in selecting a private 
contractor to handle exam administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, the California Teachers Assn., the state's largest 
teachers union and an early supporter of CLAS, also blasted the State 
Department of Education's handling of the system. CTA President Del Weber on 
Sunday called for the exams to be suspended until a full review by a panel of 
teachers, parents and other concerned citizens can be conducted. On Monday, the 
Senate Rules Committee set up procedures for legislators to begin reviewing the 
tests later this week. Like other standardized exams, the CLAS tests are kept 
confidential to protect their fairness and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's top education department official defended the tests and said he 
welcomes the audit. But he also hinted that DiMarco was using the controversy 
to further her campaign for state superintendent of public instruction in the 
June 7 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and DiMarco have been strong supporters of CLAS, which is scheduled to 
be phased in over several years. But all along they have called for the 
inclusion of more traditional approaches, such as multiple-choice questions. 
They sought less emphasis on the open-ended, "performance-based" items that 
have brought the new system praise from education reformers, testing experts 
and business leaders -- but criticism from others. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old system of tests, currently being used statewide for public 
school students in grades four, five, eight and 10, were first attacked last 
year by religious conservatives, who contended that the reading and writing 
portions of the exams are anti-religion, anti-family values and invasive of 
students' privacy by improperly asking questions that touch on personal or 
family experiences and views. 
</P>
<P>
 The organized campaign against the tests, which attempt to assess higher-level 
thinking skills by asking students to write about their reactions to literature 
selections, picked up steam after controversies developed over scoring and 
implementation. As more school board members began privately reviewing the 
tests in response to the furor, the controversy mushroomed, especially over 
questions on the eighth- and 10th-grade reading and writing tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the uproar has centered on whether questions pry into students' 
beliefs or practices about family life, sex, morality or religious aspects of 
students' private lives and whether the tests should require parent permission. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, who has not seen the exams, said her concerns go beyond issues of 
privacy. After speaking with "numerous" school board members who have seen the 
tests, DiMarco said, she became worried that the tests may further racial or 
ethnic stereotypes. She said she has heard complaints that some passages were 
"questionable as sexist or portraying handicaps in a stereotypical manner." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have major concerns about the questions that appear on the eighth- and 
10th-grade language arts exams, and I seriously question whether the items 
actually measure the skills CLAS was designed to test," DiMarco wrote in a memo 
to the governor over the weekend. She requested an audit of how the Department 
of Education spent the almost $28 million allotted for test development and 
administration, as well as a review of the tests by an independent panel made 
up of "parents and other parties who are legitimately concerned" about test 
content. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco said Monday that her office has been "trying to get the department to 
fix this and restore the system to credibility, and they have refused." 
</P>
<P>
 At a Sacramento news conference, William D. Dawson, acting state 
superintendent, said he is supportive of an independent examination of the test 
items and welcomes refinements. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the remarks by the CTA, Wilson and DiMarco are "much too hot for 
the interests of schools and kids" and play into the hands of test opponents. 
He described opponents as "very conservative individuals and organizations who 
are using extraordinary myths, and in some cases outright lies, about what is 
on the test and basically stampeding others." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson said he would have preferred DiMarco to have used a "more measured and 
problem-solving tone. (But) this is a time of the making of strong statements 
for election purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco denied that her criticisms are electioneering. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson also insisted that although the Wilson Administration, school boards, 
the CTA and others have criticized the CLAS process, they have continued to 
support the system's basic goals and direction.

EASING OF SMOKING BANS SUBMITTED FOR BALLOT; ELECTIONS: PHILIP MORRIS PUSHES 
FOR A STATE STANDARD TO REPLACE LOCAL LAWS. LATE SURGE OF INITIATIVES IS A 
SURPRISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tobacco giant Philip Morris announced Monday that it has gathered enough 
signatures to place an initiative on California's November ballot to abolish 
all local smoking bans and replace them with looser statewide standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement raised the prospect of as many as five highly charged, 
petition-generated propositions going before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 With the deadline approaching for getting measures qualified for the November 
ballot, supporters of a plan to attack all forms of public funding for illegal 
immigrants say they will turn in their signatures next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Others measures that have qualified or appear to be headed for the same ballot 
include the "three strikes and you're out" criminal justice sentencing plan, an 
overhaul of the health insurance system and a 4% sales tax on gasoline to pay 
for mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 The late surge in initiatives comes as something of a surprise. Early in the 
year, consultants involved in the initiative business believed that only the 
"three strikes" and gasoline tax proposals would be on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Philip Morris quietly funded its signature-gathering campaign, while 
backers of the health insurance overhaul mounted a massive volunteer effort, 
supplemented at the end by paid gatherers and supported by organized labor. At 
the same time, proponents of the immigration measure mounted their largely 
volunteer effort. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Los Angeles news conference Monday, Ellen Merlo, a vice president for 
Philip Morris U.S.A., said the cigarette manufacturer's paid petition effort 
obtained 607,000 signatures of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Those names will be submitted to county registrars of voters. Officials have 
until June 30 to verify that the initiative has the requisite 424,000 valid 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people claimed they were misled by signature gatherers in the costly 
and sophisticated petition drive. Many complained that they thought they were 
signing a petition to ban smoking, when in fact it is a measure backed by the 
tobacco industry to knock down tougher local laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller issued warnings to the proponents and is 
continuing to investigate some of the complaints. But Miller said he doubts 
that the drive was so flawed that it will be deemed invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said a bigger problem may be time. He had directed initiative 
proponents to submit their signatures by April 22 to give his office and the 
counties time to count the signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying it can't be done, but it is marginal," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no other cigarette manufacturer has joined the campaign. But Philip 
Morris, the nation's largest cigarette maker, spent $491,000 on the effort to 
get the measure on the ballot, Merlo said. The campaign is certain to cost 
millions of dollars, but she said Philip Morris has not decided how much to 
spend. The measure is also being backed by some bar, hotel and restaurant 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative's goal is to abolish local anti-smoking ordinances, replacing 
them with a statewide standard that would, for example, allow smoking in 25% of 
a restaurant's seating area. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the initiative, restaurants and other businesses would have to meet 
certain ventilation standards in order to permit smoking. Health groups note, 
however, that those standards are not designed to counter the ill effects of 
secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an initiative that really does address the preferences and the rights 
of all Californians," said Merlo, who came to Los Angeles from Philip Morris' 
New York headquarters. "There are some people who do find tobacco objectionable 
and I do believe this initiative does address their concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicholl, the political consultant for health groups opposing the tobacco 
initiative, repeated his charge that petition gatherers tricked people into 
signing the measure by telling them that it was designed to restrict smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to even have a chance, they'll need to spend tens of millions," 
Nicholl said. "They'll have to so brainwash the public. I don't see how they 
can win it if we do an aggressive job of getting out the lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Other measures that may make it onto the November ballot include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The immigration measure, backed by Howard Ezell, a former Immigration and 
Naturalization Service official. 
</P>
<P>
 He said backers had obtained 560,000 signatures, but want to gather another 
100,000 this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative seeks to cut all public funding for illegal immigrants and 
would require local law enforcement agencies to help the INS in the effort to 
find and deport illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In its most controversial provision, the measure would require schools to 
verify the immigration status of pupils and expel students whose parents cannot 
prove their legal status. Schools also would be required to report to law 
enforcement agencies the names of parents they believe are in the country 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 * The health care initiative, which would scrap the current health care system 
and replace it with one administered by the state. To finance the universal 
health care coverage, the health care measure envisions increases in business 
payroll taxes, personal income taxes, and a $1-a-pack tax added to cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 4% gasoline sales tax. Sponsored by the Planning and Conservation 
League, the tax would fund various mass transit and earthquake retrofitting 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * The one citizen-generated initiative already certified by the secretary of 
state for the November ballot is the "three strikes" proposition, which would 
impose sentences of 25 years to life for criminals who commit a third felony 
after having committed two prior serious or violent felonies. The initiative 
mirrors a law passed by the Legislature and signed into law earlier this year.

JUDGE DROPS GATES FROM KING LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major setback to Rodney G. King's lawsuit seeking punitive damages, a 
federal judge Monday dismissed former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates 
as a defendant, saying King's lawyers had failed to show that Gates was 
directly accountable for the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad management is not enough," U.S. District Judge John G. Davies said. 
"Allowing racism is not enough. Poor supervision is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision stunned King's attorneys, who attempted to paint Gates as the man 
who tolerated and at times rewarded officers who used excessive force -- 
particularly against minorities. With the police chief removed from financial 
liability, King lost his most visible and evidently wealthiest defendant in 
this phase of the trial. Earlier, King was awarded $3.8 million from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest chapter in the legal legacy of the King case did little to resolve 
the question of who ultimately should be held accountable for one of the 
nation's most infamous police beatings. Officers have said they were merely 
following department procedures during the incident. The dismissal of Gates 
from the suit removed the only high-ranking city official who had been legally 
called to answer for those policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel vindicated," Gates told reporters at a news conference at the radio 
station where he formerly hosted a talk show after resigning from office in 
1992. "This is a nonsense case. This is a case of vengeance on the part of 
(King's attorneys)." 
</P>
<P>
 But John Burris, one of King's lawyers, criticized Davies' decision. "The 
judge made a mistake," he told reporters, adding that King may now have grounds 
for an appeal. Burris conceded that Davies' ruling was a blow to King's case -- 
not just to the prospect of winning significant punitive damages but on the 
larger issue of who the public can hold responsible in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our objectives was to send a message that chiefs can be held 
accountable for the conduct of their officers," Burris said. "Without Gates, 
that objective will not be attained." 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorneys noted that Monday's decision to remove Gates from the case 
was consistent with one of Davies' earlier, controversial rulings in the 
criminal case arising out of the King beating. The judge, in reducing the 
sentences for convicted former LAPD officers Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. 
Koon last year, found that King bore some of the responsibility for the 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of establishing Gates' linkage to the beating, Burris said: "We went 
out hunting for elephants and ended up with squirrels." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies on Monday also dropped from the lawsuit four officers who were 
bystanders at the March 3, 1991, beating, ruling that their roles were too 
minor to make them liable for punitive damages. In addition to Gates, Davies 
dismissed Robert Simpach, Ingrid Larsen-Braun, Joseph Napolitano and David 
Love, the only black Los Angeles police officer at the scene. A series of such 
decisions has whittled down the 15 original defendants to six in the second 
phase of King's civil trial to determine whether individual defendants should 
pay punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, the decision prompted a celebration among those 
officers who had been extricated from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen-Braun rushed to a phone to call her family and give them the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just really happy to be out of it," she said later. "This is a good day. 
I'm very happy and I wish luck to the officers still involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Don Vincent, who represents Gates and the officers, said 
Davies' decision was correct. "I think it will show the jury . . . they haven't 
got that strong a case against those remaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies refused to drop Powell and Koon, the two former officers who were key 
figures in the beating. Both are serving 30-month prison terms for violating 
King's civil rights. The judge also kept as defendants fired Officer Timothy E. 
Wind, suspended Officer Theodore J. Briseno, Officer Rolando Solano, who was 
involved in the handcuffing of King that night, and Officer Louis Turriaga, who 
put his foot on King. 
</P>
<P>
 In making his decision to drop the former police chief, Davies said King's 
attorneys had failed to prove that Gates acted out of malice. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also questioned the use of the Christopher Commission report to show 
that Gates was accountable. The commission, a panel appointed after King's 
beating, was headed by Warren Christopher, then a private attorney and now U.S. 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plaintiffs have failed to prove that Mr. Gates acted maliciously or out 
of spite or was callously indifferent to the rights and safety of others," 
Davies said. "The Christopher Commission report is silent on the issues here." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's report criticized the LAPD for racism, sexism and excessive 
use of force, and called on Gates to begin a transition to new leadership. But 
Davies found that those criticisms fell short of showing Gates was personally 
culpable in King's beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates' 43-year law enforcement career ended with his 1992 resignation after 
criticism over the King case and the riots that followed the acquittals of four 
officers on state charges stemming from the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 On the stand, Gates repeated his view that the beating was an "aberration" and 
insisted that he never tolerated the use of excessive force by officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized clearly this was an incident that could be misinterpreted by the 
public, that this would be a great media event, and the department would be in 
crisis and these officers would be part of that crisis," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite aggressive questioning by King's attorney, Gates put on a strong 
defense of his 14-year tenure in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gates was very polished and prepared," said Loyola University law professor 
Laurie Levinson, who observed the testimony. "There weren't many points scored 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Before resting their case Friday, attorneys for King called a former deputy 
police chief who placed the blame for the beating on Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, Chief Gates' actions created an organizational environment 
that could make an incident like the Rodney King beating likely to happen," 
said Louis Reiter, who retired from the department in 1981 and is now a police 
consultant.

IT'S A 'NEW ERA,' SAYS OFFICIALLY ELECTED MANDELA; SOUTH AFRICA: PRESIDENT IS 
CHOSEN UNANIMOUSLY BY NATION'S FIRST ALL-RACE PARLIAMENT. AFTERWARD, HE 
ADDRESSES THOUSANDS OF WILDLY CHEERING SUPPORTERS.

<P>
 Nelson Mandela brought three centuries of bitter white rule to a dramatic 
close Monday, here in the colonial city where it all began, when he was 
unanimously elected South Africa's first black president by its first all-race 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we are entering a new era," he told a wildly cheering crowd outside 
City Hall. He spoke from the same balcony where he addressed the world four 
years ago after his release from more than a quarter of a century in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Desmond Tutu, the Anglican archbishop and Nobel laureate, 
appeared beside him with a smile as dazzling as his bright magenta cassock. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, Tutu was less restrained. "We are free today!" he shouted 
gleefully, waving his arms to the tens of thousands who packed the Grand 
Parade. "We are free today! All of us, black and white together!" 
</P>
<P>
 This historic day, which will be followed today by the formal inauguration in 
Pretoria, began with an emotional swearing-in ceremony for the 400 new 
legislators. They convened in what was once the inner sanctum of apartheid: the 
great hall of Parliament, where a handful of whites enshrined racism and hatred 
into law. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening prayer paraphrased another hero of black liberation, Abraham 
Lincoln: "For the first time in history, we have a government of the people, by 
the people and for the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing President Frederik W. de Klerk, Africa's last white ruler, showed 
Mandela to De Klerk's old green leather seat in the government front bench. It 
was from there that De Klerk rose in February, 1990, to repudiate apartheid and 
announce the reforms that freed Mandela and legalized his African National 
Congress and other black opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela walked slowly down the benches, shaking hands and smiling. Then, in a 
show of reconciliation, he beamed broadly and crossed the floor to embrace his 
most bitter black rival, Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi. The room 
erupted in applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the oath of office. Mandela, his estranged wife, Winnie, his new 
deputy president, Thabo Mbeki, and seven other senior members of the ANC were 
in the first group called to raise their right hands and swear allegiance to 
what long seemed an impossible dream: a democratic South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to sign the oath were De Klerk and nine of his National Party ministers 
and deputies. De Klerk, 58, now becomes the second deputy president; six of his 
followers have been named to the new coalition Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the rest: former ANC guerrillas, political prisoners and exiles, 
current political rivals and aspirants, as well as many of the whites who once 
passed the legal rules of racial oppression -- and later renounced them. 
</P>
<P>
 They changed the color and face of South Africa's power elite in just over an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Albertina Sisulu, wife of 80-year-old Walter Sisulu, who first brought Mandela 
into the ANC and who suffered beside Mandela for most of his 27 years as a 
political prisoner, next rose to offer Mandela's name in nomination. Cyril 
Ramaphosa, the ANC general secretary, offered the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Up at the podium, Chief Justice Michael Corbett paused in his black robes as 
the chamber grew silent. "Only one candidate has been nominated, Nelson 
Rolihlahla Mandela," he intoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he paused again. "I hereby declare Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela duly elected 
president of the Republic of South Africa on behalf . . . " He was cut off as 
every member of Parliament and hundreds of guests rose in a deafening roar of 
cheers and applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "On behalf of all the members present, I congratulate you, sir, on being 
elected president of the Republic of South Africa," Corbett finally finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, 75 and silver-haired, looked dapper as he acknowledged the honor in a 
gray striped suit with a white carnation in the left lapel. 
</P>
<P>
 Another honor came from a traditional bare-chested imbongi, or praise singer, 
from Mandela's Tembu tribe. Wearing animal skins and waving a long whisk, he 
bellowed a chant that recalled Mandela's life: from herd boy to political 
prisoner to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The story had special poignancy here, beside the Cape of Good Hope, in the 
port where Dutch sailors founded the first white settlement in 1652 and began 
the European colonization of southern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rest of Africa shed the yoke of white rule and colonialism, 
especially after World War II. But the Afrikaners here, as descendants of those 
early settlers are called, moved the other way. Starting in 1948, with the 
election of the first National Party government, they systematically imposed 
Draconian laws to enshrine white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 They used the whites-only Parliament to ban interracial mixing in schools, 
hospitals, neighborhoods and marriage. They forced families apart, bulldozed 
black homes from white areas and forced millions at gunpoint to desolate, 
reservation-like homelands in a vain attempt to separate the races. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the end, they used a ruthless police-state apparatus to oppress tens 
of millions of people, strictly regulating their lives on the basis of the 
kinkiness of their hair, the width of their noses and the shade of their skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the colonialists before them, the Afrikaners imprisoned their enemies on 
Robben Island, a notorious penal colony seven miles off Cape Town in the 
shark-infested waters of Table Bay. Its hazy outline was visible Monday even as 
Mandela spoke at City Hall, calling it "a dungeon built to stifle the spirit of 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 "For three centuries, that island was seen as a place to which outcasts could 
be banished," Mandela said. "The names of those who were incarcerated on Robben 
Island is a roll call of resistance fighters and democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Ending that infamy and that struggle was what Monday was all about. "Where 
apartheid was put on the books, democracy will now replace it," Popo Molefe, 
the new ANC premier of Northwest province, said as he arrived at the Parliament 
building. "Today apartheid is really dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramaphosa -- chief ANC negotiator during talks that led to the new 
constitution and election -- grinned as he mounted the steps. "We were thinking 
of storming it," he said. "Now we can walk in gently." 
</P>
<P>
 Winnie Mandela, who was neither named to the Cabinet nor invited to the 
official party after the formal inauguration, pushed past a crush of reporters 
without a word. Inside, Mandela neither exchanged a glance with nor spoke a 
word to her, even when she sat next to him for several minutes. The couple 
separated in 1992 after she was convicted of kidnaping and linked to an 
extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnie Mandela nominated the sari-clad Frene Ginwala, a women's rights 
activist and head of the ANC research department, as Speaker of the Parliament. 
Ginwala, approved without debate, pledged to "make sure that every voice is 
able to make itself heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Many legislators arrived with their spouses. Trevor Manuel, who will be in 
Mandela's Cabinet, brought his white-haired mother, Euphemia. "This is the best 
Mother's Day present," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Slovo, the Communist Party chief who was considered public enemy No. 1 by 
the apartheid regime, showed off his trademark red socks. "From most-wanted to 
member of Parliament," he said, shaking his head in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, two other living symbols of change walked up the cobblestone 
path. Tall and blond, Willem Verwoerd pointed to the legislative office 
building named for his late grandfather, Hendrik F. Verwoerd, the Afrikaner 
prime minister considered the architect of apartheid. "I think this is one of 
the names that should be changed soonest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Melanie, a new ANC member of Parliament, smiled. "Even for whites, 
it's a day of liberation," she said.

FED REPORTEDLY PREPARES SERIES OF RATE INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior Federal Reserve officials confirm that the central bank is poised to 
raise interest rates repeatedly in the months ahead, with some policy-makers 
embracing a controversial formula that could prompt them to call for rate hikes 
whenever national unemployment falls below 6.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the recovery is picking up speed and the economy is generating 
hundreds of thousands of new jobs each month, officials of the central bank say 
they are convinced that short-term interest rates must go considerably higher 
to prevent inflationary pressures from building. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Federal Reserve waits until consumer and producer prices begin to 
accelerate, they say, it will be too late for Fed policy to have much of an 
impact. Last week's report of strong employment growth in April and a decline 
in the jobless rate to 6.4% -- just below the 6.5% target used by some Fed 
officials -- only served to reinforce the view within the central bank that it 
is time to apply the brakes before the economy begins to overheat. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wall Street analysts and economists have speculated about the likelihood 
of further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, the virtual certainty of a 
continuing series of future increases was confirmed for the first time in 
interviews with senior Fed officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact timing and scope of future rate hikes is uncertain but several 
officials say that another upward adjustment could come as soon as the next 
scheduled meeting of the central bank's policy-setting panel, the Federal Open 
Market Committee, on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a few Fed officials say they are being guided in their decisions by 
statistical benchmarks suggesting that the unemployment rate already has fallen 
too far and that the economy is expanding too rapidly to keep inflation in 
check. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other Fed insiders, including Chairman Alan Greenspan, dismiss those 
formulas as too simplistic, their use suggests that at least some Fed officials 
might be willing to raise interest rates considerably higher than the Clinton 
Administration believes is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 One Fed official said that such informal targets lead those who adhere to them 
to the conclusion that, given current conditions, the Fed should raise the 
benchmark federal funds rate to at least 4.5%, and perhaps as high as 5%. The 
rate currently stands at 3.75%. If the anti-inflation hawks are able to 
dominate policy-making, the central bank could impose as many as five more 
quarter-point rate hikes within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed already has raised interest rates three times this year, boosting the 
federal funds rate by 0.25 of a percentage point each time. Aftershocks from 
the rate hikes continue to reverberate throughout the economy: stock and bond 
prices have declined sharply and borrowing costs have risen on everything from 
credit cards to home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has said publicly that he expects the federal 
funds rate to rise to 4%, suggesting that the White House is willing to accept 
one more quarter-point increase. But some Fed insiders predict that even higher 
rates appear likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own feeling is that we have a ways more to go and we shouldn't wait too 
long to do it," says one senior Fed source, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not there yet; we have more to do," says a member of the Fed's board 
of governors. "How many more, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The economic targets being used by some Fed officials have become a source of 
debate within the Fed. Their adherents say that they involve two basic 
calculations: one target suggests that the Fed should strongly consider raising 
rates when unemployment falls below 6.5%. The other calls for consideration of 
rate hikes if the pace of economic growth exceeds 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the latest statistical readings, both thresholds already have been 
crossed. The government reported that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 
2.6% in the first quarter of 1994 and April's unemployment rate fell below 
6.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapid economic growth and job creation are generally believed to increase 
inflationary pressures by creating spot shortages of goods, services and labor, 
which enable producers and workers to demand higher prices. But there is 
widespread disagreement over the actual rates of employment and economic growth 
at which inflationary bottlenecks begin to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 While some Fed officials believe that their targets reflect the "natural rate" 
of non-inflationary growth and employment, insiders say there is little 
agreement within the Fed or among private economists over the accuracy and 
usefulness of such specific targets. So far, they are endorsed only by a 
minority of the members of the Open Market Committee and do not represent 
official guidelines for Fed policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the increasingly aggressive monetary policy has convinced critics 
that the Fed is willing to sacrifice a certain amount of job creation and 
economic expansion to keep future price increases moderate. Ultimately, that 
puts the Republican-dominated central bank on a potential collision course with 
a Democratic President who captured the White House largely on the strength of 
his pledge to create jobs and revive the economy. In fact, Bill Clinton staked 
his presidency last year on a deficit-reduction plan designed to stimulate 
growth by keeping interest rates low. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's rate hikes could spoil that game plan right before crucial off-year 
congressional elections, in a year when Democrats appear especially vulnerable. 
While the White House has held its fire so far, congressional Democrats already 
are mounting a fierce attack, challenging the need for rate hikes and 
threatening to clip the Fed's wings with legislation that would increase White 
House oversight of the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee used their 
annual report to criticize the Republican-controlled Fed, a switch from 
previous years when they railed at GOP presidents. "Perhaps the greatest threat 
to sustained recovery would be continuing and unwarranted increases in interest 
rates," the committee's report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed officials say that some members of the Open Market Committee have embraced 
the new targets because their traditional yardstick -- the growth rate of the 
nation's money supply -- is no longer reliable. Other Fed officials privately 
criticize their colleagues who adhere to fixed targets. Greenspan, for example, 
doesn't base his policy decisions on them, arguing that they are overly 
simplistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, there are those who use those targets but I think people who base their 
policy decisions on that are kidding themselves," one senior Fed official says. 
"Economists aren't smart enough to know what full employment is." 
</P>
<P>
 Few independent economists accept the analysis used by those who adhere to the 
targets. The traditional view in the economics profession is that full 
employment is reflected by a much lower unemployment rate, one closer to 4%. 
And, even under the revised unemployment data the government began using this 
year, data which tends to produce higher jobless rates than did the earlier 
surveys, Administration officials argue that full employment comes at a rate of 
unemployment between 5.5% and 6.0%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed target of 6.5% is at the extreme high end of the range that 
economists have been using," notes Daniel Bachman, an economist at the WEFA 
Group, a forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "I think it is too conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Administration has studiously avoided joining in attacks on the 
Fed. But some Fed officials wonder how long the White House will be willing to 
maintain warm relations with Greenspan if the central bank continues to ratchet 
rates ever higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration might find it easier to openly criticize the central bank 
once Clinton's two pending nominees for the Federal Reserve board of governors 
are installed. The President has nominated White House economist Alan Blinder 
to be Fed vice chairman -- making him the odds-on-favorite to succeed Greenspan 
in 1996 -- and UC Berkeley economist Janet Yellen to fill a second vacancy on 
the seven-member board.

EX-VICE PRESIDENT LAUNCHES BID TO REPLACE YELTSIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the roar of angry hard-liners behind him, ousted Vice President Alexander 
V. Rutskoi launched a campaign Monday to replace Boris N. Yeltsin as president 
of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first major public appearance since he stood on the balcony of the 
Russian Parliament building in October, urging a mob to storm the Ostankino 
television tower in a bid to overthrow Yeltsin, Rutskoi spoke to 7,000 to 
10,000 anti-Yeltsin demonstrators at a Victory Day rally marking the Soviet 
Union's 1945 triumph over Nazi Germany. He predicted his archenemy Yeltsin 
would be tossed out of power -- without bloodshed -- before Victory Day next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 50th anniversary of the victory over fascist Germany will be celebrated 
in completely different conditions," Rutskoi declared in a comeback blitz that 
borrowed themes from ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. "The police, 
anti-people regime will no longer exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutskoi, crisply dressed and shorn of the Old Testament beard he had grown 
during four months in prison, was chauffeured to the starting point for the 
march in a lilac Mercedes-Benz. But his team of bodyguards discreetly dropped 
him off near the subway station, making it look as if the humble candidate had 
arrived by public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Afghan War hero was introduced to the cheering crowd as "the acting 
vice president of Russia" -- a title unused since Yeltsin fired, then jailed, 
his former running mate after the Parliament was stormed Oct. 4. Rutskoi was 
released in February under a controversial amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long live President Rutskoi!" chanted the crowd. One placard read, "We Beat 
Fascism, We Shall Beat Yeltsinism." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutskoi called on the fragmented Russian opposition -- an array of 
nationalist, Communist, fascist and monarchist splinter groups united mainly by 
virulent anti-Semitism -- to pull together under Rutskoi's new movement, "Great 
Power." 
</P>
<P>
 In a leaflet distributed by supporters, Rutskoi called for the 
re-establishment of a Russian superpower within the borders of the former 
Soviet Union, a return to law and order and a halt to the impoverishment of 
huge segments of the population. "Today everyone must choose," Rutskoi wrote. 
"Either the road to a colonial future with mafia-criminal lawlessness, or 
superpower status and a dignified life." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin, meantime, marked Victory Day by planting a tree in a new park 
dedicated to veterans on the western outskirts of Moscow, where the invading 
armies of Napoleon and Hitler faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the nationalist tone he has been striking more often since 
Zhirinovsky scored big election gains in December, Yeltsin reminded the world 
that Russia must always be treated with respect. He praised the stoicism of the 
Russian people in 1993 and promised to revive Russia's grandeur and dignity in 
1994. "We were united in the Great War," Yeltsin said. "We can be united now in 
civil peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin has generally ignored Zhirinovsky and scoffed at the dozen other men 
who are believed to harbor presidential ambitions for 1996. Yeltsin has said he 
will not run for reelection, but aides have hinted otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin could be a strong candidate. 
Another possible candidate is centrist Nikolai Travkin, who founded the Civic 
Union bloc with Rutskoi before breaking with the then-vice president last 
April. Travkin was named to Yeltsin's Cabinet on Friday, but in 
characteristically disorganized fashion, Travkin's post has not been specified. 
Several hard-liners have also hinted they may run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rutskoi seems to get under Yeltsin's skin as no other rival can. In 
dueling interviews last month, Rutskoi told the Pravda newspaper that Yeltsin 
and his government are "crooks, political rogues and nouveaux riches, people 
who have destroyed the Soviet Union, spilled the blood of the country, 
destroyed the economy and the army and humiliated a great nation." 
</P>
<P>
 In his retort, in Newsweek, Yeltsin said: "Rutskoi cannot rise again as a 
politician. He will hamper us in minor things, but that's all he can do. People 
will not accept him, and he himself, psychologically, is not a man who stands 
firmly on his feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Victory Day celebrations elsewhere in the former Soviet Union were also marked 
by controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sevastopol, the Crimean port that is home to the Black Sea Fleet, Russian 
officers goose-stepped to the beat of the Ukrainian navy's marching band. But 
conflict over how the two nations will divide the strategic fleet spilled over 
into jeers and hisses when the Ukrainian national anthem was played. 
</P>
<P>
 In Riga, a ceremony was held at the monument to the Soviet soldiers who 
liberated the city from the Nazis, but Latvian officials did not attend. The 
last Russian troops, whom Latvians consider an occupying army, are to be 
withdrawn before Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Lithuania did not celebrate Victory Day at all. President Algirdas Brazauskas 
released a statement noting only that Lithuania was "more than once seized by 
different occupants," as it was invaded and re-invaded by Germany and the 
Soviet Union in World War II.

U.S. PONDERS WHAT TO DO WITH ITS NUCLEAR ARSENAL; STRATEGY: NEED FOR DOOMSDAY 
'DETERRENT' FORCE QUESTIONED. SOME SAY IT COULD ENCOURAGE PROLIFERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The porpoise-shaped, matte-black form of this 560-foot-long Trident submarine 
is still 71 miles from the U.S. shoreline, but Capt. George W. Jurand gives the 
order to surface anyway, to reduce the danger of a collision in the coastal sea 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tennessee is coming home. 
</P>
<P>
 As it has 23 times before, the vessel -- loaded with 24 D-5 missiles that 
could blow up much of Moscow and other key sites in a nuclear war -- has just 
completed a 70-day deployment that took it near the same Cold War targets that 
the United States has had in its sights for years. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, the Tennessee is returning to troubled waters. With the 
Cold War ended and the former Soviet nuclear arsenal being dismantled, the 
United States is embroiled in a major debate over the role of its strategic 
nuclear forces, including Trident subs like this one. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental question, put plainly, is: Why does the United States still 
need a doomsday "deterrent" force of missiles, bombers and submarines in an age 
when the major nuclear threat is the proliferation of weapons to countries such 
as North Korea and Iran? 
</P>
<P>
 No less a Cold War hawk than Paul H. Nitze has suggested that Washington 
re-examine the role of strategic nuclear weapons in the U.S. security arsenal, 
contending that massive deterrence is unnecessary -- and could backfire by 
encouraging more proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has launched a high-level review of U.S. strategic 
nuclear forces, with the aim of revamping them to meet the needs of the 
post-Cold War world. The study, being conducted by the Pentagon, is expected to 
be completed next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Defense Department has launched a new "counter-proliferation" 
program to bolster the military's ability to detect and perhaps destroy weapons 
of mass destruction, as well as the plants where nuclear, chemical and 
biological warheads are made. 
</P>
<P>
 The reassessment will address the question of whether the United States should 
for the first time openly threaten to use nuclear bombs or missiles to 
retaliate against the use of chemical and biological weapons or to prevent U.S. 
troops from being overrun by enemy forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the pressure for a review stems from the changing nature of the 
nuclear threat itself: With the Soviet Union out of the picture, Russia no 
longer is the United States' main potential adversary. Third World countries 
such as Iraq and North Korea now pose the biggest threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Nitze, for one, contends that nuclear weapons are unlikely to be useful in 
deterring aggression because most would-be enemies are confident that 
Washington will not use them. Iraq, for example, invaded Kuwait despite U.S. 
nuclear strength. 
</P>
<P>
 With the precision-guided munitions that performed so well during the Persian 
Gulf War, Nitze argues, the United States will soon have the ability to meet 
any military challenge using conventional forces only. He says that Washington 
would be better off using these as its principal deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 The review is also being driven by budget considerations. The United States 
now spends $31 billion a year on its strategic nuclear forces -- as much as it 
did at the height of the Cold War -- and analysts say that it could cut that 
cost by $15 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the issue is important in the broader debate over nuclear 
non-proliferation. Strategists argue that if the United States embarks on a 
major new bid to modernize its own nuclear weapons, it is likely to spur some 
smaller countries into acquiring more for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the United States increasingly is taking on a role as guarantor of 
nuclear stability in potential trouble spots around the world -- between Russia 
and Ukraine, for example, and, potentially, between India and Pakistan and 
between North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 If that role continues, the United States might need to maintain its strategic 
nuclear force, not cut it back or eliminate it. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, no one is advocating that the U.S. nuclear arsenal be scrapped. 
William M. Arkin, a weapons analyst for Greenpeace, concedes that the situation 
in the former Soviet Union is uncertain and that Washington needs some nuclear 
arms as defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Administration must resolve some fundamental issues in its 
latest review -- and the answers could have a profound influence on U.S. 
military strategy and global nuclear non-proliferation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Mendelsohn, deputy director of the Arms Control Assn., a Washington-based 
research group, cites several critical issues in the Administration's strategy 
review: 
</P>
<P>
 * How big a strategic nuclear force does the United States really need to 
mount a credible deterrent -- and to maintain an adequate hedge against a 
possible revival of Soviet-type imperialism?  
</P>
<P>
 Under the existing Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, Washington will pare its 
nuclear arsenal to 3,500 warheads by 1997, down from 12,650 at the Cold War's 
peak. Should those cuts be speeded up? Should the warhead totals then be 
reduced further? 
</P>
<P>
 * What kind of nuclear forces should the United States maintain?  
</P>
<P>
 By 1997, the United States will be carrying half its nuclear warheads on 
submarines, with relatively few on bombers or in missile silos. Would the force 
be more effective with more -- but somewhat smaller -- submarines? How many 
bombers and silos will be needed? 
</P>
<P>
 * How much of the strategic nuclear force must be kept on high alert?  
</P>
<P>
 Critics argue that one of the most dangerous aspects of the nuclear weapons 
threat during the Cold War was the fact that both powers had their missiles 
constantly poised to strike instantly, almost as a reflex action. Should more 
be done to reduce that tension? 
</P>
<P>
 * Given the growing threat from the Third World , is a nuclear deterrent 
enough?  
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts argue that the United States needs to expand its concept of 
strategic warfare to provide a deterrent against other weapons of mass 
destruction -- such as chemical and biological warfare -- including the ability 
to launch preemptive strikes to wipe them out. 
</P>
<P>
 * How far can the United States go in developing antimissile missiles, to 
defend itself against Scud-type missiles like those used by Iraq during the 
Gulf War?  
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clinton Administration has scrapped the Ronald Reagan-era 
Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars program, it has embarked on a crash 
program to develop "theater" defense missiles -- a successor to the Patriot 
missiles of the Gulf War -- designed to destroy Scud-type missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the program has become controversial. Critics argue that the 
Administration's current proposals threaten to scuttle the limits imposed by 
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of the 1970s, undermining the entire 
rationale for current arms-control treaties. 
</P>
<P>
 * Should the United States abandon its longstanding refusal to pledge that it 
will not be the first to launch a nuclear strike?  
</P>
<P>
 The question is more one of diplomatic strategy than of military posture. 
Although Moscow made such a pledge during the Cold War, the United States 
refused to match it because Washington wanted to reserve the option of a 
nuclear first strike if NATO forces were overrun. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow has since abandoned the pledge in favor of eschewing any firm policy at 
all. Those who favor renewing the Non-Proliferation Treaty next spring argue 
that the nuclear powers might garner more support for the effort if they sign 
such a pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has already begun making significant changes in its 
strategic warfare policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1991 order by then-President George Bush, authorities have started 
taking the nation's B-52 bomber and Minuteman missile crews off continuous 
alert, allowing them to operate at normal readiness levels except for periodic 
training exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the provisions of the START treaty, the Air Force has begun dismantling 
241 Minuteman II missile silos at missile-launching sites in states in the 
Northwest. Another 570 newer Peacekeepers and Minuteman IIIs will be left in 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an accord signed in January, the United States and Russia agreed to 
"de-target" their nuclear missiles -- to point them out to sea instead of at 
each other. The step, while largely symbolic, is significant as a political 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Administration has begun to reshape some U.S. forces to 
deal with regional conflicts, such as the Gulf War, that are precipitated by 
Third World countries. Air Force Gen. George L. Butler, former head of the U.S. 
Strategic Command, said the United States is considering targeting some Third 
World countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huddled with some crew members on the Tennessee's cramped, cockpit-like 
bridge, Rear Adm. Winford G. Ellis, commander of Submarine Squadron 16, 
explains what the Navy's "boomers" (ballistic-missile-carrying submarines) are 
all about: to serve as a deterrent -- along with Air Force Minuteman missiles 
and B-52 bombers -- by making the prospect of U.S. retaliation so horrible that 
no potential enemy would ever want to launch a nuclear attack against the 
United States. Over the last 47 years, he asserts, the concept has worked well. 
"My guess," he says, "is that nuclear weapons are going to be around in this 
world as long as you and I live."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the easing of Cold War tensions, almost all the issues in the nuclear 
weapons debate are controversial. Even the question of whether the former 
Soviet states still pose a major threat to the United States is being hotly 
debated. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts argue that there have been important changes in the Russian 
nuclear threat over the last few years. Before the Cold War ended, Soviet armed 
forces were in a high state of readiness. Their armies were well-financed. The 
chain of command was absolute. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Russia's armed forces are out of money and suffering from low morale. 
Its warships, badly maintained and short of fuel, are largely bottled up in 
port. And its nuclear forces are in disarray, with many of its key weapons 
systems in other former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, there is widespread concern about possible "leakage" of Russian 
weapons, either through third-party smuggling or by outright sales to Third 
World countries by disgruntled Russian military personnel or by hard-hit 
Russian defense industries. 
</P>
<P>
 While Russia and Ukraine have begun moving to disarm some of their nuclear 
warheads, thousands remain on-line. There is little evidence that the rest of 
the former Soviet Union will disarm anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But those experts who favor maintaining the massive U.S. strategic force of 
Cold War days argue that, while the situation has changed somewhat, the threat 
posed by the former Soviet Union has not disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 They note that despite the fall of the Communist dictatorship, the political 
situation in Russia is uncertain at best. The Russian military is still 
well-armed with nuclear weapons. Many senior Russian officers are hard-liners 
who are anti-Western. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that the new Third World uncertainties, and "there's enough trouble out 
there that walking away from the 'deterrence' doctrine probably is not a 
realistic option," said a private nuclear weapons expert who has tracked 
post-Soviet developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, virtually all sides agree that the United States could pare its 
nuclear arsenal well beyond the 3,500 warheads envisioned by the START treaty. 
Both the Establishment-oriented Atlantic Council and the liberal-oriented 
Center for Defense Information, for example, have proposed trimming the number 
of warheads to 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenpeace's Bill Arkin contends that the United States "could probably do 
with only a few hundred" warheads without endangering national security, though 
he concedes that the move would be difficult politically. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue is the composition of the United States' strategic nuclear 
forces. For much of the Cold War years, the United States relied on what is 
known as the Triad -- a combination of missiles, bombers and nuclear 
submarines. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Triad was mainly a result of interservice rivalry -- both the Air 
Force and the Navy wanted a nuclear role -- proponents argue that having three 
kinds of delivery systems provides the military with an insurance policy in 
case one is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts question whether the Triad really is necessary. With today's 
precision-guided weapons, the underground concrete silos that house the United 
States' intercontinental ballistic missiles are especially vulnerable. And B-52 
bombers are slow and relatively easy to shoot down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that we don't really need the Triad anymore," said Robert W. 
Gaskin, a retired Air Force officer and Pentagon strategic planner who is now a 
vice president of Business Executives for National Security, a defense-oriented 
research group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bleak, early morning sky glares inhospitably as B-52 No. 61-031 rumbles 
across the taxiway at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to begin a simulated 
nuclear bombing run, and the pilot, Capt. David Knesek, is stoic about the 
mission. Once the pride of the old Strategic Air Command, the aging B-52s -- 
this one has been in the fleet for 31 years, longer than Knesek has been alive 
-- are either being converted to conventional weapons-carriers or sold for 
scrap. "I'd like to fly these as long as possible," he muses, or switch to 
flying B-1s, which are replacing the B-52s. If not, Knesek has other plans in 
mind. "Everyone has a Plan B," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To some degree, that issue already has been decided: The United States appears 
to be preparing to rely on submarines as the foundation of its strategic 
forces, while Russia seems to be heading for a mostly land-based deterrent, 
using mobile missiles and silos. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, much of the existing strategic B-52s and B-1 bomber force is being 
converted to carry conventional weapons or sent to the scrapheap. The Air Force 
will end up with about 116 big bombers by 1999 -- all of them for conventional 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, under the provisions of START, the Air Force is phasing out many of 
its Minuteman II missile silos, which are more vulnerable now because Russian 
ICBMs are far more accurate than they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy has begun campaigning vigorously to save all 18 of its Tridents -- 
the subs that carry the ballistic missiles -- but it is scrapping its smaller 
attack subs as quickly as it can. By the end of the decade, only 18 will remain 
on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the equation focuses on how much of the U.S. strategic nuclear 
force must be kept on high-alert status. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Blair, a Brookings Institution nuclear weapons expert, argues that along 
with cutting back the number of warheads, the most important step that both 
sides can take is to make it more difficult for the United States and Russia to 
launch any attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the breakup of the Soviet empire, Defense Secretary William J. Perry 
asserts that the United States must be prepared for "a worst-case outcome" -- 
the possibility that Russia will emerge from its current turbulence as an 
imperialistic, hostile power. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense officials are expected to recommend making the strategic force more 
flexible, through a "counter-proliferation" program designed to enable the 
United States to respond to new Third World challenges, such as chemical and 
biological weapons. Nukes Going -- But Not Gone 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and the former Soviet republics have vowed to cut back 
nuclear arsenals as smaller nations strive to obtain weapons. 
</P>
<P>

IRVINE MAN ON STAND IN WYNN CASE; KIDNAPING: REAL ESTATE BROKER DENIES 
INVOLVEMENT IN ABDUCTION OF A CASINO MOGUL'S DAUGHTER. HE DESCRIBES FRIENDSHIP 
WITH CHIEF SUSPECT IN CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two other men may be on trial here for allegedly kidnaping the daughter of 
casino mogul Steven A. Wynn, but Irvine real estate broker Spyro Kemble's 
reputation now is at stake in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense attorney has alleged that Kemble, who has not been charged, was a 
figure in the October kidnaping of Kevin Wynn, 27, who was released unharmed 
after her father, the chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., paid a $1.45-million 
ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble took the witness stand in federal court Monday and denied any 
involvement in the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 As the trial began last week, defense attorney Don Albregts had implicated 
Kemble, alleging that he was the man who drove Wynn's daughter to the airport 
when she was freed. And Albregts said $500,000 of the ransom money was found in 
Kemble's garage. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a prosecutor on Monday asked Kemble if he had any prior knowledge of 
the kidnaping or any involvement, Kemble replied: "No, I did not." 
</P>
<P>
 Composed and looking directly at the jurors, Kemble, 36, said the only thing 
he could be accused of is being the best friend of Ray Marion Cuddy, who 
federal prosecutors say orchestrated the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said that over the years, he had loaned Cuddy money and his credit 
card, and even shared his home. Kemble testified that after the kidnaping, 
Cuddy, despite some rough financial times, suddenly was spending cash lavishly, 
buying a $20,000 watch and trying to buy a $200,000 Ferrari car. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said Cuddy told him, "Our ship has come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble also told the court he had his father, a lawyer in Newport Beach, call 
the FBI after Cuddy's arrest because he realized that his friend might have 
placed ransom money in his garage. FBI agents searched his garage after the 
call and found $500,000 of the ransom in $100 bills stacked in several boxes, 
Kemble said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was questioned by the FBI and prosecutors at least 10 more times, Kemble 
said, and testified before a federal grand jury investigating the crime. His 
parents and wife, who have proclaimed Kemble's innocence since Albregts' 
allegations, sat in the courtroom throughout his several hours on the witness 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy is on trial with Jacob Sherwood, 22, on charges of kidnaping, extortion 
and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 A third defendant, Paul Watkins, 20, pleaded guilty to extortion and testified 
against Cuddy and Sherwood, his longtime friend, last week. In his testimony, 
Watkins said only he, Cuddy and Sherwood were involved in the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy was arrested in Newport Beach a few days after the kidnaping as he tried 
to complete a cash deal on a $200,000 Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Kemble's testimony Monday focused on his friendship with Cuddy and how 
they sometimes loaned each other money, depending on who needed help. The 
allegations about him driving Kevin Wynn to the airport never came up during 
the examination by Albregt. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cuddy returned to Newport Beach a day after the kidnaping aiming to buy 
the Ferrari, Kemble said he assumed his friend had settled a large civil 
lawsuit he had previously discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble testified that he had no idea of Cuddy's alleged involvement in the 
kidnaping until the day his friend was arrested. Kemble testified that he 
became curious about boxes Cuddy had been storing at his garage and discovered 
a stack of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, Cuddy called Kemble from jail and apologized for stashing 
the money in the boxes. Three taped calls between the two men were played in 
court Monday. "I'm sorry to put it there," Cuddy told Kemble. In one 
conversation, when Kemble said that he was being questioned by the FBI, Cuddy 
protested: "You know nothing about nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell Posin, the lawyer representing Cuddy, said the allegations leveled 
against Kemble by the other defense lawyer were unexpected and he will not 
pursue them. 
</P>
<P>
 The courtroom allegation also came as a surprise to those who know Kemble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't seem fair," said Lana Chandler of Newport Beach, who chaired 
a March of Dimes fund-raiser in which Kemble participated. "He's worked so hard 
to maintain a good image. . . . All I can say is great things about him."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION; NO STRONG 
FRONT-RUNNER EMERGING FROM FIELD OF 12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was in June, 1990, that Bill Honig rode the crest of an education reform 
wave to a third term as California's superintendent of public instruction. He 
easily gathered the majority vote needed to win the state's only nonpartisan 
office in the primary election, avoiding a November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference four years can make. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with Honig out of office and convicted on conflict-of-interest charges, 
and amid strong signals that voters want changes in the state's public schools, 
a June 7 primary victory for any of his would-be successors seems all but out 
of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 The race has drawn 12 candidates, including some prominent members of the 
state's education Establishment and a foot soldier in last year's failed ballot 
effort to provide parents with tax-money vouchers to spend on private or 
parochial school tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Democratic women with strong ties to the state's education community are 
widely considered to be among the front-runners. They are Assemblywoman Delaine 
Eastin of Fremont, the choice of the California Teachers Assn., and Maureen 
DiMarco, a former school board member from Orange County who is Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson's secretary for child development and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the others mounting substantial campaigns are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Joseph Carrabino, a retired UCLA management professor and controversial 
former president of the State Board of Education. He helped reduce the size of 
the superintendent's office in a power struggle with Honig that wound up in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wilbert Smith, a former Pasadena school board member and a champion of last 
fall's voucher initiative campaign, who recently won the endorsement of the 
California Republican Assembly, the influential right wing of the state GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County elementary school teacher Gloria Matta Tuchman, a Tustin 
school board member. She has a base of supporters from her long crusade against 
bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin is a former community college instructor and corporate planner who was 
elected to the Assembly in 1986 and appointed by Speaker Willie Brown to lead 
its Education Committee three years ago. She had raised more than $500,000 for 
the race by the mid-March reporting deadline, according to campaign finance 
documents on file with the state and county election offices. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, who once headed the California School Boards Assn. and was a 
consultant to Honig, reported having raised $7,550 since entering the race 
earlier this year. One of her campaign advisers said her late start and her 
political ties to both major parties make fund raising difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 But the adviser, Luke Breit of Sacramento, said her position as an experienced 
Democrat working in a Republican Administration bolsters her appeal as someone 
who can depoliticize an office long undermined by partisan fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin's campaign backers are trying to link DiMarco with the governor's 
policies, which they say put prisons ahead of schools. The DiMarco camp 
criticizes Eastin for being too indebted to special interests, especially the 
teachers unions, to bring about needed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has said he will make no primary endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrabino has enlisted political consultant Sal Russo, a key player in the 
conservative Republican Administration of former Gov. George Deukmejian, to run 
his campaign. He got a late start in fund raising, reporting only a $1,000 loan 
to himself by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who is black, is seeking support among minorities as well as from 
voucher-initiative backers, conservatives and others calling for drastic 
overhaul of the school system. Smith had raised about $200,000, including a 
$100,000 loan from a family member who controls the Wal-Mart discount chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuchman reported raising $67,000, including about $52,000 she and her husband 
loaned the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 An April survey by Mervin Field's California Poll tested the popularity of the 
top candidates among registered voters and those who said they are likely to 
register in time for the primary. Carrabino and DiMarco were each the choice of 
11% of those surveyed, 9% chose Eastin and 6% chose Smith; 63% said they had 
not made up their minds. Tuchman was not included in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running are Lewis S. Keizer of Santa Cruz, the founder of a private 
school for academically gifted students; David L. Kilber of Los Angeles, a 
follower of political radical Lyndon LaRouche; attorney, former teacher and 
ex-Municipal Judge Carol S. Koppel of Apple Valley, who got 17% of the vote 
when she ran against Honig in 1990; engineer Perry L. Martin of Yuba City; 
research engineer Frank Joseph Anthony Mele of Sacramento, and two other Orange 
County teachers, Hal Rice of Anaheim and Robert (Rob) Stewart of Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Of these candidates, only Keizer and Stewart had filed the required financial 
statements, showing each had raised about $2,000, election officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a lot of action for an office that has not been a steppingstone to a 
bigger political job and whose powers were narrowed by the courts last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1849, the superintendent's job is to serve as executive officer 
and secretary of the State Board of Education and to run the day-to-day 
operations of the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his conviction for funneling state funds through an education program 
run by his wife, the liberal, high-profile Honig used the office to push for 
reforms. During his 10-year tenure, the dropout rate declined, more students 
completed courses required for admission to college and the state created 
tougher, nationally praised curriculum guides in several key subjects. Honig is 
appealing the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 But he tangled openly with two governors, legislators and many conservatives, 
including the combative Carrabino, who, while leader of the State Board of 
Education, was a key figure in a power struggle between the board and 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled that the board has 
policy-making authority and granted it powers to review the superintendent's 
choices for top Department of Education staff, help formulate department 
budgets and review department directives before they are sent to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the court ruled in the board's favor, however, Carrabino had quit 
the board in the face of almost certain Senate rejection of his reappointment. 
Opponents had accused him of making racist and anti-Semitic remarks and 
furthering the politicization of the state's education system, charges he 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some important gains in the last decade, the state's education system 
has plenty of problems, including deep public dissatisfaction. Voters strongly 
rejected last fall's voucher initiative, but polls showed that although people 
did not want to undermine the public school system, they clearly wanted 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's four-year recession has eroded school funding at a time of rapidly 
growing enrollments. Class sizes have grown to the second-largest average in 
the United States, and California's ranking has slipped dramatically in the 
amount it spends per pupil. Student achievement, especially in reading and 
math, is lagging behind that in many other states, and campus violence is a 
growing concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, controversies over content and scoring have dulled the luster 
of the state's nationally heralded student testing system and have prompted 
even some supporters to question whether phasing in the expensive system should 
continue on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the state's many school-related problems have been exacerbated by the 
vacuum in political leadership since Honig left. An acting superintendent was 
named from within the Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the most important job, with the exception of governor, in California 
now," Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), longtime leader of the upper house's 
Education Committee, once said of the office he had considered seeking until 
just a few months ago.

GEORGE PEPPARD, VERSATILE ACTOR, DIES AT 65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Peppard, the actor who first achieved prominence opposite Audrey 
Hepburn in the film "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and was better known to modern 
audiences as the tough, cigar-chomping mercenary Hannibal Smith, leader of 
television's "The A-Team," has died. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Peppard, who underwent successful surgery for lung cancer two years ago, died 
Sunday night of pneumonia at UCLA Medical Center. Publicist Cheryl Kagan said 
that Peppard's cancer had been in remission since a tumor was removed from his 
right lung, but that he entered the hospital Thursday with breathing problems 
that developed into pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime heavy drinker and smoker, Peppard abandoned alcohol in 1978 and 
kicked his two-pack-a-day cigarette habit after the lung surgery in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as difficult in his professional and personal life, the versatile actor 
suffered long periods of unemployment and four divorces, two from actress 
Elizabeth Ashley, whom he met while filming "The Carpetbaggers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting married and having a bad divorce is just like breaking your leg. The 
same leg, in the same place," joked the tall, ruggedly handsome Peppard a few 
years ago. "I'm lucky I don't walk with a cane." 
</P>
<P>
 Peppard proved as pragmatic as he was outspoken. Although he originally 
disparaged the small screen in favor of films, he achieved his widest success 
and perhaps greatest pleasure starring in three NBC television series -- as the 
Polish American detective "Banacek" from 1972 to 1974, as a neurosurgeon on 
"Doctors' Hospital" from 1975 to 1976, and as the Vietnam veteran colonel on 
"The A-Team" from 1983 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concentrating on big-screen roles. . . . (I) turned down two television 
series," he told The Times in 1961. "In a series you don't have time to develop 
a character. There's no buildup; in the first segment you're already 
established, with absolutely no background." 
</P>
<P>
 Peppard appeared in more than 25 films after making his debut in "The Strange 
One" in 1957. But his first were the best -- "Pork Chop Hill" in 1959, "Home 
From the Hill" in 1960, his role as the writer supporting Hepburn's Holly 
Golightly in "Tiffany's" in 1961, "How the West Was Won" in 1962 and "The 
Carpetbaggers" in 1964. Although he appeared with the superstars -- Gregory 
Peck, Robert Mitchum, James Stewart, John Wayne -- he never became one himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of one good actor who hasn't gone to hell when he got big 
enough," he raged to syndicated columnist Hedda Hopper in 1962, although he 
later conceded that he admired Stewart, Wayne and others when he got to know 
them. "When they start getting the million-dollar salary and the percentage, 
they start doing everything except what they're equipped for -- they start 
producing and directing." 
</P>
<P>
 But a decade later, Peppard ate those words, telling a Santa Monica court he 
was giving up acting in favor of directing and producing in order to make 
enough money for alimony payments. His greatest effort proved to be the 1979 
film "Five Days From Home," which he wrote, produced, directed and starred in. 
Peppard employed family members, including his third wife, actress Sherry 
Boucher, and managed to market the film independently to some critical praise 
but little financial success. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceding that television wasn't so bad after all, he made the pilot for 
"Dynasty" in the role of the patriarch -- only to be ousted in favor of John 
Forsythe. Peppard went through several years in which he joked that he 
"couldn't get arrested," much less find work. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with the tough-guy stereotype he always attributed to his role as a 
megalomaniacal tycoon in "Carpetbaggers," Peppard was tapped for leader of "The 
A-Team," which he came to rate as the best role of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the pilot was terrific," he told The Times shortly after the series 
debuted in 1983. "I realized the role would give me the chance to do the sort 
of thing I've never been allowed to do in movies. I mean, I get to disguise 
myself as a Chinese person, a Skid Row drunk, a gay hairdresser -- I wanted to 
change from leading man to character actor for years now but have never been 
given the chance before." 
</P>
<P>
 He remained delighted with the series, which spawned a popular live-action 
show at Universal Studios amusement park, well after it ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I ever had money in the bank," he said in 1990. "It was a 
giant boost to my career, and made me a viable actor for other roles." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those roles was that of a World War II British secret service agent in 
the 1990 television miniseries "Night of the Fox." He also returned to the 
stage, appearing in "Love Letters" in London and "The Lion in Winter" in West 
Palm Beach, Fla., where he met his fifth wife, Laura. Most recently, he 
appeared in the March 3 episode of the television series "Matlock." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Detroit, Peppard was educated at Purdue University and the Carnegie 
Institute in Pittsburgh, then studied at the Actors Studio in New York. In the 
1950s, he worked in the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, summer stock in New 
England, New York-based television dramas and such Broadway plays as "The 
Pleasure of His Company." 
</P>
<P>
 Peppard earned a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame and served as grand marshal 
for the annual Hollywood Christmas Parade in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children, Brad, Julie and 
Christian, and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Lord's Place, 
P.O. Box 7117, West Palm Beach, Fla. 33405, which aids the homeless.

BROWN SAYS PAY RAISE FALLS SHORT; LEGISLATURE: THE SPEAKER BELIEVES LAWMAKERS 
SHOULD RECEIVE $95,214 SALARY, THE SAME AS MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGES. INSTEAD, 
THEY RECEIVED A 37% BOOST TO $72,000. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said Monday the Legislature's new 37% 
raise to $72,000 a year is a good step, but that state lawmakers are still 
underpaid and suggested they should receive $95,214 annually, the same salary 
paid to municipal court judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was reacting to the decision by the independent California Citizens 
Compensation Commission, which voted Friday to increase the $52,500-a-year pay 
of rank-and-file lawmakers by $19,500. It will be the first pay hike in four 
years and, when it takes effect in December, will make California legislators 
the highest paid in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary-setting commission, created by voters in 1990 as part of a 
legislative ethics reform plan embodied in Proposition 112, said the raise was 
needed to attract high-quality candidates who, in the new era of term limits, 
will temporarily leave careers to run for the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who will get $86,400 annually because of his leadership position, said 
the money for the salary hike will have to come from existing legislative 
operating funds, as required by the term limits initiative, Proposition 140, 
which capped the Legislature's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not one additional nickel cost to the taxpayers, and that pleases 
me," he told reporters at an impromptu Capitol news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the commission) have set the base salary at $72,000. I still think 
that's low," Brown said. "Salaries for members of the Legislature ought to be 
at least equal to municipal court judges." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a San Francisco attorney, said the higher pay is needed to not only 
attract the best candidates, but as reasonable reimbursement for long, hard 
days and nights the legislators must spend in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 State legislators also receive $101 a day tax-free to pay for living expenses 
when they are in session, plus a host of other fringe benefits, which starting 
in December will bring their total annual compensation package to about 
$100,000.

CAMPAIGN JOURNAL; SURROGATE ADDS DISTINCTIVE ACCENT TO RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Arianna Huffington's schedule has been tight all day and now, typically, she 
is late for a live radio talk show that started almost five minutes ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, she does not even appear rushed, let alone panicked, though her 
driver now reports that he is lost. Still no problem. Retrieving a cellular 
telephone from her pocketbook, Huffington speaks to the radio station in a rich 
accent that she compares to Zsa Zsa Gabor's, and learns that her car is 
actually right outside the studio's front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, the 43-year-old Greek immigrant is on the air, repeating once 
again the need for a more spiritual America, a central theme from both her 
latest book and her husband Michael's U.S. Senate campaign. Without a belief in 
God, she adds, we get too bogged down in life's everyday problems -- like 
toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toothpaste?" exclaimed radio host Rich Dixon, who has already told his 
listeners that Huffington has "unimaginable" wealth, estimated to be at least 
"70 . . . million . . . dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have toothpaste problems," he insists. " I have toothpaste 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington says that her problems are really quite typical and that, yes, 
her husband is a clean freak who has scolded her for leaving the top off of the 
toothpaste tube. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not uncommon for people to view glamorous Arianna Stassinopoulos 
Huffington as a visitor from the rare air of high society. And that would be 
true. But these days, Huffington is stumping California's very unglamorous 
chicken-dinner circuit as one of the major speakers and strategists in her 
husband's bid for the Republican nomination to try to unseat Democratic Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, while Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) has all but ignored 
his Republican opponents and focused instead on the November election, Arianna 
Huffington has been the campaign's most prominent representative in the GOP 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 She has faced off against Republican rival William E. Dannemeyer more than 
half a dozen times this spring at candidate forums throughout the state, 
including one here late last month. In contrast, Michael Huffington has 
appeared with Dannemeyer only a few times, and not since the state Republican 
convention last February. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement irritates Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm about ready to call the sheriff and suggest that he begin looking for a 
missing person named Michael Huffington," the former Orange County congressman 
joked recently. "It's appropriate to have surrogate speakers, but there comes a 
point when you cross the line. They have." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Huffington defends his wife's role as an important complement to the 
campaign because, as a congressman, he has to be in Washington three or four 
days during the week. Besides, he said, she is an exceptionally good surrogate. 
When he arrived at an event last week in Napa, the sponsors told him he was 
their second choice for the Senate. She was first. 
</P>
<P>
 At their appearances, she and Dannemeyer make an odd pair and their 
relationship has been icy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Black Angus restaurant in Stockton, she is gracious and polite, even 
after she has listened to 10 minutes of Dannemeyer ridiculing and vilifying her 
husband as an inexperienced, do-nothing Texas carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see a member of Congress like Michael Huffington . . . I define him as 
an economic liberal and a social liberal," Dannemeyer said, pounding the air 
with his fist. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said that when she tries to greet Dannemeyer, he only grumbles and 
then bolts. When the two were seated next to each other, she said she succeeded 
in starting a brief conversation with an "icebreaker" question about his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been courteous to her," Dannemeyer insists. "But I'm under no duty to 
engage in a continuing discussion with Mrs. Huffington." 
</P>
<P>
 It is part of Huffington's character, however, to navigate rough waters with a 
smooth touch. Instead of anger, she meets her challengers with a disarming 
smile and a sympathetic response. 
</P>
<P>
 She was confronted a few times at the Republican Women's Federated Club in 
Stockton, where about 60 people lunched on teriyaki chicken at tables adorned 
with red-white-and-blue carnation centerpieces. After her speech, Huffington 
faced two questioners who disagreed with her husband's support for abortion 
rights and gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 She reminded a man who identified himself as a soldier that gays have always 
been in the military, so that is not the issue. "The focus should be on 
conduct," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To the other, she said: "I would not personally have an abortion, but we need 
to remember one thing as Republicans -- we do not agree on everything. And . . 
. if you disagree with somebody 20%, that person is not your 20% enemy. He is 
your 80% friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer said he thinks Huffington comes across as a bit patronizing, as he 
said any person of great wealth would appear before a middle-class audience. 
Others said she proved to be an accomplished speaker and a deft campaigner. But 
even that sometimes raised questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt Arianna was attractive and she was handling herself well," said 
Nancy Boone, president of the Stockton women's club. "But the question 
afterward was, 'Who is running?' . . . There were some questions (about 
whether) we are going to have another Hillary." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond her debating and speechmaking, there is little doubt that Arianna 
Huffington is a major force in campaign decision-making. She participates in 
all strategy meetings. And the central theme of the campaign -- a more 
altruistic society -- overlaps substantially with the message in her sixth book 
-- just released -- titled "The Fourth Instinct, the Call of the Soul." 
</P>
<P>
 In Stockton, Huffington sought to underscore that campaign theme by stopping 
at a youth shelter in the hour she had between her luncheon speech and the 
radio show. 
</P>

 Huffington's visit interrupted an afternoon recreation period where a number 
of teen-age boys were either playing Monopoly or watching the game. Huffington, 
wearing a peach silk business suit and fine jewelry, immediately took control, 
approaching one boy who spun a basketball on his finger and asking him to teach 
her the trick. She never did make it work, but, as her instructor warned, it's 
not easy with long fingernails.

U.S. REFLOATS PEACEKEEPING PLAN FOR HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The United States is trying to organize a multinational peacekeeping force 
that would be deployed in Haiti if the military regime there falls, Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said President Clinton has asked U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright to 
"sound out other countries" about their willingness to participate in such a 
force.She raised the issue in Ottawa on Monday with Canadian Prime Minister 
Jean Chretien and Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet. A U.S. official said the 
Canadians promised to consider the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said the peacekeeping force was first proposed as part of the 
Governors Island agreement signed last July in New York's harbor. Under that 
pact, the Haitian military agreed to relinquish power and permit the return of 
exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 But when U.S. and Canadian peacekeepers tried to disembark at Port-au-Prince 
in October, armed thugs forced the ship to return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the U.S. diplomatic effort was clearly linked to new economic 
sanctions the U.N. Security Council approved against Haiti last week, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher did not say whether Clinton is prepared to commit U.S. troops to 
such a force, but another official said U.S. participation would be "logical." 
</P>
<P>
 In her meetings with Canadian officials, Albright discussed whether Canada 
would accept some Haitian refugees seeking political asylum. A U.S. official 
said the Canadians promised to study the request.

NEWS ANALYSIS; THE GHOSTS OF PANAMA'S PAST HAUNT ELECTIONS, SPOOKING SOME 
OBSERVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the end, Panamanians participating in their most open elections in decades 
voted for two dead men. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Perez Balladares, who won Sunday's presidential race, successfully 
conjured the image of military strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos, killed in a plane 
crash in 1981 but still a hero to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mireya Moscoso de Gruber placed a surprisingly strong second by riding a wave 
of loyalty toward her late husband, Arnulfo Arias, the legendary autocrat who 
was elected president three times and overthrown by the army each time. 
</P>
<P>
 And so results from the national elections showed that Panamanian voters 
generally divided into the two enemy camps that have been dominant political 
forces here for years: Torrijistas and Arnulfistas. 
</P>
<P>
 The new-and-unusual candidacy of salsa star Ruben Blades, portraying itself as 
a clean break from the past, finished a distant third. 
</P>
<P>
 Panama remains a largely polarized society, the election results indicate, and 
that could spell trouble for the new government and its ability to get things 
done at a crucial time: Panama assumes control of the Panama Canal in 5 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legislation necessary to run the canal efficiently depends on approval by 
a two-thirds majority of what promises to be a divided National Assembly. But 
neither of the main political forces trusts the other, and there is little 
history of mutual cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at (Perez Balladares' party) with some fear given what we lived 
through in past years," Gruber said Monday after conceding defeat. "Let us hope 
that once he is president, he has the best men at his side and that he governs 
for the people, not for a party." 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about Perez Balladares' Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) is not 
limited to Gruber and the Arnulfistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by Torrijos, the PRD long served as partner to the Panamanian military 
and was the political arm of dictator Gen. Manuel A. Noriega in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRD fell from power in disgrace when Noriega was ousted by a U.S. military 
invasion in 1989. Perez Balladares tried to distance the party from Noriega by 
returning to the populist roots represented by Torrijos. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Perez Balladares says the party has been purged of its most corrupt 
Noriega collaborators, several Noriega associates or party militants linked to 
recent scandals were present at PRD headquarters Sunday night, joining in 
victory celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arnulfistas have their own questionable history. Arias, while staunchly 
anti-military, was not exactly a democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-proclaimed admirer of European fascism in the 1930s and proponent of 
policies limiting the rights of Panama's blacks, he somehow managed to remain a 
charismatic, mystical figure supported by peasants, the middle class and some 
elements of the oligarchy until his death in 1988 at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrijos overthrew Arias in 1968. In all, Arias won the presidency three times 
in the 1940s and 1960s and was cheated out of yet another victory in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gruber and the Arnulfistas' finish in Sunday's elections -- just four 
points behind Perez Balladares -- stunned observers. The Arnulfistas had 
languished in fourth place or worse in most polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still people for whom the memory of Arnulfo, whether they knew him 
or not, is important," said Margaret E. Scranton, a political scientist at the 
University of Arkansas who is in Panama to observe the elections. "It is the 
concept of Arnulfo -- the patron, a party boss who can fix things for you . . . 
or get you a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the PRD and the Arnulfistas have fostered patronage systems, where state 
bureaucracies were used to create and provide jobs. That practice is harder in 
today's economy, and party faithful may be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bigger unknown is whether the PRD can work with the Arnulfistas and 
other traditional enemies. Perez Balladares is already trying to allay fears 
and send messages of reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 His first act Monday, for example, was to pay a personal visit to Christian 
Democrat leader Ricardo Arias Calderon, a champion in the fight against 
Noriega. And the newspaper controlled by Perez Balladares' running mate, Tomas 
Gabriel Altamirano Duque, reported that at least five Cabinet portfolios will 
be offered to people who are not PRD members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Panamanians are saying that the dark days are behind us and we are looking to 
the future," Perez Balladares said as election returns confirmed his victory. 
"Now, united despite differing political groups, we must begin to construct the 
future of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the urgency of the canal takeover, the closing of U.S. 
military bases here and the transfer of thousands of acres to Panama will force 
Perez Balladares to seek compromise with his opponents. Winning with a third of 
the vote limits his mandate and will force him to cut deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who negotiated the canal treaties with 
Torrijos and led a team of international observers monitoring the elections, 
said he is confident that today's PRD is changed because Noriega is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results of these elections show that the Panamanian people in their own 
minds and at the ballot boxes distinguished between the presence and influence 
of Noriega and the new leaders who have now been anointed to lead the country," 
said Carter, who also monitored a violent 1989 election annulled by Noriega 
when his handpicked candidate lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are less certain. The conservative La Prensa newspaper, Panama's 
largest, printed a banner headline proclaiming, "The PRD Returns to Power." 
</P>
<P>
 An editorial cartoon, using Perez Balladares' nickname, announced that "The 
Bull" won the election and then added, "I hope to God democracy won't be 
gored."

TECHNOLOGY; SCOTTSDALE VIES FOR BIG BOOST FROM NASA'S VAST DATABASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 For decades, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration made the nation 
proud by sending Americans to the moon and launching legions of robot vehicles 
and satellites into orbit and to other worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 But a series of failures, including the shuttle Challenger disaster and the 
faulty Hubble Space Telescope, and the end of the Cold War changed that, 
prompting many to ask whether it made sense to foot the bill for any space 
program simply for its prestige value. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of dwindling budgets, NASA now is taking aim at earthly problems 
by making the terabytes upon terabytes of data it has gathered in space over 
the last 30 years available to the public. The goal is to stimulate economic 
growth and improve the quality of life and education for those who foot the 
bill for the nation's space programs -- the American taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 This booming Arizona resort community of well-landscaped lawns, golf course 
fairways and Western-style stucco homes is competing to be among the first to 
benefit from NASA's new High Performance Computing and Communications Program. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 communities, high-tech corporations, school districts and 
farming businesses across the nation have submitted proposals for using NASA's 
vast databases via the Internet, a system of more than 7,000 networks linking 1 
million host computers and 8 million users that is paving the way for the 
"information superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 NASA stopped accepting proposals for the pilot project on Monday, and winners 
of the coveted cooperative agreements will be announced sometime in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the challenges ahead, it is no wonder that Scottsdale is vying for the 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
 It was born a dusty, one-square-mile hamlet of 2,000 people in 1951, and has 
mushroomed into a 185-square-mile city of 165,000 people that attracts 5 
million snowbirds a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Scottsdale officials say they need all the help they can get to accommodate 
business and residential growth without destroying the surrounding Sonoran 
Desert landscape of scenic mountains, boulder outcroppings and Saguaro cactus 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, change is magnified at the interface between urban development and 
fragile desert terrain. Here, too, data collected by remote sensing equipment 
aboard satellites about plants, soil, air, water, wind, rain and even lightning 
strikes in the region would be invaluable in determining, for example, where 
best to put a new road or a relocated business. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of dispatching survey crews to map plans for a hiking trail, planners 
could request the relevant data from NASA and, with a click of a computer 
mouse, receive everything they need to make an informed decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shaping the future of a rapidly growing community such as ours means coming 
up with short- and long-term strategies," Scottsdale City Manager Richard 
Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tool would allow us to play out an array of future scenarios," he added. 
"It could also make us more competitive than other communities in terms of 
attracting corporations looking for a place to set up technology centers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers also has high hopes that securing a cooperative agreement with NASA 
could spark new interest in a proposed space science center for Scottsdale that 
has suffered from a lack of focus and financing. 
</P>
<P>
 That project was falling apart until Scottsdale hired former aerospace 
engineer and space exploration enthusiast Wil Orr a year ago to pick up the 
pieces and round up financial partners ranging from school districts to 
high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredibly exciting for us," Orr said. "And it heralds a new era for 
NASA. After 30 years of exploring outer space, NASA is coming home." 
</P>
<P>
 And NASA may have more to gain from the program than the communities that want 
to tap into its databases at barely more than the cost of placing a 
long-distance telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hunter, program manager of the space agency's new information service, 
said that "the hope is that, as these applications start to become visible and 
public, more and more people will see that NASA missions are relevant to 
everyday life."

CULTURE; COWBOY POETRY IS ROPING AMERICANS INTO ITS RHYTHM; AT 150 EVENTS A

 Sunny Hancock had covered many miles by the time he eased his weary cowboy 
legs around the chair and sat down. He sighed and gazed into the distance as he 
gathered himself for the task ahead. Then a grin broke the creases on his 
weathered face, and the words started tumbling out in a silky Oregon drawl: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I traded for a horse one time  
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't take no beauty prize  
</P>
<P>
 Great big long-eared blue roan gelding  
</P>
<P>
 Not too bad for weight or size  
</P>
<P>
 I had to make some long old circles  
</P>
<P>
 And this trader guaranteed  
</P>
<P>
 That horse would show me lots of country  
</P>
<P>
 And not need too much rest or feed  
</P>
<P>
 He said "No this here ain't no kid horse  
</P>
<P>
 But he'll pack you up the crick  
</P>
<P>
 He will hump up on some occasions  
</P>
<P>
 And he has been known to kick  
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't trade him to anyone without having some remorse  
</P>
<P>
 But if you're sure enough a cowpuncher, mister  
</P>
<P>
 He's your kind of horse.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock was in full flight now, and his audience at the Library of Congress 
listened raptly as the old cowboy poet rambled through his original poem, 
"Horse Trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Hancock is a cowboy poet -- one of a growing number of rough and ready 
ropers with a passion for preserving their culture through verse. The art form 
is getting so popular that cowboys and cowgirls now gather at about 150 
different poetry events in the West every year, and it is reaching into the 
more serious art world. 
</P>
<P>
 So while the literati are not necessarily accustomed to the rowdy and rhythmic 
tales of life in the West, they are filling up the chairs at readings elsewhere 
in the country, including the one held last month at the Library of Congress in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was a little radical about our event was that we were trying to cross 
over two worlds that normally don't come together," said Alan Jabbour, director 
of the library's American Folklife Center. "I think you found a lot of puzzled 
reactions from many in the literary community." 
</P>
<P>
 Those puzzled reactions, Jabbour said, stem from the unique nature of the 
poetry. It is written to be recited like a story or fable, rather than read in 
a book, and makes use of simple rhyme schemes rather than complex poetic 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts from "A Cowboy Reel," by one of the library event's featured poets, 
Montana resident Paul Zarzyski, is typical of the style: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The real cowboy's rare as hen's teeth,  
</P>
<P>
 As watermelons vine-ripened in Alaska-  
</P>
<P>
 Extinct as Brontosaurus  
</P>
<P>
 On the plains or in the forest  
</P>
<P>
 But these purebloods, they'll brashly up and ask ya,  
</P>
<P>
 "Ever seen a gen-u-wine, authentic, real cowboy?"  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boredom gave birth to the art of cowboy poetry in the late 1800s, as more and 
more pioneers began settling in the West without the luxuries so readily 
available on the other side of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one way to entertain each other when there was no entertainment 
around," said Hal Cannon, the artistic director of the Western Folklife Center 
in Elko, Nev. "Everyone knew a poem or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Poems actually became more popular than songs among cowboys, Cannon said, 
because they were a much easier form for telling stories and weren't as 
potentially embarrassing as singing. 
</P>
<P>
 While never getting widespread exposure in the literary world, cowboy poetry 
endured even as the ranks of cowboys dwindled in this century. The art form had 
spawned a few books and pamphlets that recorded some earlier poems, but a 
handful of cowboy poets decided something more should be done to preserve their 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step came at a folklore gathering at the Library of Congress in 
1980, where Cannon, along with a small group of enthusiasts, laid the 
groundwork for a regional gathering of cowboy poets in Elko. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of fund raising and planning, Cannon hesitantly organized the 
first cowboy poetry gathering in 1985, worried that the event would fail. Turns 
out that cowboys, spectators and journalists showed up in droves, spawning 
numerous gatherings elsewhere and establishing the Elko roundup as a yearly 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was just such a spirit of excitement that these people who didn't know 
each other could come together with a common interest," Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow its resurgence is linked to the sense that its way of life is at 
risk," Jabbour said. "It took the initial event to give focus to it and bring 
it on stage for everybody to contemplate." 
</P>
<P>
 That cowboy poetry has become the rage surprises Sunny Hancock. "I thought it 
was strictly for cowboys and that not many people would identify with it," he 
said. "But America seems to be on a cowboy kick these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock, 63, was a cowboy before he retired, and his poetry was inspired by 
cowboys he's heard reciting poems his entire life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current cowboy poet is an ambassador; a savior," Zarzyski said. "It's 
important that we pay tribute to our tradition that we represent."

U.S. OFFICIALS CAUTION MEXICO AGAINST ELECTION FRAUD; POLITICS: CHRISTOPHER 
PRAISES REFORMS BUT WARNS OF CONSEQUENCES IF THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE IS TAINTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING and DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the midst of this nation's tumultuous presidential campaign, top Clinton 
Administration officials gently warned the Mexican government Monday that any 
hints of taint in the election this fall could be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding a two-day mission here, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and other top Administration officials also delivered the 
message that the United States supports democratic reform in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "We applaud the far-reaching electoral reforms that Mexico has adopted over 
the last several years," Christopher said. "We trust that these reforms, 
combined with your new election technology, will produce a free and fair 
election that will give all Mexicans confidence in its outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Cabinet members' visit was long planned as one of a series of regular 
meetings between the two governments. 
</P>
<P>
 It came, however, at a delicate time -- as Mexicans are picking their next 
president and shortly after governing party candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was 
assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. officials worry that the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) -- 
which has ruled Mexico since 1929, often through vote fraud -- may be tempted 
to tamper with the election if its successor candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, 
appears in danger of losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the Administration says it is convinced that President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's administration plans to carry out a fair election. But 
Christopher repeatedly warned of the consequences if it does not. He did so 
subtly in a public speech at the Foreign Ministry and more bluntly in private, 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides supporting democratic reform, he warned against corruption and praised 
the economic and political reforms that have made Mexico one of Latin America's 
economic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The modernizing economic reforms of the Salinas administration have made 
Mexico a pacesetter for the region and for the world," Christopher said. They 
also have produced an era of unprecedented cooperation between Mexico and the 
United States, capped by last year's passage of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 While continuing those reforms in the political arena, the United States wants 
Mexico to intensify efforts to root out government corruption, especially the 
political power of wealthy drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To sustain trust in democracy, governments must attack the scourges of 
corruption and drug trafficking," Christopher said. "Government cannot be held 
accountable if its power can be bought. Authority will not be respected if the 
rule of law can be defied with impunity." 
</P>
<P>
 A Christopher aide said his warnings on free elections and corruption were 
deliberately understated and that State Department officials were more direct 
in private. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexicans read these statements very carefully and are hypersensitive to 
any sign that we are interfering in their internal affairs. So we didn't want 
to come on too strong in public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In private, U.S. officials also protested the Mexican government's failure to 
keep Salinas' commitment to extradite Serapio Zuniga Rios, a suspect in the 
rape of a 4-year-old Riverside County girl. The governments agreed to negotiate 
a written agreement on extradition procedures. Until it is completed, an 
agreement forbidding the abduction of alleged criminals and important to Mexico 
will not be signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher did not meet with any of the nine presidential candidates, aides 
said, to avoid any appearance of U.S. meddling. He acted appalled at the 
suggestion, made during a news conference, that his presence could be construed 
as support for the government -- and, by extension, the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides their worries about the fairness of this nation's political system, 
analysts have expressed concern that Mexico's progress toward a more open 
society has been threatened by a rising tide of violence, reflected in the 
slayings of both candidate Colosio and Tijuana Police Chief Federico Benitez 
Lopez, who was assassinated last month. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they are concerned that both assassinations may have been 
ordered by powerful drug traffickers allied with anti-reformist officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Both U.S. and Mexican officials are becoming increasingly worried about the 
corrupting influence of narcotics traffic on the government here. The news 
weekly Proceso stated that Finance Minister Pedro Aspe Armella has acknowledged 
that drug traffickers have permeated practically all levels of law enforcement 
in Mexico. Aspe's office could not immediately confirm that statement. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official said the Administration is concerned that 
Salinas' drive against corruption appears to have stalled and that drug 
traffickers appear to have increased their influence, especially in some local 
areas. "The central government's control over these things has weakened," the 
official said. "There has been a kind of institutional entropy."

 Serbian weapons are still hidden inside the U.N. exclusion zone around 
Gorazde, but Bosnian Serb curbs on U.N. movements are preventing peacekeepers 
from locating the arms, U.N. officials in Gorazde said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Bosnian Serb antiaircraft guns were found under bushes Sunday within the 
12-mile weapons exclusion zone around the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, U.N. 
officials said.The weapons were removed from the zone, where Serbs are 
forbidden from keeping heavy weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vienna, talks between Bosnian Croats and Muslims on the establishment of 
cantons in their U.S.-backed federation formed in March appeared stalled on the 
issue of borders for the new regions. Talks were to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
 And in northern Bosnia, Serbs shelled a mostly Muslim village at the edge of 
the U.N.-declared "safe area" of Tuzla, killing two 17-year-old girls and two 
other civilians, officials said.

KENNEDY DRAFTS OWN HEALTH CARE PLAN; REFORM: THE MEASURE, WHICH WOULD EXEMPT 
THE SMALLEST FIRMS, WILL GO TO HIS COMMITTEE NEXT WEEK. THE PRESIDENT CALLS IT 
'A GOOD START.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) bowed to political reality Monday and backed away from President 
Clinton's proposal that all employers help pay their workers' health costs, 
drafting a bill that would exempt the smallest, lowest-paying firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy plans to make his draft the starting point when his committee begins 
crafting its version of comprehensive health legislation next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, attending a health care promotional event in New York, called 
the senator's proposal "a good place to start" and said that he remains 
confident the so-called employer mandate will remain the cornerstone of health 
care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton noted that Kennedy's alternative meets his basic goal of assuring that 
all Americans have health coverage by Jan. 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before the Assn. for a Better New York and later at a town hall 
meeting in Cranston, R.I., the President reiterated his hope that Congress 
would pass health care legislation this year, saying "it would be irresponsible 
to walk away from this." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hired to press (the pace of change)," he said. "And that's what I'm 
going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Pounding his fist on a table at one point, Clinton ardently defended an array 
of controversial provisions of his plan, including caps on premiums, coverage 
for all Americans by 1998, a refusal to pay for reform through a broad-based 
tax and a requirement that businesses bear the largest share of employee health 
care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the provisions, the latter, the so-called employer mandate, has proved 
to be the single most controversial element. As proposed by the President, it 
would require businesses to pay up to 80% of the cost of their workers' 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Small businesses, in particular, have argued that the expense would force them 
to lay off workers and perhaps even shut down. The President's proposal to 
provide discounts for small firms has done little to quell the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's committee is the more liberal of the two Senate panels that will 
draft major health bills. His decision to scale back the employer mandate is 
the most conclusive indication yet that the provision is unlikely to survive in 
Congress exactly as Clinton has proposed it. Instead, it appears some other 
arrangement will be made for workers in the smallest firms. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar approach is under discussion by the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee. All five congressional committees with major jurisdiction over 
health care are struggling to produce bills by Memorial Day. Meeting that 
timetable would help Congress' chances of passing final legislation this year. 
Thus far, only one House subcommittee has approved any health reform 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's draft also is an effort by the Massachusetts Democrat to address 
some of the concerns expressed by moderate Republicans. They have complained 
that the Clinton plan is too complicated, burdensome and bureaucratic. 
</P>
<P>
 However, initial reaction among Republicans to the alternative plan Monday was 
unenthusiastic. "Sen. Kennedy's plan moves some of the pieces around but 
basically it is President Clinton's proposal done up in new packaging," said 
Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, the committee's ranking Republican and a 
potential swing vote. "The Kennedy plan includes the same heavy mandates, 
extensive government controls and a high price tag that have already turned the 
American people away from the President's plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Kassebaum contended that Kennedy's plan actually might be harder on small 
business than Clinton's, because it would provide them fewer subsidies to 
lighten the burden of paying for health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, only one Republican in either chamber of Congress, Sen. James M. 
Jeffords of Vermont, has endorsed the Clinton proposal. Over the last several 
months, however, Kennedy has been engaged in intensive talks with other GOP 
senators believed by Democrats to be willing to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy made several modifications in the Clinton plan. They include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Exempting the smallest firms from the responsibility of providing coverage: 
specifically, firms employing fewer than five workers making an average of less 
than $24,000 a year -- roughly 3.3 million companies employing about 5.5% of 
the work force. Companies that do not pay for benefits would instead pay a 2% 
payroll tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring workers in small firms that do not provide coverage to buy their 
own. Low income people would be eligible for government-financed discounts and 
no one would pay more than 3.9% of income toward health premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminating Clinton's plan to force the majority of Americans to buy their 
coverage from government-run purchasing cooperatives. Instead, joining a 
so-called "alliance" would be one of several options available to workers in 
firms employing more than 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 * Giving everyone the option of joining the health plan now available to 
government workers, including members of Congress. "If it's good enough for us, 
it's good enough for all Americans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Redirecting government subsidies to business. Instead of basing them on a 
firm's average payroll, they would be doled out according to individual wages.

GACY EXECUTED IN ILLINOIS FOR MURDERS OF 33; CRIME: HE RECEIVES LETHAL 
INJECTION AFTER LAST OF HIS APPEALS IS REJECTED. THE SERIAL KILLER WAS 
CONVICTED IN 1980 FOR THE SLAYINGS OF BOYS AND YOUNG MEN. 
</P>

<P>
 Serial killer John Wayne Gacy, the part-time clown who killed 33 youths and 
buried most of them in trenches beneath his suburban Chicago home, was executed 
early today by lethal injection after the U.S. Supreme Court turned down his 
final appeal for a stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois prison officials and witnesses to the execution said Gacy, 52, was 
pronounced dead by a prison physician at 12:58 a.m. Illinois Department of 
Corrections Director Howard A. Peters III said Gacy "took a deep breath and 
dozed off" as a sedative took effect. Within minutes, synthetic curare slowed 
his respiration and potassium chloride stopped his heart. "He just laid there 
and appeared to be asleep," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The execution was delayed for several minutes, Peters said, because of a 
malfunction in the syringe that pumped pancuronium bromide, a synthetic muscle 
relaxant, into Gacy's veins. Technicians shut down the process when they 
noticed the chemical "gelling or clotting in the line," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident marked the second time since Illinois officials reinstituted the 
death penalty that the lethal injection process has been flawed by 
malfunctions. In 1990, the execution of Charles Walker was also interrupted by 
a malfunction in the injection device. Prison officials insisted that the 
process does not require further scrutiny, insisting that it has worked 
efficiently in scores of tests. "We had to make some adjustments at this time 
but the process worked effectively," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy did not struggle and was very cooperative, prison officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Gacy was strapped down to the gurney that carried him to the death 
chamber, he told prison officials that the loss of his life would "not 
compensate for the loss of all the other lives," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy's last hours dwindled Monday night in a cinderblock-walled cell at 
Stateville Correctional Center near Joliet. His night passed in a routine that 
has become traditional on America's Death Rows: a final meal (he requested 
french fries, fried shrimp, fried chicken and fresh strawberries), last rites 
from a prison chaplain and an hour of solitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy was convicted in 1980 for murdering 33 boys and young men after luring 
them to his ranch-style home near O'Hare International Airport. Some were male 
prostitutes, but many were high school-age youths who came to his house 
expecting work with his construction firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains of 27 victims were found buried in lime under his house. Two other 
bodies were buried in the back yard and four more were pulled from the Des 
Plaines River west of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, a city that had largely forgotten him, television stations 
interrupted regular programming to carry Gacy updates on the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters vied to land telephone interviews with the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Daley Plaza, the City Hall courtyard in Chicago's Loop business district, 
1,000 death penalty supporters gathered to celebrate Gacy's impending 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
 They released balloons and carried placards mocking Gacy's fascination with 
clowns and his penchant for appearing as a clown character named Pogo to 
entertain at charity functions. He also played a clown at children's parties.

<P>
 Prosecutors dropped all World Trade Center bombing charges against a Jordanian 
on Monday, admitting they lacked evidence to convict him. He pleaded guilty to 
a lesser count of lying on an immigration form. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilal Alkaisi, 29, will not cooperate with prosecutors under the deal, his 
lawyer, Robert L. Ellis, said after a hearing in federal court. He continues to 
be held without bail pending his sentencing July 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Alkaisi was one of seven Muslim fundamentalists charged in the Feb. 26, 1993, 
bombing. Four were convicted March 4 of all charges, including conspiracy and 
explosives counts, and await sentencing. The two others are believed to have 
fled the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Alkaisi faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the 
immigration violation.

ANTI-ABORTION GROUPS ORDERED TO PAY WOMEN'S CLINIC $1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A women's clinic was awarded $1.01 million in punitive damages Monday from two 
anti-abortion groups that staged confrontational protests during the 1992 
Republican National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Rescue was ordered to pay $350,000 to Planned Parenthood of 
Southeast Texas.Rescue America was ordered to pay $355,000, and leaders Don 
Treshman and the Rev. Keith Tucci were ordered to pay $155,000 and $150,000, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 Harris County jurors Thursday had also awarded the clinic $204,585 in 
actual damages after finding that the groups and two others -- Dallas Rescue 
and the Lambs of Christ -- conspired to hinder business at Planned Parenthood 
and nine other clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Planned Parenthood did not seek punitive damages against the smaller groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The abortion foes said they would appeal the case and in the meantime would 
pay nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to accept this. This is an invalid verdict, and that's why 
we're going to challenge it," Treshman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Richard Schmude, who represented the abortion opponents, said he was 
"shocked and outraged" by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Reiner, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, said the hefty punitive 
award expands an already-clear message from the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very clear message that people who engage in this conduct will be 
held accountable," Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planned Parenthood, the only plaintiff to seek monetary damages, listed extra 
security, fencing, vandalism and lost business as reasons for actual damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiner said her group has been tracking the abortion opponents' assets and 
will try aggressively to collect on the awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-abortion activists staged daily demonstrations at the clinics during 
the GOP convention in Houston.

PUSH TO END PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS CHANGES U.S. SPY GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The intensified American effort to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons 
is forcing changes in the way the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies do 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 CIA Director R. James Woolsey and his immediate predecessor, Robert M. Gates, 
both put gathering information about weapons proliferation at the top of the 
U.S. intelligence agenda. There have been hints that this is one of the few 
areas where American agents may still engage in presidentially approved covert 
actions against foreign targets. 
</P>
<P>
 And chances are that the U.S. intelligence community will be asked to 
concentrate even more on proliferation problems in the future to meet the 
Pentagon's recent requests for more militarily useful information about nuclear 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many CIA and other intelligence officials are doing different 
things in different ways from what they did in the rituals of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 They are keeping track of dilapidated Third World factories, monitoring the 
movements and traffic patterns of ships on the high seas and trying to 
intercept faxes and phone calls sent across continents from one luxurious 
private company to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the United States and the Soviet Union were directing espionage against 
one another, it was a very important contest, but it was a contest that was 
played according to certain rules . . . ," Woolsey said in December. "Weapons 
proliferators don't come to many embassy cocktail parties. One has to work very 
hard in a lot of different ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, American efforts to collect intelligence about the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons did not begin with the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 During the early 1960s, American intelligence officials succeeded in 
collecting information about China's nuclear weapons program before the first 
successful Chinese test explosion in 1964. American U-2 spy planes, based in 
Taiwan and making flights over China, took pictures of a plant designed to 
enrich uranium for nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA beefed up its efforts after India conducted a nuclear test in 1974. 
And U.S. intelligence officials were proud of their work in gathering 
information about Pakistan's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. intelligence effort has not always been so successful. The most 
notable failure was in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "We discovered that Saddam Hussein had a much more extensive nuclear weapons 
program under way than we knew at the time," then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin 
acknowledged in December. "Moreover, we learned later that during the war, we 
had failed to destroy his biological and chemical war efforts. We don't want to 
be caught like that again." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, then-CIA Director William H. Webster set up a special new 
intelligence unit called the Non-Proliferation Center. It was designed to put 
together a group of specialists from different intelligence agencies to monitor 
the spread of technology that can be used for weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times has reported that in 1991, then-President George Bush signed a 
secret directive authorizing the CIA to develop plans, including covert action, 
to block the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That directive 
ordered the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies to make proliferation one 
of their top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Non-Proliferation Center includes not only intelligence analysts who 
digest information but also case officers who are in charge of running spies 
and mounting intelligence operations. Like other parts of the U.S. intelligence 
community, the center recently has been forced to deal with budget cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey recently said that the Non-Proliferation Center seeks to "uncover and 
interdict" attempts by countries seeking weapons of mass destruction to acquire 
technology, designs, components and military systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. officials, particularly in the Pentagon, say they believe the center 
should be improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for intelligence that is useful militarily, not just 
intelligence that's useful diplomatically," Aspin said last year.

PARK RANGERS KILL COUGAR SUSPECTED OF CHARGING BOY

<P>
 Park rangers tracked and killed an adult female mountain lion in Cuyamaca 
Rancho State Park Monday, a day after a big cat charged a child. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal trackers found the 83-pound lion after a brief search. An 
Arizona family hiking in the park in San Diego County told officials that the 
animal bared its teeth and crouched to spring. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state officials, a lion rushed to within five feet of a 
3-year-old boy on a trail near Paso Picacho campground. The boy's father said 
he managed to scare the cat off. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northern California last week, trackers hunted and killed a mountain lion 
suspected of mauling a jogger to death April 23 on a secluded mountain trail.

GAY MEN BECOME NO. 1 HATE-CRIME TARGETS; HUMAN RELATIONS: FOR THE FIRST TIME, 
BLACKS ARE SUPPLANTED AS THE MOST FREQUENT VICTIMS. SUCH CRIMES ARE UP OVERALL, 
COUNTY FIGURES SHOW, BUT RATE OF INCREASE SLOWS. 
</P>

<P>
 For the first time since the county began keeping track, African Americans 
have been supplanted by gay men as the leading target of hate crimes, according 
to the 14th annual report of the Los Angeles County Commission on Human 
Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate crimes were up 6.4% overall in 1993, although the percentage of increase 
was smaller than in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay men were targeted in 27% of the 783 hate crimes logged by local law 
enforcement agencies and community groups in 1993; 22.9% of the hate crimes 
were directed against blacks and 14.6% were directed against Jews. Whites were 
fourth. Jews were the targets of 95.8% of hate crimes against religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Mornell, the commission's outgoing executive director, called the 
report a barometer of public opinion representing the feelings of larger groups 
who held similar views but did not act on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are more angry, more willing to confront, willing to chance going out 
in public and getting caught," Mornell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report shows that there has been a steady escalation in violence, with 
assaults now accounting for 43.2% of all hate crimes. Last year, for the first 
time since the county began keeping records in 1980, more hate crimes were 
committed in public places than at residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission officials, who called for stiffer penalties for hate crimes, said 
the most dramatic increase came in incidents based on sexual orientation, which 
rose 49.7% from the previous year. Gay rights advocates attributed this to 
greater willingness by victims to come forward and to a higher public profile 
about issues such as gays in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not surprised, but we're alarmed," said Liza Culick of the Los Angeles 
Gay & Lesbian Community Services Center. "There's been an increased visibility. 
We're out there demonstrating, fighting for our rights. That . . . foments 
hatred." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Berry, a Los Angeles spokesman for the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, said the shift may reflect higher visibility for 
gays rather than real progress for African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something needs to be done to stop hate crimes across the board and not just 
against one segment of the population, so that we can look at consistent and 
steady decreases instead of a few percentage points," Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever the economy is bad, people tend to take out their frustrations on 
minorities," he continued. "There needs to be more education for people 
perpetrating these crimes and also greater enforcement of penalties, because if 
it's a slap on the wrist, they won't think about it twice." 
</P>
<P>
 His concern for enhanced enforcement was echoed by representatives of other 
racial groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "All too often we hear of police showing up to a home where there's racist 
graffiti on the wall and the family is told, 'Oh, it's only kids,' " said Kathy 
Imahara, a civil rights staff attorney with the Asian Pacific American Legal 
Center. "That family is not going to report such an incident again." 
</P>
<P>
 Crimes against Asian Americans dropped significantly, from 80 in 1992 to 44 in 
1993. But commission officials believe crimes against both Asian Americans and 
Latinos are underreported because of language problems, cultural barriers and 
fears of immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Imahara added that hate crimes seem to mirror the issues being debated by 
politicians and in the media and that anti-Asian sentiment may merely be ebbing 
this year as other topics attract greater notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of things happening in 1992 that were fomenting 50-year-old 
hatreds. There were the riots, Bush's trip to Japan, the whole Japan-bashing 
thing and buying American," Imahara said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, a year in which U.S. politicians increasingly blamed immigrants for 
the country's economic woes, about half the crimes logged against Asians and 
Latinos included anti-immigrant sentiments, Mornell said. 
</P>
<P>
 While hate crimes have risen each year since 1985, the percentage of increase 
has slowed. The county recorded a 22% rise in hate crimes in 1991, a 10% rise 
in 1992 and 6.4% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission report was compiled from hate-crime data provided by nine law 
enforcement agencies in Los Angeles County, including the Sheriff's Department, 
the Los Angeles Police Department and six other city police departments. 
Mornell said he did not know whether apathy, lack of funding or absence of 
crimes to report kept other local police agencies from filing, but said he 
believes the commission report is representative. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the Department of Justice lacks the funds to collect hate crime 
data from local law enforcement agencies, although it is required to do so by 
law. Mornell said the commission supports a bill currently under consideration 
by the state Legislature that would provide $264,000 for that purpose. Crimes 
of Hate 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, gay men have supplanted blacks as the leading target of 
hate crimes, according to the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations. 
Here is how the number of hate crimes broke down in 1993: 
</P>

PUCK PROBLEMS; ROLLER HOCKEY'S THE RAGE, BUT FINDING A PLACE TO PLAY CAN BE 
TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA and CHAU LAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Nordiques and the Panthers were on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 First they were booted from a shopping mall parking lot in West Hills. Then 
they got kicked out of an elementary school. And it was all because neighbors 
complained that the roller hockey teams made too much noise when the pucks hit 
the boards, or when their skates clattered across the asphalt, or when 
exuberant parents shouted too loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, after they were chased outside the Los Angeles city limits, the 
players, ages 8 to 13, found a third site for practice games: a Calabasas 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The saga of the Nordiques and the Panthers is not unusual. Roller hockey is 
the new youth sport rage in Southern California, with many kids setting aside 
baseballs and basketballs and creating hockey hotbeds in communities from Los 
Angeles to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the sport's popularity continues to grow, so does the number of school 
districts or businesses banning the activity because they don't want to be held 
liable if players get hurt, even though most, if not all, organized leagues 
have insurance. The Los Angeles Unified School District is among those that has 
prohibited the sport on its campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have designed areas that are safe to play," said Jim Sugahara, head 
of outdoor recreation programs for the giant district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grounds have a lot of cracks, and children may run into basketball 
poles," he said. "It's not conducive to roller-skating or roller-blading. It's 
just not designed for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 But parents and coaches who have seen children abandon Little League baseball 
and other established sports to play roller hockey disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just excuses," said Steve Shepp, a coach for the Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't need much other than a blacktop," he said, adding that all players 
in his league are required to wear proper equipment and that all the games are 
supervised. 
</P>
<P>
 But fear of lawsuits has prompted schools and businesses -- places with big 
parking lots -- to put a damper on the popular pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our security people on weekends have chased some kids and young adults off of 
our school sites," said Brad Lantz, student services director for the Tustin 
Unified School District in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 These are growing pains being felt throughout the region as pint-size Wayne 
Gretzkys pour out of neighborhood cul-de-sac pickup games, looking for 
organized teams and places to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordiques and Panthers, two teams from the West Valley Roller Hockey 
League, have missed a total of about three weeks of practice since the season 
began in late March; they have twice lost their playing privileges when 
neighbors and school officials complained of noise, heavy traffic and the 
destruction of property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once or twice a puck went through a school window. However, they did replace 
them," said Ilene Meyers, principal of Lockhurst Drive Elementary School in 
Woodland Hills. After a six-month tryout, she decided not to allow the West 
Valley league to practice on her playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just didn't work out," said Meyers. "Our school is in a residential 
neighborhood. It was difficult for people living there." 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches got on the phones again and called more churches and private 
businesses with big parking lots. But the answer was always no, with the same 
concerns cited, said Pete Hogenson, the Panthers' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't hold practice for about two weeks because we didn't have a 
practice site," said Hogenson, whose 8-year-old son, Jake, plays on the team. 
"We didn't want to take these kids to go and practice at somebody's abandoned 
parking lot without permission." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Chaparral Elementary School in Calabasas agreed to allow the teams to 
practice twice a week for a total of three hours. The players and coaches 
couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few places in Southern California where young roller hockey players 
get a welcome is Side by Side Rinks in Huntington Beach. League play goes on 23 
hours a day, seven days a week. Players show up at 1 a.m. for the final set of 
league games. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 a.m., the rink shuts down -- for an hour. At 5 a.m., the next day of 
roller hockey begins. 
</P>
<P>
 But the search for less formal practice sites has posed a minor law 
enforcement problem, as police officers encounter weekend hockey games on 
school property and force the players to clear out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police come out and tell us to leave, the principals come out and tell us 
to leave; I think it's really stupid," said Brian Fletcher, 17, who plays for a 
junior team in Mission Viejo. For Fletcher, "roller hockey is the best sport in 
the world. You get going so fast, you get so much speed, it's kind of a rush. 
Then when you score a goal, and you get really pumped." 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of youth roller hockey was made possible by two events, 
enthusiasts agree: The successful marketing of in-line skates -- with a series 
of wheels set in a single line between the heel and toe -- and the celebrity of 
Los Angeles Kings superstar Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 While the problem with playing sites centers on schools, some cities are also 
concerned enough about liability to take a hard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Trudell, a spokesman for the Garden Grove Unified School District, said 
his 9-year-old son and his friends have been shooed away from parks by city 
employees in Anaheim Hills. "It's really overpowering my son's desire to play 
football or baseball. He loves to play roller hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 John Black, who managed Roller Hockey International's Los Angeles Blades 
franchise last year, also organizes youth roller hockey tournaments throughout 
Southern California and has seen the phenomenal growth of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see the gleam in a kid's eyes when they talk hockey," he said. "The 
word you hear over and over is addictive. This sport has really taken root, and 
it's definitely here to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Black and other roller hockey organizers say the only thing holding the game 
back is lack of proper facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have organized baseball, basketball and soccer. Why can't we have 
organized roller hockey?" said Panthers coach Hogenson. "I'd like to see it be 
a part of city parks and recreation programs." 
</P>
<P>
 With schools conveniently located in most neighborhoods, most roller hockey 
players wind up in the schoolyard. A better way needs to be found, everyone 
agrees, but progress toward developing roller hockey facilities has been slow. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of finding a place to play, though increasingly common, is not 
new. George Williams, 34, owner of the Reseda Roller Hockey League, recalls 
that even before the era of in-line skates -- when he and his young Burbank 
buddies wore sneakers to play street hockey -- the sport was not a big hit with 
authority figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been kicked out of every schoolyard, every tennis court and every 
supermarket parking lot," Williams said. "We knew every cop in Burbank by 
name."

SCOTT HARRIS: WHO'S ULTIMATELY WHO IN 'WHO'S WHO'

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lives of great men all remind us  
</P>
<P>
 We can make our lives sublime.  
</P>
<P>
 And, departing, leave behind us  
</P>
<P>
 Footprints on the sands of time.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 
</P>
<P>
 I bet you didn't know that Mike Antonovich has such big feet. The Who's Who 
Historical Society, which chose Longfellow's rhyme as a prologue in the 1994 
edition of "Who's Who in California," figures the Los Angeles County supervisor 
for a size 38. Now, maybe he won't leave such big prints in the sands of time, 
but that's how many lines appear under the "Who's Who" entry for "ANTONOVICH, 
MICHAEL D." 
</P>
<P>
 How big is a 38? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider that, by this measure, "REAGAN, RONALD WILSON" is merely a size 19 -- 
only half that of Antonovich. ("REAGAN, NANCY," incidentally, is a size 30, 
which should raise fresh questions about who was really running America back 
then.) 
</P>
<P>
 And how does Mike Antonovich compare to his colleagues on the Board of 
Supervisors? 
</P>
<P>
 Deane Dana is a size 17. As for Ed Edelman, Gloria Molina and Yvonne 
Braithwaite Burke, well, there's some sad news. The liberal majority of the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors, it seems, consists entirely of 
non-entities. They don't rate a single line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, Molina and Burke shouldn't take it too hard. They aren't the only 
Californians of note ignored by "Who's Who in California." 
</P>
<P>
 A quick check revealed that although former Gov. Edmund (Pat) Brown is listed, 
Jerry and Kathleen are mentioned merely as his children. And speaking of 
Browns, the Assembly Speaker named Willie has no mention at all. Likewise, 
there is nothing concerning Senate Majority Leader David Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 By now you may be wondering why it is that "Who's Who" would list such 
Republicans as Antonovich and Dana while ignoring Democrats of equal or greater 
significance. Curious, I looked up Richard Riordan, or Dick Riordan to his 
friends. Perhaps you've heard of him. He's the Republican who last year was 
elected mayor of Los Angeles. Perhaps you've heard of Los Angeles. It is 
California's most populous city. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Riordan? "Who's Who in California" has never heard of him. 
</P>
<P>
 But "RIORDAN, CAROL CAMPBELL," that's a different story. She's got 21 lines. 
She's a "university television producer, entertainment and media consultant" 
who is affiliated with San Diego State University. You learn something new 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 These omissions aren't limited to the world of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say you want to bone up for a meeting with MCA/Universal honcho Lew 
Wasserman, one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. To prepare, you reach for 
"Who's Who" and look him up. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see . . . Here's a Ware, a Warne, three Warners, two Warrens and, 
finally, Wasserman. But no. This is "WASSERMAN, BRUCE ARLEN." He's a dentist in 
San Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
 Or how about Michael Eisner, the Walt Disney Co. chairman? There's no Eisner 
at all. The closest you'll come is a fellow named Eisemann, a math professor in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked up a few other names that any book titled "Who's Who in California" 
should have. It was nice to see that California's senators, Dianne Feinstein 
and Barbara Boxer, both made the cut. But like fellow Democrat gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi didn't make it. 
Former Mayor Tom Bradley is mentioned, but not former Mayor Sam Yorty. 
Hollywood, I figured, would be well represented. Looking up Steven Spielberg, I 
stumbled across studio executive Dawn Steel. Never did find Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this seems a bit dubious from a publisher that in 1992 boasts that " 
'Who's Who in California' is today recognized as the most reliable biographical 
reference work on Californians of achievement." You can take their word for it. 
</P>
<P>
 This "Who's Who" -- and there are others, by different publishers -- raises 
more questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A question that occurs over and over again is 'How was I selected to appear' 
or 'What does it take to be included,' " the publisher wrote in the foreword to 
the 1991 edition. "The only criteria we use in choosing candidates are 
achievement and/or position. Ultimate selection is based on reference value and 
demonstrated merit. In any event no biographee is admitted to these pages based 
merely on desire, wealth or social standing." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, this didn't reassure me. I mean no disrespect to Carol Riordan and 
Bruce Wasserman, but I suspect their namesakes may have greater "reference 
value." Perhaps the criteria were changed for the 1994 edition, which offers no 
explanation about its methodology. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to call up Edna L. Barrett, who is listed as executive director and 
editor, to ask her about the book's oversights and, especially, the financial 
aspects of this "Who's Who." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynics may suspect this to be the equivalent of the classified section of the 
vanity press, but I don't think so. Many years ago, an honor-student friend of 
mine received such an invitation to appear in a book called "Who's Who Among 
America's High School Students," or something like that. Goodness knows how 
many proud parents spend good money buying that book. I want to ask Edna 
Barrett who buys "Who's Who." My sincere hope is the "biographees" are the 
primary market and libraries don't spend public money on a work that is, to put 
it kindly, lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, "Who's Who in California" doesn't include the address of the 
Who's Who Historical Society, which seems kind of strange. Perhaps this is 
another oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if I were responsible for this book, I wouldn't want to 
make it easy for anybody to track my footprints on the sands of time.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CITY DELAYS PICKING COMPUTER ADVISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has asked for a more formal selection of the consultant who 
will receive up to $100,000 to help develop a million-dollar computer system 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer contract became a sensitive issue for the city last month when 
City Manager Allan L. Roeder received an anonymous letter accusing him and 
other city officials of improperly recommending a Newport Beach consultant to 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department investigated, at Roeder's request, and declared that 
nothing illegal or improper had been done. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Director Susan Temple asked the council recently to authorize a 
contract with AEF Systems Consulting Inc. The Newport Beach firm has been 
highly recommended by other cities that have bought expensive computer systems, 
Temple said. The city will spend at least $1 million on the system, said 
Communications Director Vincent M. Whelan. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said they want Temple to formally request the 
qualifications of other consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the end result is going to change any, but it takes any doubt 
away from the process," said Councilman Peter Buffa. The council voted 4 to 1 
to delay selecting a consulting firm until Temple receives statements of 
qualifications from other firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle voted against delaying the contract, saying she 
trusts the city's staff to select the consultant with whom it will work best. 
"I'm not going to attempt to design the system," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple said it could take six to eight weeks to get statements from consulting 
firms. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; KISS LEAVES EVERYONE SQUEALING

 Jimmy Dean apparently doesn't kiss on the first date. He squirmed and squealed 
as Connie Smith, principal of W. R. Nelson Elementary School, took him in her 
arms Monday as about 300 delighted students watched. 
</P>
<P>
 When Smith's puckered lips touched his quivering snout, Jimmy Dean shrieked in 
fright, sending the gathered students roaring in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Then some students rushed to touch him. The excitement seemed too much for the 
3-month-old Vietnamese potbellied pig. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone had fun as Smith fulfilled a promise she made in February to kiss a 
pig if the students succeeded in raising $5,000 through a reading fund-raiser 
called Partners in Excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, in fact, smooched Jimmy Dean twice because only half of the 700 
students can be accommodated at the school's multipurpose center at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 But while it was double fun for Smith and the students, it looked like double 
torture for Jimmy Dean, a five-pound black critter with a white band around his 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The students raised more than $6,000. Each student read seven books in seven 
weeks and asked seven sponsors to pay 50 cents for each book read. Smith said 
the money was used to buy several sets of encyclopedias. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't so bad," said Smith, of her first pig kiss. She admitted she 
browsed through many Orange County pet stores to get as much information about 
pigs as she could get. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried the pig might bite me," she said. She added that she had been 
concerned about her dress because "accidents" happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know who was more scared, the pig or me," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Dean, owned by Ellen Schreiber of Laguna Hills, was a last-minute 
replacement for "Pudge, The Pig," who weighs more than 300 pounds and could not 
be loaded on a truck to be taken to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Schreiber talked over the weekend and Schreiber offered Jimmy Dean. 
She has another pig, 100-pound Quigley, which also is too big to fit in her car 
and take to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 For Monday's kissing date with the principal, Schreiber said, she did nothing 
special for Jimmy Dean. The pig, which sleeps inside her house, had his usual 
fruits, vegetables and vitamins, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Dean didn't have a bath, cologne or breath freshener. He was not dressed 
up in any way. He was quiet while inside his plastic cage but once taken out, 
he squealed "like a bird," said one student. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a squealer, but he does not bite," said Schreiber, who bought the piglet 
for $175 a month ago from an Orange pet shop. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the W. R. Nelson Elementary students said that it was fun to see 
their principal kiss the pig. 
</P>
<P>
 But William Johnson, 10, a fourth-grade student, said that raising the money 
to buy books was as important to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need the encyclopedias and the other books," said William, who 
together with his sister, Joanna, 7, a first-grader, raised $65. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Saling, 10, said the pig was like a baby dog, but his hair was like a 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great fun," said third-grade teacher Cela Varosy. "Our principal was a 
good sport." BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; MORE STUDY DUE ON PARK/BEACH MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The question of when proposed construction on park or beach land must be 
placed before voters has been sent to a committee for further study. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Measure C, an initiative passed by 75% of the voters in 1990, residents 
must vote on any construction proposed for park or beach land. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is unclear whether a project should go before voters when first 
proposed or after receiving city approval. 
</P>
<P>
 A council subcommittee made up of Measure C authors recommended the latter. 
But some council members said the costly approval process places financial 
burdens on developers, which could include nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Members also said voters might not have enough information to make an informed 
decision. But Councilman David Sullivan, who was among the four authors of the 
measure, said people would "know what they are voting on." 
</P>
<P>
 The council has told the city staff and the subcommittee to develop a 
checklist to outline a project's financial impacts and parameters, including 
environmental concerns, specific design, size and location. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Hagan, community services director, said the checklist would allow any 
development on parks or beaches to be placed on a ballot before completion of 
the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, he said, would "be spending some money to get to a checklist 
but wouldn't be spending the full amount to get through the process." And 
voters would still have a clear picture of what they're voting on, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said he is weary of the checklist idea but willing to discuss it.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON; EX-OFFICER 
SENTENCED FOR STEALING FROM MOTORISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An former Compton police officer wept Monday as a judge sentenced her to a 
year in County Jail and five years probation for stealing from motorists she 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want me to sit here and tell you that I committed these crimes," a 
sobbing Charmagne Drew told Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan."If that is what 
is needed to gain my freedom and see my family, then that is what I will do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow, I don't believe that will even be enough," said Drew, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Tynan said he was convinced that Drew is "seriously distressed and needs help. 
The court feels that a state prison sentence would be destructive of Ms. Drew." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gail Ehrlich wanted the judge to sentence Drew to a maximum 
40-month term in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew was convicted in December on three of five grand theft counts of stealing 
from drivers she had pulled over. The ex-officer, who was sent to state prison 
for three months of diagnostic testing, was fired by the Compton Police 
Department in December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 During her testimony, Drew accused four of her victims of lying. She was 
caught when officers set up a sting. The jury found her guilty of taking $300.

HOMELESS AGAIN; HUD OFFICIALS TAKE BACK DUPLEX OCCUPIED BY PROTESTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeless protesters who illegally took over a vacant government-owned duplex 
in the Pico-Union district last week were forced to clear out Monday, under the 
threat of prosecution for trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 3 p.m., officials of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, assisted by several Los Angeles police officers, removed one 
squatter and boarded up the West 17th Place property where four homeless people 
had been living. Officials threatened to arrest anyone who tried to re-enter 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The squatters and several advocates for the homeless took over the Los Angeles 
property May 2 as part of a statewide effort to force the federal government to 
turn over abandoned U.S.-owned buildings to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Armstrong, the only person in the duplex when HUD officials arrived, 
agreed to leave without incident. She packed two canvas bags with clothes and 
food -- items donated during her weeklong stay in the run-down duplex -- and 
quietly walked out into the afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The other homeless people who had been staying at the duplex will have to make 
arrangements with HUD to get their belongs, including blankets and several 
couches, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll throw us out, yet this building will stand vacant," Armstrong said. 
"It's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, nearly a dozen properties from Long Beach to San Francisco were seized 
in an effort organized by the California Homeless Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Ming, area coordinator of HUD's Los Angeles office, said he tried to 
persuade the homeless people last week to leave the property and apply for 
government housing through normal HUD channels. When the squatters ignored his 
request, he said he had no choice but to evict them. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they did was illegal," Ming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, HUD officials and Long Beach police on Monday evicted several 
squatters from two houses taken over in that city. The occupants left without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Leonard, a network member and organizer of the Los Angeles break-in, said 
homeless activists hope the protest will prompt discussion with federal 
officials on the future use of vacant properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a strong moral position," Leonard said. "Although it is technically 
an illegal squat, HUD has the authority to make some kind of arrangement with 
us. . . . Instead they have thrown people onto the streets." TINA DAUNT

 An army of Warner Center workers will march down the streets of Woodland Hills 
on Thursday in a one-mile walk to raise money for the March of Dimes' fight 
against congenital defects and infant mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 1,500 walkers raised more than $85,000 for the March of Dimes 
Campaign for Healthier Babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers are hoping to surpass both statistics for the event's 12th year. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal this year is to include more than 2,000 walkers and raise $87,000, 
although organizers are worried that residents still rebuilding and replacing 
since the earthquake won't be able to donate as much as in past years, said 
Shelley Hutsler, marketing director for the March of Dimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Walkers are asked to get friends, family and colleagues to sponsor them. 
</P>
<P>
 The walk through Warner Center Business Park starts at noon at Warner Center 
Plaza I, 21600 Oxnard St. There are no prizes for speed, but the walkers will 
be awarded a free lunch from Subway. Registration begins at 11:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always looking for more walkers," Hutsler said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about walking or to submit donations, call the March of 
Dimes at (818) 972-9449. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; TAX FOR MORE POLICE CONSIDERED FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ballot measure to increase property taxes for more police officers will be 
discussed by the City Council this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a safe to say it is an option we are considering," said Mayor Donald L. 
Bone. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has yet to have a formal discussion on the concept, said City 
Manager Kevin O'Rourke. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's on the stack for upcoming discussion with the council," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone added that action to place a tax ballot measure before voters in November 
will also depend on decisions the council makes on the upcoming 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the council would have to decide by July to place a 
measure on the November ballot. Two-thirds of the voters would have to approve 
of the tax, Bone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Richard M. Tefank said the 87-member department needs more 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the demands for calls for service and the types of issues 
that we deal with in the community, there is always a need for additional 
resources," Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tefank also said that since 1991, the city has not filled vacancies for five 
police officer positions and four civilian positions in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Arthur C. Brown said he would support higher property taxes if it 
meant increased crime protection and faster responses to emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourke said the city faces an increasing challenge in keeping the current 
level of services with dwindling revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business as usual in the city is over and has been for a while," O'Rourke 
said. "The way we provide services to our community is changing." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WOMAN WHO AIDED ANNE FRANK TO TALK

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who preserved Anne Frank's diaries during World War II and helped 
bring them to the public's attention will speak at the Irvine Marriott hotel on 
May 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Miep Gies provided Anne Frank and her family with food and supplies after the 
Nazis invaded the Netherlands in 1942 and the Frank family was forced into 
hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, the family lived in the attic of an office, hiding from German 
troops. In 1944, they were discovered by the Nazis and sent to concentration 
camps, where most of them -- including Anne -- died. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, Gies discovered Anne Frank's journal entries, which would become 
the basis for one of the most popular books about the horrors of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Irvine lecture, Gies will discuss life in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam and 
detail her relationship with Anne Frank and her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the event are $40. The talk is sponsored by a group working to 
bring an exhibit about Anne Frank to Orange County, said organizer Bruce 
Giuliano. Dessert will be served, and Gies will answer questions from the 
audience.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; LANGUAGE INSTRUCTOR TEACHER OF THE YEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
 A teacher who helped her school win a top state award for language arts has 
been named Westminster School District's Teacher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis Warner Middle School teacher Marilyne Coats, 49, won the honor, partly 
for her work on the campus' Language Arts Demonstration Program, spokeswoman 
Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program trained teachers to adopt innovative instructional methods to 
improve students' language skills. The five-year, state-funded project recently 
received a prestigious first-place Golden Bell Award from the California School 
Boards Assn. earlier this year, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very happy," said Coats, who joined the district in 1983. "It's quite an 
honor to be selected from the fine teachers that we have today. I have a lot of 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Barbara Fileto praised Coats as "an outstanding role model for 
all the teachers in our district. She's energetic, devoted to her students and 
very willing to open her classroom to new and different teaching methods." JON

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTELOPE VALLEY; WORK 
ON TRACK TO SPEED METROLINK COMMUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metrolink officials Monday gave a tour of earthquake-related improvements to 
the track on the Santa Clarita line. The changes are designed to cut 30% off 
commuting times between the Antelope Valley and Los Angeles by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews are straightening many of the 50 curves on the commuter rail line 
between the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, allowing the average traveling 
speed to increase by 35 to 45 m.p.h., said San Bernardino County Supervisor 
Larry Walker, who chairs the Metrolink board of directors. The 78-mile trip 
from Lancaster to Los Angeles, which took 2 hours and 25 minutes when the line 
opened Jan. 24, will take an hour and 48 minutes when work is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the same time as driving a car that distance during rush hour," Walker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The line between Santa Clarita and Lancaster did not exist before the Jan. 17 
earthquake and was not scheduled for completion for at least 10 years. But the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency provided $50 million in emergency funds for 
the extension after the magnitude 6.8 temblor collapsed a connector ramp on the 
Antelope Valley Freeway, the only major highway route between the Antelope 
Valley and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 An existing rail line used for freight trains was converted to Metrolink use 
after the earthquake, but trains went more slowly than other Metrolink lines 
because of the numerous sharp curves, Walker said.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County prosecutors declined to file charges against the grandfather of a 
6-year-old Korean boy who accidentally shot his mother in the head with the 
man's gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Yun Taik Chung, 70, was asleep in front of the television in his Koreatown 
apartment, wearing his uniform and gun for his job as a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy took the .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun from his grandfather's 
waistband without anyone noticing and accidentally shot his mother, Hyang Ja 
Jung, in the head. Police presented a report on the shooting to the district 
attorney's office for possible prosecution. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Sheldon 
Levitin found that Chung was not criminally liable because he had the firearm 
on his person. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, an adult who keeps a loaded gun where a child can easily get it can be 
prosecuted for negligence.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; OLD TIRES MAY GIVE STREETS MORE MILEAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is using old tires to give new bounce to some of its streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are using more than 36,000 tires as part of an asphalt mix in repaving 
some streets, a technique that city officials say will make the streets last 
longer and costs less. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rubber (in the repaving mix) provides some preventive maintenance," said 
Keith Jones, the city's manager of streets. "This makes the streets a little 
more resistant to water penetration, which is the No. 1 enemy of streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Jone said the ground-up tires are also expected to save the city money by 
preventing the need for interim repairs with "slurry seals," a thin, watery 
mixture used for repaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually have to put on two slurry seals on the streets during a 15-year 
period, and this type of overlay (using ground-up tires) is supposed to defer 
at least one of those seals," said Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The repaving includes Harbor Boulevard from Trask Avenue to Westminster 
Avenue; McFadden Avenue from Ward Street to the city limits; Ward Street 
between Mast Avenue and McFadden Avenue, and 63 residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The work, which began last month ended Monday. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; NEW COMMUNICATION UNIT OKD FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved spending more than $1.1 million for a new, 
computerized communications system at the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $155,000 will be spent to hire three police officers who will 
staff the new communications system once it is set up, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously approved the two proposals last week in what they 
said was part of the effort to bring local policing into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for the communications equipment will come from cash and properties 
seized in drug-related cases. The salaries for the three new officers will come 
from Proposition 172 money, the half-cent sales tax voters approved last year 
for public safety services. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief W. Douglas Franks said the department's current equipment -- now 
more than 20 years old -- often breaks down and no longer meets the needs of a 
growing community. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last four years, (the equipment) has been the subject of a 
continual Band-Aid approach in order to keep it working adequately," Franks 
told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the new equipment will be bought from Motorola, the same company 
that won a contract to provide communication equipment for a countywide network 
scheduled to go into operation within the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new communications system, Franks said, police officers can dictate 
reports directly to a computer that has word-processing capabilities, instead 
of the current, time-consuming practice of dictating to a cassette recorder and 
having a typist transcribe it. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city will also be able to participate in Santa Ana's computerized 
system of filing and retrieving mug shots to help police officers gain access 
to information about cases they are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 The communications center will have computers to help dispatchers control 
telephones, radios and other electronic equipment in their contact with police 
officers in the field, Franks said. It should take about two years to put the 
system in place, he said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; MAN PUSHING HIS CAR IS HIT FROM BEHIND

<P>
 A 28-year-old Anaheim man pushing his disabled car on Ball Road was fatally 
injured Monday by a suspected hit-and-run driver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 5:30 a.m., Andres Garcia Lopez was pushing his disabled 1981 
Oldsmobile eastbound in the slow lane on Ball Road when he was hit from behind 
near East Street by a 1986 Toyota, driven by Omar Vasquez, 23, of Orange, Sgt. 
Richard Buchholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was crushed between the two vehicles, but his wife, Maira Maras, 24, who 
was steering the disabled car, was not injured, Buchholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Vasquez left the scene, driving slowly eastbound on Ball as a result of 
collision damage, a witness shouted at him to pull over, Buchholz said. After 
Vasquez pulled over, the witness parked in front of the suspect's car until 
police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez was arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run driving and was booked 
into Anaheim City Jail. MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; POLICE SUBSTATION APPROVAL EXPECTED

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today is expected to approve $120,000 in funding to open a 
Police Department mini-substation in the Anaheim Hills Festival Shopping 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,300-square-foot facility at 8082 E. Santa Ana Canyon Road will feature a 
front-counter area, police briefing and changing rooms, and a meeting area with 
multimedia and teleconferencing capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the mini-substation will be open only from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 
from 5 to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has maintained an office with locker-room facilities for police 
officers serving in the canyon area since 1988. That facility, at another site, 
offered no direct service to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department is exploring the possibility of opening a larger, 
full-service substation in Anaheim Hills later this year. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CLEANUP CAMPAIGN TO HELP FIRE VICTIMS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is gearing up for what promoters hope will be a citywide garage sale 
Saturday, followed by a spring cleanup campaign next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoted by the city and the Laguna Fire Relief Coalition, the project aims to 
rid local residences of trash that could become a fire hazard while raising 
money for victims of the Oct. 27 blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole concept is, you clean up your house, you clean up financially and 
you help clean up some of the problems of the survivors of the fire," coalition 
director Anita Mangels said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, a community-based group that formed after the fire and 
continues to distribute supplies to victims, is hoping residents will donate a 
percentage of the profit to the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents overwhelmed at the prospect of tackling an overstuffed garage can 
get help from coalition workers who will distribute kits with information about 
how to organize a garage sale and signs identifying their household as a 
participant. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition workers and Boy Scouts of America members will help in garages on 
the day of the sale, Mangels said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Boy Scouts are on call," she said. "If people need help setting up, 
selling, shifting items around, we will be happy to dispatch volunteers, 
provided they give us notice ahead of time that they need help." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, workers at the coalition headquarters at 660 N. Coast Highway 
will hand out city maps and the addresses of sale participants to prospective 
shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, unsold items can be discarded at curbsides on the normal trash day. 
A separate truck will pick them up at no cost to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 As another option, several local nonprofit groups will hold a rummage sale 
Saturday in the parking lot behind Vons market in the Boat Canyon shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents wanting to sidestep the garage sale can deliver items to the parking 
lot after 7 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; MEETINGS TO FOCUS ON AIR BASE CONVERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city, preparing for the future closure of the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, will hold a series of work sessions and public forums for the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the City Council will schedule a meeting to discuss how the base will 
be reused once the military pulls out. 
</P>
<P>
 The session is likely to be scheduled within the next two weeks and probably 
be the first of many public forums over the next several years as the base's 
future uses are determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Redevelopment of that 4,700 acres (at the base) could definitely impact that 
quality of life of all of South County, Laguna Hills included," said 
Councilwoman Melody Carruth, who sits on a 51-member advisory board for the El 
Toro joint powers authority. "We need to get as much information to the public 
as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills meets regularly with a group of South County cities and community 
groups that are closely watching the El Toro air base conversion process. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has contributed $5,000 to help the local governments hire a 
Washington-based lobbyist who will stay in contact with federal agencies 
seeking to control the base reuse project. 
</P>
<P>
 Carruth said the city is also considering putting aside up to $100,000 to help 
the South County communities finance a study of base reuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see our city be prepared if we decide that a consultant is 
needed to analyze the project," Carruth said. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MODEL-ROCKET FLYING MAY RESUME AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Model-rocket enthusiasts may soon return to Mile Square Regional Park to blast 
off their motor-powered toys after being banned from the site for the past six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 An unauthorized rocket launched from the Fountain Valley park last summer 
crash-landed onto the adjoining Mile Square Golf Course, prompting county 
officials in November to prohibit model-rocket launching because of safety and 
liability concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 But after six months, it appears that the ban will be lifted, county officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Miller, manager of regional parks for the county, said the Southern 
California Rocket Assn. has agreed to monitor launches on scheduled weekends to 
ensure public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to protect the safety of the public and the golfers," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Model rocketeers hailed the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very welcome news for everyone," said Gregory Kelly, 42, of Tustin, a 
model-rocket hobbyist for 18 years. "Too bad it took this long to get it ironed 
out, but at least (the county) is saying it's being moved forward to be 
reopened." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul David, 38, also of Tustin, who has designed his own collection of model 
rockets, agreed. "There are a lot of people who enjoy the hobby," he said. "We 
need a place to launch -- and it can be done safely." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the monitoring agreement with the model-rocket group is expected 
to go before the Board of Supervisors for approval within a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the incident last June involved an 11-foot-long rocket with a 
motor rating four times greater than permitted. The rocket plummeted onto the 
golf course near the 11th green, just 10 feet from some golfers, and buried 
itself eight inches into the ground. No one was injured, but Miller said many 
people voiced concern about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, county officials in November prohibited model-rocket launches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of unfortunate that one incident would wreck it for everybody who 
does fly conforming rockets," Kelly said. "It's not that all rocketeers are 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the closure, Miller said model-rocket launches had been allowed in the 
hobby area of the park since 1970, with policy limits set on the size and power 
of the rockets. Enthusiasts said that for the past few months, they have had to 
go to neighboring counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Shecter, founder and senior adviser of the 130-member Southern California 
Rocket Assn., which draws about 75% of its membership from Orange County, said 
his group agreed to supervise Mile Square Regional Park launches because 
hobbyists were left in the lurch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was either that, or no one can fly there," said Shecter, 35, who has been 
involved in the hobby since boyhood. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; STUDENTS START DRIVE TO END SUSPENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students upset over the suspension and arrest of four classmates last week at 
La Habra High School have started a petition drive to pressure administrators 
into lifting the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Three students were suspended for "inappropriate behavior" after they would 
not agree to detention for moshing, or slam dancing, during an assembly Friday 
where a rap band was performing. The fourth student was suspended when he 
protested the suspension of the others. 
</P>
<P>
 After being suspended, the four male students -- one 18, two 17 and one 16 -- 
staged a demonstration in which about 100 classmates walked out of their 
classes. Police were called and the four suspended students were arrested on 
suspicion of trying to incite a riot and trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
 Three students have been released to their parents' custody, but one was still 
in Juvenile Hall Monday because his parents were out of town and could not be 
reached, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students collecting signatures said Monday they had gathered 120 names on 
the petition, which demands that the suspended students be allowed to return to 
class before Friday. The petition will be turned over to administrators this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacki Jones, 17, who signed the petition, called the suspensions unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 The students "were just moshing," said Jones, a senior. "If it had been 
something like the waltz or the Charleston, I'm sure there would be no 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Desmaretz, 17, a senior who also signed the petition, said that 
"everyone has a different type of dancing. I think it's pretty sad when kids 
get suspended for dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students, even those who had not signed the petition, agreed that the 
suspensions were too harsh and that administrators should reconsider the 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Patricia Howell said she will not give in to the students' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's getting blown all out of proportion," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, they have to suffer. We're in the business of education. We 
still have a school to run, and that's what we're doing." MIMI KO

TRANSIENT CONVICTED IN COUNTY-USC RAMPAGE; CRIME: DAMASCIO TORRES IS FOUND 
GUILTY OF WOUNDING THREE DOCTORS AND TAKING TWO EMPLOYEES HOSTAGE. HE ADMITTED 
THE FEBRUARY, 1993, ATTACK DURING TESTIMONY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a five-day trial during which he recounted his armed attack on an 
emergency room at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, a Skid Row loner was 
convicted Monday of wounding three doctors in the rampage and taking two other 
employees hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury deliberated a little more than four hours before 
reaching the verdicts against Damascio Ybarra Torres, 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres admitted the attack during his testimony, saying he went to the 
hospital with two handguns, a rifle and a knife because he believed that 
physicians there had injected him with the virus that causes AIDS, then 
repeatedly referred him to a mental health unit when he returned seeking 
treatment for resulting physical illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The February, 1993, shooting raised concerns about security at often-crowded, 
government-run medical centers, where impatient or unbalanced patients 
sometimes become violent. After the rampage, security measures were tightened 
at County-USC, which is one of the busiest medical facilities in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Torres sat silently next to his lawyer as a court clerk read the 
verdicts against him -- guilty of three counts of attempted murder with intent 
to do great bodily harm, two counts of felony imprisonment and using guns in 
committing the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres faces three life sentences on the attempted murder charges alone at his 
June 1 sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury agreed with a defense expert who testified that Torres suffers from 
persecution delusions but concluded that he was rational enough to methodically 
plan and execute his crime, said a juror who talked to reporters outside the 
courtroom and who asked that her name not be made public. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his trial began, Torres had withdrawn his plea of innocent by reason of 
insanity against the advice of his lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Joan Croker. 
</P>
<P>
 He also insisted on testifying on his own behalf, Croker said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdicts, Croker told reporters that she had hoped the jury would 
find Torres guilty of lesser charges, especially after they saw "how delusional 
he was" during his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believed he was used in an experiment related to AIDS in 1982," Croker 
said. "He said he went to the hospital to make a statement." 
</P>
<P>
 His testimony, however, coupled with a 34-point plan Torres wrote the night 
before the rampage indicating how he would carry out the attack, helped 
convince the jury that he was lucid enough to be held responsible for his 
actions, Deputy Dist. Atty. Anne Ingalls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingalls said she drew that conclusion from private discussions she had with 
jurors after they were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Critically injured in the attack at the hospital were Dr. Richard May, Dr. 
Glen Rogers and Dr. Paul Kaszubowski. Rogers testified that he had treated 
Torres twice in the year before the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
 May and Kaszubowski have been unable to return to work as a result of their 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The two hostages, a physician and a receptionist, were released unhurt after 
Torres surrendered to a SWAT team after holding officers at bay for several 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hostages, Dr. Anne Tournay, testified that before she was taken 
prisoner she heard a man yelling: "I don't want nurses. I want doctors. I want 
white coats." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when police searched Torres' room at a Downtown transients' hotel, they 
found the written plan for the attack.

ELECTIONS / 49TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; MINORITY CANDIDATES TRY TO MAKE ETHNICITY A 
MINOR ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Monterey Park) and challenger Judy Chu, 
Monterey Park's mayor, say they would just as soon forget about the issue of 
ethnicity as they campaign for the June 7 Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really something I concern myself with," Martinez said in an 
interview. "The issues are not about color." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Chu: "I'm presenting myself as a candidate for all people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Martinez and Chu are members of ethnic groups that have sought to increase 
political representation, and ethnicity in politics is a factor that voters are 
likely to consider. That includes races where candidates from different 
minority backgrounds are bucking not the majority old guard but each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon her election two years ago, Martinez joined a small but growing pool of 
Latinos in the Assembly. Chu would become the first Chinese American in the 
Assembly since March Fong Eu, now ambassador to Micronesia, left the 
Legislature in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49th District is considered friendly toward Asian candidates because of a 
pronounced Asian presence. On some streets in Monterey Park, where people of 
Asian descent make up 53% of the population, store signs written in Chinese 
characters are as common as English-language signs. 
</P>
<P>
 But districtwide, Latinos account for about 55% of the population, whereas 
Asians make up 29%, according to census data. The district includes parts of 
Monterey Park, Alhambra, San Gabriel, Rosemead, Temple City, El Monte, Los 
Angeles and unincorporated East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture is even more favorable for Latino candidates when voter turnout is 
considered. Estimates provided by both campaigns indicate that Latinos cast 
about 50% of the votes in the 1992 Democratic primary and Asians 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although ethnicity may hurt Chu at the ballot box, it apparently has helped 
fill her campaign coffers. She has raised $163,000 so far, most of which has 
come from donors with Asian surnames. Martinez has raised about half as much, 
but that could change as the election nears. 
</P>
<P>
 As an incumbent, Martinez has the ability to tap into campaign donors from a 
range of special interests concerned with issues from education to gambling. In 
addition, she has the support of the Assembly's Democratic leadership and the 
state Democratic Party, which could provide mailers and campaign workers to 
help get out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu declines to concede an ethnic advantage to Martinez, but she has 
acknowledged that her appeal must go beyond the Asian community. "I think that 
people will vote on the issues and on the quality of candidates, and I'm 
running on that basis," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A psychology professor at East Los Angeles College, Chu won a seat on the 
Monterey Park City Council in 1988, in part by promising to bridge cultural 
gaps in the community. Chu worked toward that goal in 1990, when she 
spearheaded Harmony Week, an event to celebrate Monterey Park's ethnic 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the primary is virtually guaranteed victory in November; 
Democrats outnumber Republicans in the 49th District by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez and Chu largely agree on issues such as improving education and the 
economy and reducing crime. Their campaigns have focused on who is more 
qualified to achieve common goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu's challenge in the primary grates on Martinez, who sees her opponent as 
overly ambitious. With term limits in effect, Chu should have waited for an 
open seat, the assemblywoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's unfortunate that someone has so much ambition that they can't 
wait their time," Martinez said. "Instead of dividing our efforts in contested 
primaries, we should be working to elect a (Democrat as) governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Chu says the 49th District can't wait. She cites a recent survey by the 
California Journal, a magazine on state politics, that rated Martinez as a poor 
legislator.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our district is clearly being shortchanged," Chu said in a recent interview. 
"She doesn't get along with legislators up there and people don't respect her. 
This district needs new leadership."  
</P>
<P>
 Considered feisty and outspoken for an Assembly freshman, Martinez conceded 
she has rankled some lawmakers by aggressively pursuing her goals -- and said 
she does not intend to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I start to concern myself with how the other legislators view me, and not 
the issues, I'm in trouble," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez irked state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) when she grilled him 
on his proposal to break up the Los Angeles Unified School District, which the 
assemblywoman opposed. She later referred to the former Senate leader, who is 
of Italian descent, as the "godfather." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez defended her legislative record, dismissing the magazine survey 
results as "tantamount to gossip." She noted that she authored a new law that 
prohibits school district officials from spending public money on alcoholic 
beverages. She co-authored another law that increases the punishment for armed 
adults who sell drugs near school bus stops.

<P>
 A possible increase in water rates for consumers will be considered as the 
Capistrano Valley Water District reviews its budget for fiscal 1994-95 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The public meeting will be held by the district's Water Advisory Commission at 
the district's offices, 34206 Paseo Adelanto, at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Water officials say the district may lose about $500,000 in state revenue.They 
fear legislators may transfer property tax revenue earmarked for water 
districts to other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district uses the tax income to replace aging pumping stations and 
pipelines, and district officials say a major revenue setback would either 
require a rate increase or severe cutbacks in renovation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will make budget recommendations to the district board of 
directors. For more information about the meeting, call (714) 493-1515. FRANK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CHP SEEKING MAN WHO BEAT MOTORIST

<TEXT>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officers are seeking help in locating a man they 
said beat a motorist who had stopped for a red light after exiting Interstate 
5. 
</P>
<P>
 A 44-year-old Mission Viejo man told officers that shortly before 11 a.m. 
Saturday he was beaten while stopped for a light at the freeway's southbound 
Avery Parkway off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whom officers did not identify, said a man who might have exited 
the freeway behind him walked up to his car and began beating him through the 
driver's side window with a metal object, leaving him with a broken nose and 
other injuries requiring 35 stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was cut up real bad," CHP spokesman Bruce Lian said. "This may have 
followed some sort of traffic dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP is looking for a man in his late 40s or early 50s, driving a white, 
late-model Honda Accord with a black covering over the front end. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information is asked to contact Officer Dave Shisler at (714) 
661-6215. MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; BORDER PATROL ARRESTS 4 AFTER CHASE, 
CRASH

<P>
 U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested four Mexican nationals here Monday after a 
chase along Interstate 5 from the San Onofre checkpoint ended in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The four men ran the border checkpoint just after 6 a.m., according to Border 
Patrol spokeswoman Ann Summers. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects' car crossed four lanes of traffic and exited the freeway at the 
El Camino Real off-ramp, but the car's brakes locked. The car skidded to the 
bottom of the ramp and hit a metal signpost in the 1700 block of South El 
Camino Real, Summers said. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 After a short chase on foot, the car's driver, in the United States illegally, 
was arrested on suspicion of smuggling illegal immigrants. All four occupants 
are in custody, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the freeway chase was in danger of becoming a "high-risk pursuit," 
Border Patrol agents behind the suspects' car had turned off their flashers, 
Summers said. MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TB ISOLATION CELLS IN COUNTY JAIL PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to prevent the outbreak of tuberculosis among Orange County Jail 
inmates, officials are planning to modify six cells to isolate victims of the 
highly contagious disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh F. Stallworth, the county's health officer, said the precautions at 
the jail are a reflection of the disease's dramatic growth in Orange County 
during the past three years, in which tuberculosis cases have increased 41%. 
There were 431 cases last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening in Orange County is no different than what's happening in 
the rest of the state and nation," Stallworth said. "The jail population is a 
reflection of society." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to be considered by the County Board of Supervisors today would 
modify four cells in the medical department of the Intake / Release Center and 
two in the Women's Jail to isolate infected inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The cells would have separate ventilation systems that would circulate 
potentially contaminated air directly outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no active cases in the jail population, there were six last 
year and three so far this year. In those cases, inmates were quarantined at 
Western Medical Center in Anaheim. With the newly modified cells, officials 
said inmates can be isolated more quickly and treated more cheaply than by 
housing them in a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "In jails, where the setting is fairly crowded and there is already a 
high-risk population for disease, it could spread more quickly," Stallworth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis is a bacterial disease that is spread by airborne droplets from 
coughing or sneezing, Stallworth said. Generally, the disease is spread after 
prolonged contact with an infected person. Symptoms of the disease are 
coughing, fever, night sweats, weight loss and the coughing of blood. Left 
untreated, the disease can be debilitating. 
</P>
<P>
 Infected inmates would be isolated for at least two to three weeks while 
undergoing treatment, Stallworth said. KEVIN JOHNSON

DEAD BOY'S FATHER PLEADS FOR NEW POLICY ON BUS LIGHTS; SAFETY: LAGUNA NIGUEL 
MAN TELLS SCHOOL BOARD THAT DRIVERS SHOULD TURN ON FLASHERS WHENEVER THEY STOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parents of a 7-year-old who was killed by a pickup truck after he got off 
a school bus pleaded with school district officials Monday night to require all 
bus drivers to turn on their flashing lights whenever they stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "This accident was inexcusable," said the boy's father, Thomas W. Lanni of 
Laguna Niguel. "The simple flick of a switch could have saved my son's life." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, Thomas, was hit by the truck on April 22 as he crossed Aliso Niguel, 
and died at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "All he was was a lost little boy," his father told the school board. "I'm 
begging you please, don't let this happen to another child. These are 
kindergartners and first-graders. They're not old enough to take care of 
themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 The Lanni family has filed a $10-million claim against the Capistrano Unified 
School District, alleging the bus driver acted improperly by neither flashing 
his lights nor escorting the first-grader across Aliso Niguel at El Pilar. 
District officials have 45 days to respond to the complaint, which must be 
filed and rejected before any civil lawsuit can be brought. 
</P>
<P>
 School board officials maintain the bus driver did not use the flashing lights 
because the driver believed all six students who got off at the stop lived on 
the same side of Aliso Niguel. Later, school officials said, it was learned 
that Thomas and three others lived on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, board members made no comment about the flashing lights nor 
circumstances of the accident, but board President Paul B. Haseman extended the 
board's "extreme remorse and sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Orange County Sheriff's Department investigators concluded that the 
boy's death did not involve criminal conduct. The investigators also concluded 
that neither the bus driver nor the truck driver was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office will review the investigation to determine if 
the bus driver violated the state Vehicle Code by failing to escort Thomas and 
three other children across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows vehicles on both sides of the street to pass a stopped school 
bus if the flashing lights are not on, and the pickup truck was traveling 
within the posted speed limit of 30 m.p.h., according to the investigation. 
Because the bus driver did not know that some of the children who got off at 
that stop had to cross Aliso Niguel to get home, the driver was not at fault 
for not turning on the lights, investigators concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary cause of the accident was Thomas running or walking into the 
street in front of the school bus," according to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Lanni family contends that the tragedy never would have occurred if 
all bus drivers were required to turn on the flashing lights whenever they 
stop, not just when the driver knows a child will be crossing the street. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say that Barbara Lanni told the bus driver that morning exactly 
where her son was to be dropped off. But the boy got off one stop earlier, as 
his mother waited for him several blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have been playing Russian roulette with our children," Barbara Lanni 
said, "and my son lost."

ANAHEIM HOTEL CLAIMS IN SUIT THAT DISNEY PLAN HURT BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of a 242-room Anaheim hotel filed a lawsuit Monday against the Walt 
Disney Co., alleging that they have lost bookings and have been unable to sell 
the hotel because of confusion over Disney's publicized plans for the 
$3-billion resort it wants to build in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Hotel Associates, a limited partnership that owns the Grand Hotel on 
Harbor Boulevard, asserts in its Orange County Superior Court lawsuit that 
Disney scared off business in announcing plans to demolish the hotel to make 
way for a giant parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed demolition was only an early option and eventually was discarded, 
but tour operators, travel agents and tourists have "canceled bookings or 
failed to make bookings which they would otherwise have made in the ordinary 
course of business," according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 It also states that Disney knew that the owners were trying to sell the hotel, 
and Disney's actions caused negotiations to be broken off. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Disney Development Co., Disney's planning and 
construction unit, said she could not comment on litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney is exploring whether to build an amusement park and several new hotels 
next to Disneyland. But since the new theme park would fill the present-day 
main parking lot, the company has proposed building two new parking structures 
-- believed to be the largest in the country -- to handle more than 30,000 cars 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
 But where to place the lot on the park's east side was a problem. Several 
options required acquiring property or razing buildings not owned by Disney. It 
eventually settled on a parcel that does not require destroying the Grand 
Hotel.

SUIT OVER OFFICER'S FATAL SHOOTING TO BEGIN; COURT: FAMILY OF DEAD MAN ALLEGES 
THAT ANAHEIM POLICEMAN USED BAD JUDGMENT AFTER HIGH-SPEED CHASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 To his colleagues and supporters, Lee Smith is the consummate cop whose 
gang-busting efforts earned him this year's Anaheim Police Officer of the Year 
award from a local community group. 
</P>
<P>
 But to others, Smith is an overly eager officer with an itchy trigger finger 
who fatally shot four people within a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was cleared two months ago of any wrongdoing by the U.S. Department of 
Justice, but today his role in one of those shootings will come under fresh 
scrutiny when he and Anaheim city officials begin their defense of a wrongful 
death lawsuit filed by the family of one of the dead men. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides will try to paint conflicting portraits of Smith, a 10-year 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a man that didn't do anything even tantamount to Rodney King," said 
Frank Barbaro, who is representing the plaintiffs. "His only mistake was 
running into the wrong officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Praet, the officer's attorney, countered that his client is "an 
excellent police officer. He's very even tempered, a true professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's trial involves the Feb. 2, 1989, death of Robert Vincent Edson Jr., a 
28-year-old Orange man who was fatally shot by Smith after a high-speed chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Edson ran a struggling ticket service for concerts and sporting events. At the 
time of his death, he and his family -- his wife and a stepson -- were staying 
at Galaxy Motor Inn near Disneyland, after having been evicted from their 
apartment in Orange because they couldn't pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after midnight, Edson left the motel to pick up some shampoo for his 
wife, Allison Lynn. But while returning, Edson sped away when officers 
attempted to stop him for driving without headlights. Edson's friends said he 
had evaded police before because he was driving with a suspended license and 
could not afford auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith pursued Edson to the motel where he fired at least eight shots at the 
suspect when he appeared to reach for a weapon from his waistband, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbaro said this client's husband did not deserve to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was pounding on the door for his wife to let him in," Barbaro said. "He 
should not have died for his stupid decision to run. He posed no threat to Lee 
Smith, who used an incredible amount of bad judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office cleared Smith of any wrongdoing 
in Edson's death and three other fatal shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Praet said Smith does not believe that he is responsible for Edson's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officer Smith is saddened by the fact that Mr. Edson led him into a situation 
to take his life," Praet said. "No police officer wants to take a human life. 
Smith did not go looking to engage in such activity, but Mr. Edson placed him 
that situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Praet said he would try to show that Edson committed a "recognized phenomenon" 
known as "copicide," or "suicide by cop." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Praet, "We believe that Edson was despondent to the point where he wanted 
to take his own life, but he was unwilling to do it himself. So he was (luring) 
the officers to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbaro scoffed at that characterization, saying that Smith used poor judgment 
in firing his gun at an unarmed Edson. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who holds a black belt in karate, was named the department's top 
officer by the local post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Ted Labahn, a supervisor in the department, said Smith has been 
instrumental in solving several gang-related homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 But since Edson's shooting, Smith's judgment while on duty has been a source 
of controversy. The other fatalities involving Smith were: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Sept. 8, 1989, shooting death of Dennis William Smith, who allegedly 
shot and wounded an officer after a car chase and shootout. Smith, who was part 
of a tactical police assault team involved in the gun battle, fired the fatal 
round that killed the suspect.

 * The Oct. 10, 1989, shooting death of Gregory Alan Rosenberger, a 25-year-old 
drug suspect from Brea who was reportedly involved in a scuffle with the 
officer. Evidence presented at another civil trial showed that Smith shot 
Rosenberger six times -- three times in the back. Smith testified that he 
feared for his life when Rosenberger grabbed the grip of his holstered gun. 
Last August, the Anaheim City Council agreed to pay $175,000 to settle a 
lawsuit brought by Rosenberger's family.

 * The Dec. 9, 1991, shooting death of a burglary suspect. The man, identified 
as Antonio V. Galindo, broke into Smith's condominium. He was armed with a 
knife, police said.

MOBILE LABS GIVE STUDENTS TASTE OF FACTORIES OF FUTURE; EDUCATION: YOUNGSTERS 
FROM GARDEN GROVE SCHOOL OPERATE HIGH-TECH MACHINERY WITH AID OF CALCULATORS 
THEY BUILD THEMSELVES. 
</P>

<P>
 A group of Garden Grove students got a chance to be high-tech factory workers 
for a few hours Monday -- but they didn't have to travel to a manufacturing 
plant or even put on a hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters, all from a private Catholic school, built a calculator and 
operated such light machinery as a robotic arm and precision, metal-cutting 
drills simply by using computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers were in two small red, white and blue trailers that were filled 
with high-tech equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Called mobile technology labs, the trailers are owned and operated by the 
National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, a consortium based in Ann Arbor, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The trailers rolled into Anaheim for a two-day conference held by the center. 
The group is trying to increase interest in America's manufacturing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 These labs on wheels, which cost up to $175,000 and were funded by donations 
and federal grants, are designed to give America's future workers an idea of 
what a job in the increasingly high-tech manufacturing industry would entail. 
</P>
<P>
 While other states such as Texas and Michigan are using the mobile 
manufacturing labs in local school systems, California does not have them.  
</P>
<P>
 "The students walk out of here with a product, like a calculator, that they've 
made from scratch and they can say, 'Hey, mom, I made this,' and then tell her 
how they made it," said Tom Hackley, a mobile lab teacher. "It teaches them how 
to be successful using very sophisticated equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 In the lab Monday, Ken Johnson, founder of R.J. Associates design company in 
San Jose, showed a group of six students how to make a calculator. Waving a 
tiny plastic board in his hand, he asked them, "Know what this is?" 
</P>
<P>
 "A microchip board?" asked a tall, brown-haired boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nope, it's a circuit board," said Johnson. "Now, you guys know what a hard 
drive on your computer is, right? Well, this is a calculator's hard drive." 
</P>
<P>
 The teens -- all students at St. Columbans and members of Future Scientists 
and Engineers of America -- nodded and watched closely as he showed them how to 
operate a computer-driven machine and solder the calculator together. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Drainville, 13, said he thought the experience was "pretty interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Over in the trailer where teens were operating a robotic arm and using a 
computer to drill into brass, Kristen Pass, 11, said she was interested in 
operating high-tech machinery for a living one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's neat. You work with things you know will help in the future," 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Janice Pass, questioned why the labs weren't being offered to 
California's schoolchildren so they could have a chance for hands-on work 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are so excited. It gives them a chance to take their computer and 
math skills and use them in real life," she said. "I could see in the future 
maybe some local businesses taking the initiative and helping to fund these." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Dorsey, a spokeswoman for the manufacturers' group, agreed: "We 
sincerely hope that one day they will be in California schools."

KANTOR OPPOSES SINGAPORE'S BID FOR KEY SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what some analysts said could be retribution for its caning of an American 
teen-ager, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Monday he would oppose 
Singapore's bid to be host of a key international trade summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysts said the gesture, in essence a slap in the face, would deliver a 
sharp diplomatic message to Singapore without jeopardizing lucrative U. 
S.-Singapore commercial relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore wants to hold the first ministerial meeting of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) when the body comes into being next year. The WTO will take 
over from the GATT and effectively police world trade. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite Singapore's strong pitch and public optimism that it would win the 
race to host the huge trade gathering, U. S. opposition would effectively kill 
its chances, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if his decision to block Singapore was expressly related to the 
caning dispute, Kantor said only, "I have made myself quite clear." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Chow Tong put forward his 
country's bid at a GATT meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, last month, a U. S. 
source said there could be resistance from Washington because of the caning. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department summoned Singapore's Ambassador S. R. Nathan, and State 
Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said Assistant Secretary of State 
Winston Lord "emphasized that this incident will have to be taken into account 
in the overall relationship between the United States and Singapore."

 I-Flow Corp.: The Irvine maker of portable intravenous pumps said Monday that 
it has signed a three-year marketing deal with an Illinois medical device firm 
to distribute its two lines of pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 I-Flow's contract with SoloPak Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Elk Grove, Ill., is 
expected to generate at least $2 million in the first year for the financially 
struggling start-up company. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, founded in 1985, has been limping along, reporting a string of 
losses that forced it to raise $4.5 million in a stock offering in December to 
help pay for a restructuring of its distribution and marketing operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, the company reported a first-quarter loss of $725,000, or 9 
cents a share, on revenue of $761,000. That compared to a loss of $649,000, or 
11 cents a share, on revenue of $1.1 million for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company did not disclose the revenue estimates for the contract's second 
and third years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the contract, which became effective immediately, privately held SoloPak 
will market and distribute I-Flow's SideKick and Paragon pumps, both of which 
are hand-held devices that automatically regulate drug flow into the blood 
stream for chemotherapy or pain-ridden patients at home or at work.

BRIEFCASE: TECHNOLOGY; AST DELAYS BUT CANON MOVES AHEAD WITH SUBNOTEBOOK 
COMPUTER LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 AST Research Inc. had promised it would come out with a subnotebook computer 
this spring. But Safi Qureshey, chief executive of the Irvine computer company, 
said recently that it looks as though the machine, a portable computer that 
weighs less than five pounds, will be out in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 AST is waiting for a better idea of what consumers want in a subnotebook, 
Qureshey said. But that isn't stopping Canon Computer Systems Inc., which on 
Monday joined a small group of manufacturers who have already begun to ship 
subnotebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Canon, a Costa Mesa subsidiary of Tokyo-based Canon Inc., launched a 
four-pound line of Innova Book 10/10C subnotebooks. Ron Okamoto, director of 
computer marketing, said the subnotebooks round out Canon's line of computers 
for small-business owners and traveling professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The product introductions are the latest example of Canon's effort to remake 
its entire product line to keep pace with rapid changes in the computer 
industry. As part of its sales offensive, Canon also launched several new 
printers and a line of multimedia desktop computers, or those that can play 
video and sound as well as graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 Street prices on the subnotebooks are expected to range from $1,600 for 
black-and-white models to $2,100 for color machines. Those prices compare to 
about $4,000 for the color subnotebook model offered by Toshiba America 
Information Systems Inc., an Irvine-based rival. Last week, Toshiba cut prices 
on its line of portables as much as 20%. Canon will also compete against rivals 
such as Epson America and Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like the idea of smaller and lighter computers," Okamoto said. "But 
generally they're not willing to pay more for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Lair, vice president of marketing for Toshiba America's computer 
division, however, said that executives often want the same capabilities in 
their portable machines as they have in their desktop computers and will 
therefore pay the higher price for full-featured machines.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: LAGUNA HILLS-BASED HOSPITAL FIRM EXPANDS REACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Community Psychiatric Centers said Monday that a subsidiary has signed an 
agreement to manage a Seattle hospital that it eventually plans to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Psychiatric, a Laguna Hills-based operator of psychiatric hospitals, 
said that its Atlanta-based subsidiary, Transitional Hospitals Corp., will 
manage Fifth Avenue Hospital until it can obtain permission from Washington 
regulators to buy the 80-bed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The parent company obtained a $50-million loan from Bank of America to help 
expand Transitional Hospitals and its United Kingdom psychiatric center. A year 
ago, Community Psychiatric received a $40-million bank loan to fund both 
internal growth and acquisitions at the subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Including the Seattle deal, Transitional Hospitals operates 12 long-term 
critical-care hospitals in 10 states.

US FACILITIES TAKES STEPS TO BLOCK TAKEOVER BID; INSURANCE: FIDELITY NATIONAL 
FINANCIAL IS TRYING TO WOO SHAREHOLDERS WITH A $79-MILLION OFFER FOR THE 
HOLDING COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Top managers at US Facilities, confident that shareholders would rebuff a sale 
of the insurance holding company, said Monday they will ask the company's 
directors to allow a vote at the upcoming annual meeting on two issues proposed 
by Fidelity National Financial Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors of US Facilities scheduled a board meeting for next Monday to review 
reports from a special directors' committee and its financial adviser on 
Fidelity's $79-million bid to take over the company and on Fidelity's request 
for a shareholder vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The bid technically has expired, though Fidelity, the nation's fifth-largest 
title insurer, said it would make the same $15-a-share offer to stockholders 
that it made to the company. First, though, Fidelity wants shareholders to vote 
on whether US Facilities should be put on the block to the highest bidder and 
whether two of Fidelity's nominees should be elected to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be fair to the shareholders," said US Facilities spokeswoman 
Rosemary L. Mulligan. She said management is concerned about possible liability 
because it has a fiduciary responsibility to bring any serious acquisition 
offer before shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 This move surprised Fidelity Chairman William P. Foley II. "The best way to 
ensure that the company continues to respond is for shareholders to give us 
their proxy so that we can vote on the two measures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities said in a news release that directors will make a recommendation 
to shareholders well before its May 25 annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a letter Monday to shareholders, Chairman George Kadonada lashed 
out at Fidelity's offer, questioning Fidelity's financial capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make no mistake," he wrote, "Mr. Foley's sole motivation is to exploit your 
company to advance his own interests and those of other Fidelity National 
stockholders." 
</P>
<P>
 He questioned "whether there ever will be a serious and credible proposal from 
Fidelity National." And he questioned the independence and qualifications of 
the two Fidelity director nominees, saying they have no insurance industry 
background and would "represent the interests of Fidelity National and not 
those of US Facilities and its stockholders." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley, noting that Fidelity is a "very strong organization" financially, said 
he would send a letter today to US Facilities shareholders to respond to 
Kadonada's statements.

HOTELS CONTINUE TO SHOW DROP IN OCCUPANCY RATE; ECONOMY: FIRST-QUARTER DECLINE 
POSTED DESPITE 5% CUT IN ROOM PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County hotels continued a downward trend in keeping their rooms filled, 
despite slashing rates an average of 5% from last year to lure customers, a Los 
Angeles consulting firm reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-quarter occupancy report by PKF Consulting came little more than a 
week after county officials and local tourism executives met in Anaheim to 
discuss ways to draw more visitors to an area that traditionally has been 
considered a tourism hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a drop in tourism and that shouldn't happen," said John Dravinsky, 
general manager of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point and a member of a 
steering committee that was formed at the April 29 gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which drew 100 executives to the Anaheim Convention Center, 
included retired Disneyland President Jack Lindquist and Orange County 
Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and William G. Steiner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a wonderful product here and we need to put together a unified force" 
to lift the tourism industry out of its doldrums, Dravinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 The PKF survey showed that the average occupancy rate in Orange County through 
March 31 was 61.38%, down 6.2% from the same period the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop, however, was due in part to a change in the monthly survey, in which 
researchers added two money-losing hotels in South Orange County to its list of 
hotels the firm routinely contacts, said PKF researcher Melissa Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 She declined to identify the two South County hotels, citing a confidentiality 
clause between PKF and participating hotels. She also declined to say how many 
Orange County hotels the PKF contacts in preparing its countywide survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, South Orange County, with fashionable destination resorts such as the 
Ritz-Carlton and the Dana Point Inn, also in Dana Point, suffered a decline of 
11.1% from last year's first quarter, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim, popular for its cavernous Anaheim Convention Center, Disneyland and 
two sporting complexes, did not fare much better. The PKF survey reported that 
only three of every five Anaheim hotel rooms were filled, on average, in the 
first three months. That is down 8.4% from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 North Orange County hotels, located in Fullerton, Fountain Valley, Buena Park, 
Huntington Beach, Orange, Cypress, Yorba Linda, Brea and Placentia, saw an 
average drop of 9.1% in their occupancy rates, from 60.67% to 55.13%, the 
survey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills said that the drop in tourist-oriented areas such as Anaheim and South 
Orange County, including Mission Viejo, Dana Point, Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills, 
San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano, came largely because of a reticence by 
out-of-towners to visit a region that has seen itself rocked over the past 
several years by earthquakes, fires, floods and riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were staying away from Southern California in general," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The silver lining was found in an increase in occupancy at hotels near John 
Wayne Airport, Mills said. That area saw a 3.7% hike in hotel usage -- from 
65.6% to 68.02% -- over the past year as Orange County's economy eased itself 
out of a stubborn three-year recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a good sign that business travel is improving," Mills said. 
</P>

 Ritz-Carlton's Dravinsky said that he expects a turnaround by January, but he 
added that the county and tourism officials must become more aggressive with 
marketing to show Orange County as a place to spend time and money.

 "We need to advertise smarter," he said, "It is a question of getting people 
down here and showing them how diverse the county really is."

BANK TO OFFER INSURANCE TO BORROWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Savings Bank, a mortgage lender based in Irvine, has introduced a new 
program that provides free insurance to cover monthly payments for borrowers 
who purchase a home and then lose their job. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its Payment Protection Plan, borrowers who are involuntary laid off or 
terminated are covered for up to six monthly mortgage payments on adjustable 
mortgages for a maximum of $2,500 per month including principal, interest, 
taxes and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think one of the major obstacles or fears that home buyers have is the 
risk of losing their jobs," said Stephanie Christie, vice president and product 
manager with American Savings in Irvine. She said she knows of no other 
mortgage lender in California with such a program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think there is a fear of the economy and we hope that this will get 
people off the fence and into new homes," she said.

ACQUISITION BOOSTS REVENUE AT KOLL MANAGEMENT SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Koll Management Services Inc., one of the nation's largest managers of 
commercial property, said its revenue increased 46% in fiscal 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach-based company attributed its revenue boost to the 
acquisition of Rubloff Inc., a Chicago property manager, which added 30 million 
square feet of properties, boosting its current portfolio to about 120 million 
square feet in more than 600 properties nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year ending March 31, Koll revenue was $56.7 million, compared to the 
$38.9 million reported for fiscal 1993. Net income during the year was $3 
million, or 93 cents a share, compared with $2.7 million, or 82 cents a share, 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an extraordinary year of growth and evolution for our company," said 
William Rothe, president of Koll Management Services, which was spun off two 
years ago from the privately owned Koll Co., a development company formed in 
1962 by Don Koll. Koll Co. retains a majority stake in Koll Management 
Services.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite its upbeat tone, Monday's announcement did not do much for Koll stock 
because the company had earlier announced year-end estimates. The company's 
shares did not trade Monday on Nasdaq; it's last price was $10.75 per share on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earnings sure look good, but you wonder whether this is a onetime shot in 
the arm and they fall back, or if is this a long-term thing?," said Mark 
Matheson, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon & Co., a Los Angeles investment 
banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, Koll revenue increased 65% to $17 million, compared 
with revenue of $10.3 million for the year-ago period. Net income rose to 
$956,000, or 30 cents a share, up from net income of $599,000, or 18 cents a 
share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 During the year, Koll acquired Peregrine White Co., a leasing and appraisal 
firm based in New York City for $1.5 million and purchased Karsten Realty 
Advisors of Los Angeles, another property management company, for $1.22 
million. But its single largest purchase was the Chicago commercial developer 
Rubloff Inc., giving Koll a major presence in the Midwest, Southeast and 
Southwest.  
</P>
<P>
 And the company will likely have more acquisitions this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consistent with our strategy of taking advantage of windows of opportunity 
and low barriers of entry, we continue to evaluate new lines of business while 
building the infrastructure necessary to expand into new markets," Rothe said. 
Koll Management Services 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter ended March 31, Koll Management Services reported net 
income of $956,000, up 60% over the same period a year ago. Fourth-quarter 
revenue increased 65% to $17 million. (Figures in millions of dollars, except

MONSANTO SETTLES SUIT FOR $250,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monsanto Co. agreed Monday to pay $250,000 in civil penalties to settle a 
consumer protection lawsuit in which the Orange County district attorney's 
office alleged that the company sold defective home garden care products. 
</P>
<P>
 Monsanto did not admit any liability in connection with its Greensweep 
products, but it agreed to pay the costs of the investigation and also agreed 
to a court order barring it from engaging in fraudulent, deceptive and unfair 
business practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Monsanto had cooperated in the investigation and had ordered distributors to 
remove remaining products from store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor's consumer protection unit had asserted in its civil suit that 
Greensweep products were sold in plastic containers with defective valves prone 
to be forcibly ejected by the water pressure of a garden hose.  
</P>
<P>
 Warnings about the danger also were deceptive and misleading because they 
failed to advise consumers of the risks, the suit alleged.

FIXATIONS: LEADER OF THE PACK; EAGLE-EYED COLLECTOR FROM ORANGE KNOWS ARTICLES 
OF THE BOY SCOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doug Allen has had the sort of fulfilling life in Scouting that I used to read 
about in Boys Life magazine as a kid: Beginning as a Cub Scout at age 8, Allen 
found outdoor adventure and camaraderie. He made Eagle Scout at an early age 
and went on to be an adult leader of a troop that goes on two-week canoe trips 
into Canada and 80-mile backpack hikes through the Sierra. He included 'Eagle 
Scout' on his job resumes and wound up with a job building a space station. 
There probably wasn't a Scout of his generation who didn't dream of someday 
building space stations. 
</P>
<P>
 My own Scouting career wasn't so idyllic. I lasted one year in the Cub Scouts, 
where our den mother's dry yard was all we saw of nature. With watered-down 
Kool-Aid and stale cookies, I'd swear she turned a profit on our 15-cent dues. 
Our motto may have been "Be Prepared to Suffer." For the slightest infraction 
of unstated rules we'd be compelled to crawl through a gantlet of paddling 
fellow Cubs. Once, upon winning a paper drive, we were awarded a wood-burning 
kit, which we never saw again. The final straw came when we did a show for 
parents in which our pack lip-synced to Beatles records, and they made me be 
Ringo. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why I turned my back on Scouting, becoming a bitter journalist, 
while Allen builds space stations and is still so taken with Scouting that he 
has amassed a collection of thousands of rare Boy Scout items. It's practically 
enough to fill a museum, and that's what he hopes to do someday.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of his collection is on display (and some for sale) at Nix Books (2820 E. 
Chapman) in Orange, while more of it crowds the study of the Orange home he 
shares with his wife, Sharon, and three teen-age sons. 
</P>
<P>
 He has 1930s jodhpurs, '50s flint fire-starting kits, an ashtray commemorating 
the 1953 Scout Jamboree held in Orange County (from which our Jamboree 
Boulevard derives its name), felt-cased canteens, merit badges, axes, first-aid 
kits, belts, ancient issues of Boys Life and two copies of the Scout Grail, the 
1910 handbook by Boy Scouts of America founder, naturalist Ernest Thompson 
Seton, including a signed copy from Seton's own library. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While most of his collection is devoted to American Scouting, he also has 
several rare items from Britain, where Scouting was originated in 1908 by Lord 
Robert Baden-Powell. He was a hero of the Boer War, where he had organized boys 
in a courier corps, also using them as medical aides and scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Baden-Powell was encouraged to develop a civilian version of that corps at 
home, Allen said, because "there was a lot of concern in that time before World 
War I about the listlessness and directionlessness of boys, concern that boys 
would go bad if they didn't have anything to hold onto. Here in the U.S. they 
had the same concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 While others in the growing hobby of Scout collectibles tend to specialize in 
particular areas -- collecting merit badges, for example -- Allen says he 
collects everything. "I'm interested in the history of Scouting, and every item 
you come across tells you a little more," he said. If those jodhpurs could only 
talk! 
</P>
<P>
 The early Scout uniforms in the United States were often surplus Army doughboy 
uniforms, and that is of some historical import, Allen said.  
</P>
<P>
 "At first there was a lot of resistance to Scouting from pacifists. There was 
quite a pacifist and isolationist movement then. I have some slogan pins from 
the time, 'I didn't raise my son to be a soldier,' 'No entangling alliances,' 
things like that. And these sectors thought the Scouts were militaristic 
because they wore uniforms that were the same color as military uniforms, or 
even surplus doughboy uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Until it was recognized by Congress in 1916, the Boy Scouts of America was 
only one of several scouting organizations duking it out for prominence in the 
United States. Others had similar names, such as the American Scouts and the 
Scouts of America. Some of these groups drilled with rifles and did other 
military training. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Boy Scouting was decidedly more pacific, though, if relatively rustic by 
today's standards. Even city boys then usually weren't far from a rural area, 
and Allen relates that it wasn't unusual for Scouts to take to the woods for a 
week or two with no adult supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them would even fell trees and build cabins. They might live in it 
for a whole summer, hunting game or bartering with local farmers for eggs and 
milk. They might only get a visit from a Scoutmaster on a weekend. Things were 
a lot different then, where I guess parents weren't afraid to let their kids 
run off to the woods for quite a length of time and live on their own," Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Things weren't altogether different when he began Scouting in Anaheim in the 
'60s. "Every so often we'd throw a pack on our backs and bicycle up to the 
Firestone Scout Camp in the Brea Hills beyond the oil fields. We'd camp there 
by ourselves. A ranger would come along and collect the 15-cent-a-day fee, and 
there was no other supervision. We wouldn't get away with that today. They 
require now that every outing have at least two adult leaders in attendance, 
for safety and also for the child-molestation concerns that every organization 
has now." 
</P>
<P>
 One might well be drawn to collect old Boy Scout items just for the more 
innocent times they reflect. He said getting into the hobby was a gradual 
thing: 
</P>
<P>
 "In being a leader for years, every so often I'd see a handbook I didn't have 
and I'd pick it up and read through it. That just fed on itself, and I became 
more and more interested, with all the unique history and artwork -- you know, 
Norman Rockwell started out illustrating for the Boy Scouts -- and everything 
else. If you've been in the Scouting movement since 1963, 31 years, you start 
to develop an interest in it. I've spent more time in Scouting than I've been 
married." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Sharon are nearing their 19th anniversary. She recently purchased a 
pre-1955 flint and steel fire-starting kit for him. She has collecting 
interests of her own, and parts of their vacations are spent checking out 
antique shops and garage sales in different climes. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of his items come from thrift shops, he's spent as much as $600 for 
others, such as the 1910 handbooks. He estimates he now has some 4,000 pieces 
in his collection, and a bare fraction of that fits into his display at Nix 
Books. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the items marked for sale there, he says: "I run that as a business, not a 
hobby, although the real reason for it is to try to sell extra things so I can 
continue to buy things I don't have. In two years there, we haven't really 
turned a profit yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the advantages I see to it is boys can come in there and see some of 
the stuff, whereas before I had it in glass cases here, and my wife didn't 
really want people tramping in all the time to see it. So now there's a place 
they can look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 He'd like to get his collection into a proper museum setting, both because he 
feels Scouting history warrants it, and because he'd rather not have to be 
paying the rent on it. A few years ago he talked to a local Boy Scout council 
office about putting displays in there, "but the council executive at the time 
said he didn't want anything cluttering up the office," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 He says Scouting history often reflects the times as well. For example, 
"during the early '70s, the Scouting program changed because of the culture 
change during the Vietnam War. There was a big backlash against uniforms, and 
everybody was trying to make things simpler. So during that time they really 
slackened off the requirements, got a fashion designer to make the uniform more 
appealing to young people and loosened up on having to wear the uniform so more 
people would stay in."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is one bit of history he wishes the Boy Scouts had never been part of. 
Some of the most recent items in his collection are news clippings of the legal 
battle over the agnostic Anaheim Hills brothers who were thrown out of the 
Scouts for refusing to recognize God in the Scout oath. Allen, who is chairman 
of the board of deacons at his church, said: "We never used to make a religious 
issue of Scouting. If a boy wanted religion, he went to church. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a Scout, religion really wasn't emphasized. Maybe we'd have a 
pastor at an annual awards banquet sometimes. But we never had a litmus test 
for saying, 'Are you an atheist?' It didn't matter. The real push now is not 
from atheists who want to deny religion but more from the religious right who 
want to impose more and more religion on the Scout program and want to make it 
more of a religious organization.  
</P>
<P>
 "They've been changing requirements, so now there is a religious requirement 
in the Cub Scout program that never used to be there. And in the latest 
handbook, they have a requirement now for one of the Scout ranks that the boy 
has to lead the patrol in prayer before a meal on a camp-out. That was never 
there before. These are things that are creeping up. Some of us who have been 
in Scouting a long time are saddened by that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He still thinks Scouting is the best thing going for kids, and he remains 
active as assistant Scoutmaster of Troop 543 in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a good program. Boys can learn to operate in a team 
environment, where they go out and camp and have to fend somewhat for 
themselves. They learn to run their own patrols, learn how to be leaders and 
followers, how to rely on themselves. They experience the elements and high 
adventure in the outdoors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working as a project leader on the space station at McDonnell-Douglas, do the 
things he learned as a Scout -- leadership, teamwork, starting fires with flint 
-- come in handy?  
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely. I've always put on my resume that I'm an Eagle Scout. I don't 
know if that's ever gotten me a job, but I figure it doesn't hurt. And Scouting 
has taught me a lot about leadership. I earned my eagle fairly early and served 
in a number of leadership positions as a Scout and as an adult. It taught me to 
plan early and set goals and work within groups and teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "And nowadays, Scouting provides a lot of satisfaction for me to see boys 
advance and grow. You get these new kids that are really just kids. For them, 
life's all comic books and just being out to play and having problems with 
attention. Then you see them mature over a period of years, from a point where 
they have trouble making a three-mile backpack to where they're doing 60, 70 
miles without a problem, taking on responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can spend five or eight years with a kid. Then when he comes back and 
helps as an adult leader, that gives you a real feeling of accomplishment, the 
sense that you've touched somebody's life, that you've helped them make it in 
this world. There's nothing like that," Allen said with a smile.

KING JAMES; AT 36, JAMES TRUMAN RULES THE CONDE NAST MAGAZINE EMPIRE. WILL HE 
FIRST TURN HIS EYE TO VANITY FAIR? VOGUE? ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST? HE'S PLOTTING, 
BUT HE'S NOT TALKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The elevator floats upward, carrying the young dauphin of Conde Nast to the 
14th floor. A too-tanned woman cosseted in Chanel enters on a lower floor and 
upon engaging those silent blue eyes gushes an invitation to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon? she swoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he replies graciously, continuing his ascent. 
</P>
<P>
 A modification of Ross Perot's great sucking sound seems to follow James 
Truman everywhere these days. It is the sound of sycophancy, sidling up to him 
in the foyer -- even penetrating the gray of his temporary office where, strewn 
about and remarkably obvious to straining eyes, are several notes from Conde 
Nast editors. "Happy First Day," writes Mademoiselle Editor Elizabeth Crow. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Truman, former editor of Details magazine, succeeded 81-year-old 
Alexander Liberman as editorial director of S.I. Newhouse Jr.'s magazine 
empire. Over the past three decades, Liberman had masterminded a vision for the 
13 magazines by using a remarkable artist's eye and perfecting the art of 
intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Painter, sculptor, pragmatist, the Russian-born Liberman was the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer, wit and Brit, now Truman is the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the job is going to be what I make it," Truman says. "I mean the job 
is, as much as it has a job description, to oversee the Conde Nast magazines 
editorially and, in particular, to assist those that are in trouble. And so in 
part it's to be kind of like a magazine doctor, but in the broader sense, you 
know, Alex made it more than that and I would like to make it more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 The incestuous world of magazines demands more. 
</P>
<P>
 Which magazine will he doctor first? (He won't say.) What new technology 
should Newhouse experiment with first? (He won't say.) Which editor will he 
burden with his attention first? ("That's not my style" is all he'll say.) 
</P>
<P>
 But before all that, why Truman in the first place? Why, of all the members of 
Newhouse's senior class, did he pick this fair-haired boy of 36 to be his ears 
and eyes and oracle of good taste?

<P>
 Clearly, Newhouse prefers people he knows, and Truman's appointment was not 
exactly the result of an international dragnet. There were half a dozen editors 
he might have selected and not everyone in the lunchroom wanted the job. Rumors 
are that Newhouse was turned down by Tina Brown of the New Yorker and her 
husband, Harry Evans of Random House. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Truman may be a logical choice. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends insist that he is a pop culture divining rod who can package a 
sensibility. So perhaps he'll help Newhouse storm the youth market and escort 
Conde Nast into the information age, where it has yet to aggressively venture. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Truman is immensely charming in a kind of self-effacing, watery way that 
is suspect at first, yet convincing after awhile and then suspect again. 
Friends and Details' underlings slavishly praise him, and even if they are 
sometimes confused by his opaque style, they are impressed by how nimbly he 
moves between uptown and downtown, grit and glamour. 
</P>
<P>
 And Truman succeeds -- although not as effortlessly as he charms.  
</P>
<P>
 Within a three-year span, he became a star in the Conde Nast galaxy by 
transforming Details from painfully hip to incredibly hot, ballooning 
circulation from 100,000 to 450,000. Truman locked into the generation raised 
on MTV and Super Nintendo, captivating it with humor, sex and its own 
"I-don't-give-a-damn" attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 But he insists that he wasn't brought uptown to paint all of Conde Nast with 
some Generation X gloss. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, everyone has made a great fuss about my age but, you know, I mean, 
frankly I'm too old to be twentysomething . . . I mean, I'm not worried about 
being 36." 
</P>
<P>
 Older editors -- and they're all older -- couldn't help but balk. Paige Rense, 
the 60ish editor of Architectural Digest, was quoted as saying that if Truman 
bossed her around, she'd have to "spank him and send him to bed without his 
supper." But such rumblings were quieted by Newhouse, and shortly after, Rense 
and Truman were seen having a very public lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the editors are very excited about working with him," chirps Vogue Editor 
Anna Wintour, who brought Truman to Conde Nast. Wintour further explains why 
she won't find it awkward working for someone who once worked for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it easier," she says cheerily. "It's much easier for us to have 
someone here who we know, like and respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Truman became Newhouse's choice, he apparently was handpicked by 
Liberman. They have spent considerable time together over the past year, 
presumably with the e minence grise passing on wisdom to the young prince. 
(They have also shopped together with Truman turning Liberman on to his 
favorite designer label, Comme des Garcons.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gabe Doppel, who was redesigned right out of the editorship of Mademoiselle by 
Liberman, explains that her buddy Truman has much in common with the older man: 
"They both observe life from the outskirts; they both are very flirtatious; 
they both have a childish sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I think of James at work at his hideously messy desk -- it's of a 
boy sitting behind it with his shoes off," Doppel adds. "Alex was so different. 
He always had a clean desk with nothing on it except his folded hands." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It is still winter, February and bruising, before he has quit smoking, before 
he has started the new job, before James Truman has become the enigma of Conde 
Nast headquarters on Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 He is still working in Details' downtown offices, which have that unsettled 
feel of a college dorm. There is a Pepto-Bismol bottle on his computer, bound 
copies of his favorite British pop music weekly on the shelf, a kilim rug with 
autumnal colors on the wooden floor and a nondescript couch. The windows are 
thrown open to relieve the room of smoke and Truman is trying to entertain 
J-school questions about the future of American magazines and how they'll 
survive CD-ROMS.  
</P>
<P>
 "The magazines that have succeeded most recently are those that do not in any 
way condescend to their readers," he says. "I think Allure is very good at not 
condescending, given the subject matter (beauty) of the magazine. I think 
Details did the same thing. I think Spy, when it was good, did the same thing; 
I think Vanity Fair, the same. There was that belief when you picked up those 
magazines that you were being treated not as a media demographic, but as a 
lively, intelligent, interested person." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several Conde Nast magazines may be in dire need of re-creating that or some 
other belief -- and Truman knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first three months of this year, eight of the 13 magazines saw their 
total number of ad pages drop dramatically compared to the same period last 
year. Only Allure, Self, Details and Conde Nast Traveler increased ad pages, 
while Vanity Fair, Mademoiselle and others decreased. While that may not be an 
indication of much more than ad rate increases and does not necessarily explain 
profitability, conventional wisdom has it that several of the magazines are 
hurting and Truman is supposed to be part of the solution to renourish them. He 
is supposed to have fresh ideas; there is supposed to be content beneath all 
that lambent wit and style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Advertising doesn't come unless you have the magazine that people are 
reacting to," he says. "The advertiser has to feel that the magazine is 
connecting in a real way with its reader, which makes it hot -- that terrible 
word. But you know, hot is really saying this magazine has found its reader and 
is involved in a very intimate dance with the reader. And I don't want to bring 
up a rival magazine, but Harper's Bazaar is a great example. Its circulation is 
not doing at all well, but it's absolutely packed with advertising because 
advertisers fear it is connected very passionately with a group of women." 
</P>
<P>
 But how do you make those passionate connections? 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that what was lost in the 1980s was that sense of voice, which is why 
when you read about the new Esquire, they're trying to take it back to what it 
was. Everyone is looking back to how magazines were as if this kind of 
aggressive, hysterical kind of shouting that magazines did for 10 years was 
just an aberration. I think magazines have to find a way out of that because I 
think that area is going to be used up by television anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't a TV in Truman's office. There is a Sony mini-component stereo 
system and piles of CDs and several photographs strewn about, including one of 
him and Details' sex columnist Anka Radkovich and another of him and Kate Moss 
and Sofia Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
 Truman looks almost as anemic as Moss in that picture, but it is deceptive. 
Although reedy and fair, he is sturdy -- an athlete, in fact. He is an ardent 
boxer who trains once a week. He plays tennis, stylistically awkward but 
aggressively, a friend says.  
</P>
<P>
 And everything on Truman's face curls -- his lips, his nose, his hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look horrible in photos," he says as he tries to angle to get his favorite 
photographer to shoot him for this story. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Farther away and longer ago -- before he collected antiques and had a 
decorator for his roof-garden apartment in the West Village -- James Truman 
really was young and unformed and trying to re-create himself on the sidelines 
of the world of rock music. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the late 1970s, a time when post-punk music was exploding and Britain 
was again becoming the major music capital of the world. Truman was a writer 
for Melody Maker, an influential British pop weekly, and living in London. 
Crumpled over his typewriter, he would imprison himself for days in a 
corrugated hut constructed within Melody Maker's run-down offices because of 
what friends gently refer to as his "deadline difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 "The most effective way to help James get his deadline met was to bring him an 
endless supply of doughnuts and orange juice," says Ian Birch, then his editor 
at Melody Maker. "James didn't so much as write stories as sculpt them. But he 
never took a cliched route. He was always a lateral thinker." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps his most memorable pieces -- and most labored over -- were on Bryan 
Ferry and his group, Roxy Music.  
</P>
<P>
 The son of a coal miner, Ferry dressed in white dinner jackets onstage and 
made an ironic statement out of everything about being a pop star. At a time 
when music was jagged, discordant and punk, Ferry presented an elegant, 
manicured sound -- the smooth music that accompanied models down runways or 
that filled restaurants in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Truman admits to being attracted to Ferry's way of bending the world toward 
his own eccentric vision of it. Truman also says he probably wrote "far too 
many stories" about the rocker -- although they are now close friends who shoot 
pool together in Greenwich Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pop stars become role models for young writers because they obviously ring 
bells in their character," says Birch, publisher of British Elle. "But James 
was too intelligent for that and it would be too simplistic to say he was 
writing about himself when he wrote about Ferry." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Truman emerged from a Bryan Ferry-like existence, rebelling against his 
class -- although in a far less dramatic way. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ferry came from working-class Newcastle, Truman was raised "middle 
class" in Nottingham, where his father, Derek, owned various businesses. The 
Trumans weren't landed gentry but they had money. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ferry achingly rendered Bob Dylan as a soloist, Truman lost himself in Jack 
Kerouac, who cruised America and wrote about its dark side. Yet as much as 
Truman was fascinated by Kerouac, he did not ignore his countrymen, such as 
Evelyn Waugh. 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview from the family's Caribbean winter home, Valerie Truman 
says her son owned everything Waugh ever wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of those books are still in his room," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Truman's room in Nottingham also reflects an earlier art. As a teen-ager, he 
was an avid painter; when the family traveled throughout Europe in summers, he 
would spend his time sketching and painting, his mother says. A huge 
black-and-white mural of three Chinese men smoking hookah pipes still covers 
the wall of his study. He studied French at the Sorbonne and Spanish in 
Seville. 
</P>
<P>
 His art also was expressed in the form of outlandish clothes, his mother adds. 
"He didn't like the old tweed sport jacket and trousers. But he was always 
quite interested in fashion, the outlandish and weird, like silver jackets or 
black plastic trousers." 
</P>
<P>
 He attended the Oundle Boarding School, an aspirational although not 
first-rate school. He decided against attending a university and worked briefly 
in his father's businesses, including an engineering and aircraft firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "James tried, but he was much more artistic and creative and not into the kind 
of things his father was," Valerie Truman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he spent a year at journalism school and then found jobs in London, 
mostly at music weeklies.  
</P>
<P>
 The British weeklies -- with their seemingly endless amounts of space -- were 
the perfect proving ground for young writers exercising their voice. But if 
London was the place for them to ramble on and be celebrated as their 
generation's Oscar Wilde, New York was the place to tone it down and make some 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Truman came to work in New York for the Face, a monthly music and 
lifestyle magazine, and his dispatches brought him recognition. Like many 
British expatriates, Truman came to America because he was more dedicated and 
ambitious than the polite world he was raised in would allow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated the class system there," he says. "I hated the fact that if you 
showed enthusiasm for things there, you were thought to be vulgar in some way." 
</P>
<P>
 His attitude toward America, however, was also jaundiced. In one long, amusing 
article in the Face, Truman suggested that the growing telephone sex business 
was a perfect metaphor for modern America and its actions in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isolated, nearly invulnerable, its enemies largely self-created, America had 
become the lonely turret gunner, seeing the world only at a distance, lost in 
private, morbid fantasy," he wrote, adding that America's "death-bed image 
could only be that of a man lying in a dimly lit room, trousers round his 
ankles, quietly wanking to the sound of a paid stranger's voice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While this writing style brought him admirers, Truman's personal style brought 
friends and patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Truman met Anna Wintour at a dinner party at her home. Wintour, working as a 
fashion editor at New York magazine, was bowled over by his charm but was 
blinded by what he was wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tight black-and-white houndstooth-check Armani," she recalls, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went on Anna's list," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after, she became editor of British Vogue and asked him to write a 
piece about how he dressed. A few years later when she was editor of American 
Vogue, she hired him as features editor.  
</P>
<P>
 It was 1988 and Truman took the job gladly. He had just returned from a year 
in Hollywood trying to write a screenplay with former Sex Pistols manager 
Malcolm McLaren. Their collaboration didn't work and Truman says he found Los 
Angeles' "inertia impossible to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 1990, Newhouse had plucked Truman from Vogue to be editor of Details, which 
Conde Nast had bought two years earlier. A black-and-white guide to downtown 
club life, Details was to be Conde Nast's vehicle to younger men and it was up 
to Truman to transform it somehow, someway. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a year -- and from Truman's vantage, it was a long, painful year. 
Perhaps the most reviled was his first issue, in which he and his art director 
and close friend Derek Unglass featured a graphic photograph of a man in the 
electric chair in Florida. Among the staff the photo was referred to as 
"Roasted Head of Cop Killer." Funny as this was in the office, it didn't go 
over well with advertisers, and for the next several editions Truman's critics 
carped that he simply was getting everything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 But Truman eventually found relief the old-fashioned way: He put movie star 
Keanu Reeves on the cover and thousands of teen-age girls snapped it up. He 
also had to fire Unglass, who did not want to give up on their original edgy 
concept of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derek and James created this deconstructed, wild, very assaultive product, 
and Derek became a scapegoat for that," a former Details staffer says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Truman's Details found readers -- the kind of guys who graduate from 
college and move back into their parents' basements and spend all their spare 
nights listening to music. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Fishman, a frequent Details contributor, says Truman had a unique but 
effective editing style. In one instance, he recalls Truman advising him to 
revise a story by "running it through the postmodern blender." He then got up 
and rooted around his office as if he had such an cooking utensil. 
</P>
<P>
 "My editor and I walked out of the office thoroughly enthused with these 
high-octane bits, but then we looked at each other and said: 'Do you have any 
idea what he was talking about?' But then we figured out how to put into action 
James' extremely engaging conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Conason, now the executive editor of the New York Observer, worked for 
Truman during Details' first years. Conason's job was to assign serious 
journalistic efforts, which he hoped would get Details' young readers 
"interested in the world beyond the radio station and mall." They ran an 
interview with a Polish journalist, a story on the sale of Soviet weapons in 
Germany, a profile of Cuban youth. But as the magazine veered toward 
celebrities, sex and music, Conason left. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worse insult James would make when he was killing one of my story ideas 
was 'Joe, that's such a worthy idea.' And then he'd laugh. And I had to laugh, 
too. The message was 'Don't weigh me down with this story.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Conason left with high regard for Truman: "The irony of it is that James 
actually likes good writing, really cares about that. I'm just not sure 
Generation X cares a whole helluva lot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was Truman's idea to hire a sex columnist, and when he came across young, 
attractive free-lance writer Anka Radkovich, he gave her free rein, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "James takes chances," says Radkovich, explaining that their idea for the 
column was freewheeling and raw. "We didn't want it to be a sex column like 
Mademoiselle or Glamour has. Those are service-type columns. We wanted to go 
beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 And so she has -- with graphic descriptions of her dates and instructive 
columns on how to put on condoms.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, unlike dowdier men's magazines, Details seems comfortable covering 
sexual lifestyles from heterosexual to gay to in-your-face androgyny. At the 
same time, the magazine seems to project old-fashioned advice to young men, 
such as how to get a girl into bed. It also deals with AIDS, gay politics and 
highly confessional stories of relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a high foreplay factor in Details," says a staffer who asked to 
remain anonymous, "and that's because James is interested in sex, the other 
editors are interested in it, and judging from the letters to the editor and 
faxes around the place, so are the readers." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the nature of the magazine and Truman's elusive manner, his own 
sexuality has been the subject of speculation. He's had a few enduring 
romances, friends say. A highly social woman he recently dated reportedly said 
he dumped her, explaining that he was too busy with work to have time for 
black-tie parties. (By the way, he was one of two people out of 1,000 at the 
annual PEN gala who didn't wear black-tie. Instead, he wore his uniform of 
black suit and collarless white shirt.) 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he had anything interesting to reveal about his personal life Truman 
declares emphatically:  
</P>
<P>
 "I am heterosexual, I am single and I am not about to get married." After a 
contemplative pause he adds, "You know, I always felt it would be difficult to 
be married and to be the editor of Details, because I think Details is very 
much a magazine for single people. But I think in my new job, I could get 
married." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the same week in late March, there were two parties celebrating Truman's 
appointment as new head of the principality: one for the grown-ups and one for 
the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Si Newhouse threw the very adult, very subdued event for New York's media and 
fashion aristocracy, including Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Naomi Campbell and 
Fran Lebowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 The Details staff threw the other bash -- a long night that began at a 
downtown Japanese restaurant and ended at a tragically chic bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening was rowdy and slightly sloppy. Small disposable cameras were 
placed at each table and the youthful editors, writers, assistants and 
hangers-on traipsed between tables posing for each other. When dessert -- fresh 
fruit -- was served, the managing editor had to confiscate the grapes because 
they were ending up in the oddest places. "Hour-glass" Anka, as she is 
sometimes called, planted herself on Truman's knee. 
</P>
<P>
 For the presentations, one editor stood up with a cassette player and warbled 
"To Sir With Love," an ode of respect for the teacher. There were several 
rounds of sarcasm and Truman was presented a group picture taken at an 
elementary school with the entire Details staff dressed in uniforms and seated 
behind desks with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and cartons of milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Truman gave a brief speech and, although he was neither weepy nor rendering 
his garments, he was sentimental, say witnesses, most of whom were too drunk to 
remember his exact words. Apparently he reminisced about Details by referring 
to various covers that hang in the lobby of its offices and how they reminded 
him of what was going on in his personal and professional life at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was alternately self-aggrandizing and self-effacing," one writer said 
affectionately. "He was soooooooo James." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet during most of the high jinks, Truman remained seated in the middle of it 
all in his postmodern pose, watching, listening, coolly appraising and 
dispatching clever one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Truman's young admirers described him as almost having a "Warholesque 
quality. He has that passive quality that you read Warhol had that makes people 
feel free to perform or frolic." 
</P>
<P>
 Another noted: "I think he was mysterious to begin with, but now it's a 
tactic. He loves to throw something out and see how it resonates." There is 
that James Truman, whom people relentlessly label "elliptical," and then there 
is the other private, emphatically warm Truman described by intimate friends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Edwards, screenwriter and devoted friend, recalls an occasion when he 
joked about being broke and Truman immediately pushed a handful of cash at him. 
Ian Birch recalls a trip to New York during which, jet lagged and slightly ill, 
he had to be put in a cab and sent home by Truman. "He was very generous, very 
concerned, very caring." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gabe Doppel doesn't appreciate Truman's choice of gifts -- he once 
gave her fish kettle -- she says that when she was going through her worse 
times at Mademoiselle, she would call Truman "15 times a day and he would take 
my call every time." 
</P>
<P>
 But even close friends say there is always a part of him that remains in the 
shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't want to people to pick away at the mystery of his mystery," 
Edwards says. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Trilling, yet another "best friend," says that after a decade of knowing 
Truman, "I still don't know him, but I know enough. We talk about life, we talk 
about girls, we talk about getting older." 
</P>
<P>
 And when Truman wrote his final message to the thousands of Details readers 
who helped launch this latest career climb, he showed that when facing the 
possibility of emotion, it is always safe to be cool -- and to talk about sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate goodbys but let me try this," he wrote in the April editor's note. "I 
thank you beyond words for making this magazine a success and in the process 
making the last four years the greatest adventure of my life. It has felt like 
struggle and it has felt like love. I'm sorry we never got to sleep together."

A SERIOUS SLIP FOR THE ELDERLY; HEALTH: THE POPE'S HIP INJURY AGAIN POINTS UP 
THE NEED FOR SAFETY IN THE HOME. EXPERTS SAY FRAILTY AND POOR BALANCE INCREASE 
CHANCES OF FALLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was over 65 and stepping from the bathtub when he lost his balance and 
fell. He fractured his hip. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to Pope John Paul II in the Vatican last month was a 
classic-case scenario. Among the elderly, hip fractures resulting from falls 
are a common injury that often leads to disability and even death, safety 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Pope, 73, is reportedly in excellent condition and is expected to 
recover, he will be left with a metal joint in his right thigh and faces months 
of physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is the extent of his injuries, Pope John Paul will be blessed, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling is the most common cause of fatal injury in the elderly, according to 
the National Safety Council. Moreover, thousands are left permanently disabled 
from falls, particularly by hip fractures. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300,000 Americans -- most of them elderly -- suffer hip fractures each 
year. About 20% of those individuals die within one year of the fracture, 
according to government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, this type of injury can transform an active person into a bedridden 
one. Half of all people with hip fractures who could walk without assistance 
before the accident cannot walk independently afterward, reports the National 
Osteoporosis Foundation. And, 41% of those injured need nursing home care 
during their rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elderly people are highly susceptible to falls because of such health problems 
as arthritis, poor eyesight and hearing, frailty, poor balance and 
coordination, senility, dementia and weakness or dizziness caused by 
medications, says Michael Taylor, a spokesman for the National Safety Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, just getting out of the bathtub requires you to raise a leg and 
have balance. This is difficult for some elderly people. Even when they walk, 
they often shuffle their feet and are unable to pick their feet up," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican officials have not explained what caused the Pope to fall. He 
fractured and dislocated his right femur at the point where it connects to his 
hip. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftermath of a fall can be particularly disastrous because of 
osteoporosis, the bone-thinning condition common among the aged, says Sandra 
Raymond, director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation. Bones lose mass and 
weaken as people age. Women eventually lose 30% to 50% of their bone density 
and men lose 20% to 30%. Osteoporosis is a manifestation of this bone loss in 
which bones are extremely porous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost 90% of hip fractures are caused by osteoporosis," Raymond says. "But 
part of the problem with these fractures is the people who fall didn't know 
they had low bone mass or osteoporosis. This is a shock to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as a heart attack or stroke is sometimes the first sign of heart disease, 
a bone fracture can be the first warning of osteoporosis, Raymond says. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she says, the warning often comes too late: "It's already a catastrophic 
event. So prevention is the key." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say elderly people should discuss their risk of osteoporosis with 
their physicians and, if necessary, undergo tests to evaluate bone density. 
Bone loss can be minimized through a good diet (high in calcium), 
weight-bearing exercise and taking certain medications. 
</P>
<P>
 Many doctors will also review fall-prevention strategies with patients at risk 
for bone fractures, Raymond adds. But fall prevention should be practiced by 
everyone -- young and old. This means assessing your home for hazards, such as 
loose carpeting, slick floors and cluttered areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bathrooms, in particular, can be made safer by installing grab bars and 
putting down non-skid rugs and bathtub mats. Bathroom designers prefer rounded 
edges on counters and sinks to reduce injury. Some bathtubs are equipped with a 
seat to use while bathing. And there is even a urethane foam padded tub on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Grab bars are extremely protective and can be purchased for as little as $17 
each with minimal installation costs, says Dan Kramer of D and D Kitchen & Bath 
Design in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Although grab bars are still not common in homes, some bathroom designers say 
they are incorporating them more in new homes. Grab bars are even available in 
designer colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people realize that grab bars are great safety devices, Kramer says, but 
they shirk from purchasing them "because they don't look all that attractive. 
People think of them as being used in institutions more than anything else." 
Number of Deaths Due to Falling 
</P>
<P>
 Falling is the most common cause of fatal injury in the elderly. In 1992, 
6,200 people died in accidental falls in the home. Most often injured are those 
very young or very old. 
</P>
<P>
 Age 0-4: 120 5-14: 40 15-24: 40 25-44: 250 45-64: 450 65-74: 900 75 and up: 
4,400

LAUGH LINES: ASK NO MORE FOR WHOM THE QUARK QUACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, the scientific community leaps for joy, dislodging thousands of pens 
and pencils from its collective vinyl pocket protector, sending countless pairs 
of black-framed glasses (held together with duct tape) skidding across 
laboratories around the world and then landing heavily on its Hush Puppies and 
mismatched socks. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the uncontrolled glee? 
</P>
<P>
 Quarks, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 And not just any quark, mind you. We're talking Top Quark here. The Big 
Enchilada. The Main Man. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists believe that they have discovered the missing piece of the puzzle 
-- that being the Top Quark -- of how matter is formed. And I don't know about 
you, but I haven't slept a wink since the announcement. (It's possible the 
neighbor's insane wolf-dog, which has been barking nonstop since mid-April, is 
a factor. But I don't think so. I think it's Top Quark.) 
</P>
<P>
 They found Top Quark near Chicago. I'm not sure if Michael Jordan had it or 
not, but he probably did. He has everything else. Except, as we've all found 
out recently, any real talent for baseball. But let us digress a moment. There 
are perhaps a few nincompoops out there who don't know what a quark is. I hate 
to take time away from the rest of the class, but those of you who don't know 
-- and you know who you are! -- pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
 A quark is a particle in the 12-piece chain that makes up everything in 
nature. Trees, for example. And dirt. Even Al Gore is made up of these 
particles, or quarks, although researchers believe he is composed mostly of 
DIQs (Dead or Inactive Quarks). 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, however, they couldn't find the 12th particle, the Top Quark. But 
all that changed last week when it was found by hundreds of top physicists -- 
you know, the guys you made fun of during gym class at your high school, but 
who later extracted their revenge by getting secure, respectable, well-paying 
jobs and gorgeous second wives. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, as one physicist explained, this is what they did: 
</P>
<P>
 They discovered, through use of a particle accelerator, a few dozen lines, 
each a fraction of a millimeter long, which appeared scattered among trillions 
of records of atom disintegrations. Top Quarks. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of you who ponder somewhat less profound, although no less puzzling, 
questions (such as: Why the hell did kamikaze pilots wear helmets ?), this 
might get a bit complicated. This quark business involves explanations of the 
creation of life itself. Its complexity, indeed its very definition and 
identification, defies logical explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, we let University of Toronto physicist Pekka Sinervo take a 
whack at it: 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, so it probably is a duck." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as physicists are so fond of saying, that is that . 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery, however, is not without its doubters. 
</P>
<P>
 Can any of us forget, for example, the great quark snafu of 1984, in which 
Carlo Rubbia of Geneva nabbed the Nobel Prize for allegedly finding this same 
Top Quark? Three years later he was forced to withdraw the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out he didn't find the Top Quark at all, but rather a sesame seed from a 
McDonald's Happy Meal discarded carelessly -- and foolishly, I might add -- in 
the laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, nonbelievers abound in this latest Top Quark thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are counter-indications to give one pause," said none other than Pekka 
"Duckman" Sinervo. "The working title is 'Evidence for a Top Quark.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wimps. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe -- and I imagine I speak for all of us here -- that either it's the 
darn Top Quark or it isn't. No room for middle ground in something this big. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as my father has so often said, quark or get off the pot.

BODY WATCH; FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE STETHOSCOPE; THE PATIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a scene as old as cave art: patients seething in the waiting room over a 
3 o'clock appointment that is nowhere close to happening, and doctors steaming 
behind their stethoscopes because they are running late -- all because patients 
arrive late, which they do because doctors always run late because patients 
always arrive late because doctors always run late. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 'Round and 'round it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we asked Liz Brody, senior editor at Shape magazine, and Dr. Jim Allen, a 
Malibu family physician, to fire off the top peeves of doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * Time is a terrible thing to waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors are the reciprocal of dogs -- one of their hours equals seven of ours. 
Why can't we seem to retain this information from one visit to the next? We 
drive through town like pinballs on Ritalin just to sit in the waiting room 
reading back issues of Ornithology Today and chanting oohhhhhmmmm so our blood 
pressure doesn't go through the roof. Obviously we'll never make our next 
appointment on time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Questions, questions, more questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling out medical histories shouldn't be worse than filling out tax returns. 
And how about when they test you on memory loss. You know the routine. I can no 
more remember the dates of my surgeries or which aunt has what disease than I 
can remember how much I spent for doctors visits in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oh, it's only a paper gown. 
</P>
<P>
 The "gown" -- and aren't we overstating the case here? -- looks as if it were 
ripped off a roll of Bounty. I wouldn't mind wearing it if there were some way 
to close it in the back, especially since the thermostat in the inner sanctum 
is always set for Haagen-Dazs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pain of poundage. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it that even if you go in for an infected eyebrow, they make you get on 
the scale? 
</P>
<P>
 * The hand that rocks the prescription pad. 
</P>
<P>
 So does that "Exorcist"-like penmanship read thiamine or Thorazine?  
</P>
<P>
 * The Pavlovian Pee Thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I run to the bathroom all night, come time to give a urine sample I'm 
as dry as a Santa Ana. It's fairly impossible to do it on cue. But for those 
who've mastered this level, there is the next challenge: tinkling within the 
boundaries of that teeny-wee-wee cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * Needles. 
</P>
<P>
 Need I say more? 
</P>
<P>
 * Hypochondriac until proven sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all your limbs are attached, stay away," my friend Ted says. "Unless 
you're missing one, doctors never listen to you." In general, I agree. Tell a 
doctor you've got a Kmart complaint like indigestion or fatigue and their eyes 
glaze over with a look that says, "I'm standing here in front of the fridge and 
can't find a thing to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 * R-e-s-p-e-c-t. 
</P>
<P>
 Find out what it means to me. MDs operate under the illusion that they possess 
IQs; we are Beavises and Butt-heads. It's an attitude thing, starting from the 
time they enter the examining room wearing our chart as a face mask. Then, with 
eye contact still at a minimum, they'll hit you with shred of eponychium on a 
proximal nail fold when they could have said hangnail.  
</P>
<P>
 * Evelyn Wood speed healing dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 After all the waiting, the doctor pronounces you healed. And during that blip 
of an exam, it's amazing how the charges rack up! You can't help but wonder if 
that $400 mole absolutely had to come off or whether Doc needed new polo 
mallets.

WHAT'S THE DEAL; FEEDING THAT CRAVING FOR ICE CREAM 
</P>

<P>
 When you absolutely must have ice cream, you can splurge or scrimp -- on both 
price and fat. Here's the cost to your wallet and your waist. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ben & Jerry's New York Super Fudge Chunk ice cream (chocolate flavor with 
pecans, walnuts, chocolate-covered almonds and white and dark chocolate 
chunks), 240 calories and 17 grams of fat per 4-ounce scoop, 63% fat, $1.70 
plus tax.

 * Haagen-Dazs Caramel Cone Explosion bar, 350 calories and 23 grams of fat per 
93-gram bar, 59% fat, $3.95 for package of three. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jersey Maid Rocky Road ice milk, 100 calories and 2 grams of fat per 
half-cup serving, 18% fat, $2.89 for half a gallon.

</P>
<P>
 'Round and 'round it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we asked Liz Brody, senior editor at Shape magazine, and Dr. Jim Allen, a 
Malibu family physician, to fire off the top peeves of doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * The chronically late patient. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a preemptive strike for the traditional complaint of patients about 
doctors. Typically, this patient shows up about the time you're supposed to be 
A) in the O.R. doing the surgical thing; B) in the E.R., attending a critically 
ill patient, or C) on the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Time abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 These are patients who try to expand a scheduled 15-minute sore-throat exam 
into a complete physical, with an impromptu psych consult thrown in for good 
measure. (Another good reason doctors are sometimes late.)  
</P>
<P>
 These patients also wait until 11:30 on a Friday night of a holiday weekend to 
realize that they're out of blood pressure medication and then expect you to 
magically supply them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Something for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 I call it the "While-we're-here scenario" -- as in, "While we're here, could 
you look at Jennifer's ears and Mark's skin rash. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 They would never think of going to a lawyer to discuss suing their doctors and 
then segue into cajoling a free opinion on Aunt Mildred's will. 
</P>
<P>
 (Also in this category: regulars who consistently use the phone in lieu of an 
office visit to secure a diagnosis and treatment.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Getting stiffed for services. 
</P>
<P>
 Patient comes to office with a sexually transmitted disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just passing through," patient says. 
</P>
<P>
 Is treated with compassion and a $25 injection, plus a few starter (free) 
samples of an expensive antibiotic. Check bounces. Phony name and address, you 
get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chronic non-payers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlimited number of excuses. And these same people expect medical reports to 
be filled out and sent out to schools, work, et al., immediately . 
</P>
<P>
 * Non-compliant patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't matter how many risk factors for coronary disease are present, you can 
talk until you're blue in the face but no way will he/she lose weight, give up 
cigarettes or eat less fat. Medications? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sarah Bernhardt Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients who manipulate and over-dramatize any affliction or illness. Usually 
accompanied by an enabler for heightened effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially the most creative field with unlimited stories of pain, allergies 
(to every analgesic known to man except Demerol, natch), dogs eating their 
medication, UFOs sucking up their prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * The can't-quite-get-the-hang-of-things patient. 
</P>
<P>
 This has two forms: A) those who wait until they're at death's door to 
consider a doctor visit, and B) those who pop in at first sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients who have never established an ongoing relationship with soap and 
water.

RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; SYMPHONY BALL IS APPRAISED AS A JEWEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Precious gems, sparkling evening gowns and glittering decorations turned the 
Pacific Symphony league's Symphony of Jewels ball into a night to treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 guests -- twice the number who attended last year's ball -- 
showed up in bejeweled evening wear at the Hyatt Regency Irvine on Saturday for 
the league's 15th anniversary season gala. The $175-per-person ball was 
expected to net about $200,000 for the Orange County orchestra. Jewel of a Ball 
</P>
<P>
 Some guests said the huge turnout was due to the appearance of Davis Gaines, 
who starred in the title role of "The Phantom of the Opera" in Los Angeles and 
San Francisco. Others attributed the attendance to the Symphony of Jewels' 
reputation as one of the county's premier balls, thanks largely to underwriter 
Tiffany & Co., which made sure every detail was perfect, down to the 
jewel-toned tablecloths. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, however, agreed the evening's success was due to the efforts of 
co-chairwomen Jo Ellen Qualls, vice president of Tiffany, and Sharon Lesk 
Jaquith, trustee of the Leo Freedman Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I invited a number of people from Los Angeles, and Jo invited people who had 
previously not been introduced to the orchestra," Jaquith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls had a likely explanation for the ball's popularity: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great time," she said. "This is the kind of ball where you want to 
wear your best jewels and your ball gown. You can't overdress." 
</P>
<P>
 Men donned tuxedos, some with cummerbund sets the color of rubies and 
emeralds, while women showed off beaded sheaths and full-skirted ball gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 During the champagne reception, they ogled jewelry from Tiffany sported by 
fashion models (including one dead-ringer for Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly 
in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"). The models wore gowns by Lillie Rubin and posed 
in elegant vignettes furnished by Randolph and Hein. All That Glitters 
</P>
<P>
 Later, guests adjourned into the ballroom, which twinkled with hundreds of 
votive candles perched atop a trio of Lucite tubes at the center of each table. 
Mirrored tabletops reflected white floral centerpieces and a sprinkling of faux 
gems. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests were served an opulent dinner of salmon Wellington and roast veal 
tenderloin and a dessert of tiramisu and berries served inside an edible gold 
jewel box. In between courses they danced to the tunes of Barry Cole and his 
orchestra, then sat at attention while French-Canadian pianist Alain Lefevre 
performed the Mephisto Waltz by Franz Liszt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I (performed) personally for Sharon (Jaquith). People like her are angels of 
music," said Lefevre, who attended with his wife, Jojo. 
</P>
<P>
 Another angel of music, former "Phantom" Gaines, took the stage and sang his 
favorite Broadway tunes. He appeased "Phantom" lovers with "Music of the 
Night." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'll be singing from 'Phantom' for the rest of my life," said Gaines, 
who performed "Phantom" 1,071 times (but who's counting?). 
</P>
<P>
 Later, young professionals, who had paid $50 to catch the entertainment and 
enjoy dessert, joined guests on the dance floor and partied until 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to develop a new base of supporters," said Barbara Trainor, 
orchestra league president, of the low-priced, post-dinner ticket program. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were Maurice and Marcy Mulville, chairwoman emeritus; G. 
Randolph Johnson, orchestra board chairman; Rondell Hanson, board president; 
Lou Spisto, board vice president and orchestra executive director; William 
Dultz, president of Travcoa, which donated a grand prize around-the-world tour 
by private jet; George and Arlene Cheng; Bill and Laila Conlin; Edward and 
Celeste Cumming; Vesta Curry; Larry and Margaret Gates; James Geraghty; Arthur 
and Lynda Gome; Ben and Patricia Dolson; William Dultz; Patrick and Dorothy 
Hurley; Mark Chapin Johnson; Dennis Kariger; Tom and Anne Key; Peter and Mary 
Muth; Elaine Redfield; Edward and Helen Shanbrom; Michael Weaver; Marv and Pat 
Weiss; Pat Werrlein, and Madeline Zuckerman. KATHRYN BOLD

ANN MARTIN, 'ACTION NEWS'?; AFTER 18 YEARS AT CHANNEL 7, FORGETTING THE WORD 
'EYEWITNESS' ISN'T THE ONLY CHALLENGE THE LONGTIME ANCHOR WILL FACE AT TROUBLED 
CHANNEL 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you pull up beside Ann Martin in traffic and she's staring straight ahead 
saying "Ann Martin, Channel 2 Action News" over and over again, don't call the 
men in the white jackets to take her away. She simply has a few things to get 
used to. 
</P>
<P>
 After 18 years of saying "Ann Martin, Channel 7 Eyewitness News," she will 
start sitting behind the anchor desk at KCBS-TV Channel 2 Monday. While others 
in the industry have been furiously speculating about her new deal, which they 
say makes her the highest paid television news anchor in local history, Martin 
has spent much of the past two weeks relaxing, meeting her new colleagues and 
practicing her new station name to ensure she doesn't mention the old one on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've been at the same place for the last 18 years, you get used to 
saying things a certain way, so I've been practicing over and over in the car," 
Martin explained last week during an interview at KCBS. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's more than just Martin's station name that is changing. She is leaving 
the dominant news station in town for a newsroom that has been last in the 
ratings for much of the past 20 years, clouded by an apparently endless cycle 
of management upheaval and low morale. In addition, news about her salary, 
which has been reported in a range between $1.2 million and $2 million per 
year, has suddenly thrust the unassuming Martin into the center of the 
recurring controversy over the high salaries of selected television anchors in 
the age of newsroom cutbacks and staff reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's given her a high profile that makes her uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like all of this is happening to someone else," Martin said. "I've 
always been a very private person. It's such a funny thing when the journalist 
becomes the news story. I feel like I'm in the eye of the hurricane." 
</P>
<P>
 She paused, then said, "I mean, before, at my other station, I was always just 
there. I grew up at that station. I was just part of the scenery; I never made 
news. This whole thing has come as a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin was mainly known at KABC for her calm, pleasant manner, which seemed 
unflappable even in the face of disasters such as the riots and the Northridge 
earthquake. Martin says she is just being herself when she reads the news, and 
has based her style of delivery on acting as if she is relating the news to her 
80-year-old aunt: "I just try to be as honest as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 But Martin refuses to set the record straight on terms of her contract or 
salary, saying only that the $1.7-million figure most frequently quoted is "off 
the mark" -- but whether it's too high or too low, she isn't saying. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS General Manager William Applegate, who calls Martin "arguably the 
preeminent female anchor in the marketplace," also declined to discuss the 
specifics of her salary. But he said, "I think it should be noted that, for the 
first time, a female reporter and anchor takes her place in the higher echelon, 
financially and otherwise, in what has been an exclusively male domain." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a quiet dignity about Ann," said KNBC-TV Channel 4 anchor Paul 
Moyer, who anchored with her at KABC for 13 years. "She carries herself with 
style and dignity. That has allowed her to survive in a business where precious 
few do. We developed a fondness for each other on and off the air, which is 
rather rare in this line of work. We're still very close friends, and I'm 
tickled to death for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Of her exit from KABC, Martin said, "When my agent, Ed Hookstratten, was in 
negotiations, he said this might be a time to see about making a change. A lot 
of people who I had grown up with at the station had left, so my history was 
already interrupted. I just felt it was in the wind. It's a chance to get 
shaken up a bit and revitalized. I find it exciting to work at a place where 
they're aiming at being No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's arrival also appears to have juiced up the staff at KCBS. As she 
walked down the halls, employees smiled and welcomed her. When she was 
introduced in the newsroom by Applegate, the staff applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Tuck, who will be her co-anchor at 5 p.m. and 11 p.m., said Martin is 
seen as a pivotal link in the effort to turn around KCBS' fortunes, which also 
includes other personnel changes and the recent introduction of a revamped set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone here now wants to succeed," Tuck said. "We've gone through some 
terrible times, with the revolving doors of management. We've gone through our 
tabloid stage. Turnaround is never easy. It's like turning around an ocean 
liner. You have to stop it first before turning it around. We've managed to do 
that now. We're doing the best job we've done since I've been here, and Ann's 
acquisition is a big piece of the puzzle for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuck added, "Of course, we have to be careful not to put too much 
responsibility on one person. But Ann is a key player for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Moyer said he understands what kind of pressure Martin is under with the media 
furor over her salary. He signed a six-year contract with KNBC 1992 paying $8 
million, but that station's ratings fortune did not dramatically change with 
his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through the same thing she's probably going through now, and I'm sure 
it's not very comforting to her," Moyer said. "I went through it and it 
bothered me. It becomes an overriding concern of the press, how much money we 
make. It's really too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 But others said they had difficulty understanding Martin's high salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went to the highest bidder," said former Channel 2 anchor Joseph Benti. 
"I have nothing against her, but what she represents. All this underscores 
again that the public and public information are the last consideration. 
Compare the salary of one anchorperson to the entire budget of a public-radio 
station like KPFK-FM. What many of these anchors earn in one week is more than 
that station spends all year on wire services." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Emery, acting chair of the journalism department at Cal State 
Northridge, said, "It's deeply disturbing that around the nation, local 
stations on the one hand reduce their staffs and have cheaper output, but 
somehow find the dollars to hire these so-called 'stars.' In Ann Martin's case, 
she's a fine, straight-shooting journalist who happens to be in the right city 
at the right time. But every time these huge salaries are announced, there are 
mutterings from many other solid journalists who don't know how long they will 
be on the payroll." 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate disputed that view. "The amount paid for anchors has nothing to do 
with how well a news department is financed," he said. "Critics would like to 
think that anchors prey off the newsroom and siphon off money, but that's just 
not true. We are all financed very well, and TV news has always been 
personality driven in terms of anchors." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Martin says she isn't worrying about the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not getting stressed out by all of this at all," she said. "Two weeks 
from now, someone else will be the big story and all of this will be forgotten. 
The people I meet when I'm shopping at Ralphs who tell me they like my work -- 
they're the ones who are important to me. All the rest of this stuff is 
confetti."

NO MORE 'DODGING BULLETS' FOR ACTRESS SUZZANNE DOUGLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N. F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some might call it a schizophrenic childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzzanne Douglas -- currently on both movie and television screens -- says she 
spent her early years "dodging bullets and then running home and learning about 
the arts" from her mother, a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas believes her unusual upbringing in Chicago's South Side has added 
dimension to her work. She plays a family woman married to an ex-Black Panther 
in the movie "The Inkwell," and in the CBS telefilm "Search for Grace," she 
plays the calming best friend of a woman who has a past-life experience. This 
fall, moviegoers can see her in "Jason's Lyric" as the wife of a troubled 
Vietnam veteran, played by Forest Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with two worlds," recalls Douglas, 36. "The one outside, with the 
guns and rough life, and the one in my home, where my mother was constantly 
reading and talking about the arts." 
</P>
<P>
 Her ability to effectively use skewed past emotions for her career hasn't gone 
unnoticed by those who've worked with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a very strong performer who's extremely cheerful," says Sam Pillsbury, 
director of "Search for Grace." "She's not tortured in any way -- and that's 
not to minimize her. She's like a bomb waiting to go off with an explosion of 
energy, and when you are moving so fast, as a director, it's one more thing you 
don't have to worry about. You can count on her strong, intelligent and witty 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Chicago's projects, it was a family choir -- consisting of many 
of Douglas' 125 first cousins -- that "saved me from becoming a statistic," the 
actress says. "We had a great sense of family. There was a continuing emphasis 
on education, so we read together, performed plays together and always had a 
thirst for learning." 
</P>
<P>
 But Douglas had trouble relating to her peers: "They didn't think I was black 
enough," which confounded her, since, she adds, "I grew up in an all-black 
neighborhood. I only knew white people from the movie screen." Ironically, the 
movie that changed the life of the then 9-year-old was 1965's "The Sound of 
Music."  
</P>
<P>
 "I walked out of there thinking I was Julie Andrews," she says. "I used to 
walk around singing songs from the movie. That's probably why I got beaten up 
so much. I spoke with this mah-vah-lous elocution. It was such an escape for 
me. But I was very aware of who I was." 
</P>
<P>
 What she didn't understand, she says emphatically, was that "during 
Reconstruction, after slavery, you couldn't keep blacks from their thirst for 
learning. It's very indicative of blacks, that spirit of wanting to learn and 
know more. I was so perplexed by them not thinking I wasn't black enough. Were 
they saying that black people who wanted an education and spoke well weren't 
black enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 By high school, Douglas realized how drawn she was to acting, singing and 
dancing, despite the derision of her peers. After being spit on during a 
production of "You're a Good Man Charlie Brown," she was even more determined 
to become a successful actress.  
</P>
<P>
 She performed in musical revues, studied at the Illinois University Stage 
Institute (sharing the stage with John Malkovich, Judith Ivey, Robert Townsend 
and Laurie Metcalf) and racked up the Broadway credits: "Threepenny Opera" 
(co-starring Sting), "The Tap Dance Kid" and "Into the Woods." 
</P>
<P>
 Her first movie role -- in 1989's "Tap," tapping and acting opposite Gregory 
Hines -- earned her that year's NAACP Image Award for best supporting actress. 
</P>
<P>
 Married to Dr. Roy Jonathan Cobb for "five glorious years," Douglas is ready 
to start a family and settle into both their New Jersey home and the one 
they're building on Martha's Vineyard. "We put ourselves as a priority in each 
other lives," she says. "That's our life. It's not about whether I get another 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet acting remains important to her. She's set to work on an as-yet-unnamed 
feature film with her "Inkwell" co-star, Joe Morton, in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas' inspirations include her mother -- who had only a high-school 
education and turned a bank temp-job into a vice presidency -- and her 
mother-in-law, Jewell Plummer Cobb, former Cal State Fullerton president, who 
was the first African American woman university president. If they persisted 
for their successes, she says, so can she. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a good life now," she sums up simply. "You draw from life, go into 
your own life to help create a character. I've had a very full life and I can't 
wait to see what God has in store for me in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Search for Grace" airs next Tuesday from 9-11 p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 
8). "The Inkwell" is now playing in theaters.

ABC THINKS 7 WILL BE FALL'S LUCKY NUMBER; TELEVISION: FOUR COMEDIES, TWO DRAMAS 
AND 'THE ABC FAMILY MOVIE' WILL JOIN THE NETWORK'S SEVEN RETURNING SOPHOMORE 
SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 ABC, coming off a strong season with seven returning sophomore series, on 
Monday announced its new prime-time lineup for the fall, bidding to dethrone 
ratings champion CBS with the help of a one-hour drama from the creators of 
"thirtysomething" and a program starring Korean American comedian Margaret Cho. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the proliferation of network newsmagazines, one of ABC's entries in 
this field, "Day One," failed to make the fall schedule and was bumped back to 
midseason. But "Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman," much praised but 
with borderline ratings, made the final cut and will return this fall in its 
same Sunday time slot. 
</P>
<P>
 According to ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert, the network's large 
number of returning series, plus its broadcasts of the World Series, the Super 
Bowl and the Academy Awards, gives the company a good shot at No. 1 in total 
household ratings next season, a crown that CBS has worn for three consecutive 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC was virtually neck-and-neck for the lead this season until the Winter 
Olympics, propelled by the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan rivalry and its stain 
of scandal, enabled CBS to pull away with huge ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore series returning for ABC include "Grace Under Fire," "NYPD Blue," 
"Turning Point," "These Friends of Mine" (which will be retitled "Ellen," after 
star Ellen Degeneres), "Boy Meets World," "Thunder Alley" and "Lois & Clark." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the canceled series from this past season's prime-time schedule were 
"Thea," "The Byrds of Paradise," "Phenom," "The New America's Funniest People" 
and the "ABC Monday Night Movie." Other ABC series axed this season include 
"Birdland," "George," "Joe's Life," "Missing Persons," "Moon Over Miami," "The 
Paula Poundstone Show," "Where I Live" and "The Critic" (which Fox has picked 
up for next season). 
</P>
<P>
 The seven new fall series include four comedies, two dramas and "The ABC 
Family Movie," an 8-10 p.m. Saturday entry that the network experimented with 
this year and that will include remakes of Disney motion pictures, other 
made-for-TV movies and feature films, said network spokesman Pete Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC has been notoriously unsuccessful on Saturday nights. But last year's 
surprise success of CBS' "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" indicated there is an 
audience for traditional entertainment on that night. Although ABC focuses on a 
younger audience than CBS, aiming chiefly at viewers 18 to 49, Barrett said of 
the early Saturday movie attempt: 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a presentation that parents and their children will be able to enjoy 
together. We feel that if we put on good movies, we'll be able to win some 
viewers over who have been watching videocassettes, renting movies and playing 
video games. We're after young families here who have not been watching 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of ABC's ratings strengths traditionally has been to target young families 
with its regular weekly series. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC finished the 1993-94 season with six of the 10 top-rated series: "Home 
Improvement," "Roseanne," "These Friends of Mine," "Grace Under Fire," "Coach" 
and "NFL Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
 The new drama from "thirtysomething" creators Edward Zwick and Marshall 
Herskovitz is "My So-Called Life," which deals with the experiences of a 
15-year-old girl as she tries "to figure out who she is and where she belongs 
in relation to her family, friends and high-school contacts." The series, which 
the network will launch in late summer, features Claire Danes as the girl, with 
Bess Armstrong as her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho, a well-known performer in comedy clubs, makes a breakthrough for Asian 
Americans in her new half-hour series, "All American Girl." In the sitcom, ABC 
said, she is "a totally assimilated college graduate whose very traditional 
Korean-American family provides her with support, but erects a few cultural 
roadblocks in her quest to be a very American young woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "All American Girl" has been scheduled preceding network television's No. 1 
series, "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Other new ABC series: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Blue Skies," a sitcom starring Corey Parker and Matt Roth as two young 
friends and partners in a "small but thriving back-to-nature mail-order 
catalogue business" whose relationship is tested when an attractive female 
Harvard graduate arrives to straighten out their books. 
</P>
<P>
 * "On Our Own," a sitcom in which "the oldest of seven orphaned children 
concocts an outrageous scheme to impersonate his aunt in order to keep his 
family from being separated by well-meaning social workers." Ralph Harris stars 
as the young impersonator, and six members of a family called the Smolletts are 
featured. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Me and the Boys," a sitcom with stand-up comedian Steve Harvey as a widower 
who is bringing up three young sons under the watchful eye of his mother-in-law 
(Madge Sinclair). 
</P>
<P>
 * "McKenna," a drama starring TV veteran Chad Everett ("Medical Center") as 
the head of a family that provides tours for guests who come to their ranch in 
the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A number of the new series -- including "My So-Called Life," "McKenna" and "Me 
and the Boys" -- are owned, wholly or in part, by ABC as the major networks 
increasingly take steps to assure their financial futures. 
</P>
<P>
 In its shifting of shows, ABC has moved the reliable ratings entry "Coach" 
from its post-"Roseanne" slot to the 8 p.m. position opening the Monday lineup. 
Switching "Coach," however, means that the program will be seen here in the 
West following "Monday Night Football." Getting the coveted spot following 
"Roseanne" is "Ellen."  
</P>
<P>
 After football ends, the Monday schedule, which formerly replaced the gridiron 
contests with movies, will be "Coach," "Blue Skies," "The Marshal" -- a new, 
contemporary one-hour drama about a lawman who chases fugitives -- and "Day 
One." 
</P>
<P>
 Also returning at midseason, ABC said, will be the series "Matlock" and 
"Sister, Sister." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is ABC's night-by-night lineup for fall: 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday: "America's Funniest Home Videos," "On Our Own," "Lois & Clark: The New 
Adventures of Superman," "ABC Sunday Night Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday: "Monday Night Football," "Coach," "Blue Skies." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday: "Full House," "Me and the Boys," "Roseanne," "Ellen," "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday: "Thunder Alley," "All American Girl," "Home Improvement," "Grace 
Under Fire," "Turning Point." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday: "My So-Called Life," "McKenna," "PrimeTime Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: "Family Matters," "Boy Meets World," "Step By Step," "Hangin' With Mr. 
Cooper," "20/20." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday: "ABC Family Movie," "The Commish."

TALES OF HOLLYWOOD, TOLD BY HOLLYWOOD; THEATER: STARRY READERS OFFER A CRASH 
COURSE ON THE IMAGE OF HOLLYWOOD IN AMERICAN FICTION IN A 10-WEEK SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crowds are different from the restive, hard-eyed fans who straddle the red 
carpet outside the Music Center at Oscar time or bunch up behind velvet ropes 
at movie premieres. 
</P>
<P>
 These followers are a different stripe of Hollywood camper -- some carry first 
editions of "The Day of the Locust," "The Last Tycoon," or "What Makes Sammy 
Run?" 
</P>
<P>
 They don't rush or mob the screen celebrities who come to read aloud from 
novels about the movies but treat them with the deference of someone delivering 
a recital on a leafy campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Except this is no Ivy League garden. It's the Met Theatre, a 99-seat house off 
seedy Western and Santa Monica. But no matter. The valet parking is safe, and 
the presentations inside the theater each Tuesday night are full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Dustin Hoffman on opening night reading a chapter from "What Makes 
Sammy Run?" while the book's robust 80-year-old author, Budd Schulburg, sat a 
few feet away. You could feel the pride felt by Schulberg, who had also just 
listened to another actor, Tom Bowers, read from Schulberg's "The 
Disenchanted."  
</P>
<P>
 When Hoffman finished reading a particularly biting passage about Sammy Glick 
(a crass Hollywood studio product of the '30s and '40s), he looked into the 
audience, grinned and said "nothing in Hollywood to this date has changed." 
Schulberg, who read a short story of his own, agreed that Sammy Glick would 
still feel right at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed later, Hoffman said: "The first novel I ever read in my life, when 
I was 14 or 15, was 'What Makes Sammy Run?' I read all Schulberg's books. I 
can't think of a bigger honor to read before the man whose work influenced me 
early on. It was a heightened rush." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Met Theatre's "Great Writers Series V: Movies in Literature," 
an oasis of reflection about movies, a civilized repast from the hurly-burly of 
"the industry" and the frenzy of media locusts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best-kept secret in town," chortled one patron, Nick Beck, a 
retired Associated Press reporter and former journalism professor. "You see 
some of the best screen and stage actors for just $10 in addition to the 
writers who show up." 
</P>
<P>
 F. Scott Fitzgerald's low-life, Hollywood hack, out-of-pocket screenwriter Pat 
Hobby, from Esquire's old "Pat Hobby Stories," was humorously brought to life 
by Arliss Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 And last Tuesday there was Raquel Welch, in a devilish touch, reading from 
Gore Vidal's stinging Hollywood satire, "Myra Breckenridge," which was made 
into a witless, disastrous 1970 movie in which Welch played the title role. 
</P>
<P>
 Teamed with reader Harry Hamlin, she read smoothly and in an interview 
backstage said that she had prepared hard and "had diagramed the material." 
Nearly a quarter century after filming the movie, she said she still remembers 
it as a "chaotic experience . . . in which no one knew what anyone else was 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Launched in late April with little fanfare and extending into late June, this 
unusual 10-week, 10-session series is a crash course on the image of Hollywood 
in American fiction. It's a hot topic at the Met, which is demonstrating that 
creative fiction about Tinseltown is vaster than we imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bill tonight, for instance, Bruce Wagner reads from his novel "Force 
Majeure" and his screenplay "Maps to the Stars," which will be embellished by 
special guests Rosanna Arquette, Dana Delany and Kim Cattrall. 
</P>
<P>
 The brainchild of producer-director and genial host Darrell Larson, the 
sessions are drawing packed houses of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Storytellers, of course, have been around since the ancient world. Today 
authors regularly read from their work on public radio, and poetry corners 
abound. But Larson's innovation, initiated with his first writers' series four 
years ago when he landed William Styron (Larson's father-in-law), has 
underscored people's hunger for oral literature in a formal setting, 
particularly when it's anchored to a theme. (For next year, Larson is 
considering such themes as Native American literature and "angels in 
literature." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Future weeks will bring L.A. novelist James ("The Black Dalia") Ellroy reading 
his "Dick Contino's Blues"; Roddy McDowall (who Larson says "embodies the 
history of Hollywood") reading from Christopher Isherwood's novel about a young 
screenwriter, "Prater Violet," and Ed Harris, Michael Ontkean, Amy Madigan, 
Penny Fuller, Mariska Hargitay (Jayne Mansfield's daughter) and writers David 
Freeman and Gavin ("Inside Daisy Clover") Lambert, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fun for me," said Larson, "is casting the right actor to fit the 
material. I liked Hoffman's edginess for Sammy Glick. If they ever make 'Sammy' 
into a movie, Hoffman would be great." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Great Writers Series V: Movies in Literature" is presented Tuesdays, 8 
p.m., at the Met Theatre, 1089 N. Oxford Ave., Hollywood, through June 21. $10.

ART; LOOKING AFRESH AT THE VISUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students today "are very keyed up about the visual," says Sally A. Stein, 
chairwoman of the art-history department at UC Irvine. Art-history classes at 
UCI are experiencing only slight dips in enrollment these days, unlike in some 
other disciplines, Stein says.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite UCI's reputation as a major research institution, however, the 
university has not been able to offer specialized training in art history for 
students who already have bachelor's degrees. The seven-member art-history 
department isn't large enough to start a graduate program by itself, and budget 
cuts keep it from expanding. (Task forces have recommended a $10.8-million cut 
in UCI's 1994-95 budget.) 
</P>
<P>
 That will be remedied in the fall, when the department launches an innovative 
interdisciplinary Ph.D program -- thanks to a cooperative arrangement with the 
UCI departments of history, English and comparative literature, and East Asian 
languages and literatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty members affiliated with the new program also include specialists in 
film studies and comparative culture; in addition, most of the female 
professors are also active in women's studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein, whose area of expertise embraces American art, photography and 
mass-media and feminist theory, says the program wants its budding art 
historians to avoid fixing narrowly on art objects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to think about other kinds of communicative codes in society. . 
. . The real task and challenge is to weave together contemporary theoretical 
debates with the . . . objects -- to sacrifice neither to the other." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the days when I spent seven bleary days a week camped out at the UC 
Berkeley art-history library, graduate students were expected to learn a set of 
detective skills to come up with plausible theories about the art of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 By minutely examining works of art, familiarizing ourselves with literary 
sources, and researching pertinent historical data, we could speculate about 
the period of an undated work, the evolution of a regional or individual style, 
shifts in patronage or the differences between the hand of a master and the 
style of his (rarely her) student, studio assistant or colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of our work followed in the tradition of art-history scholarship, with 
its zealous attention to stylistic nuance. But the Postmodern tornado had 
already had begun spinning through our department, turning this narrow focus of 
attention into a broader look at the culture that produced the art. 
</P>
<P>
 While we still paid keen attention to the trajectories of famous artists' 
careers, we also learned to investigate what else was going on -- from cheap 
prints sold to the masses to funerary sculptures produced in provincial 
colonies of sophisticated ancient cities. 
</P>
<P>
 We scrutinized works of art for their "hidden" messages about all sorts of 
things: moral standards of the day, encroaching urbanization, scientific 
advances, contemporary views of the insane, presentational styles in local 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet although a Post-Structuralist revolution swept through the English 
departments of U.S. universities during the past decade, art-history 
departments were slow to embrace a non-traditional approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Southern California, we have (major art museums), but the movie business 
and advertising are enormous producers of pop culture," says James Herbert, an 
associate professor of art history who came to UCI this year USC expressly to 
help initiate the new Ph.D program. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things are taken very seriously by academics at UCI (who study) a wide 
range of visual artifacts and are not hostage to established categories of high 
art," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most important categories gets left out when you study (only) 
those privileged artifacts stored in museums. If you take the category of art 
as a given, you never look at . . . what it means for paintings to be in 
museums and for Mickey Mouse to be in Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of a UCI faculty member who combines traditional and new 
approaches, Herbert mentions Margaret Miles, professor of Greek and Roman art 
and architecture, whose work in classical archeology involves digging up "pot 
fragments and every other piece of garbage in downtown Athens, not only the 
most privileged objects in that society." 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert, a specialist in modern European art and critical theory, also points 
out that art historians are in a particularly good position these days to 
contribute to intellectual discourse in allied fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies in the humanities nationwide have recently taken an interest in 
visual images" after a decade of emphasis on language, he said. "Art historians 
have been thinking about pictorial metaphor, how visuality works as a 
language." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to elaborate on the trend toward visual thinking, Herbert cited an 
article by A. J. T. Mitchell, a professor at the University of Chicago, in 
Artforum magazine ("The Pictorial Turn," March, 1992). 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, Mitchell writes, "the fantasy of . . . a culture totally dominated 
by images has now become a real technical possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Ours is a culture, he writes, in which "a supposedly alert, educated 
population can witness the destruction of an entire Arab society as nothing 
more than a spectacular television melodrama, complete with a simple narrative 
of good triumphing over evil." 
</P>
<P>
 Visual culture today, Mitchell concludes, is "too deeply embedded in 
technologies of desire, domination and violence, too saturated with reminders 
of neo-fascism and global corporate culture, to be ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is designed to provide personal faculty attention, the UCI 
art-history Ph.D program will have only four entering students next fall, 
selected from about 20 applicants. Stein said those who have been selected are 
distinguished by "a great deal of initiative in pursuing personal intellectual 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 One incoming student is a South Korean woman who said she wants to study the 
history of photography with Stein. The other three, all from the United States, 
will focus on ancient art, Chinese art and African American art in the 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the fledgling Ph.D program already has an enrollment of one: Amy 
Marver, who was a student of Herbert at USC. Marver (the winner of a 
prestigious Smithsonian Institution Pre-Doctoral Fellowship for study next fall 
at the National Museum of American History in Washington) is writing a 
dissertation on "the domestication of the concept of the modern in New York in 
1930s," Herbert said. Her project will discuss the way women decorating their 
homes were influenced by such varied sources as the design department at the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York, the 1939 World's Fair and department store 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ph.D program accepts students with either a bachelor's or master's degree, 
but it isn't set up to grant master's degrees. Herbert says this is the result 
of "the shifting nature of professional demands -- even teaching (art history) 
at a community college requires a Ph.D," as well as the department's limited 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 As in most graduate art-history programs, the expectation at UCI is that the 
emerging Ph.D's will teach at the college level. When I was at UC Berkeley, in 
fact, the faculty tended to disparage museum work as a distinctly inferior 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stein says she hopes the program will eventually "begin to talk about 
museum practice and exhibition theory." Other occupational possibilities for 
newly minted art historians with doctoral degrees, Stein said, include arts 
administration and art book publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the world outside the academe, UCI's art-history department -- 
which still needs two innovative younger scholars to fill positions in modern 
and contemporary Art and Japanese art -- has hit on a savvy way to blend the 
Ph.D program's personnel needs with community outreach. A series of early 
evening lectures open to the public will give a diverse group of candidates for 
the positions the opportunity to strut their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The program (in Room 130, Humanities Office Building II) begins May 23 at 5 
p.m. with Bettina Bergmann, who teaches art at Mount Holyoke College. Her juicy 
subject is "Marital Trouble in Region Nine: 'The House of Fatal Love' in 
Pompeii." Next fall, the program resumes with lectures by scholars such as Jane 
Blocker (author of a forthcoming book on the contemporary Cuban American artist 
Ana Mendieta) and Aline Brandauer (who is working on a book about the 
interaction between Mexico and Paris in Surrealist art circles).

SUSPECTED SLIDE IN LAGUNA BEACH FEARED LARGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The size of a suspected ancient landslide beneath a neighborhood already hard 
hit by fire and an earlier slide may be larger than previously believed, 
according to geologists. 
</P>
<P>
 In a proposal made public Monday, Geofirm -- a geotechnical consulting company 
-- recommended an extensive study of the geology underlying about 65 lots in 
the Temple Hills area. Initial reports had indicated that no more than three 
streets might be affected, but geologists now say the study area should include 
portions of eight streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The area -- including parts of Bayview Place, Buena Vista Way, Temple Hills 
Drive, Canyon View Drive, Wendt Terrace, Griffith Way, Glomstad Lane and Wilcox 
Drive -- is the second fire-damaged neighborhood here to be shaken by reports 
of suspected ancient landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings, if correct, threaten to delay the efforts of victims of the 
devastating Oct. 27 fire to rebuild their homes and raise questions about 
whether the owners of surviving houses may be required to perform costly 
stabilization. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the city learned that an ancient landslide could lie under 50 lots 
in the Mystic Hills neighborhood and contracted with Geofirm to study the area. 
That report, due to be delivered to city officials on Wednesday, confirms that 
a slide exists there but also shows that it affects fewer than 20 lots, about 
half the size of the original study area, according to a source close to the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, after reports from geologists and one property owner of the 
possibility of similar problems under Buena Vista Way and two nearby streets in 
the Temple Hills area, city officials asked Geofirm to prepare a proposal to 
examine that area as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-part study, which would cost the city $38,000, is scheduled to be 
considered at tonight's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract calls for a study that would take an estimated six to eight weeks 
and involve drilling test borings an average of 80 feet deep. The suspected 
slide, evidence of which was discovered by geologists contracted by private 
homeowners to prepare geological studies of their property in the wake of the 
fire, is believed to lie 65 to 76 feet below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the affected lots, 15 or 16 were damaged or destroyed by the fire, with the 
remainder involving existing homes and a few vacant lots, said Terry Brandt, 
municipal services director. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Geofirm declined to comment Monday either on the Temple Hills 
proposal or the Mystic Hills report, now nearly completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Councilman Wayne L. Peterson said Monday he thinks the city 
should move rapidly to study the second area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's essentially taking the same action we took in Mystic Hills," he said. "I 
think that's what we need to do and do it as quickly as we can. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always known there were problems (on city hillsides), we just didn't 
know to what degree." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, life continued as usual for some residents in the affected section 
of Temple Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Moore, a Temple Hills Drive resident whose home suffered relatively 
minor damage in the fire, appeared unfazed by the latest dose of bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had any slide problems and we've been here 22 years, so we're not 
really worried about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On nearby Buena Vista Way, where a small landslide in March, 1993, caused two 
homes to slide toward each other, another resident paused while walking his dog 
to discuss the report that his property may sit atop an ancient landslide. The 
man, who asked not to be identified, said he was not shocked by the latest 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got this house up here," he said, gesturing toward a condemned, 
still-sagging house up the street. "We've had fires, we've had floods, we've 
had earthquakes. So why should we be shocked?" 
</P>
<P>
 Other area homeowners, who received maps and notices from the city over the 
weekend that their properties lay inside the study area, appeared equally 
sanguine Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Olson, whose Canyon View Drive home is still under repair after it was 
damaged in last year's landslide, noted that geologists told city officials 
then that the slippage might have occurred because water leaking from a broken 
pipe had reactivated an ancient landslide. The responsibility for that slide, 
which forced the condemnation of two other houses, is still the subject of 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the latest disclosure, Olson said she "pretty much took it in stride." 
After all, she said, "most of Laguna seems to have ancient landslides under 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Several streets down the hill, Barbara Morrissey said she was confident the 
old slide would not affect her Wendt Terrace property, which came through the 
fire unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It only affects the folks who are trying to rebuild," Morrissey said. 
"They're not going to make the people whose houses are OK tear them down and 
rebuild them again. It hasn't concerned me in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 With regard to the Mystic Hills problem, city staff previously suggested that 
the city consider creating a special tax assessment district to pay for any 
required stabilization of the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Laguna's post-fire rebuilding effort is inching forward. As 
of Friday, 153 applications had been submitted to the city for plan checks. 
Only five permits have been issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the necessary geological clearance, fire victims whose lots are in the 
potential problem areas cannot obtain building permits from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city officials say that displaced residents can still have their 
architectural plans prepared and get preliminary approvals from the city. 
Search for Slide Area 
</P>
<P>
 If the Laguna Beach City Council approves, geologists will extract earth 
samples to determine if an ancient landslide exists under the Temple Hills 
neighborhood. The study would take about six to eight weeks and involve about 
65 lots. Earlier this year a different slide area was identified in the Mystic 
Hills neighborhood.

WILSON CALLS FOR REVIEW OF CLAS EXAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL and CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adding a big new voice to the spreading controversy over the California 
Learning Assessment System, the Wilson Administration has called for an 
independent review and a financial audit of the pioneering exams, which the 
governor's education adviser said were "seriously flawed." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can no longer wait for the Department of Education to act on its own to 
resolve the public's concern and restore confidence to the CLAS exam," Maureen 
DiMarco, Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary for child development and education, said 
in a statement released late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the CLAS tests, Wilson said: "It appears that the execution of 
this good idea has been disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
 His letter to Auditor General Kurt Sjoberg asked that the review pay 
"particular attention" to the procedures used to develop the test questions and 
to the process used by the education department in selecting a private 
contractor to handle exam administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Several school districts have suspended the tests until a Los Angeles County 
Superior Court judge decides if they violate the state's Education Code. 
Monday, officials of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District became 
the latest to make that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District will vote later today on whether to 
suspend testing. And the Capistrano Unified School District, which continues to 
give the tests, has postponed processing them pending the court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, the California Teachers Assn., the state's largest 
teachers union and an early supporter of CLAS, also blasted the State 
Department of Education's handling of the system. CTA President Del Weber on 
Sunday called for the exams to be suspended until a full review by a panel of 
teachers, parents and other concerned citizens can be conducted. On Monday, the 
Senate Rules Committee set up procedures for legislators to begin reviewing the 
tests later this week. Like other standardized exams, the CLAS tests are kept 
confidential to protect their fairness and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's top education department official defended the tests and said he 
welcomes the audit. But he also hinted that DiMarco was using the controversy 
to further her campaign for state superintendent of public instruction in the 
June 7 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and DiMarco have been strong supporters of CLAS, which is scheduled to 
be phased in over several years. But all along they have called for the 
inclusion of more traditional approaches, such as multiple-choice questions. 
They sought less emphasis on the open-ended, "performance-based" items that 
have brought the new system praise from education reformers, testing experts 
and business leaders -- but criticism from others. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old system of tests, currently being used statewide for public 
school students in grades four, five, eight and 10, were first attacked last 
year by religious conservatives, who contended that the reading and writing 
portions of the exams are anti-religion, anti-family values and invasive of 
students' privacy by improperly asking questions that touch on personal or 
family experiences and views. 
</P>
<P>
 The organized campaign against the tests, which attempt to assess higher-level 
thinking skills by asking students to write about their reactions to literature 
selections, picked up steam after controversies developed over scoring and 
implementation. As more school board members began privately reviewing the 
tests in response to the furor, the controversy mushroomed, especially over 
questions on the eighth- and 10th-grade reading and writing tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the uproar has centered on whether questions pry into students' 
beliefs or practices about family life, sex, morality or religious aspects of 
students' private lives and whether the tests should require parent permission. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, who has not seen the exams, said her concerns go beyond issues of 
privacy. After speaking with "numerous" school board members who have seen the 
tests, DiMarco said, she became worried that the tests may further racial or 
ethnic stereotypes. She said she has heard complaints that some passages were 
"questionable as sexist or portraying handicaps in a stereotypical manner." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have major concerns about the questions that appear on the eighth- and 
10th-grade language arts exams, and I seriously question whether the items 
actually measure the skills CLAS was designed to test," DiMarco wrote in a memo 
to the governor over the weekend. She requested an audit of how the Department 
of Education spent the almost $28 million allotted for test development and 
administration, as well as a review of the tests by an independent panel made 
up of "parents and other parties who are legitimately concerned" about test 
content. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco said Monday that her office has been "trying to get the department to 
fix this and restore the system to credibility, and they have refused." 
</P>
<P>
 At a Sacramento news conference, William D. Dawson, acting state 
superintendent, said he is supportive of an independent examination of the test 
items and welcomes refinements. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the remarks by the CTA, Wilson and DiMarco are "much too hot for 
the interests of schools and kids" and play into the hands of test opponents. 
He described opponents as "very conservative individuals and organizations who 
are using extraordinary myths, and in some cases outright lies, about what is 
on the test and basically stampeding others." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson said he would have preferred DiMarco to have used a "more measured and 
problem-solving tone. (But) this is a time of the making of strong statements 
for election purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco denied that her criticisms are electioneering. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson also insisted that although the Wilson Administration, school boards, 
the CTA and others have criticized the CLAS process, they have continued to 
support the system's basic goals and direction.

O.C. BROKER DENIES ROLE IN LAS VEGAS KIDNAPING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men are on trial here for allegedly kidnaping the daughter of casino mogul 
Steven A. Wynn, but Spyro Kemble's reputation is on trial, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine real estate broker has been accused of being a figure in the July 
26 kidnaping of Kevin Wynn, 27, who was released unharmed after her father -- 
the chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc. -- paid a $1.45-million ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble took the witness stand in federal court Monday and denied any 
involvement during hours of testimony that touched on $100 bills stacked in 
bundles and negotiations to buy a $200,000 Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 As the trial began last week, defense attorney Don Albregts had implicated 
Kemble by alleging he was the man who drove Wynn's daughter to the airport, 
where she was freed two hours after the kidnaping. And Albregts said $500,000 
of the ransom money was found in the garage of Kemble's home. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a prosecutor questioned Kemble on Monday whether he had any prior 
knowledge of the kidnaping or any involvement, Kemble flatly replied: "No I did 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 Composed and peering directly at the jurors, Kemble, 36, said the only thing 
he could be accused of is being best friends with Ray Marion Cuddy, whom 
federal prosecutors say orchestrated the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping trial has gripped Las Vegas, a gambling mecca beleaguered by 
mounting casino holdups, some by accused Los Angeles gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Kevin Wynn was kidnaped at gunpoint from her Las Vegas home, 
bound with surgical tape and clothing and placed on the floor of her car, an 
Audi with the license plate BIONDA, Italian for blonde. She was driven to 
McCarran International Airport, where she was found after the ransom had been 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony last week, the victim said she was forced to disrobe and 
photographed in her underwear with one of her assailants as "insurance" in case 
her father contacted police instead of paying her ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said he and Cuddy were so close, that over the years, he had loaned 
Cuddy money, his credit card, and even shared his home. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cuddy had some rough financial times, Kemble testified, after the 
kidnaping, his friend was suddenly spending cash lavishly, seeking to buy an 
expensive car and a $20,000 watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said Cuddy told him, " 'Our ship has come in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy, formerly of Newport Beach, had been an usher at Kemble's first wedding, 
and had lived with him occasionally through the 14 years of their friendship, 
Kemble testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble also told the court he had his father, a lawyer in Newport Beach, call 
the FBI after Cuddy's arrest when he realized his friend may have boxed ransom 
money in his garage. FBI agents secured a warrant and searched his garage after 
the call, finding $500,000 of the ransom in $100 bills stacked in several 
boxes, Kemble said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added he was questioned by the FBI and prosecutors at least 10 more times, 
with his father or an attorney usually present. Kemble, who was never arrested 
in connecting with the kidnaping, also testified before a federal grand jury 
investigating the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents and newlywed wife, who have proclaimed his innocence since 
Albregts' allegations, sat in the courtroom throughout his several hours on the 
witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy is on trial here with Jacob Sherwood, 22, on charges of kidnaping, 
extortion and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 A third defendant, Paul Watkins, 20, pleaded guilty to extortion and testified 
against Cuddy and Sherwood, his longtime friend, last week. In his testimony, 
Watkins said only he, Cuddy and Sherwood were involved in the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy was arrested in Newport Beach a few days after the kidnaping as he tried 
to complete a cash deal on the Ferrari. He had been driving Kemble's Mercedes 
at the time of the arrest and had used Kemble's credit card to reserve a suite 
at a luxury hotel, Albregts further alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Kemble's testimony Monday focused on his friendship with Cuddy and how 
they would sometimes loan each other money, depending on who needed help. The 
allegations about him driving Kevin Wynn to the airport never came up during 
the examination by Albregts. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from Assistant U.S. Atty. Jay Angelo, Kemble testified that 
he first met Cuddy in the early 1980s at the now-defunct Newport Beach Sporting 
Club. Kemble, who was born in Berlin but has lived in Orange County for most of 
his life, once worked for Cuddy as a personal fitness trainer at the club 
before receiving his real estate license and starting his own real estate 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cuddy fell on hard times in early 1993, Kemble said he loaned his friend 
more than $20,000, and let him use his credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had lent Ray money. He utilized my credit card," Kemble testified, adding 
that Cuddy never had a credit card of his own, preferring to use cash. "I sent 
him some money in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, Cuddy was counting on receiving a $500,000 settlement from a 
civil suit involving a former business partner, Kemble testified. When that 
settlement was overturned on appeal, Kemble added he had never seen his friend 
more downcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray has always been a very positive man," Kemble said. "No matter what 
happened, Ray always saw a silver lining. This particular event devastated 
Ray." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy soon after moved from Sacramento to Las Vegas, and once mentioned that 
he exercised at the same health club as Kevin Wynn, Kemble testified. Cuddy 
continued to talk about the civil lawsuit and his hope to negotiate a new 
settlement, Kemble added. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Cuddy returned to Newport Beach a day after the kidnaping aiming to 
buy a new Ferrari, Kemble said he assumed his friend had settled the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me our ship has come in," Kemble testified. "I understood that was to 
be that the lawsuit was finally over. Ray had received his money. We could all 
go on with our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble testified that Cuddy paid him back the money he had borrowed and lent 
him at least another $9,000. Kemble said he needed a loan because his business 
was "not what I intended it to be at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy continued to use his credit card occasionally, and borrowed his car 
because his own Volkswagen Rabbit was being spruced up and washed, Kemble 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble admitted to the prosecutor that he did become suspicious about the 
money when Cuddy hedged at paying cash for the Ferrari, fearing the federal 
government would learn of the transaction. Cuddy also tried to invest money 
abroad to avoid government detection, Kemble testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cuddy, Kemble said, assured him he had tax problems and was only trying to 
avoid having to pay any more money to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble testified he had no idea about Cuddy's alleged involvement in the 
kidnaping until the day his friend was arrested. When he heard that some ransom 
money had not yet been recovered, Kemble testified he became curious about the 
eight to 12 boxes Cuddy had been storing at his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Against his father's advice, Kemble said he searched the boxes and discovered 
a stack of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after his arrest, Cuddy called Kemble from jail and apologized for 
stashing the money in the boxes. Three taped calls between the two men were 
played in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry to put it there," Cuddy told Kemble. "But I didn't have a place to 
put it." 
</P>
<P>
 In one conversation, when Kemble said that he was being questioned by the FBI, 
Cuddy protested: "You know nothing about nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 In another call, Cuddy told Kemble: "I'm so ashamed of the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell Posin, the lawyer representing Cuddy, said the allegations leveled 
against Kemble by the other defense lawyer were "unexpected to me and 
unappreciated." He said he would not pursue the allegations against Kemble, 
especially since that would implicate his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I don't like about this is it makes me feel like I'm facing two 
prosecutors in the courtroom," he said. "One of them is physically in front of 
me, one of them is physically right behind me, that being my co-counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 The courtroom allegation also came as a surprise to those who know Kemble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't seem fair," said Lana Chandler of Newport Beach, who chaired 
a March of Dimes fund-raiser in which Kemble participated. "He's worked so hard 
to maintain a good image . . . and do the right thing. All I can say is great 
things about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble married for a second time about two months ago, and he and his wife now 
live in Irvine.

RANGERS KILL COUGAR THAT CHARGED AT BOY IN SAN DIEGO PARK

 Park rangers tracked and killed an adult female mountain lion in Cuyamaca 
Rancho State Park on Monday, a day after a big cat charged a child. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Fish and Game wardens and federal Animal Damage 
Control trackers found the 83-pound lion, which had rushed within five feet of 
a 3-year-old boy, after a brief search and killed it about 6 a.m., said Fish 
and Game spokesman Bob Schlichting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yuma, Ariz., family was hiking in the San Diego County park Sunday when 
the animal bared its teeth and crouched to spring until the boy's father warded 
it off by waving a stick and shouting, he told officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's cougar confrontation was not the first for the park or the area. In 
September, the same park closed briefly while rangers tracked and killed a 
cougar that bit a little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 County park rangers at Aliso and Woods Canyons Regional Park in Laguna Beach 
received reports in April and May of mountain lion sightings from park 
visitors, which prompted rangers to ask the state Department of Fish and Game 
to investigate.

TEACHER PASSES TEST; STUDENTS REJOICE AT HER RECOVERY FROM A HEART ATTACK 
SUFFERED IN CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No celebrity staging a comeback can claim a more loyal following than Marjorie 
Jane Blasjo, an El Modena High School English teacher felled by cardiac arrest 
a year ago as she worked in her classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three weeks short of retirement after 33 years of teaching, the 
65-year-old woman was saved from death by the fast action of her students, only 
to face seemingly insurmountable obstacles to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tragic for us," said Gail Richards, then the principal at El Modena 
High, where Blasjo had worked for 26 years. "We were going to have a party for 
her retirement. We were so happy for her. Then it seemed in a moment it was all 
taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 Without warning, Blasjo's heart stopped beating the morning of May 24, 1993, 
as she graded papers in an advanced English class.  
</P>
<P>
 "Her lips were blue and she hunched over," said Philip Le, a student in the 
class who began cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a skill he had learned in the 
Army Reserve. Le said he was assisted later by a teacher who breathed into 
Blasjo's mouth while Le compressed her chest. 
</P>
<P>
 The students also summoned paramedics and watched in horror as their teacher 
was taken from the classroom on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
 After 72 hours in a coma, Blasjo's prognosis was grim. Her husband, Wes, who 
retired last June from his job as an industrial arts teacher at El Modena High, 
recalls that a neurologist who examined her at Chapman General Hospital in 
Orange "said there was not much hope for her being anything more than a 
vegetable." 
</P>
<P>
 But Blasjo's recovery has surprised her physicians. She struggled first to 
merely open her eyes and move her fingers, then to speak, eat and take her 
first steps as she clung to parallel bars. She learned to use a wheelchair, 
walk haltingly with assistance, dress herself and apply make-up. 
</P>
<P>
 She also has taken up her favorite hobby, oil painting, again. One of her 
landscapes was chosen as the cover of the 1994 calendar published by Tustin 
Rehabilitation Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen a miracle before our very eyes," Wes Blasjo said of his wife's 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Blasjo ended a year of treatment in hospitals and rehabilitation 
facilities and went home. It was a landmark day for her, as well as the Santa 
Ana rehabilitation home -- Meridian Neuro Care Center -- where she has been 
living since September. A spokeswoman for the home, which specializes in 
nursing victims of severe brain injuries, said the staff rarely sees a patient 
recover so dramatically. In celebration, the staff last week threw Blasjo a 
going-home party attended by more than 100 of her friends, including many 
former students. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasjo still has severe physical and mental limitations. She is fed in part 
through a stomach tube. And although she seems to understand what is said to 
her, she has no memory of what has happened since her attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain damage has also destroyed Blasjo's ability to recall events immediately 
after they occur, although much of the past is still clear to her. For example, 
she cried in appreciation when she saw a huge cake with her picture on it at 
the party. A few minutes later, she denied she had ever seen the cake, although 
she was still grasping in her hand the tissue with which she had wiped her 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
 But she remembers her students well, especially the ones who had a special 
flair for English composition. "I have had many successes," she said, referring 
to former students who have entered top universities. 
</P>
<P>
 And she can still find on a map of Africa the town near Nairobi where she 
served as a young missionary in the 1950s. "Do you remember when you killed an 
elephant with a rifle?" coaxed her eldest son, Alan, 44. "Where was he?" 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the yard," said Blasjo. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what was he doing?" 
</P>
<P>
 "He was chasing your brother," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon returning to the United States from Africa, Blasjo earned a teaching 
credential from Cal State Long Beach in 1960 and began teaching for the Orange 
Unified School District. Later she received a master's degree in education 
administration at the University of La Verne. She chaired the English 
department at El Modena High for five years and headed the school district's 
English department for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Blasjo raised a family of eight children, three of whom were 
adopted. After a divorce from her first husband, she married Wes Blasjo, who 
had four children. Wes Blasjo said she would also welcome into their house 
children "who for one reason or another needed a home. Some people take home 
cats and dogs. She took home kids." And she has raised from birth one of her 
grandsons, who is now 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasjo's former students said they were delighted and impressed by Blasjo's 
past, especially when she would spice up a lesson in American literature by 
talking about her friendship with Ernest Hemingway while both were in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Former student Stephanie Asche said she and her classmates were in awe of 
Blasjo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she is one of those Renaissance people who has done everything," said 
Asche, a junior at Pepperdine University. "I wanted her to write a book about 
her life, she had lived so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Richards, who is now principal of Irvine High School, said Blasjo was 
"beloved" by her students, many of whom continued to attend Blasjo's annual 
Christmas week open house long after they graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards said Blasjo had "mastered the art of teaching," using "every minute 
to keep her students thinking. It was almost exhausting to be in her classroom. 
She had very high expectations and pushed the kids to reach their maximum. She 
was so good at it, it was fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Some relatives and colleagues believe Blasjo's rigorous work schedule -- which 
included a long commute to her home in Riverside and four nights each week of 
teaching adult education -- finally caught up with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She cared about everybody and she cared too much," said Richards. "She was 
pushing herself too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Blasjo said his wife had begun to fear gang activity in the community 
surrounding El Modena High. She was concerned about reports of some students 
carrying knives and guns. She was looking forward to retiring to a lakeside 
home they had bought in Arkansas, he said, "to get away from guns and graffiti 
and the threat of violence in California." 
</P>
<P>
 But at her going-home party, Blasjo said she had no regrets. Dressed in a 
multicolored pantsuit, she smiled and hugged former students, some of whom 
hadn't seen her since she was in intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she wished she had slowed down during her career, she shot back, "No. 
I've enjoyed every bit of it."

SPACE-SAVER SCHOOL FUNDING MAY BE RESCINDED; CONSTRUCTION: STATE OFFICIALS ARE 
UPSET THAT PART OF $22.7-MILLION ALLOCATION WOULD GO TOWARD RAZING AND 
REBUILDING STORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials have issued their strongest condemnation yet of a 
controversial proposal to build a middle school with state funds in a shopping 
center here, and they have set a vote for next month on whether to revoke $22.7 
million set aside for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for a "space-saver" school, designed to build schools in already 
developed areas without having to condemn houses and businesses, sparked 
intense criticism after a preliminary appraisal valued the property -- at the 
Bristol Market Place -- at $21.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say part of that money would go toward tearing down and 
rebuilding a HomeBase store and Montgomery Ward auto center at state expense. 
But that is one of the issues now causing the state "substantial discomfort," 
said Lyle A. Smoot, assistant executive officer of the State Allocation Board, 
which oversees school construction money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not condemning the property, so there is no reason why we would have to 
replace the existing structures. I can't see why an appraiser would include the 
replacement value of those buildings in an appraisal," Smoot said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to put any money into tearing down a building and putting it 
back up somewhere else," said state Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), who 
authored the legislation creating the space-saver concept and is chairman of 
the allocation board. "I wouldn't give them a Canadian dime for that, let alone 
a German reichsmark from World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene and Smoot have both voiced skepticism in the past about the Santa Ana 
project, but their comments in recent days marked their most strident 
criticisms, signaling the possible death knell for a proposal that has already 
fueled community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The state board has placed the project on a "recision list" and will decide 
next month whether to proceed or put the money back in the pot for other 
districts to tap, Smoot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael G. Vail, the Santa Ana Unified School District's top facilities 
planner, said he was not aware of the state's criticism or the fact that the 
allocation board could revoke the funding next month, and he was deeply 
concerned that the district could lose the nearly $23 million that the state 
set aside in December for the project at Bristol and 17th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has cooperated fully with the state in answering questions on the 
project, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing to keep in mind is that the allocation board staff contacted us and 
asked us if we wanted to do this project. They continually gave us guidance 
about what kind of site they wanted," Vail said. "All I know is that we have a 
deal. It's very clear in my mind that the people in Sacramento knew what the 
deal was." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have not complained to him about the cost of relocating the 
HomeBase and auto center, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the buildings need to be demolished. There's a cost to that, and to 
relocate them, rebuild them," Vail said. "I'm sure the allocation board staff 
knows that that is part of the appraisal. They have been out here a number of 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Santa Ana Unified School District approved the Bristol Market 
Place site in February after a contentious hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics, including neighbors, two school board members and Santa Ana City 
Councilwoman Lisa Mills, have blasted the site as inappropriate for youths and 
too costly, while some real estate experts say the district appears ready to 
pay up to three to four times what the property is worth in today's market. 
Critics insist that the district has not given serious consideration to any 
other sites, even though they might be substantially cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Vail countered that the district has reviewed many other sites. Bristol Market 
Place is the only one that satisfies state guidelines and the district's need 
for at least 11 acres, he said. The two-story intermediate school would be 
built on the mall lot, and parking underneath the school would be made 
available to mall shoppers, a dual use that Vail said he believes would satisfy 
the state's guidelines under the space-saver program.  
</P>
<P>
 Greene said moving the two businesses on the site contradicts the spirit of 
his bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original notion was that we had all this built-up territory in places 
like Los Angeles and San Francisco, so how can we build a school without moving 
anyone or tearing anything down?" Greene said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana property "is not typical of what that thought was," he said. "If 
they can prove it meets the conditions, fair enough. But they're not going to 
have a simple time proving it." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene said he hasn't "foreclosed" on the idea of building a space-saver 
school on the Santa Ana property, and he has a meeting scheduled with Vail on 
May 18.  
</P>
<P>
 But if the allocation board decides at its meeting next month that the Santa 
Ana site doesn't qualify as a space-saver, "that drops them way back in line" 
for any state school construction money, he added.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do our best to give them whatever information they ask us for," Vail 
said. "We've gone into this with good faith. . . . We have a tremendous need 
for school facilities and we're a district that has no resources to pay for our 
own schools."

SENIORS FEARFUL OF LOSING RIDES; TRANSPORTATION: POPULAR DIAL-A-RIDE PROGRAM IS 
FACING CUTBACKS. THE MONEY IS NEEDED FOR A TRANSIT SERVICE FOR THE DISABLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an emotional meeting that pitted two vulnerable groups against each other, 
local transportation officials heard testimony Monday on a plan to eliminate 
some of the county's Dial-A-Ride program for seniors while maintaining a 
similar program for disabled riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Several dozen elderly and handicapped persons crowded inside the Orange County 
Transportation Authority hearing room, where speakers expressed outrage over 
the proposal, arguing it is unfair to pit the disabled against seniors in a 
battle for scarce budget dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the transportation agency's plan to phase out most of its popular 
Dial-A-Ride program by Sept. 11 so it can fund a federally mandated 
transportation program for disabled riders. Transit officials call the agency's 
program for handicapped riders ACCESS service. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has it roots in the Americans With Disabilities Act, approved in 
1990 by Congress. It requires local transportation agencies to facilitate use 
of mass transit by the disabled, though the federal mandate came without any 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's public hearing, frustrated agency board members said there is not 
enough money to pay for both programs. The board will decide the future of the 
20-year-old Dial-A-Ride May 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, Dial-A-Ride for individuals -- where a single person can 
call for same-day transportation -- would be ended. The program would be 
retained for groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government passes a law but doesn't write a check," said board 
member and San Juan Capistrano City Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer. "We have a 
federal mandate to solve a problem with limited funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Avondle Sharum, who represented a senior services center in Santa Ana, said 
she was "appalled" by the proposal to end one program in order to save another. 
"Disabled persons are now pitted against seniors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her comment was echoed by Nora Webb, director of the Roger Senior Center in 
Huntington Beach, who said it is "a most horrendous thing pitting the two 
groups against one another." Several of the 50 speakers who addressed the board 
during a three-hour meeting expressed the same sentiment.  
</P>
<P>
 Individual Dial-A-Ride accounts for about 300,000 riders annually and costs 
the agency $5 million, according to OCTA figures. The fare is 90 cents each way 
per transportation zone, and the program is available to people 65 or older and 
some persons with disabilities. Group Dial-A-Ride services 950,000 riders a 
year and costs $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 ACCESS would cost about $4.5 million annually and would serve some 250,000 
riders. The fare is $1.50 each way. OCTA expects about 4,500 people to qualify 
for the ACCESS program by the end of June. In order to qualify, riders have to 
prove they have a disability that precludes them from riding a regular bus. 
</P>
<P>
 According to agency figures, Dial-A-Ride service is subsidized at $16 per 
trip, while ACCESS is subsidized at $22 each trip. By comparison, riders on 
fixed bus routes are subsidized at $1.55 per trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Dial-A-Ride and ACCESS provide door-to-door service. But while 
Dial-A-Ride offers same-day service, ACCESS currently requires 48-hour notice. 
Officials hope to reduce that to 24 hours by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, several seniors said that Dial-A-Ride is the difference in 
their lives between independence and being a shut-in. The program enables them 
to travel to the grocery, bank and doctor without having to impose on friends 
or family, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Ditty, executive director of San Clemente Seniors, Inc., expressed 
doubt that the agency would be able to phase out Dial-A-Ride by September 
without "disenfranchising an entire group of people." 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have a system in place to phase it out so quickly. Seniors are 
still very transit dependent and OCTA doesn't have a system in place to make 
the transition orderly. We're seeing a panic among many seniors who are afraid 
they are losing their independence come September." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has no plans now to offer an alternative service, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditty and other speakers asked the board to delay at least 18 months before 
phasing out the taxi service. By that time, the transportation agency could 
devise an alternative plan to accommodate seniors, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 While eliminating the program could cut some costs for the transit authority, 
it could also drive up costs for other agencies that serve senior citizens, 
Ditty said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If their transportation is cut off, you're going to have more homebound 
seniors," Ditty said. "This means that we're going to have to bring services to 
them, like delivering meals to their homes. Nobody has the money to pay for 
these services." 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency has until January, 1997, to comply with the federal law, 
but the agency is pushing to have it implemented by January, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials said the demand from the disabled for the federally mandated 
program is growing at such a rapid pace that it is necessary to speed up its 
implementation to maintain quality service.

CAMPAIGN REFORM LAW CHALLENGED; POLITICS: A LAWSUIT FILED BY THE WIFE OF 
ATTORNEY-ACTIVIST DANA W. REED SEEKS TO OVERTURN MEASURE T'S CONTRIBUTION 
LIMIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A political campaign reform measure that was overwhelmingly approved by Orange 
County voters in 1992 is being challenged in federal court because it prohibits 
spouses from making separate contributions beyond the $1,000 cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit challenging the campaign finance law known as Measure T was filed 
in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on April 26 by Debra L. Reed, wife of 
attorney and political activist Dana W. Reed, against Orange County and Dist. 
Atty. Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that Measure T is unconstitutional because it violates 
Debra Reed's rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association by 
preventing her from making a campaign contribution to a candidate who already 
has received the $1,000 limit from Dana Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Political activists who supported the campaign reform law said Monday that 
they believe it will be upheld in court. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was considered a huge victory at the ballot box for political 
reformists, Orange County voters in November, 1992, approved Measure T, which 
placed a first-ever cap on contributions to candidates for the Board of 
Supervisors and other county offices, such as sheriff and district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, candidates are banned from taking more than $1,000 from 
any single source during an election cycle, generally four years. 
</P>
<P>
 While the lawsuit does not dispute the $1,000 limit, it takes issue with the 
provision requiring that contributions by a husband and wife "be aggregated 
unless the contribution comes exclusively from a spouse's separate property." 
</P>
<P>
 The question over separate contributions from spouses has clouded the 
ordinance since its approval, and both sides consider the lawsuit a test case 
designed to clear up the issue once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been the continuing question as to the validity of that section, so 
(the filing of the lawsuit) didn't surprise me," Capizzi said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, who has criticized the ordinance since its inception, sent a letter to 
Capizzi several months ago asking him not to enforce the section of the law 
pertaining to spouses. But since the request was rejected, Reed and his wife 
decided to challenge its validity, their attorney, Bradley W. Hertz, said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mitchell, chairman of Orange County Common Cause, said of Dana Reed's 
pursuit of the issue: "God bless him. Let him have at it . . . Dana Reed and 
his wife and his law firm have every right to test this provision in the 
courts." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley L. Grindle, a longtime advocate of campaign finance reform in Orange 
County, said the law is fair because husbands and wives generally draw their 
money from the same commingled source. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state aggregates other contributions that come from the same pots of 
money -- for instance a man and his business, or a business and its 
subsidiaries," Grindle said, adding that if that provision of the law is struck 
down, "husbands and wives are going to be leaned on (by politicians) twice, and 
($2,000) is a hefty sum." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Dana Reed, through a business partnership, 
contributed $1,000 to Supervisor William G. Steiner, who is running for 
reelection in the June 7 primary. Then, last month, Debra Reed attempted to 
contribute $100, but her donation was returned by Steiner's treasurer because 
it violated the county ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The law "goes beyond simply restricting (Debra Reed's) First Amendment rights 
of free speech and free association," the lawsuit states. "The ordinance acts 
as a complete ban on her . . . rights in that she has been deprived of the 
opportunity to make contributions to the candidate of her choice."

 Hertz said the law effectively creates two "half people instead of two 
individual people. It limits the husband and wife to having only the 
contribution rights of one person." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit seeks a temporary injunction that would allow Debra Reed to make a 
campaign contribution prior to the June 7 election, Hertz said.

GAY MEN ARE LEADING TARGET OF HATE CRIMES; VIOLENCE: COUNTY REPORT SHOWS 
OVERALL INCIDENTS ROSE 6.4% IN 1993. FIVE VALLEY COMMUNITIES WERE IN TOP 10 FOR 
REPORTED CASES. 
</P>

<P>
 For the first time since the county began keeping track, African Americans 
have been supplanted by gay men as the leading target of hate crimes, according 
to the 14th annual report of the Los Angeles County Commission on Human 
Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall hate crimes were up 6.4% in 1993, although the percentage rise was 
smaller than in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay men accounted for 27% of the 783 hate crimes logged by local law 
enforcement agencies and community groups in 1993; 22.9% of the hate crimes 
were directed against blacks and 14.6% were directed against Jews, although 
they accounted for 95.8% of hate crimes against religious groups. Whites were 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Mornell, the commission's outgoing executive director, called the 
report a barometer of public opinion in that it represented the feelings of 
larger groups that held similar views but did not act on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are more angry, more willing to confront, willing to chance going out 
in public and getting caught," Mornell said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the San Fernando Valley was home to half of the top 
10 communities in the county where hate crimes were committed. The report 
documented 196 of 783 incidents in 1993 as occurring in the San Fernando Valley 
and surrounding communities, a 10% increase over the 177 incidents committed in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Racially motivated hate crimes were the most frequently committed in the 
Valley, with 106 incidents reported as compared to 61 related to religion, 26 
related to sexual orientation and three related to gender. 
</P>
<P>
 The report's more detailed breakdowns, such as by gay males and African 
Americans, were not reported region by region. However, sexual orientation 
crimes as a whole rose 85% in the Valley over the previous year, nearly twice 
as fast as the countywide increase of 49.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate crimes based on religion committed in the Valley also followed a 
countywide trend, dropping slightly last year over the previous year to 61 
incidents, 11 of which were reported in Woodland Hills, earning it a 
second-place ranking in the county for the most such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission officials acknowledge that the document may be underreporting the 
actual number of hate crimes committed in the county because it is based on 
crime reports and data voluntarily submitted by law enforcement and community 
organizations, a submission system that varies, sometimes drastically, from 
year to year. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, just nine law enforcement agencies provided hate crime data for 
the 1993 report -- including the district attorney's office, the county 
sheriff, the Los Angeles Police Department and local police departments -- 
compared to 16 agencies in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year many of the law enforcement agencies didn't even bother to report," 
said Celia Zager, a commission spokeswoman. "We depend on them, we're not out 
there gathering it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The report shows that countywide there has been a steady escalation in 
violence, with assaults now accounting for 43.2% of all hate crimes. Last year, 
for the first time since the county began keeping records in 1980, more hate 
crimes were committed in public places than at residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission officials, who called for stiffer penalties against hate crimes, 
said the most dramatic increase came in incidents based on sexual orientation, 
which rose 49.7% from the previous year. Gay-rights advocates attributed this 
to greater willingness by victims to come forward and to a higher public 
profile about issues such as gays in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not surprised, but we're alarmed," said Liza Culick of the L.A. Gay & 
Lesbian Community Services Center. "There's been an increased visibility. We're 
out there demonstrating, fighting for our rights. That . . . foments hatred." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley and surrounding communities, as elsewhere, some of the attacks 
on homosexuals were more violent than others: A gay man killed in Palmdale in 
July was one of three men murdered in the county last year based on his sexual 
orientation; members of a North Hollywood gay and lesbian church feared they 
were the target of coordinated hate attacks after a sign was found propped up 
against their church that read "$10 For Gay Lives Reward," followed by a 
burglary and other harassment incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Berry, a spokesman for the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People in Los Angeles, said the countywide increase in crimes against gays may 
actually reflect higher visibility for gays rather than real progress for 
African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something needs to be done stop hate crimes across the board and not just 
against one segment of the population, so that we can look at consistent and 
steady decreases instead of a few percentage points," Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever the economy is bad people tend to take out their frustrations on 
minorities," he continued. "There needs to be more education for people 
perpetrating these crimes and also greater enforcement of penalties because if 
it's a slap on wrist, they won't think about it twice." 
</P>
<P>
 His concern for enhanced enforcement was echoed by representatives of other 
racial groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "All too often we hear of police showing up to a home where there's racist 
graffiti on the wall and the family is told, 'Oh, it's only kids,' " said Kathy 
Imahara, a civil rights staff attorney with the Asian Pacific-American Legal 
Center. "That family is not going to report such an incident again." 
</P>
<P>
 Crimes against Asian Americans dropped significantly from 80 in 1992 to 44 in 
1993. But commission officials believe crimes against both Asian Americans and 
Latinos are underreported because of language problems, cultural barriers and 
fears of immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys led the Valley in hate crimes with 30 incidents. In fact, only the 
central Los Angeles area, Hollywood and Long Beach garnered higher figures in 
1993 for crimes committed against people based on their race, religion, sexual 
orientation or gender. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Detective Mitch Robins, who investigated hate crimes in the Van Nuys 
Division last year, was not surprised to hear that 30 incidents had been 
committed in his division, and he even speculated that the figure was actually 
higher. Robins said the cases he investigated shared no single motive, nor were 
they limited to any particular group of victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a myriad of different crimes motivated by hatred and prejudice," 
Robins said. "In Van Nuys the scales weren't tipping in any one direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park, North Hollywood, San Fernando and Woodland Hills were also among 
the top 10 communities reporting the highest number of hate crimes countywide, 
with each of those reporting 10 or more incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate crimes that made headlines in the San Fernando Valley and surrounding 
communities in 1993 ranged from a Lancaster couple who discovered a huge cross 
bearing hate messages and threats erected on their lawn to a North Hills couple 
arrested and subsequently convicted for conspiring to manufacture and sell 
illegal weapons to an undercover FBI agent posing as a white supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all the crimes were as high profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins of the Van Nuys Division investigated six hate crimes in as many weeks 
in February and March of last year, including one incident in which three 
Latinos pelted an African American man with rocks and bottles while speaking 
racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Imahara added that hate crimes seem to mirror what issues are being debated by 
politicians and in the media, and that anti-Asian sentiment may merely be an 
ebb this year as other topics take to the fore. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of things happening in 1992 that were fomenting 50 year-old 
hatreds, there were the riots, Bush's trip to Japan, the whole Japan bashing 
thing and buying American," Imahara said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, a year in which more U. S. politicians increasingly blamed immigrants 
for the country's economic woes, about half the crimes logged against Asians 
and Latinos included anti-immigrant sentiments, Mornell said. 
</P>
<P>
 While hate crimes have risen each year since 1985, the percentage increase has 
slowed. The county recorded a 22% rise in hate crimes in 1991, a 10% rise in 
1992 and 6.4% last year.

SHORT-SITED SPORT; RECREATION: ROLLER HOCKEY IS ALL THE RAGE, BUT FACILITIES 
WHERE KIDS CAN PRACTICE AND PLAY GAMES ARE SCARCE BECAUSE OF FEARS OF 
LIABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Nordiques and the Panthers were on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 First they were booted from a shopping mall parking lot in West Hills. Then 
they got kicked out of an elementary school. All because neighbors complained 
that the roller hockey teams made too much noise when the pucks hit the boards, 
or when their skates clattered across the asphalt, or when exuberant parents 
shouted too loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, after they were chased outside the Los Angeles city limits, the 
players, between the ages of 8 and 13, found a Calabasas elementary school 
where they could hold practice games. 
</P>
<P>
 The saga of the Nordiques and the Panthers, two teams from the West Valley 
Roller Hockey League, is not unusual. Roller hockey is the new youth sport rage 
in Southern California, with many kids setting aside baseballs and basketballs 
and creating hockey hotbeds in communities from Los Angeles to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the sport's popularity continues to grow, so has the number of school 
districts or businesses banning the activity because they don't want to be held 
liable if players get hurt -- even though most, if not all, organized leagues 
have insurance. The Los Angeles Unified School District is among those that 
have prohibited the sport on its campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have rinks at our schools. We don't have designed areas that are 
safe to play," said Jim Sugahara, head of outdoor recreation programs for the 
giant district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grounds have a lot of cracks and children may run into basketball poles," 
he said. "It's not conducive to roller-skating or roller-blading. It's just not 
designed for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 But parents and coaches who have seen children abandon Little League and other 
established sports to play roller hockey disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just excuses," said Steve Shepp, a coach for the Nordiques in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't need much other than a blacktop," he said, adding that all players 
in his league are required to wear proper equipment and all the games are 
supervised. 
</P>
<P>
 But fear of lawsuits has prompted schools and businesses -- essentially those 
with big parking lots -- to put a damper on the activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our security people on weekends have chased some kids and young adults off of 
our school sites," said Brad Lantz, student services director for the Tustin 
Unified School District in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing pains are being felt throughout the region as pint-size Wayne Gretzkys 
pour out of neighborhood cul-de-sac pickup games, looking for organized teams 
and a place to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordiques and Panthers have missed about three weeks of practice since the 
season began in late March after they twice lost their playing privileges when 
neighbors and school officials complained of noise, heavy traffic and the 
destruction to property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once or twice a puck went through a school window. However, they did replace 
them," said Ilene Meyers, principal of Lockhurst Drive Elementary School in 
Woodland Hills. After a six-month tryout, she decided not to allow the West 
Valley Roller Hockey League to practice on her playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just didn't work out," said Meyers. "Our school is in a residential 
neighborhood. It was difficult for people living there." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches called more churches and private businesses with big parking lots, but 
the answer was always no because of the same concerns, said Pete Hogenson, the 
Panthers' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't hold practice for about two weeks because we didn't have a 
practice site," said Hogenson, whose 8-year-old son, Jake, plays on the team. 
"We didn't want to take these kids to go and practice at somebody's abandoned 
parking lot without permission." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Chaparral Elementary School in Calabasas agreed to allow the teams to 
practice twice a week for a total of three hours. Players and coaches couldn't 
be happier, even though they had to call off practice one Thursday when the 
school held its PTA meeting on the same day. However, there were no complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have one practice. Two is a luxury," said Hogenson. "If we have 
to make concessions to be good tenants we will." 
</P>
<P>
 Some hockey teams have gone to extremes to find a place to practice. In Orange 
County, some teams -- which have few other places to go -- secretly play on 
school campuses on weekends and in the early hours before school starts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saddleback Valley recently, as the sun rose over a black asphalt parking 
lot near a schoolyard, hyperkinetic kids donned their skates and began 
practicing their slap shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Their coaches kept one eye on the players, and the other eye peeled for the 
security guard or principal who might appear and immediately banish them all 
from the schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Side by Side Rinks in Huntington Beach is one of the few places in Southern 
California for young roller hockey players. League play goes on 23 hours a day, 
seven days a week. Players show up at 1 a.m. for the final set of league games. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 a.m., the rink shuts down. An hour later, the next day of roller hockey 
begins. Rink management says they could fill three other roller facilities with 
the demand for new roller hockey leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 But the search for less formal practice sites has posed a minor law 
enforcement problem, as police officers encounter weekend hockey games on 
school property and force the players to clear out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police come out and tell us to leave, the principals come out and tell us 
to leave; I think it's really stupid," said Brian Fletcher, 17, who plays for a 
junior team in Mission Viejo. For Fletcher, "roller hockey is the best sport in 
the world. You get going so fast, you get so much speed, it's kind of a rush. 
Then when you score a goal, you get really pumped." 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of youth roller hockey was made possible by two events, 
enthusiasts agree: The successful marketing of in-line skates -- a series of 
wheels set in a single line between the heel and toe -- and the celebrity of 
Los Angeles Kings' hockey superstar Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its popularity has just mushroomed, it's being played in the streets 
everywhere," said Alan Trudell, spokesman for the Garden Grove Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 While the problem largely centers on schools, some cities are also concerned 
enough about liability to take a hard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Trudell said his 9-year-old son and his friends have been shooed away from 
parks by city employees in Anaheim Hills. "It's really overpowering my son's 
desire to play football or baseball," Trudell said. "He loves to play roller 
hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 John Black, who managed Roller Hockey International's Los Angeles Blades 
franchise last year, also organizes youth roller hockey tournaments throughout 
Southern California and has seen the phenomenal growth of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see the gleam in a kid's eyes when they talk hockey," said Black. 
"The word you hear over and over is addictive. This sport has really taken 
root, and it's definitely here to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Black and other roller hockey organizers say the only thing holding the game 
back is lack of proper facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have organized baseball, basketball and soccer. Why can't we have 
organized roller hockey?" said Hogenson, the Panthers' coach. "I'd like to see 
it be a part of city parks and recreation programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Players will go anywhere they can find a smooth surface. Enclosed tennis 
courts are attractive, and enclosed garage structures will do in a pinch. 
</P>
<P>
 But with schools conveniently located in most neighborhoods, most roller 
hockey players usually wind up on the schoolyard. A better way needs to be 
found, everyone agrees, but progress toward developing roller hockey facilities 
has been slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Accongio, who runs the six-team Golden West Roller Hockey League in 
Anaheim, said he's talked to several Orange County cities and school districts 
about building rinks -- and always gets the same answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say they don't want noise in parks, they say liability is the issue," 
Accongio said. "But insurance isn't that hard to get. I'm willing to come in, 
build the park, get the kids in off the street. It's been frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are also encouraging signs for roller hockey enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, the city converted an underutilized tennis court for roller 
hockey play. Garden Grove and Anaheim found places that could be used for 
roller hockey and hired outside contractors to operate leagues for adults and 
children. The Los Alamitos School District is working on a similar proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of finding a place to play, though increasingly common, is not 
new. George Williams, 34, owner of the Reseda Roller Hockey League, recalls 
that even before the era of in-line skates -- when he and his buddies growing 
up in Burbank wore sneakers to play hockey -- the sport was not a big hit with 
authority figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been kicked out of every schoolyard, every tennis court and every 
supermarket parking lot," Williams said. "We knew every cop in Burbank by 
name."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; 8 BUSINESSES FILE SUITS OVER SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight businesses have filed lawsuits against the city of Agoura Hills in an 
effort to block a law requiring them to remove their pole-mounted 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron, Unocal, McDonald's, Texaco, Burger King, Denny's, Lumber City and 
Roadside Lumber have filed separate suits during the past two weeks challenging 
the city's ban of tall signs that line the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills outlawed pole-mounted advertisements nine years ago, saying they 
spoil the panoramic view of the foothills, and gave merchants seven years to 
remove them. In November, voters sanctioned the ban by a 3-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits argue that removing the large, illuminated signs would severely 
hurt the profits of the plaintiffs, who rely on the business of freeway 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Denny's sign were removed," states the Los Angeles Superior Court 
lawsuit by that business, "the drop in revenues and profits would be so serious 
that the restaurant would have to close or would face a serious threat of 
having to close." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing dates have not been set for the lawsuits, Agoura Hills City Atty. Greg 
Stepanicich said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Terry Matz said although the city and business owners have had 
nine years to settle the issue, he almost expected the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had hoped that we would get voluntary compliance with our ordinance, 
particularly in light of the ballot measures," Matz said. "It's disappointing 
that it has come to lawsuits, but not surprising." 
</P>
<P>
 The ban on pole signs has been the thorniest, longest-running political issue 
in the city's 12-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts by the city to gain compliance with the law ended in a standoff with 
about a dozen merchants, who formed a political action committee and spent more 
than $100,000 in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat the November ballot 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Agoura Hills, meanwhile, have struck a deal with owners of a gas 
station to remove one of the tallest pole-mounted signs in town, in exchange 
for a promise to quickly review plans to remodel the station. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement signed April 28 by representatives of the city and Shell Oil Co. 
states that Shell's sign atop a 70-foot pole at 5134 Kanan Road will be removed 
when the city issues permits to build a mini-mart and carwash on the premises.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; 1 DEAD, 1 SERIOUSLY INJURED IN CRASH

<P>
 A Pacoima man died early Monday after he was ejected from his van when it was 
hit by another vehicle and tumbled 150 feet down a freeway embankment, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Salinas Olea, 63, was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.His 
passenger, Patricia Castillo, 21, who was also thrown from the van, was taken 
to Holy Cross Medical Center where she was in serious condition, a California 
Highway Patrol spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the second vehicle, John Nichols, 21, of Northridge, suffered 
only minor injuries and was not hospitalized, said CHP Officer David King. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 3 a.m. when Nichols was driving east on the Simi 
Valley Freeway near the Topanga Canyon Boulevard exit, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols told investigators that when he swerved his pickup truck to avoid 
hitting an animal running across the freeway, he accidentally hit the front of 
Salinas' van, which was traveling in the next lane, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the animal was black, but he didn't know if it was a cat or dog or 
what," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 After his van was hit, Salinas lost control of the vehicle and it went over an 
embankment, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Salinas nor Castillo was wearing a seat belt, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols was traveling about 65 m.p.h. at the time of the accident, said King, 
who added that an investigation is continuing. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; FAULT OFFERS A VIVID LESSON FOR STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is something about living through a 6.8 earthquake that makes a lesson 
in physical science a little more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that was the case for 58 Reseda High School students who scrambled up 
dusty trails, climbed over barbed wire and scaled slopes of loose gravel above 
the Antelope Valley Freeway near Palmdale on Monday to see how the San Andreas 
Fault has twisted and folded the earth's sedimentary layers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For something that big to happen, you want to know what makes it happen," 
16-year-old Ambra Sultzbaugh said of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. "It 
makes it more clear to see it in person." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 600-mile-long San Andreas Fault was not a factor in the 
Northridge temblor, the contorted layers of sedimentary rock visible from the 
Antelope Valley Freeway offer a vivid lesson on what causes any earthquake to 
happen. The Antelope Valley Freeway slices through the fault -- which marks the 
meeting of the Pacific and North American plates -- exposing cliffs with 
U-shaped lines of sediment where the plates butted against each other. 
</P>

 Reseda science instructor Tony Recalde, who has taken his students to the San 
Andreas Fault for several years, said the trip was much more popular this year 
than ever before. "All these kids wanted to come," Recalde said. "They are 
taking it more seriously. It hits home." 
</P>
<P>
 The students, mostly sophomores, take integrated science at Reseda, which 
combines lessons in biology, chemistry, earth science and physics. The view of 
the San Andreas Fault, where Avenue S meets the Antelope Valley Freeway, was 
one of a half a dozen stops on a daylong science tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalde pointed out that the sediment formations helped students identify 
minerals and showed them the hundreds of homes built directly on the fault 
zone. "I would never live out here," Recalde said. "This would be ground zero 
as far as I am concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with plastic bags and picks for digging, the students scaled the rugged 
slopes, stopping to search for bits of gypsum and other minerals to bring back 
in plastic bags. "It's really amazing, actually," said Melissa Puccio, 17, 
standing on a narrow trail more than 100 feet above the freeway to gaze at the 
maze of sedimentary layers.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; CAR CRASHES INTO HAMBURGER STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Munch Box burger stand, anchored firmly at the intersection of Devonshire 
Street and Canoga Avenue, has for 39 years weathered all California threw its 
way: Valley summer heat, droughts, torrential rains, and even two major 
earthquakes in 1971 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was no match for a driver who plowed his pickup truck through the 
popular eatery early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A driver who fell asleep at the wheel mowed down a street light, a fire 
hydrant, a fence and finally, the east wall of the 400-square foot fast-food 
burger joint. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda resident Robert Ray Smith, 28, told police that he had been up all 
night playing pool and darts and that he started to fall asleep while he was 
driving to his girlfriend's house, said police. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing I knew, I was inside the Munch Box," Smith told police. There 
were no charges filed in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 With spirit undeterred, Munch Box owner Buck Barker said he'd reopen within a 
week. Barker will have to repair the wall and replace his stove, a picnic 
bench, soda machines and other equipment damaged in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Munch Box, described by residents as a Chatsworth institution, spans two 
generations of burger lovers, high school kids and their parents alike. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of patrons such as 48-year-old Warner Wells, a customer since 
his days at Chatsworth High School, Barker will have no problems fulfilling his 
pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells heard police sirens from his construction business a block away from the 
Munch Box and stopped by to lend a hand. Wells arrived to see the truck "pretty 
well into the building" and a damaged fire hydrant gushing water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came up to offer him some help if he needed any materials," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lunchtime customers who stopped by helped Barker load salvaged equipment 
onto a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 A few angry burger-loving patrons offered to "get the guy" responsible for the 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Nelson, a student at Moorpark College, was on his way to a friend's house 
when he spotted the hole in the wall of his favorite burger stand. Nelson 
grabbed a pair of work gloves and began helping with the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Bannister, a former Chatsworth business owner, left the area two years ago, 
but comes by every week to eat at the Munch Box. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came by to get a Diet Coke, and I drove up and saw this," Bannister said. 
"Even though it's out of my way, I still come here because of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 "The people" are Barker and his wife, who have been running the burger stand 
since 1985, when Barker's uncle asked him to take over the restaurant that he 
founded in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker, famous not only for his hickory burgers and chili dogs, but also for 
his work in the community, will receive the Citizen of the Year award from the 
Chatsworth Coordinating Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, Barker held a fund-raiser for a 13-year-old girl who was comatose 
for 80 days after being hit by a car. The girl, who is still undergoing 
physical therapy, played on the same baseball team as Barker's 13-year-old son. 
Barker opened the restaurant for five hours on a Friday night and donated all 
proceeds to the girl's family to help pay medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good guy. That's what it boils down to," Bannister said. TERESA ANN

GLENDALE BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MORE YOUNG FAMILIES FACING HOMELESSNESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cynthia Ruiz recalled calmly how she had to steal formula from a market to 
feed her youngest son after she was forced to live on the streets with her two 
children when her boyfriend lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz, 20, and her sons, Richard Adams, 1, and Anthony Ruiz, 3, have been in 
and out of motels and shelters since they spent a week last year wandering the 
streets searching for their next meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would push them around in a stroller at night, wondering what was going to 
happen to us," Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz and her children, who now live in Glendale in transitional housing 
provided by the Salvation Army, are among a growing number of young families 
who wind up on the streets when they are unable to find work or can't afford to 
rent an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to a faltering economy and fewer jobs, young families are the fastest 
growing portion of the homeless population, said Paul Bandy, director of social 
services at the Glendale Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report by the Glendale Task Force on Homelessness, up to 360 
people, a majority of them with young families, spend their nights on city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of homeless people in Glendale, including the elderly, veterans, 
singles, the mentally ill and substance abusers, has doubled since 1986, 
stretching social service organizations to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists fear many more are at risk of becoming homeless -- the report 
estimates at least 10,000 people face this threat -- and will end up on the 
streets for lack of community help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the people I see are just a paycheck away from becoming homeless," 
said Maria Melchor, case manager at Catholic Charities' Loaves & Fishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Atkins, a single father trying to raise five children, has faced the 
threat of homelessness since he moved from Long Beach to Glendale last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins receives a $930 welfare check each month, but must pay $926 in rent for 
the one-bedroom room that he and his children share at the Manhattan Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins, who was forced to quit his job with Starline Tours to take care of his 
children after his wife left, said he can't find an apartment because managers 
aren't willing to rent to a family with five children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my kids to be in and out of shelters -- I want to have a steady 
place so I can keep them in school," Atkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David Ramsay formed the 31-member homelessness task force last 
year to bring the community together to help the homeless. The group is 
scheduled to present its final report to the City Council this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted a better understanding of the problem -- the homeless are not 
simply a monolithic group for which one answer fits all," Ramsay said. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force has made some preliminary recommendations to the council, 
including building a transitional shelter, implementing a Business Watch 
program and an anti-panhandling campaign, and preparing a homeless resource 
guide. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; QUAKE DAMAGED 2 WATER RESERVOIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have discovered that two of San Fernando's four water 
reservoirs were severely damaged during the Northridge earthquake and will 
require about $2.75 million to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 After conducting underwater inspections and engineering analyses of Reservoir 
3A and Reservoir 4, above-ground structures located at 13655 Foothill Blvd., 
engineers concluded repairs are needed on both. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have determined that it is seismically unsafe, and it could not stand 
another 6.8 earthquake," said San Fernando Public Works Director Mike Drake 
during a recent City Council meeting, referring to Reservoir 4, which suffered 
the most damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a crack about two-thirds of the way to the top and it also has 
fracturing at the bottom," said San Fernando City Engineer Jerry Wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservoir 4, built in 1962, holds 1 million gallons of water. Reservoir 3A, 
built in 1991, holds 2.5 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ray Ojeda said he was not surprised about the damage to Reservoir 
4, since it was built before tougher seismic standards were introduced, but 
that he was concerned the current situation could constitute a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it goes, we're in real trouble, because we're all (below) it," he said.

GLENDALE BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; HOUSING PROJECT TIED TO EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Families could get affordable housing at three apartment buildings that the 
city of Burbank is considering buying for a project that offers low-cost 
housing to parents who want their kids to care about education. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to see a giant change in grades in the first year," said 
Kent Salveson, the Orange County developer who created the EEXCEL program five 
years ago. "But what has happened is we've changed behavior. We've changed 
their self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 EEXCEL, which stands for Educational Excellence for Children with 
Environmental Limitations, combines affordable housing projects with education 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the City Council will consider a plan to spend $1.2 million -- using 
federal funds plus $400,000 in city redevelopment money -- to buy three 
apartment buildings with 19 apartment units on West Elmwood Street for an 
EEXCEL project. City officials hope to expand the project later. 
</P>
<P>
 Salveson has started several such projects -- which are either built, managed 
or owned by EEXCEL -- in South-Central and Downtown Los Angeles and elsewhere 
in the Los Angeles area. He is also looking at projects in Ohio, Arizona, Texas 
and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salveson's EEXCEL projects have not always been welcomed. Sometimes 
officials ignore bullet holes and drug deals at an apartment project and tell 
Salveson that there is no need for such a program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank, at the prompting of Councilman Dave Golonski, invited Salveson to 
work on establishing an EEXCEL project on the 100 block of West Elmwood Street, 
which has had a history of gang-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he gets into a gang, we'll evict (them)," Salveson said of the possible 
consequences that a youth and his parents may face as tenants. He takes an 
equally strong stance against drugs. Once Salveson said he evicted a mother and 
her family because he caught her smoking marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 But for this firm stand, Salveson said he also tries to offer the children 
hope. Every schoolchild in his buildings receives one intensive two-hour 
tutoring session, which Salveson said usually brings them up to their normal 
grade level and helps them better understand the most difficult subject, 
usually math or English. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects also offer a study hall with tutors on duty to give students 
ongoing help, Salveson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of hating math, some of the kids are really starting to enjoy it," 
said Salveson, who added that he has seen cases in which a D student became an 
A student. EEXCEL has just completed its first self-evaluation of the project, 
and found that so far every student has shown at least some improvement, 
Salveson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is attitudes, rather than grades, that are most important. Prospective 
tenants are screened to identify parents who care about their children's 
education. Bad grades will not keep a family out of an apartment -- or get them 
evicted -- but they most likely will not be accepted if children have serious 
attendance and discipline problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The enthusiasm that Burbank has shown toward the project has been encouraging, 
Salveson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking for cities and governments that understand, really, what the 
problems of today are, that families are becoming more 'fractionated,' " 
Salveson said. "They understand that unless a meaningful effort is brought in 
to try and stop this cycle, the problems cities have are going to get worse."

OFFICER ACCUSED OF CREDIT CARD FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police officer was charged Monday with being part of a credit 
card fraud ring that allegedly altered cards to increase credit limits, 
according to the Los Angeles district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Clemons Davis, 33, assigned to the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Central Division, allegedly used an electronic encoder to alter the magnetic 
strips found on the back of credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges filed against Davis include possession of a forged driver's license, 
possession of a counterfeit seal, insurance fraud and the sale or receipt of 
access cards to defraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Also charged were Tandra Ann Sadr, 19, and Monica Coles, 28, both of North 
Hollywood. Both were charged with burglary and Sadr also was charged with 
dissuading a witness from testifying on a call she made from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio was arrested Thursday when Burbank police served search warrants at 
two apartments in a complex in the 5300 block of Riverton Avenue, said Lt. 
Duane Dow of the Burbank Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 During the arrest, a Rottweiler mixed-breed dog apparently belonging to Coles 
got loose and bit Officer Craig Campbell, who shot and killed the dog, Dow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell was taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center where he was treated and 
released, Dow said.

POLICE ASK PUBLIC'S HELP TO SOLVE FAMILY'S SLAYING; INVESTIGATION: AUTHORITIES 
SEEK WITNESSES, MOTIVES AND SOLID LEADS IN THE 1991 STABBING DEATHS OF A COUPLE 
AND THEIR TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Still baffled by a case described as "one of the most brutal" unsolved 
slayings in Los Angeles, police appealed to the public Monday for information 
that could help solve the 1991 murders of four family members in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they have little new information about the stabbing deaths 
of Hee Wan Yoo, his wife, Gyung Jin, and their children, Pauline, 6, and 
Kenneth, 4. But for the first time, authorities said they believe that more 
than one person was involved in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Los Angeles police remained tight-lipped about the evidence in the 
case, they were candid about what they don't have: witnesses, motives and solid 
leads. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no rhyme or reason to these killings," LAPD Detective Richard 
(Buck) Henry, who heads the investigation, said at a news conference at Parker 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of the family members were discovered Nov. 20, 1991, in the Yoos' 
Granada Hills home by relatives who went to the house when Hee Wan Yoo failed 
to show up for work at the Wilshire-area dental lab he owned. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy concluded that each family member was stabbed with a sharp weapon, 
but county coroner's officials declined to elaborate. Investigators have said 
there was no evidence of forced entry into the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the killings, police have conducted hundreds of interviews on the case 
and have employed up to six Korean-speaking officers in hopes of drawing 
information from the city's Korean community, said Lt. Al Moen, head of the 
department's major crimes division. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is "baffling because of the lack of evidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police for the first time Monday said they have evidence that more than one 
person was in the house during the slayings. But they would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what occurred inside that residence," Henry said. "We don't 
know if we had suspects or witnesses in that residence." 
</P>
<P>
 A $50,000 reward has been posted for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of the killers. Half was provided by the city and half by relatives 
of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Moen said the Yoo case is one of the most brutal unsolved murder cases under 
investigation by the LAPD. "If someone did in fact witness these murders, we 
are asking that person to please come forward and help us bring the killer of 
this young family to justice."

VALLEY INTERVIEW; JOB-SEEKER CITES LOOPHOLE IN AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Doug Smith, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal Americans With Disabilities Act took effect in July, 1992. It 
prohibits job discrimination against qualified people with mental, physical or 
learning disabilities. Employers must make "reasonable accommodations" for 
disabled people in hiring, compensation, firing and all other aspects of the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda S. Sirlin, 52, questions whether it has changed the way employers think 
and act. Sirlin has worked as a secretary to a vice president of a brokerage 
firm and for a UCLA professor. Experiencing problems with speech and balance 
from an unknown ailment, she had to stop driving. In May, 1990, a week after 
getting a new job near her home in North Hollywood, she learned she had 
multiple sclerosis, a degenerative nerve disease. She lost her job and has been 
unable to find new work since. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirlin was interviewed by staff writer Doug Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How did you lose your job?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I told my supervisor, I have MS. I wasn't using a cane. I was just 
walking slowly. It was very difficult for me to stand three and four hours, 
which I had to do a lot of, and carry large things from one part of the plant 
to another. So I told him what was wrong and three days later he said, 'I have 
to talk to you about something,' and I said, 'Why don't you just give me my 
paycheck.' 
</P>
<P>
 He said, 'We'd like to keep you on if you'd work for $7.50 an hour.' I said, 
'No,' and I left. And that was it. They let me go. They decided that $30,000 a 
year was just too high. I'd never worked for $7.50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you complain to anyone?  
</P>
<P>
 A: At that time, the Americans With Disabilities Act was not even thought of. 
I never did anything about it because there was nothing I could do. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Did you start to look for work immediately after that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many jobs have you applied for?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I couldn't even tell you. For a year, I went to at least three interviews a 
week. I sent out resumes. I got calls for all the resumes I sent out, and I 
made calls from want ads in the paper. When an appointment was set up, and I 
gave them my qualifications, then I would say, 'By the way, I have multiple 
sclerosis,' and all of a sudden the job wasn't available. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you always put it on the table that you have MS?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. All the time. I have to. If you could see the reaction of people when 
I walk in with a walker. They stutter and stammer. They don't know what to do. 
They don't even know if they should shake my hand. They don't even know that I 
can let go of the walker to shake their hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do employers tell you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Two weeks ago I called about a job. It was a secretarial position. He asked 
me my qualifications. I told him. This is on a Monday. I made an appointment 
for Wednesday. I said, 'By the way, I have to let you know that I have multiple 
sclerosis. I use a walker most of the time. But I do use a wheelchair just to 
get from point A to point B quicker.' 
</P>
<P>
 I said, 'I'd like to know before I come in if that's going to cause anyone to 
be upset or nervous,' and he said, 'No. That's no problem.' I called Tuesday to 
verify the time. He said, 'I was just about to call you. The position's been 
filled.' 
</P>
<P>
 I called a friend of mine. She called. The job was still open. I called the 
job coordinator of the Multiple Sclerosis Society. She called the company and 
asked about the position. It was still available. I called the state Department 
of Fair Employment and Housing because of the state law against discrimination 
against people with disabilities. This company is exempt because they said they 
had less than five employees. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a loophole with the Americans With Disabilities Act. If a company has 
less than 25 employees, they're exempt from that law. They can discriminate. 
Under the state law it's five employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What other bad experiences have you had?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I had one of the national car rental places ask me if I was contagious. She 
said, 'Is this contagious?' I said, 'No, but your stupidity is.' And I tore up 
the application and left. I just couldn't take it. It's very depressing for 
someone to form an opinion after 20 minutes of talking to me of what my 
abilities are. 
</P>
<P>
 I even had one woman come running out to my car. I had called. She had said, 
'Can you get here immediately?' I was there in five minutes. Couldn't find the 
office. Got out of the car, looked for the office. Got back into my car. She 
must have seen me walking. I was using a cane. I turned the engine on. She came 
out to the car and said, 'Are you Linda?' I said, 'Yes.' She said, 'Oh, the 
job's been filled.' I came home. My friend called. She made an appointment with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 So right now I'm kind of in between. I'm not even interested in looking. I 
don't even care anymore. Nobody is going to hire me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Don't you qualify for disability benefits?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, but that's not the point. The point is I want to be out of the house. 
I want to be around people. I want to feel useful. I don't feel useful. I'm 
sitting in a house all the time. It's very aggravating to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is multiple sclerosis?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There is a coating over the nerves. The coating cracks, which causes the 
nerves to send incorrect messages to parts of your body. It also affects the 
muscles and it causes you to have no balance. If I were to stand up and walk, I 
would fall. 
</P>
<P>
 When I got diagnosed, I was just using the wall to get by. Then I started 
using the cane. Then I started using a walker. Now I'm in a wheelchair, so I 
have progressive MS. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you sure you could do the job?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I type 110 words a minute. I'm very computer-literate. There's nothing that 
would frighten me in an office. I don't think there's anything I couldn't do. 
If I could learn the stock market, I could learn anything. That's a very tough, 
stressful, burnout business, and I loved every second of it. I wish I could go 
back. I just couldn't do it. I just can't drive that far. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the average secretarial job, wouldn't there be duties that you could not 
perform?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Such as? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you had to write in longhand, such as taking notes?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I print. I can type while somebody is talking. I do write. I don't write 
well anymore. I used to have beautiful penmanship. I don't anymore. I print 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 I certainly can walk to a copy machine. I can walk to a file cabinet. I can 
answer the telephone. I write a hell of a letter. There's very little I don't 
think I could do in a company. I just want to be useful. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't stand at a filing cabinet for two hours. I would prefer a job that 
was 80% sedentary. That would be good for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Since the Americans With Disabilities Act passed, have you found any 
difference in the way employers respond to you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, same thing. As a matter of fact, I'm getting fewer interviews, because 
now I tell them I'm using a wheelchair. Up until six months ago I wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 And they take a look at me and say, 'Oh my God. That's scary. What if I fall 
in their office? What if I hurt myself? Could I hurt somebody else?' They're 
just scared of it. They see a wheelchair and they're frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I don't know. I'm sure major corporations are not like that. I'm sure they 
don't discriminate. Smaller companies I know do. I've interviewed with too many 
of them. They sit there and I feel that they're looking at me and there's a 
neon sign flashing on my forehead that says, 'Handicapped. Disabled.' 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In all the interviews you've done, you haven't had one good experience?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Sunkist is one of the few companies that doesn't discriminate, from what I 
understand. They had all kind of accessibilities for wheelchairs. In fact, the 
woman that I spoke with said, 'We're not going to discuss your disabilities. 
We're going to discuss your abilities,' which was the most beautiful thing I've 
ever heard anybody say to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's ever come across to me like that. From what I understand, somebody on 
their board of directors is in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why didn't you get that job?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I had an interview with them, and then I was offered something else, and I 
was positive I was going to be getting this other job, so I lost out on 
Sunkist, and I'm very sorry I did. The pay wasn't terrific, but I'm certainly 
not going to be able to get what I got at other places I've worked.

FAMILIES OF SLAIN PAIR GIVE EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The families of two teen-agers murdered during a robbery at a Subway sandwich 
shop gave emotional testimony about the effect of the deaths on their lives 
Monday to a jury that will determine if the killer should be executed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Words absolutely fail to convey the devastation," said Steve Berry, father of 
the slain Brian Berry. "It's like trying to convey a scene to a blind man." 
</P>
<P>
 James Robinson Jr., a 25-year-old part-time college student, was convicted one 
year ago in the shooting deaths of Berry, 18, and James White, 19. The jury 
that found him guilty of the double murder was unable to decide if Robinson 
should be executed for the June 30, 1991, killings, which prosecutors believe 
were committed to cover up a robbery that netted Robinson less than $600. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were killed execution-style, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth L. 
Barshop. While he was on his knees, White was shot through the top of his head, 
the prosecutor said. As Berry watched, the gunman fired one shot into his face 
and then pumped another round into the side of his head, a coroner testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors called the parents to the witness stand to tell a second jury 
about the impact of the shootings on their families. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who worked at the restaurant, and Berry, who went to visit before the 
store's closing, had been friends since the fourth grade. "The boys are buried 
together," said White's mother, Kristine. "We figured they would want it that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristine White, who is an elementary school teacher and single mother, 
testified about the horror of being summoned to a hospital and seeing her 
wounded son. Even after doctors pronounced James White dead, life-support 
systems continued to force him to breath, she said between tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends expect you to be over it, but they don't realize you never are," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry's twin sister, Shannon, was home alone when police came knocking on the 
door of the family's Northridge home. Her parents were spending the weekend in 
a cabin near Big Bear that did not have a phone, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've ever had to tell my parents anything more horrible than my 
brother had been killed, their son," Shannon Berry said, choking back sobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of celebrating birthdays, I have to mourn on them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Richard A. Leonard did not cross-examine any of the four 
family members who testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson is expected to testify Wednesday. Leonard said his client will once 
again deny having anything to do with the killings, even though he will testify 
that he was in the store after the murders took place. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury now hearing evidence in the Robinson case will be asked to decide if 
he should be put to death for his crimes or if he should spent the rest of his 
life in prison without the possibility of parole.

ASBESTOS FOUND AT DEMOLITION SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regional environmental officials found asbestos in three of eight randomly 
chosen piles of debris from repair and demolition projects under way in 
Northridge, according to a statement issued on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The samples were identified in field tests conducted by the Southern 
California Air Quality Management District last week, said Bill Kelly, an AQMD 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of those tests prompted city and regional environmental officials 
to issue a cautionary warning to property owners who are making post-earthquake 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be from do-it-yourselfers or contractors who don't know about 
the presence of asbestos," Kelly said, "and they're just ripping the stuff out 
and putting it on the curb. I'm not saying we know the complete scope of this 
problem, but we are trying to head it off from getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD statement urged property owners to have a licensed laboratory test 
materials suspected of containing asbestos. If asbestos is found, it should be 
removed only by a contractor licensed to do such work, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are existing demolition and remodeling debris piles with materials 
suspected of containing asbestos, keep the material damp until it can be 
properly removed," the statement said.

VALLEY RAIL PLANS CALLED FEASIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Preliminary findings from two engineering studies show that both above- and 
below-ground rail lines across the San Fernando Valley floor are feasible and 
that either project could be streamlined to reduce costs, transit officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a briefing prepared for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, planners 
say both a subway system paralleling Burbank Boulevard and an elevated line 
straddling the Ventura Freeway could be built without running into unfriendly 
soil conditions or unduly disrupting traffic. Both options could also realize 
cost savings if they included new station designs, more efficient construction 
techniques and the postponement of some station openings, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 But no hard numbers are yet available on the projected savings, which will 
probably be the deciding factor for the cash-strapped MTA when its directors 
approve a final route later this year, resolving a debate that has dragged on 
for years. Cost comparisons are expected this summer after the two engineering 
studies, now 70% done, are finally completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The costs are the big numbers that everyone wants to know about. Those are 
due in August," said David L. Mieger, project manager for the east-west Valley 
rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our deficits right now, we're looking at every dollar we spend," Mieger 
said. He declined to speculate which option might ultimately be cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, projections tab the Ventura Freeway line -- which the MTA 
tentatively approved two years ago, pending the outcome of the studies -- at 
$2.6 billion, while the price tag on the subway system is an estimated $3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary report released Monday indicates that freeway widening for 
construction purposes and stricter seismic standards in the wake of the 
Northridge earthquake would increase costs for the overland route. Those 
increases might reduce some of the potential savings from measures such as 
performing some construction and assembly off-site and delaying station 
openings where ridership is expected to be lower. But officials predict a net 
gain for the transit agency, which faces an operating deficit next year of $126 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 An extension of the Red Line subway from North Hollywood to Warner Center 
could also be built at less than the expected $3 billion, analysts said. 
Because the line would not run under major streets, stations could be open-air 
and would not need the intense ventilation and lighting required at stations in 
Downtown Los Angeles and those under construction along the Hollywood segment. 
</P>
<P>
 This could result in savings of as much as 30% to 40% per station, helping to 
"significantly reduce the estimated costs" of the subway, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also said that a geological survey has found the Valley's soil to 
be conducive to subway construction, free from gases and chemicals that have 
slowed construction of other segments of the line.

PAROLEE ACCUSED OF KILLING GIRL, 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A parolee accused of shooting his 16-year-old girlfriend to death during a 
dispute over a paging device is scheduled to be arraigned today in Antelope 
Municipal Court, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.John A. Portillo said he filed one count of murder Monday 
against Manuel Guadalupe Sanchez, 19, who was arrested Saturday on suspicion of 
killing Nicole Inuma of Llano. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez was released from state prison in January, after serving time for 
receiving stolen property, said Rosario F. Santillan, supervisor of the 
Antelope Valley Parole Unit. "He was seemingly adjusting well," Santillan said. 
"He had no violations whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred Friday afternoon when Inuma went to the Sanchezes' 
apartment to retrieve a pager that Sanchez had taken from her and was using for 
his business, sheriff's investigator Mike Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said Sanchez initially told investigators that a third person entered the 
apartment and shot Nicole. That statement "didn't square with what the 
witnesses in the neighborhood had seen or heard," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez later told deputies that he shot the teen-ager accidentally, Lee said.

MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO ROLE IN MURDER AT ATM; CRIME: WESLEY DALE HARPER AGREES TO 
TESTIFY AGAINST THE ALLEGED GUNMAN IN EXCHANGE FOR A SENTENCE THAT INCLUDES THE 
POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old Lancaster man charged with killing an ATM customer outside a 
local bank pleaded guilty Monday under an agreement that will require him to 
testify against his alleged partner in the crime, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Wesley Dale Harper pleaded guilty to first-degree murder 
and will be sentenced to 26 years to life in prison with possibility of parole, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela R. Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had been convicted in the Lancaster Superior Court trial that began last 
week, Harper could have been sentenced to life in prison without possibility of 
parole, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper was accused of driving a pickup truck in Lancaster on March 5, 1993, 
looking for someone to rob at an automated teller machine. At a Bank of America 
branch on Lancaster Boulevard, investigators allege, Harper's passenger, 
Christopher Arthur Mann, 20, fatally shot ATM customer Hans Christian Herzog, 
44, of Lancaster, then stole Herzog's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper provided Mann with the sawed-off rifle used to kill Herzog, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime, which was recorded in part by a bank security camera, received wide 
attention because random killings are rare in the Antelope Valley, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Monday's plea bargain, Harper will be a witness for the 
prosecution when Mann stands trial separately next month, the prosecutor said. 
"Defendant Harper's sentence is contingent upon his ongoing cooperation in the 
prosecution of defendant Christopher Mann, who was the shooter," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Harper's testimony will be important because the district attorney's 
office is seeking the death penalty against Mann. "Only these two people were 
present (at the slaying)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harper maintains that he did not know that Mann was going to shoot (Herzog)," 
said Harper's attorney, Edward Consiglio. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney said Harper accepted the plea bargain "because he did not 
want to gamble on the chance that he would get life without possibility of 
parole."

SANTA CLARITA TO LOOK AGAIN AT SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members are expected to clear the air tonight about a proposed 
smoking ban adopted five months ago but then snuffed out before taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
 As approved in December, the ordinance prohibited smoking in restaurants, 
workplaces and enclosed public areas. Banks, shopping malls, restaurants and 
retail stores all were covered, but bars with less than one-fourth of their 
income from food sales were exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators were to face fines of $50 for a first offense, $100 for a second 
offense and $250 for a third offense, although Santa Clarita officials hadn't 
predicted stringent enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The council backed away from the broad ban when it appeared for a second 
reading in January and 200 residents attended the meeting. Supporters said the 
ordinance dealt with a health issue and should be passed, while opponents said 
personal freedoms were at stake and merchants should be able to set the rules 
for their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members called for additional public hearings to discuss the issue, 
and will hear the results of those sessions tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents favor no-smoking regulations at their job, but are less 
supportive of such restrictions in eating establishments, said Michael Murphy, 
Santa Clarita intergovernmental relations officer who has handled the smoking 
issue for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the public hearings that we held, there seemed to be enough support there 
to move ahead with all provisions of the ordinance except in respect to 
restaurants and bars," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to discuss how much to restrict smoking in restaurants 
and bars -- anywhere from a total ban to no restrictions at all -- but 
otherwise leave the earlier ordinance and its restrictions on the workplace as 
first approved. 
</P>
<P>
 If the wording of the ordinance is decided upon tonight, it will appear for 
first reading May 24 and could take effect by mid-July.

METRO FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; RED CROSS OPENS OFFICE IN EAST VENTURA COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a need highlighted by last year's wildfires and the Jan. 17 
earthquake, the American Red Cross opened a second Ventura County office Monday 
in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt for some time that the size of the population warranted a local 
presence out here," said Brian Bolton, executive director of the Ventura County 
Red Cross Unit."Then when the firestorm and the earthquake hit, it seemed clear 
that it was time to open a center in the eastern part of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the office space was unexpectedly easy: the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency and the state Office of Emergency Services, which share a 
disaster relief office at 59 Tierra Rejada Road, donated the 1,000-square-foot 
space to the relief agency. The Red Cross will be able to stay free of charge 
as long as FEMA and OES remain, which should be at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful that by then we will have really demonstrated our services and 
be able to generate some community funding," Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolton said about 17,000 people use the agency in the county, including 
volunteers who take life-saving classes and those who receive disaster aid.

BOY, 7, DIES AFTER BEING HIT BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 7-year-old Palmdale boy who was hit by a car while walking across busy 
Palmdale Boulevard after buying Mother's Day flowers died Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley Snyder suffered what proved to be fatal head injuries in the Saturday 
afternoon accident, said David Davidson, a sheriff's traffic investigator.The 
boy was pronounced dead at 10:49 a.m. Monday at Antelope Valley Hospital 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley was crossing Palmdale Boulevard between 5th and 6th streets East at 
2:35 Saturday afternoon when he was struck by a car driven by Katheryn Oggs, 
18. The boy was not in a marked crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastbound traffic on Palmdale Boulevard had stopped near 6th Street East where 
Bradley was crossing, but Oggs drove into the parking lane to get by the other 
cars, according to a sheriff's report. Oggs, a Lancaster resident, did not see 
Bradley until her car hit him. The boy was dragged nearly 60 feet by Oggs' car. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson said the investigation is continuing. Oggs has not been charged in 
the boy's death.

FINKS LEAVES RICH LEGACY BEHIND HIM; PRO FOOTBALL: EXECUTIVE, WHO DIED SUNDAY 
OF LUNG CANCER, WAS KEY TO VIKINGS, BEARS AND SAINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The NFL lost one of its most popular and progressive executives Sunday night 
when Jim Finks, 66, died in New Orleans after a yearlong battle with lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Finks, a consultant to the New Orleans Saints at the time of his death, 
rebuilt three struggling NFL franchises into playoff teams before nearly being 
named NFL commissioner in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 A six-man selection committee picked him to lead the league, but a faction of 
younger owners resented being given only one candidate, and Finks was three 
votes shy of the 21 necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The job eventually went to Paul Tagliabue, who immediately named Finks 
chairman of the powerful competition committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim Finks had a vision for the game that stood the test of time," Tagliabue 
said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Finks, a heavy smoker, was found to have lung cancer shortly after conducting 
the Saints' 1993 draft as their general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 It proved to be their finest draft in more than a decade, and included such 
selections as tackle Willie Roaf, running backs Derek Brown and Lorenzo Neal, 
and Pro Bowl return specialist Tyrone Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Finks was never able to enjoy this final triumph. Because of the lung 
cancer and, later, a blood clot in his brain, he was unable to attend a game 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody talks about franchise players . . . well, the Saints have lost a 
franchise general manager," said Paul Buckley, general manager of the New 
Orleans Hilton and one of Finks' best friends. "The impact on the Saints has 
been tremendous because they have lost an impact player." 
</P>
<P>
 After winning their first five games last year, the Saints lost six of their 
last eight and finished at 8-8. That equaled their worst record since 1987, the 
year after Finks arrived and led the organization to its first winning season 
in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the most complete football man I ever knew," said Wellington Mara, New 
York Giants' co-owner. 
</P>
<P>
 When Finks joined the Minnesota Vikings for his first NFL general manager's 
job in 1964, the expansion team had gone 10-30-2 in its previous three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, the Vikings were in the first of their four Super Bowls 
with Finks-built teams. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974 he took over the Chicago Bears, who had not won a championship in 11 
years. By 1977, they were in the playoffs. Before he left in 1983, he had 
acquired 19 of the 22 starters for the Bear team that won the Super Bowl after 
the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the Saints in 1986, Finks detoured into baseball and served as 
president of the Chicago Cubs. Under him in 1984, they won the title in the 
National League East, their first championship in 39 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Finks' approach was as simple and direct as his many sayings, which co-workers 
scribbled on note pads for posterity.  
</P>
<P>
 Finks-isms included, "That guy could talk a dog off a meat truck," and, "We're 
hotter than a deep-holed stove," and, "That guy is tougher than a boiled owl." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in this game have athletic ability, others have player personnel 
ability . . . Jim Finks had a human ability," Buckley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finks is survived by his wife, Maxine, and four sons, Jim Jr., David, Dan and 
Tom.

THE BARRICADE; IRBE HELPED LATVIA STOP RUSSIANS, AND NOW HE STOPS SHOTS FOR 
SHARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Someone yelled that soldiers were coming to drive them from the barricades, 
and who knew what might follow? 
</P>
<P>
 Arturs Irbe would not leave, could not leave. He would stop them. He would be 
Ka Muris . Like wall. 
</P>
<P>
 After Soviet forces had killed protesters in Vilnius, Lithuania, for rebelling 
against the government's distant and oppressive rule early in 1991, citizens of 
Latvia -- another Baltic state yearning for independence -- protested that 
invasion. That made them the new targets of the government's ire. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Moscow government sent tanks rolling to Riga, Latvia's capital and 
Irbe's hometown, thousands took to the streets and put up barriers to protect 
buildings, radio stations, TV towers and historical landmarks. Irbe, who plays 
now for the San Jose Sharks, was among them, prepared to fight soldiers sent by 
the country he had represented less than a year earlier at the 1990 World 
Hockey Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had worn the Soviet uniform, he never bought the Soviet message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play for the red flag. Not for Russia," he said. "I tried to tell 
people, 'I'm not Russian. I'm Latvian.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Later, outraged by the Soviets' heavy-handedness in the Baltics, he quit the 
national team, knowing he might lose a chance to showcase his talents and win a 
lucrative NHL contract. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he manned the barricades through four long, tumultuous nights, he 
risked his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were moments people said, 'Troops are coming with gases,' " he said. 
"We are in the middle of a brawl, myself and my wife, and we didn't know what 
was happening. Of course (there was danger). But there wasn't that much fear 
because we were all together. There was a sense of the country's heartbeat, our 
nation's heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a great time and a great experience in my life. I met people back 
there on the streets, on the barricades, who said, 'What are you going to do? 
There is a big tournament coming up, the World Championships? Are you going to 
play for the Soviets?' I said, 'No. After this I cannot do that.' They really 
cheered that. I had no chance to decide any other way except to refuse. I told 
my wife, 'I cannot play for them, whatever happens. I could not refuse to 
remember.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Irbe's resolve -- and that of his compatriots -- won out. He was unhurt, and 
Latvia gained its independence. Its economy is unsteady, but it is free. And 
its people are fiercely proud of Irbe, who is tending goal for the Sharks with 
the same determination he showed at those barricades. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Ka Muris. Like wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a phone call from Riga (last week) and the person who did the 
connection, the telephone company operator, I know her very well," he said. 
"She was so excited, because we just won first game in Toronto. She said, 'You 
wouldn't believe the people, in the morning, they are asking each other how did 
Sharks do?' 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not talking even about how are going the talks between our president 
and (Russian) President (Boris) Yeltsin about withdrawing arms and troops from 
Latvia. The first question is how the Sharks did, did they win." 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, with surprising frequency, has been yes. 
</P>
<P>
 In their third season, the Sharks are making an impressive first foray into 
the playoffs. Led by Irbe, who played an NHL-record 4,412 minutes this season 
and compiled a sparkling 2.84 goals-against average, they upset the top-seeded 
Detroit Red Wings in the first round and are even with the Toronto Maple Leafs 
after four games of their quarterfinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 On this defense-oriented team, the 27-year-old goalie is the last and most 
important line of defense. Stocky at 5 feet 8 and 180 pounds, he's remarkably 
agile and exceptional at controlling rebounds. That means he can prevent 
goal-mouth scrambles that might lead to flurries of shots, and to goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without him, we wouldn't be here," Shark defenseman Jeff Norton said. "Archie 
got us this far." 
</P>
<P>
 Irbe, who was drafted by Minnesota in 1989 and acquired by San Jose in the 
1991 dispersal draft, will try to carry them one step farther tonight, when 
Game 5 is played at the San Jose Arena. The decibel levels could be 
ear-shattering. Shark fans, frenzied over the team's success, roar at his every 
save. They serenade him with chants of "Irr-bay! Irr-bay!" and decorate the 
building with banners depicting walls, a tribute to his motto. 
</P>
<P>
 They also groan at his earnest but misguided attempts at passing the puck. 
Irbe has become as infamous for his bad puck handling as he is famous for puck 
stopping, and fans have been known to cover their eyes when he tries to make a 
pass. His teammates wish they could do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of comical," center Todd Elik said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not always funny to Coach Kevin Constantine, though. He has watched 
Irbe's misadventures since the 1991-92 season, when he coached Irbe and the 
Kansas City Blades to the International Hockey League title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tell everybody to pay him more because he provides entertainment to 
fans of hockey everywhere," Constantine said. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't told Irbe to stop handling the puck because he has been able to 
laugh after most of Irbe's gaffes. After giving the puck away to Kris Draper in 
Game 4 against Detroit, and to Mark Osborne in the opener against Toronto, Irbe 
didn't give up another goal in either game. The Sharks won both. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very strong-willed," forward Jeff Odgers said. "If he makes a mistake, 
he'll try that much harder to make it up because he doesn't want to let the 
team down." 
</P>
<P>
 That resilience is why Constantine, who rarely smiles, grins when the subject 
is Irbe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arturs is a special guy," he said. "Our season has been heavily dependent on 
his goaltending. Ask anybody on the team, on the coaching staff. If we've had 
any success this season, he's been a major part of it. Being an ex-goalie, I 
have a soft spot for him and a little extra affection for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Even opponents like him. When Detroit's Dino Ciccarelli crashed Irbe's crease 
to distract him, Irbe chirped, "Hello, Dino." 
</P>
<P>
 Ciccarelli, disarmed, was speechless. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you hate a guy like that?" he said later. 
</P>
<P>
 With Winnipeg enforcer Tie Domi, Irbe was critical. When Domi declared he 
would hurt Irbe, the goalie calmly replied, "You should try to do something 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Domi was too startled to reply. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy to carry on a conversation while facing slap shots and onrushing 
opponents. Shark assistant coach Wayne Thomas, whose eight-year NHL goaltending 
career included a Stanley Cup championship with Montreal, admires Irbe's 
ability to gab and grab. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had enough trouble stopping the puck that I couldn't talk to guys," Thomas 
said. "A guy like (the New York Islanders') Billy Smith, he was able to stop 
the puck and keep his concentration enough to yap at guys. I didn't have that 
ability. Arturs is kind of matter-of-fact about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's pretty intense, but controlled. He has an unbelievable will to win and 
succeed, but he manages to stay on a pretty even keel." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas attributes Irbe's puck-handling problems to that hunger to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has done a great job of mastering the art of blocking pucks, with his 
hunger to learn and get better at the position," Thomas said. "The next stop, 
in his mind, is breaking the puck out of the zone. Right now he's caught in 
between. Sometimes he's too active and tries to do too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all players, it's a learning process of 'simple is good.' There's going 
to be some growing pains, but thank goodness he wants to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 He learned English much faster than he's learning to pass pucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Irbe, who joined the Sharks' Kansas City affiliate in 1991, used to beg off 
team gatherings by claiming he didn't know the language well enough. He tripped 
himself up during a promotion in San Jose last season, when he was asked if he 
wanted to sit on the bench with a last-place NHL team or play in the minors for 
a division-leading team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to be a pauper among kings than a king among paupers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An articulate statement for someone unfamiliar with English, and a quote that 
caught Constantine's attention. He asked Irbe if he had said that exactly as 
written. "Yes, I did," Irbe said, proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Constantine, "You just lost your English language excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Irbe uses his language skills to lead his teammates on the ice and in the 
locker room. He's vocal, and his words carry weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very supportive," said defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh, a fellow Latvian. 
"Maybe a couple of times he will get mad at defensemen and start screaming. 
Mostly he is supportive and he pats you on the pads. He's great." 
</P>
<P>
 When he converses, Irbe can do it in English, Latvian or Russian. He and 
Russian-born teammates Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov, stars on the great 
Soviet teams of the 1980s, often discuss politics. Although they are products 
of a government that repressed his homeland, Irbe found he has more in common 
with them than in dispute. He especially enjoys talking with Larionov, who also 
rebelled, in his case against the iron fist of the Soviet hockey federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand his point of view, but I had to learn on my own," Irbe said. "I 
really almost 100% agree with Igor. I never heard from anyone who was on former 
Soviet team when I quit saying, 'Shame,' or blame me for refusing to play. They 
understood my nationalism and activity." 
</P>
<P>
 His country is never far from his mind. Irbe went home last summer to play for 
Latvia in an Olympic qualifying tournament, and he brought his mother to the 
Bay Area this season to live with him, his wife and infant daughter. He also 
brought his best friends here, paying their expenses because they could not 
afford to. A brother and sister remain in Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult time because the system is changing," Irbe said. "The Soviet 
system was so deep in people's minds, people's routines. Young people, they can 
make adjustments right away. For older people, it's real tough. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming clear there's no middle class. Almost none at all. Very small 
middle class. Bigger upper class and a very, very huge lower class, people who 
live on (the) minimum just to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is some kind of extra joy in their lives, that myself and Sandis, we are 
playing for this team and having success. We are really playing for our country 
now, not only for San Jose."

JIM MURRAY: LEWIS A FAR CRY FROM REAL LOUIS EVEN WITH BIG RIGHT, WBC TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be nice to have a heavyweight boxing champion named Lewis again -- no 
matter how it is spelled. 
</P>
<P>
 But you have to regretfully conclude that Lennox is no Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox Lewis is, in many ways, the most attractive of the guys who revel in 
the title "heavyweight champion of the world" these days. He is articulate, 
attractive, a gentleman. He has this clipped British accent that always 
impresses, awes and intimidates Americans. I mean, imagine Ronald Colman as the 
heavyweight champ of the world, and you get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 He has only one drawback: He can't fight.  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, he can hit, all right. He might have the best right hand in the business 
right now. George Foreman, no less, concedes that to him. It's a bomb.  
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with having a bomb is, you've got to find a way to deliver it.  
</P>
<P>
 Lennox looks as if he is trying to send it by fourth-class mail. Addressed to 
"Occupant." 
</P>
<P>
 The other Louis -- Joe -- needed an opening no bigger than a keyhole when -- 
pow! -- it was in there and on your chin. Lennox almost needs you to paint a 
target on it and hold it still.  
</P>
<P>
 It's the trouble British boxers have had since antiquity. Somehow, it's not in 
the British character to brawl, in-fight, or even duck. The British credo, "No 
gentleman ever plays a game too well," extends to fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Brits, a prizefight is like a French duel. You don't duck, sidestep, or 
fall away. You stand up like a man and hope your opponent misses. It's what got 
the Redcoats licked in the American Revolution. The British squares were no 
match for the minutemen hiding behind rocks, leading to the suspicion it's 
where the word squares came from to describe the hopelessly naive.  
</P>
<P>
 American fighters, from Washington's army to Jack Dempsey, had no such 
constraints. They fought out of a crouch, they bobbed and weaved, they came in 
low. The Marquess of Queensberry devised a series of humane rules for the sport 
in 1867, but the Americans pretty much rose above it and turned the game into a 
back-alley assault and battery.  
</P>
<P>
 America loved its bully boys. John L. Sullivan was the first, the prototype. 
He brought the title to America in the 1880s and it was never to return to 
Britain again, although an Italian, Primo Carnera, a German, Max Schmeling, and 
a Swede, Ingemar Johansson, would briefly take it to the Old World. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brits sent periodical challengers over to the United States to see if they 
could somehow bring the championship back to what they considered its rightful 
ancestral home, but they were found wanting. The best of them was the Welshman, 
Tonypandy Tommy Farr, a carnival or booth fighter, whose claim to fame would be 
that he carried Joe Louis to a 15-round decision at a time when most Louis 
opponents were hard put to go more than one round with him. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst the Brits sent over was a pale, tense, clumsy heavyweight named Phil 
Scott, whose stock in trade was to dive to the canvas at a crucial moment, 
holding his groin and crying "Foul!" He was miscast as a fighter, but 
Shakespearean as an actor. He won so many fights lying on his back, emoting, 
that the press was to dub him "Phainting Phil." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't do much for the image of the English fighter in this country, 
although he did hasten the development of the tin protective cup and the 
practice of deducting only a round, not a fight, for a low blow.  
</P>
<P>
 He never got a title shot. Of course, in those days, there was only one 
heavyweight champion of the world. Today, there are almost as many as there are 
letters in the alphabet. Everyone, it seems, gets his letter. You have 
"heavyweight champions" named Witherspoon, Dokes, Weaver, Tate, even, briefly, 
Page and Bey. Some years, it's hard to tell who isn't the heavyweight champion. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is one of two at the moment. He won his title the way so many seem to do 
nowadays -- by phone. What happened was that Riddick Bowe, shortly after he had 
won the unified heavyweight title by beating Evander Holyfield, chose to take 
one of his championship belts, the one emblematic of the World Boxing Council's 
championship, and deposit it in a trash bin, rather than give Lewis a shot at 
it.  
</P>
<P>
 The WBC, so to speak, took it out, dusted it off and gave it to Lennox Lewis.  
</P>
<P>
 It is Lennox's view that Bowe was not acting out of disdain for the WBC so 
much as out of fear of Lewis, who had knocked him out in the Olympics at Seoul 
in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
 Whoever is right, the reality is, Lennox Lewis is the first Brit since the 
days of the storied James Figg, Tom Cribb, Daniel Mendoza and Tom Molyneaux to 
have any claim at all to the heavyweight title.  
</P>
<P>
 He came to the States last week to defend his half of a title against a trial 
horse named Phil Jackson in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Jackson, it so happened, is not going to put anybody in mind of Joe 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither, it so happens, is Lennox. Lewis, despite having grown up in 
Canada, turns out to be your standard Brit in the ring. He doesn't fall to the 
floor clutching his groin, but, like most UK heavyweights throughout history, 
he makes his fight like a statue. He seems incapable of moving forward. Indeed, 
he has trouble moving laterally, and he looks like something hanging from a 
chain most of the evening.  
</P>
<P>
 A British fight is like the Battle of Jutland. It's fought at long range. You 
take your shot, the opponent takes his. And whoever lands the most wins a dull 
decision.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem begins in the gyms. American fighters have always had one 
advantage over our British cousins in that, in this country, the gyms are full 
of canny, savvy old trainers who know all about the art of slipping punches, 
fighting on the inside, body shots and a whole lot of stratagems a Brit 
wouldn't, so to speak, stoop to.

 Lewis needs six months with Georgie Benton. Or one of those wise old bent-nose 
pail toters who can show him how to unload that right without wiring ahead it's 
coming. After all, the other Louis had Chappie Blackburn. Rocky Marciano had 
Charley Goldman. And so on.  
</P>
<P>
 Lewis could be a colorful and popular champion. He could be the first Brit in 
a century to be undisputed heavyweight champion.

<P>
 But, first, he has to learn to fight.

FINCHEM WILL HEAD PGA TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Finchem was selected Monday to succeed Deane Beman as the commissioner of 
the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem, 47, is deputy commissioner and chief operating officer of the tour.He 
will assume duties as the tour's third commissioner on June 1. The late Joe Dey 
was the first commissioner, from 1969 to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem was elected unanimously during a meeting of the tour's Tournament 
Policy Board, board chairman Richard J. Ferris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim has been involved in every aspect of tour operations and his expertise 
will ensure that there will be a smooth transition and a continuation of the 
success we have enjoyed under Deane," Ferris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beman, 56, announced March 1 that he would not seek another term as 
commissioner, a position he has held for 20 years. He said his immediate plans 
are to play some competitive golf on the Senior PGA Tour and to be involved in 
golf course design. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deane is leaving the tour in excellent shape," Finchem said. "The tour is 
successful financially and competitively. We look forward to building on that 
solid foundation." 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem, a graduate of the Virginia law school, was a partner in a Virginia 
Beach, Va., law firm and was deputy adviser to President Carter for economic 
affairs in 1978-79. He was national staff director of Carter's presidential 
campaign in 1980.

SOCCER / JULIE CART; CONTROVERSY, SECOND-GUESSING AND ANALYSIS? IT'S ABOUT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best thing that has happened to the U.S. national team this year has been 
what has come to be known as "the goalkeeper controversy." This played out last 
week when the U.S. Soccer Federation selected Jurgen Sommer as its third World 
Cup goalkeeper, thus eliminating the highly regarded Kasey Keller from the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-guessing and analysis began immediately: arguments about the 
relative strengths of each of the three, the possible political motivations for 
the selections, the practical impact for the U.S. team against World Cup 
opponents. This and other decisions of U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic were again 
scrutinized and criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer officials are skittish, as always, at any hint of disagreement in the 
happy family. Their attitude is wrongheaded. This entire episode is the first 
sign anyone has seen that soccer is being taken seriously here. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy is exactly what happens in "mainstream" sports when decisions are 
made. Fans praise or complain. Insiders look for hidden agendas. Debate is 
stirred. It's what sports in the United States are about. You want people 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing that could happen to soccer would be if radio sports-talk show 
hosts stopped making fun of it and began analyzing such decisions. Fans talk 
about things they care about. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another way to view it: Which is better, selecting a World Cup team 
with an inevitable shrug because the talent pool is so shallow, or generating 
intense competition among qualified candidates? A surplus of skilled 
goalkeepers isn't the problem. It's a lack of competition that should worry 
soccer officials. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be more criticism when roster cuts are made. At least someone 
cares. At least some fans are informed enough to have an opinion. A little 
noise is surely better than deafening silence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for Keller, give him high marks for class. It would be natural for him to 
feel snubbed, because he got precious few scouting visits as he went through 
his second outstanding season for Millwall in the English First Division. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he did finally discuss the decision last Friday from his apartment in 
London, Keller was professional and resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely something I had in the back of my mind," Keller said of the 
possibility that he would not be selected for the World Cup team. "It was 
something I was well prepared for, even to the point of discussing doing some 
British (television) commentary during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought that what I had done (at Millwall) for the past year had to 
filter through somehow. It didn't, I guess. I'm disappointed, but I did all I 
could do and I have a good, stable professional career here that I have built." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller was eager to dispel a rumor that he was not selected because his ego 
would not allow him to sit quietly while someone else started. "I don't want 
anybody to think it was an ego thing on my part," he said. "That I was too big 
to be part of the team and not play. I would have been happy to have come in 
and give the benefit of my experience, even if I didn't play." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller was Tony Meola's backup in the 1990 World Cup and, at 24, he has other 
chances, provided the United States can qualify. If not, Keller has established 
an excellent reputation in England and now has a transfer fee value of 1 1/2 
million pounds, about $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a personal setback, but it won't hurt my career," Keller said. "My 
game is improving every day. That's what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The latest foreign-based players to report to camp are striker Ernie Stewart 
and defender Cle Kooiman. Stewart was released by Willem II in the Dutch First 
Division to train with the U.S. team. Kooiman finished the season with Cruz 
Azul in the Mexican First Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Both players attended last Saturday night's game against Estonia and are 
expected to begin practicing with the team Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart has played only 14 games with the national team, but that belies his 
crucial role for the team, as the probable starting striker in Milutinovic's 
single-striker system. Stewart and Cobi Jones are the fastest players on the 
U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 Kooiman is a rugged defender who has served as captain of Cruz Azul, an honor 
seldom accorded a non-Mexican player. Unlike the offensive players who will 
return from Europe, Kooiman joins an almost intact defense that has been 
playing together for more than a year.

 What is happening with the proposed professional soccer league? Not much. 
</P>
<P>
 That sums up the investment interest in Major League Soccer, which has 
announced it will begin operations next spring. The league has been seeking 
$100 million in initial investment, $60 million of it in cash -- astonishing 
figures in the current economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indications are of massive retrenchment by MLS. Investors were at first 
required to put up $10 million each, but now that figure has been halved. 
Additionally, sources say, the league has gone to Wall Street to seek 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 franchise cities are to be announced June 15 and it looks doubtful that 
each will have met one major criterion for selection: The sale of 10,000 season 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential financial blow was dealt a few weeks ago, when the USSF 
executive committee shot down an MLS proposal that the pro league assume 
marketing rights for the U.S. national team and the Olympic team. Someone 
noticed those rights were already held by Soccer USA Partners (SUSAP), which 
the USSF contracted to promote the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the matter of players. If the 12 teams have rosters of 18, the 
new league will need 216 players. Allowing for four foreign players on each 
team, that leaves room for 168 American professional players. Where are they? 
</P>
<P>
 Take every player off the World Cup roster, assuming the new league could pay 
the millions in transfer fees for the foreign-based players, and assuming the 
players would want to play in the MLS for less money, and 146 players still 
would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the best of the rest of the American players are under contract to 
American Professional Soccer League (APSL) teams, and those teams could not be 
expected to happily turn over their players to their rival, the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
 So where is the MLS going to get its players? In addition to the APSL's 
players, the MLS covets the stadiums the APSL has under lease. The San 
Francisco Blackhawks have already announced their bid for an MLS franchise -- 
look for other APSL teams to follow suit, as the MLS comes courting. 
</P>
<P>
 William De La Pena, owner of the Los Angeles Salsa, confirmed that he has 
talked with MLS representatives about joining the new league. The problem: De 
La Pena wants to own his own team and not be part of the MLS single-entity 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Pena says there's room for compromise, but it appears the APSL has all 
the leverage.

 BILL BUCKNER 
</P>
<P>
 Buckner might be forever remembered for letting a ground ball get through his 
legs, costing the Boston Red Sox a Game 6 victory that would have ended the 
1986 World Series, but Dodger fans won't forget the eight years he spent in Los 
Angeles (1969-76), either. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-handed outfielder and first baseman's team-leading .314 batting 
average in 1974 helped the club win its first National League championship in 
eight seasons.And only four other Dodgers have topped his .289 lifetime mark 
with the Los Angeles franchise.

 "Billy Bucks," 44, lives in Idaho and is a roving batting instructor in

<P>
 Technically, Hassler is the only Angel to have had three separate tours with 
the club. He made his major league pitching debut in Anaheim at 19 in 1971, 
spent the next season in the minors, then played for the Angels from 1973-76 
and again from 1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-5 left-hander threw a one-hitter against the White Sox in '74 -- 
although he lost, 1-0, on an unearned run -- and was the team's ERA leader in 
three seasons. But he also lost a club-record 17 consecutive decisions in 
1975-76. 
</P>
<P>
 Used as both a starter and reliever over his 14-year career, he retired in 
1985 with a 44-71 lifetime mark. Hassler, 42, lives in Arizona and dabbles in 
real estate.

RAMS COULD SIGN YOUNG, EX-RAIDER KELLY TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams met the contract guidelines for free-agent linebacker Joe Kelly and 
defensive end Robert Young Monday, and could have both players signed today. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president, met Monday with Steve Feldman, agent 
for Young and Kelly, and made the offers for both players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams offered Young, a restricted free agent, a three-year deal worth $3.5 
million, nearly a $1-million-a-year raise from last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, cut two weeks ago by the Raiders, is considering one-year deals from 
the Washington Redskins and the Rams, who offered $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guidelines given to me by my players have been met (by the Rams)," 
Feldman said. "I need to run it by both players and should have an answer by 
(today)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also are awaiting the arrival of the contract of wide receiver Greg 
McMurtry. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry, an unrestricted free agent from New England, had agreed to terms on 
a one-year, $500,000 deal last week and was supposed to sign his contract 
Monday and send it by overnight mail to the Rams, said his agent, Brad Blank.  
</P>
<P>
 Signing McMurtry won't keep the Rams from pursuing free-agent receiver Haywood 
Jeffires of Houston, although negotiations have been slow. Fred Joseph, 
Jeffires' agent, said he has been negotiating with the Oilers and expects to 
hear from the Rams "very shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred called (Monday) but I haven't got back to him," Zygmunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires had rejected a three-year, $3.9-million offer from the Rams in April. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry, 6-feet-2 and 210 pounds, started 28 games for New England from 1991 
to 1992 but started only eight last season after a falling out with new Patriot 
Coach Bill Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
 He caught 22 passes for 241 yards and a touchdown but was benched temporarily 
by Parcells because of a quarrel about a blocking assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greg has always been considered a good blocker," Blank said. "Bo Schembechler 
called him his best blocking receiver ever at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parcells came in there with a broom and wanted to clean out some of the guys 
who were there. Greg was a victim of a new coach and a clean sweep." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry, a standout high school outfielder in Boston, was drafted in the 
first round by the Boston Red Sox in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 He bypassed baseball to attend Michigan, where he started four years. New 
England selected him in the third round of the 1990 draft and was the team's 
No. 2 receiver in 1991 and '92.

FED'S INACTION SPOOKS STOCK, BOND TRADERS; MARKETS: THE DOW PLUMMETS 40.46 
POINTS AS T-BOND YIELDS SURGE AGAIN. ELECTRIC UTILITY STOCKS ALSO PLUNGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stock prices tumbled and bond yields surged for a second consecutive session 
Monday as investors expressed concern over the economy's healthy pace and 
questioned the Federal Reserve Board's commitment to fighting inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials fell 40.46 points to 3,629.04. And electric utility 
stocks -- sensitive to higher interest rates -- dropped to their lowest levels 
since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond zoomed 
to 7.65% from 7.55% on Friday and is now at its highest level since late 1992. 
The yield had been 7.33% just last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The markets' latest rout began Friday, after the government reported robust 
job growth for April. The news reignited the inflation worries that have dogged 
the bond market all year, with investors focused on the economy's strength and 
the potential for rising prices as consumers and businesses spend more. 
</P>
<P>
 After Friday's employment report, bond traders had expected that the Fed would 
immediately move to again raise short-term interest rates, thereby showing its 
resolve to moderate the economy's growth and dampen inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fed, which has raised short-term rates three times this year, failed 
to act Friday or Monday. That was a major disappointment to bond investors, who 
fear that the central bank is moving too slowly to contain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This perceived lack of leadership by the Fed has gotten the bond market 
spooked that (the Fed governors have) lost their resolve to fight inflation," 
said Todd Clark, senior trader at Mabon Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors want to see some sign of a Fed backbone," agreed James Solloway, a 
director at Argus Research. 
</P>
<P>
 While many experts believe it is only a matter of time before the next Fed 
hike in short-term rates, any delay is debilitating to the frazzled bond market 
-- particularly this week, as the Treasury attempts to sell $17 billion in 
three-year notes today and $12 billion in 10-year notes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists have criticized the Fed's policy of "gradualism," under which 
it has raised rates a quarter-point at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "By pursuing a gradualist policy, the Fed is allowing itself to be backed into 
a position of having to make a large rate move to restore confidence and market 
stability," said L. Douglas Lee, economist at NatWest Washington Analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists still believe that long-term bond yields will stabilize and 
perhaps fall back again by summer, if the market can be persuaded that 
inflation won't become a major problem. But in the meantime, the continuing 
rise in yields is eroding the value of existing fixed-rate bonds and bond 
funds, raising the specter of another selling wave by small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond mutual funds suffered a large outflow of money in March during the first 
major surge in yields. On Monday, traders said some of the selling in the bond 
market may have been due to bond fund managers raising cash in anticipation of 
more shareholder redemptions ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, traders keyed off the bond market's weakness, leaving 
stocks broadly lower. NYSE losers topped winners by 17 to 5, though volume was 
typically slow for a Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks briefly rebounded before 11:30 a.m. EDT, when the Fed typically acts in 
the money markets. When the Fed signaled it wouldn't raise rates short-term 
rates Monday, the slide resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Though higher short-term rates aren't necessarily good for the stock market, 
many stock investors now favor an additional boost in short rates if that would 
allow the bond market to stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, fear of inflation can be as damaging to stock prices as to bonds -- so 
many on Wall Street favor higher short-term rates to keep the economy's 
recovery on an even keel with low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Electric utility stocks, which usually suffer as interest rates move up, 
were crushed by the latest bond yield rise and by news of a dividend cut by FPL 
Group, parent of Florida Power & Light. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow utility index tumbled 5.47 points, or nearly 3%, to 183.36, its lowest 
level since March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 FPL plunged 4 3/8 to 27 1/2 after cutting its dividend 32%, even though the 
market had expected some kind of cut by FPL as a cash-saving measure. Other 
utilities dropping sharply included SCEcorp, off 5/8 to 14 3/4; Pacific Gas & 
Electric, down 1/2 to 23 3/8; Houston Industries, off 1 to 33 3/8, and 
Consolidated Edison, off 3/4 to 28 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Pinnacle West Capital, parent of Arizona Public Service, dropped 2 1/2 
to 17 7/8 after saying it sees higher costs from closing two of three nuclear 
generating units at its Palo Verde plant for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco stocks fell on a news story alleging that senior executives at BAT 
Industries kept secret research done in 1963 on the hazards of smoking. BAT 
slid 5/8 to 13, Philip Morris sank 2 to 50 and RJR Nabisco lost 3/8 to 5 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks were broadly lower as investors feared for the economy's 
health amid rising interest rates. GE dropped 1 3/4 to 94 7/8, Caterpillar fell 
2 1/2 to 105 5/8, Georgia-Pacific lost 1 to 59 and GM gave up 7/8 to 53 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the upside, some health care stocks were strong. Lilly rose 1 1/8 to 53 
1/8, Warner-Lambert gained 1 1/2 to 70 1/2, Pfizer added 1/2 to 59 1/2 and 
Biogen rose 1/2 to 34 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, London's FTSE-100 index fell 8.2 points to 3,097.8 and 
Frankfurt's DAX index lost 18.14 points to 2,218.88. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index fell 29.12 points to 2,147.58. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index gave up 104.52 points to 19,757.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, oil prices inched up while gold gave back $2.20 of the 
$9.80-per-ounce jump it made Friday, settling at $381.20. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar edged down to 1.653 German marks in New York from 1.660 on Friday, 
after the Fed failed to boost short-term interest rates. Against the yen, the 
dollar rose 102.68 from 102.40.DOW JONES INDUSTRI

MCKESSON SHARES ZOOM ON SPECULATION THAT IT'S A TAKEOVER TARGET; HEALTH CARE: 
ANALYSTS SAY THE DRUG DISTRIBUTOR'S PCS UNIT IS THE BIG ATTRACTION FOR 
POTENTIAL INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As merger mania grips the health care field, shares of McKesson Corp. rose 
sharply Monday on speculation that major pharmaceutical makers are sizing up 
the San Francisco-based drug distribution giant. 
</P>
<P>
 McKesson' shares soared $5.625, or 7.8%, to $77.875 on the New York Stock 
Exchange on very heavy volume of 659,500 shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in McKesson's stock came a day after a London newspaper reported 
that Britain's Glaxo Holdings was in talks with McKesson to buy all or part of 
the company. Analysts said McKesson's stock has climbed steadily over the past 
year on rumors that drug makers such as Glaxo, Pfizer and Eli Lilly & Co. were 
eyeing the distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Glaxo and McKesson declined to comment specifically on reports 
of discussions between their firms. 
</P>
<P>
 McKesson's prime attraction is not its massive drug wholesaling business, 
which accounted for about 95% of its $12.2 billion in sales last year. Instead 
the allure comes from a tiny division, PCS Health Systems Inc., a pharmacy 
benefit management firm with estimated revenue of $175 million, or less than 2% 
of McKesson's total sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Why all the interest in PCS? Fearful of losing influence over the price and 
distribution of their products, drug makers are rushing to acquire pharmacy 
benefit companies, which now exercise control over more than half the nation's 
$65-billion-a-year drug business. Pharmacy benefit firms work with employers 
and health maintenance organizations to hold down drug prices, usually by 
encouraging the use of lower-cost generic drugs or by demanding -- and getting 
-- discounts on name brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, drug giant SmithKline Beecham offered $2.3 billion for Diversified 
Pharmaceutical Services, a pharmacy benefit company owned by United Healthcare 
Corp. That followed last November's acquisition by Merck & Co., the world's 
biggest drug maker, of Medco Containment Services for $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 With Diversified Pharmaceutical out of the running, McKesson's PCS unit is 
"the most attractive, the largest, the most profitable and has the best 
investment in technology" of the drug benefit management firms, said John Ford, 
an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Lawrence C. Marsh, an analyst with Wheat First Butcher & Singer in 
Richmond, Va.: "PCS is a real jewel that's not attached to (a drug maker) yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh estimated that PCS' revenue and operating earnings grew at a hefty 60% 
clip last year and that growth should nearly equal that pace this year. 
Importantly, PCS accounts for about 16% of the parent firm's total operating 
earnings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He projects that PCS would be worth up to $3.3 billion, an estimate based on 
the price SmithKline is paying for Diversified Pharmaceutical. While DPS 
manages pharmacy benefits for 14 million people, PCS covers about 45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that PCS is of considerable strategic importance to McKesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing company policy, Marvin L. Krasnansky, McKesson's vice president of 
corporate relations, refused to discuss reports of discussions with Glaxo. 
However, he noted that PCS "is a critical part of our business strategy and we 
consider it a core business." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if McKesson management isn't interested in selling, analysts said the 
company will have to entertain offers to meet its obligation to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a public company and someone throws a tremendous amount of money at 
you, you can't necessarily turn it down," said Ford, the Bear Stearns analyst. 
"But I believe the company does not want to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a spokesman for Glaxo's U.S. unit in Research Triangle Park, N.C., 
said the company's policy is to not comment on "rumors and speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole area of managed care is one we're deeply involved in and one in 
which we are talking to a variety of individuals and organizations that may 
help us better meet our company's needs," spokesman Rick Sluder said.

MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY PANEL PROPOSES SOME SELF-POLICING; ETHICS: THE ADVISORY 
GROUP'S GUIDELINES WOULD PLACE SHARP LIMITS ON PERSONAL INVESTING BY MANAGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mutual fund industry organization proposed Monday to sharply limit personal 
investing by fund managers, a plan prompted by recent complaints that some 
managers may have feathered their own nests in conflict with the best interests 
of their funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the six-member advisory group of the Washington-based Investment Company 
Institute stopped short of calling for a total ban on personal investing by 
fund managers, which a number of the industry's critics have advocated. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is facing pressure to act from Congress and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission following several recently reported episodes of fund 
managers' personal trades in securities of companies in which their funds were 
about to invest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panel said it concluded that the problems are isolated and that the 
mutual fund industry's ethical track record is superior to that of bank trust 
departments, pension funds and other managers of pooled investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed guidelines would bar managers from investing in initial public 
offerings and from profiting on short-term trades. They would also prohibit 
fund employees from trading in a stock while any of the funds in their group 
had a pending order to buy or sell the same stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Subcommittee on 
Telecommunications and Finance, praised the industry proposal. Barry Barbash, 
director of the SEC's division of investment management, said the commission 
expects to issue a report within a month of its own inquiry into the recent 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbash said a survey of trading records from 30 mutual fund groups does not 
appear to show a widespread problem, although data is being tabulated. While 
the SEC will not take a position on the industry guidelines until its own 
inquiry is complete, Barbash said the proposal shows that the industry is 
"reacting responsibly to the issues we raised." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald P. Lynch, chairman of the ICI and its advisory group and managing 
partner of Lord Abbett & Co., said the recommended guidelines would wipe out 
any potential conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines must still be approved by the institute's board of governors 
and even then would not be binding. But the great majority of mutual fund 
companies are expected to adopt the guidelines, said James S. Riepe, another 
member of the advisory group, who is also managing director at funds group T. 
Rowe Price Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Jamison, a spokeswoman for Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest 
mutual fund concern, said Fidelity will adopt the guidelines, although its 
existing rules already incorporate some of the proposals. The SEC reportedly is 
looking into personal trading by a few Fidelity employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to barring managers from putting their personal money into initial 
public offerings, the guidelines call for: 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring managers and certain other fund employees to "pre-clear" personal 
investments with their companies' compliance officials. They would also be 
required to get specific authorization in advance from their companies before 
investing in private placements -- stock and other securities that are not 
offered to the general public or registered with the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forbidding managers to keep any profits that result from selling a security 
within 60 days of its purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 * Barring portfolio managers from buying or selling a security within seven 
calendar days before or after the manager's fund trades the security. A broader 
group of fund employees would be prohibited from buying or selling on the same 
day any fund managed by their company trades a security.

MEDIA VISION SKID CONTINUES ON NEWS OF FBI-SEC PROBE; TECHNOLOGY: FIRM IS 
INVESTIGATED FOR ALLEGED SECURITIES VIOLATIONS. STOCK HITS $2.875 A SHARE AFTER 
PEAKING AT $46.50 IN JANUARY. 
</P>

<P>
 The stock of Media Vision Technology Inc., a once-high-flying maker of video 
and sound products for computers, plummeted Monday after the FBI and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged that they have launched an 
investigation into alleged securities violations. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4.3 million shares of the Fremont, Calif.-based company changed 
hands in Nasdaq trading, tumbling $1.75 each to $2.875. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp selloff, from a high of $46.50 in January, has erased more than $600 
million of market value for Media Vision, which has dropped a series of 
bombshells in recent weeks. The company's fall from grace sent a strong signal 
that, promising as it is, the so-called multimedia market requires that 
investors do their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Media Vision already faces several shareholder class-action suits alleging 
that company executives misled investors about performance and the likelihood 
of future success. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Media Vision reported that it would revise figures for 1993, 
including its record sales volume of $241 million, and take a sizable loss for 
the fourth quarter, for which it initially had reported an $8.5-million profit. 
The company blamed price cuts and shipment delays. Last week, it laid off 50 
employees, 15% of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's stock collapse followed a report in the San Francisco Chronicle that 
the company was under investigation because of allegations that executives had 
repeatedly falsified sales records and engaged in other shoddy or illegal 
business practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have an investigation of Media Vision," Rick Smith, an FBI spokesman in 
San Francisco, said Monday. He said the investigation is being conducted 
jointly by his agency, the SEC and the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Media Vision spokeswoman Elizabeth Fairchild said, "We're aware 
that there is some sort of investigation." She added that "we're still in 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Media Vision, established in 1990, makes sound cards and multimedia kits that 
enable computer users to run educational and entertainment software in CD-ROM 
format. It also publishes CD-ROM games, including "Critical Path," "Forever 
Growing Garden" and "Always Arthur." 
</P>
<P>
 Media Vision's troubles are bad news for Montgomery Securities, a San 
Francisco-based brokerage that has aggressively underwritten securities sales 
for hot high-tech ventures. Montgomery was Media Vision's lead underwriter when 
the company went public in 1992 and backed a $75-million debt offering late 
last year. Montgomery representatives would not comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's additional evidence that where there's lots of money to be made, there's 
also lots of money to be lost," said Dan Case, president of the Hambrecht & 
Quist investment firm in San Francisco. "Multimedia is still a very exciting 
business opportunity, but one where due diligence is required." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Jain, 48, Media Vision's founder and chief executive, has a mixed history 
as a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. A tennis enthusiast born in New Delhi, Jain 
(pronounced Jan) attended college in Vienna before immigrating to the United 
States to earn two degrees in computer science at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous Jain start-up, Video 7, a maker of computer graphics circuit 
boards, was sold to LSI Logic in 1989. Dismayed to discover vast amounts of 
unsold inventory, LSI fired Jain and later sold the company. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Jain touted Media Vision's rosy prospects to investment analysts 
just eight days before disclosing that the company would have to revise its 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said Media Vision encountered troubles because it failed to 
adapt to a shift in the market. Home computer users, who early last year 
clamored for Media Vision's multimedia kits, found them tricky to install. Once 
powerful new machines with sound and video capabilities built in popped up at 
competitive prices, many users chucked old systems for new. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Media Vision clung to multimedia kits -- including CD-ROM players, 
speakers and sound cards -- Creative Labs, the market leader, began 
manufacturing more multimedia components for big computer makers such as IBM, 
Compaq and AST. Milpitas, Calif.-based Creative Labs is the U.S. arm of 
Singapore-based Creative Technology and makes Sound Blaster brand products. 
</P>
<P>
 Dataquest Inc., a market research firm, puts Creative Labs' share of the sound 
board market at 70%. All told, Dataquest projects this year's market for 
multimedia computer systems and sound boards at $7.3 billion, up from about $6 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Ryon, a multimedia analyst at Dataquest, said the Media Vision fiasco 
will help inject some sanity into all the multimedia hype. Stock Plunge 
</P>
<P>
 Media Vision Technology Inc. was one of Wall Street's darlings, with a product 
line including devices that enabled personal computers to emit stereo sound. 
But this year Media Vision shares began a long slide that culminated Monday in 
an investigation of possible securities violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly Stock prices, except latest: 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 14: $45.75 Monday: $2.875, down $1.75

 Utilities to Put 1,850 Electric Cars in Use Before Mandate: Four California 
utilities -- Southern California Edison Co., the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and the Sacramento Municipal 
Utility District -- announced that they will place electric cars with their 
customers and in utility-owned fleets before the 1998 deadline set by the 
California Air Resources Board for the Big Three auto makers to begin selling 
zero-emissions vehicles to the public. The plan, by EV America, a national 
coalition of utilities and electric car proponents, includes setting standards 
for volume purchases of cars from specific manufacturers to help lower prices 
through "modest" economies of scale.

 SEC Seeks Derivatives Trade Data From P&G: The consumer products company said 
the Securities and Exchange Commission requested the information about its 
derivatives trading, which caused it to take a $157-million pretax charge in 
its fiscal third quarter. The Wall Street Journal reported that Procter & 
Gamble Co. is considering cutting or eliminating this year's executive bonuses 
to offset a portion of the loss from its derivative investments. Derivatives 
were originally devised as a way to limit exposure to such potential risks as 
rising interest rates or falling currency rates, but they are also used to 
speculate.

DAILY NEWS OF LOS ANGELES TO BE SOLD, OWNER ANNOUNCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of the Daily News of Los Angeles said Monday that it has hired an 
investment bank to find a buyer for the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily News is owned by multimillionaire Jack Kent Cooke, who paid $176 
million in December, 1985, to buy the Woodland Hills-based newspaper from 
Tribune Co. in Chicago.According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation, the Daily 
News had a daily circulation of 211,252 for the six months ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper is part of Cooke's private business empire, which includes the 
Washington Redskins, the Chrysler Building in New York, cable TV holdings and a 
horse-breeding farm in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kent Cooke Inc., which owns the newspaper, said in a statement that 
Lazard Freres & Co. of New York has been retained to "explore interest already 
received and contact other potential" buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke and other company officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since earlier this year, union officials at the Daily News had heard rumors 
that the paper might be for sale, and they said they were only mildly surprised 
when Bob Burdick, the paper's editor, gave the news to workers late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Tranquada, who chairs the Newspaper Guild unit that represents about 165 
editorial employees at the Daily News, said the newsroom was full of 
speculation. The guild's contract with management expired in February, and 
union workers have been working under an extended contract. Cooke, who lives in 
Middleburg, Va., has a net worth of $800 million, according to Forbes magazine.

JAPANESE TRADE SURPLUS RISES 3.3% TO RECORD $130 BILLION; COMMERCE: HOWEVER, 
MUCH OF THE FISCAL-YEAR INCREASE IS BLAMED ON THE RISING VALUE OF THE YEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's current account surplus, long a source of friction with the United 
States and other major trading partners, rose 3.3% to a record $130.04 billion 
in the fiscal year ended March 31, the Finance Ministry said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The current account, a broad measure of trade in goods and services plus 
certain other capital flows, amounted to $125.90 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States government has raised the possibility of imposing trade 
sanctions if Japan does not take steps to reduce its perennial surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
 Measured in yen, however, the fiscal 1993 surplus narrowed by 10% from the 
previous year as the rising yen encouraged spending by Japanese and discouraged 
purchases of Japanese products abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The surplus fell to 14 trillion yen from fiscal 1992's 15.6 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 The yen's rise against the dollar raises the value, in dollars, of Japanese 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was trading at about 102 yen at the end of fiscal 1993, compared to 
about 115 at the end of fiscal 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus 1,000 yen worth of exports would have been worth $8.70 at the start of 
the fiscal year and $9.80 at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the long run, analysts expect the dollar's effect on Japanese products' 
competitiveness to help shrink the surplus in both dollar and yen terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the dollar approached its modern record low of 100.40 yen, reached 
Aug. 17 last year. It closed Monday in Tokyo at 102.41 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the surplus fell 16% to $15.76 billion, from $18.79 billion a year 
earlier, the ministry said. In yen, March's current surplus plummeted 25%.  
</P>
<P>
 The ministry does not provide a breakdown of figures by country or region for 
the current account. In calendar 1993, Japan's trade surplus with the United 
States reached $59 billion.

MACY AND ITS SUITORS SWEETEN THEIR OFFERS; RETAILING: BUT THE COMPANY CLAIMS IT 
HAS THE SUPPORT OF MOST CREDITORS FOR ITS PLAN TO EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY.

 R.H. Macy & Co., rival Federated Department Stores Inc. and a group of Macy 
bondholders on Monday each sweetened their debt payment offers for Macy's 
bankruptcy reorganization, but Macy said it has the support of a majority of 
its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati-based Federated revised a bankruptcy plan that proposes a merger 
with Macy -- offering to pay Macy's creditors $3.83 billion, about $318 million 
more than it offered in a bid last month. Macy's creditors -- the lenders and 
vendors that must approve a bankruptcy reorganization plan -- could force a 
merger by opting for the Federated plan. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Macy revised a bid it made in March by offering an additional $260 
million in stock purchase rights to unsecured creditors -- the bondholders and 
product suppliers that do not have pledges of collateral from the retailer. 
Under that new offer, Macy would be paying $3.93 billion of its total debt of 
$6 billion -- $100 million more than Federated. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy and Federated announced their revised terms shortly after the close of 
stock trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A third plan was submitted by Macy's bondholders. The bondholders have 
expressed dissatisfaction with the Macy and Federated proposals, contending 
that they would not receive adequate compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bondholders offered secured creditors the same terms contained in a 
proposal submitted last week but gave them the option of taking an additional 
$1.6 billion in cash instead of debt securities. In total, creditors would 
receive about $3.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Under their proposal, the bondholders would give up their $1.3 billion in 
claims in return for complete ownership of Macy.  
</P>
<P>
 Another possible player in the reorganization scramble -- Nomura Securities 
International Inc. -- had expressed interest in submitting a reorganization 
plan, but court-appointed mediator Cyrus R. Vance did not authorize such a bid 
Monday. Industry analysts said a Nomura proposal will not be considered in the 
negotiation process. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from Nomura met with Vance and some Macy bondholders last 
week. Nomura, a Japanese company with North American operations based in New 
York, indicated it could help pay creditors by issuing bonds that would be 
backed by Macy's real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy said it still expects to emerge from bankruptcy in January, 1995, three 
years after it entered Chapter 11 proceedings. Sources at Macy said they have 
the support of most of the major secured creditors -- among them Fidelity 
Investments, Swiss Bank Mortgages and Citibank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have worked diligently and successfully with all of our creditor groups in 
developing and enhancing the revised (proposal), which we firmly believe will 
result in a confirmable plan of reorganization," Macy Chairman Myron Ullman 
said. "The creditors' strong support reflects their endorsement of Macy's 
future and confidence in its potential value." 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, Macy -- operator of the Bullock's, I. Magnin and Macy's chains -- 
must get court approval for its reorganization plan. Vance will meet with 
creditors this week to discuss the rival plans.

SAUDIS SELECT AT&T TO PUT TOGETHER NEW SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 AT&T Corp. won a $4-billion, seven-year agreement to build an advanced digital 
communications network in Saudi Arabia, the company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T beat several rivals for the deal, including Northern Telecom Ltd., 
Siemens and L.M. Ericsson Telephone Co.Terms must still be finalized, but 
through 2000 the deal could add annual sales of about $600 million to the 
company, which had revenue last year of $65 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, President Clinton sent a letter to Saudi King Fahd that urged AT&T 
be chosen. Secretary of State Warren Christopher mentioned it in a visit to the 
king. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted that AT&T was selected to partner with the Saudis in their 
telecommunications expansion project," AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen said in a 
statement. He also thanked Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The AT&T executive in charge of the bid, Dan Hesse, said the company's rivals 
received similar support from their governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "With government procurement, support from the suppliers' government is always 
an important factor," Hesse, president of AT&T Network Systems International, 
said by phone from the Netherlands.  
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who has made two trips to Saudi Arabia in 
the past year, issued a statement saying the contract had "commanded top 
priority" at his department for the past eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract is to double Saudi Arabia's existing communications system 
capacity by the year 2000, creating 1.5 million digital lines as well as 
wireless systems.

NASD WANTS TO ADD LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS TO BULLETIN BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Securities Dealers said it plans to list limited 
partnerships on its electronic bulletin board to increase the amount of price 
information available on these thinly traded investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The OTC Bulletin Board, which is owned and operated by a subsidiary of the 
NASD, is designed to give price information on stocks too small or illiquid to 
trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market or any U.S. exchange. It provides more 
continuous information on small stocks than the "pink sheets," which are 
published once a day by the National Quotation Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 360 firms make markets in the more than 4,700 bulletin board stocks. 
The NASD's plan to add limited partnerships, which requires approval from the 
Internal Revenue Service, would make it easier for securities firms to get 
price information on partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD hopes to add limited partnerships to the bulletin board by the end of 
this year. But the timing depends largely on regulatory approvals that are 
beyond the NASD's control, said Charles Bennett, director of corporate finance 
at the self-regulatory organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there is no centralized market for limited partnerships, most of 
which are organized to invest in oil, gas, real estate or cable television. 
This makes them difficult to sell or value. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe that investors are in a position to get the best price for 
their securities," Bennett said. "It's a real fragmented market with not a lot 
of competition." 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD found only about two dozen firms that buy and sell partnership units 
in the secondary market. Of those, only seven are truly active in the area, 
Bennett said. By centralizing price information in one place, the NASD hopes to 
protect investors who need to sell because of a sudden change in personal 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an investor protection question and not an opportunity to build a 
new marketplace," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preserving the tax status of a limited partnership has been the key obstacle 
to forming an active secondary market for them.

 United Parcel Settles Bar Code Suit: Omniplanar Inc. said the big package 
delivery firm paid it an undisclosed sum after a jury found that UPS 
misappropriated the electronics research and development company's trade 
secrets. Omniplanar, based in Princeton, N.J., filed suit in federal court in 
September, 1991, alleging that UPS misappropriated its now-patented MaxiCode 
bar coding technology the year before. The firm's labels hold about 10 times 
more data than a conventional bar code in the same space.

 Microsoft Abandons Suggested Pricing: The Redmond, Wash.-based software maker 
said it will no longer publish suggested retail prices for its products.It said 
the move, effective July 1, will cover products sold in the United States and 
Canada. Industry analysts said Microsoft Corp.'s decision acknowledges 
pervasive discounting of computer software. "No one pays suggested retail price 
anymore," said Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie. "If you're a corporation, you 
get a discount or licensing deal. If you're a retail customer, you've got 
plenty of discount places to shop."

 Insilco to Sell Sinclair Paint: The agreement to sell for $51 million to Grow 
Group Inc. excludes some real estate assets.Insilco Corp., which emerged from 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, 1993, also said it has abandoned 
plans to sell two other units, Rolodex and Curtis Manufacturing Co. Proceeds 
from the Sinclair Paint Co. sale, which is expected to close by Aug. 1, will go 
toward reducing Insilco's debt. New York-based Grow Group is a producer of 
specialty chemical coatings and paints. Sinclair, whose principle market area 
is Southern California, operates about 50 stores, 13 of them company-owned. It 
had 1993 sales of about $95 million, or 16% of Insilco's consolidated sales of 
$165 million for the year.

 Oral Arguments Set in Proposition 103 Case: The California Supreme Court set a 
June 7 date for arguments in the case of 20th Century Insurance Co. 
vs.Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, a key step in the legal struggle over 
the 1988 insurance rollback initiative. The case is before the Supreme Court on 
Garamendi's appeal of a Superior Court judge's ruling that Garamendi lacked 
authority to impose a blanket 10% limit on insurers' profitability. The hearing 
date is the same as that of the primary election for governor, in which 
Garamendi faces state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, a fellow Democrat.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: FOES HOLD TOBACCO FIRMS' FEET TO FIRE; INDUSTRY'S 
WOES KICK ACTIVISTS INTO HIGH GEAR

 Every night after dinner, as Jolanta Pienczykowsi watched her father pull his 
pack of Kent cigarettes from his shirt pocket and light up, she had to hold 
back her tears. 
</P>
<P>
 She figured that smoking was slowly killing her dad -- as well as the rest of 
the family, which had to inhale the smoke secondhand. So Pienczykowsi, who was 
in high school at the time, created an anti-smoking poster with this warning 
about tobacco smoke: "If you can smell it, it may be killing you." 
</P>
<P>
 Her poster -- sponsored by the Coalition for a Smoke-Free America -- will 
begin appearing in New York subway cars this week, just one example of how 
anti-smoking activist groups have banded together to take advantage of a 
black-eyed tobacco industry that is reeling from a recent spate of terrible 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group, Women & Girls Against Tobacco, began posting anti-smoking ads 
in shopping malls throughout California last week. The ads read: "What has the 
tobacco industry done for women lately? Targeted them. Exploited them. Killed 
them. Don't be their next victim." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Boston-based consumer advocacy group Infact recently asked consumers 
to stop buying Philip Morris products such as Miller Beer and Oscar Mayer 
luncheon meats. It wants the tobacco giant to stop targeting children with ads 
featuring the Marlboro cowboy and costly promotions involving the Marlboro 
Adventure Team. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of recent events has kicked anti-smoking groups into high gear. A few 
weeks ago, congressional hearings saw the nation's most powerful tobacco 
executives staunchly insisting that nicotine is not addictive. Time magazine 
and the New York Times Sunday Magazine recently ran cover stories on the 
industry's headaches. And criticism continues to mount by those who say the Joe 
Camel caricature, which recently jumped from Camel ads to cigarette packs, is 
aimed at children. 
</P>
<P>
 Most anti-smoking activists recognize they might never again have such a 
readily available soapbox. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to strike while the cigarette is still hot," said Alvin Golin, 
chairman of the Chicago-based public relations firm Golin/Harris 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists recognize there is a certain synergy in their actions right now, 
said Katharine D. Paine, chief executive of Delahaye Group, a Portsmouth, 
N.H.-based corporate identity firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a national wave of concern, and the wave is starting to crest," said 
Regina Penna, project director for Berkeley-based Women & Girls Against 
Tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the current environment, "the timing of the boycott is 100% right," said 
Elaine Lamy, executive director of Infact. "This gives ordinary people 
something they can do to express their outrage." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, tobacco industry executives, who have long denied the clout of 
anti-smoking organizations, say they see no increased activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the activity I've seen is relatively confined to people who would fit 
in a small office," said Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based 
Tobacco Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Cherner, president of New York-based SmokeFree Educational Services Inc., 
is taking action on several fronts. In addition to posting Pienczykowsi's ads 
in subways this week, his group is buying space on Harlem bus shelters and 
purchasing radio spots. The group's most immediate goal is to eliminate smoking 
in all city-run public spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that the pendulum has swung in our direction," Cherner 
said. "If we don't succeed now, we'll never succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 But backlash may be on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep cautioning people that they have to be careful about the 
(anti-tobacco) message," Cherner said. "If it starts to sound preachy," some 
people will bend in the other direction and possibly become more sympathetic to 
an industry that is trying to position itself as unfairly under siege, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists point to one organized backlash being underwritten by the tobacco 
industry that could appear to be consumer-generated. Philip Morris is so 
concerned about smoking eventually being banned in places such as bars and 
restaurants that it is running print ads -- complete with a toll-free number -- 
that solicit consumer help in prompting businesses to establish smoking and 
non-smoking areas. 
</P>
<P>
 While this is an ideal time for the advocacy groups to speak up, they risk 
polarizing consumers if their messages do not stay focused, said Lynne Doll, 
executive vice president of the Los Angeles public relations firm Rogers & 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she said, secondhand smoke is an issue consumers can understand. 
"But if you get too many different anti-smoking messages out there, the public 
gets confused," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pienczykowsi, now a college senior, says the poster she created has already 
had an effect that made all her effort worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father has heeded the poster's warning and quit smoking. Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The $15.3-million account for the California Department of Health Service's 
anti-smoking campaign is expected to be awarded this week to one of two Los 
Angeles agencies: Stein Robaire Helm or Asher Gould Advertising. . . . Venice's 
hot newest ad shop, Group Zero, has picked up the estimated $5-million business 
for Carlsbad-based Cobra Golf Inc.'s line of King Cobra golf clubs. . . . The 
Los Angeles office of Hill & Knowlton has opened a new unit, Hill & Knowlton 
Hispanic Communications, which will handle Spanish-language public relations. . 
. . Durazo Communication and Imanda Wong Communications, which provide Latino 
and Asian marketing expertise, have announced a formal affiliation. . . . The 
Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women has endorsed a 
nationwide boycott of all Calvin Klein products to protest Calvin Klein ads 
that it says exploit children and equate extreme thinness with beauty.

TWO PLEAD GUILTY IN SALE OF BOGUS AIRCRAFT PARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two aircraft parts brokers and a Fontana company have pleaded guilty in 
connection with a scheme to sell fake engine parts for small private jets, 
federal authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokers -- executives at Ontario Air Parts in Fontana -- pleaded guilty to 
conspiring to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration and private aircraft 
companies by selling cheap, counterfeit jet engine liners from Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said James A. Fishback Sr., 60, and Earlene C. Christenson, 45, also 
acknowledged buying from now-defunct Dixon Aircraft Components worn military 
engine liners and illegally selling them for use on civilian jets. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea bargain entered in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, prosecutors 
said they will recommend sentences of six months in jail and a $250,000 fine 
for each defendant and a $250,000 fine against the company, which is owned by 
Fishback. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishback's attorney, Richard Sherman of Los Angeles, said the company is 
cooperating with the government investigation. "There have been some things 
that have not been properly handled," Sherman said. "They are not dangerous or 
dishonest people." 
</P>
<P>
 The brokers sold to six companies about 60 substandard engine liners for small 
jets capable of carrying up to 20 passengers, prosecutors said. Nearly all the 
liners have now been recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is serious because (defendants) circumvented the FAA scheme of 
regulation, which is designed to ensure that all civilian aircraft parts are up 
to specifications," said George B. Newhouse, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los 
Angeles. "There is a huge risk that these parts may fail in flight." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of federal safety checks was particularly significant in this case 
because engine liners are so important to a jet's operation, authorities said. 
The liners separate the extreme heat of fuel combustion from an engine's moving 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no airline crashes have been attributed to counterfeit parts in this 
country, the use of unapproved parts is seen by experts as a significant 
problem worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 An aging Norwegian charter plane crashed in 1989 in part because of 
unsanctioned parts, said Howard Aylesworth of the Aerospace Industries Assn. 
The crash killed 55 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, six small general aviation planes have crashed because 
of the failure of parts not approved by the FAA, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All airplanes are manufactured to very, very high tolerances of safety," 
Aylesworth said. "But unapproved parts compromise that margin of safety. They 
create an unknown safety condition." 
</P>
<P>
 However, FAA spokesman Joe Doubleday said he is unaware of the general 
aviation crashes cited by Aylesworth. He said counterfeit parts are a concern 
but have not proved to be a safety hazard, because so many backups are built 
into jet aircraft systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have found no crashes or equipment failure linked to parts sold 
by the brokers or refurbished by Dixon Aircraft, Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's convictions bring to 62 the number of such cases successfully 
prosecuted by federal authorities during the last two years, said Dennis Dutch, 
a top investigator at the Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Counterfeit parts were his office's top priority for the last two fiscal years 
because of a surge in complaints in 1991, Dutch said. Inquiries have resulted 
in 92 indictments nationwide. About 150 more cases remain active, he said.

HONDA TO BUILD ASSEMBLY PLANT IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Honda Motor Co. announced Monday that it will build a $50-million automotive 
assembly plant near Guadalajara to produce mid-size sedans for the growing 
Mexican market and possibly for future export to Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 The 250,000-square-foot plant, to be located next to an existing Honda 
motorcycle and auto parts factory, will build 15,000 Accord sedans annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican law requires companies to build cars in Mexico if they want to sell 
vehicles in the country. And while that law will be phased out within 10 years 
under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Mexican market is expected 
to grow substantially during that period -- and car makers already active in 
Mexico are likely to grab the largest market share. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honda expects this large market to continue to grow and looks forward to 
being part of the market," Yoshihide Munokuni, Honda's executive vice 
president, said in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico currently has five major auto producers: General Motors Corp., Ford 
Motor Co., Chrysler Corp., Nissan and Volkswagen. Several others, including BMW 
and Mercedes-Benz, are expected to build assembly plants there in the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600,000 vehicles are sold in Mexico annually. With the country's rising 
incomes and a burgeoning middle class, sales are expected to increase at 
double-digit rates. Mexico is also seen as a vital staging ground for exports 
to Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda said it will not export any vehicles made in Mexico to the United States 
or Canada. The company's auto plant in Ohio will provide technical and 
production support for the facility. Thirty jobs will be created in Ohio as a 
result, Honda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plant in Mexico is small by industry standards. It will employ 250 
workers and begin production in November, 1995, the company said. Honda is also 
studying the possibility of doubling annual capacity to 30,000 vehicles, which 
would boost the work force to 500.

COMPANY TOWN; MCA HOPES 'JURASSIC' CAN KEEP 3DO FROM EXTINCTION; TECHNOLOGY: 
THE INTERACTIVE GAME, BASED ON THE MOVIE, ARRIVES IN STORES TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The silhouetted Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton, the dramatic musical score, the 
massive advertising campaign splashing the red, yellow and black "Jurassic 
Park" logo everywhere. No, it's not a flashback to last summer. It's the launch 
of the 3DO video game version of MCA/Universal's mega-movie, which arrives in 
stores today. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the high-tech dinosaur film broke all box office records. This time 
around, MCA hopes "Jurassic Park Interactive" will help rescue 3DO, one of its 
high-profile multimedia investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the Hollywood darling of multimedia start-ups, 3DO -- of which MCA and 
parent Matsushita own a hefty chunk -- has been floundering since the launch of 
its game machine last fall, in part because of the dearth of good software to 
play on it. Investors are counting on "Jurassic," which was developed 
internally by 3DO, to boost sales of the Redwood City, Calif., company's 
"multiplayers," whose price tag was recently lowered to $500.  
</P>
<P>
 MCA's new interactive division, which is publishing the game as its first 
product, is also banking on its success to make a name for itself in the 
competitive field. 
</P>
<P>
 But other movies-turned-video games, such as "Cliffhanger" and "Dracula," have 
not been the instant hits studios expected. "Jurassic" is being released just 
as rival video game titans Sega and Nintendo gear up for a summer advertising 
blitz. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the 3DO version is the only one to use music and footage from the 
film, less-sophisticated "Jurassic" games are already available from Sega and 
Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
 Like 3DO itself, the "Jurassic" game may also suffer from overblown 
expectations. "People could be disappointed just because it's not the movie, 
because they're trying to compare it to something that cost $60 million and 
took 600 people over three years to make," worries 3DO game designer Greg 
Gorsiski. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rob Biniaz, who runs MCA's Universal Interactive Studios, says the game 
will succeed or fail based on its own quality, not how good the movie was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in Hollywood is grappling with this 'interactive movie' concept," 
Biniaz says. "It grows out of a feeling that making video games is beneath us, 
that we have to elevate it to an art form. Well I'm perfectly happy to say 
we're making video games here, and we know that what really counts is the game 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 On the video game scale, "Jurassic Interactive" was not low-budget. It cost 
between $1 million and $2 million and took about 10 people -- not all of them 
full-time -- 14 months to make. Nor is any expense being spared on the 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 A full-color manual accompanies the CD-ROM the game comes on, packaged in a 
sleek black box with the ubiquitous "Jurassic" logo emblazoned on the front. 
MCA's powerful home video and audio distribution unit is taking care of getting 
shelf space for the product. Biniaz won't say how much Universal Interactive is 
spending on the marketing campaign, but it's "a considerable sum." 
</P>
<P>
 In the game, the mission is to save five people trapped on an island off Costa 
Rica from hordes of genetically reconstituted velociraptors and the like. The 
goal, says Gorsiski, is "not to shoot up 17,000 T. rexes and rack up 100 
million points," but to "feel the adrenaline that you felt when you were 
watching the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurassic Interactive" is expected to sell for about $55. But between the U.S. 
and Japanese markets, only about 70,000 households have purchased 3DO players. 
Game producers often increase their sales volume by converting their games to 
other formats, but MCA has no plans to do that with "Jurassic." While that may 
be an effort to support 3DO, Gorsiski says it would also be difficult to 
rewrite the game for another platform, because so much of it takes advantage of 
the 3DO technology aimed at enhancing game play. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorsiski, who has designed seven other games, is just glad it's over.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do," he says. "How do you rewrite a 
linear story for a non-linear environment and make it better? It's a task that 
a lot of game designers wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole."

COMPANY TOWN; TIMES MIRROR PLANS CABLE NETWORK FEATURING OUTDOOR SPORTS 
ACTIVITIES; MEDIA: WITH SHOWS ON HIKING AND FISHING, THE OUTDOOR LIFE CHANNEL 
WILL DRAW UPON THE COMPANY'S MAGAZINE RESOURCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first major programming initiative, Times Mirror Co. said Monday that 
it plans to launch a new cable TV network called the Outdoor Life Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror, which owns the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers and 
magazines, said the cable TV network will be launched in 1995 and draw upon the 
resources of its six outdoor life magazines, including Field & Stream, Ski 
Magazine and Yachting. 
</P>
<P>
 The new channel, the first venture from the newly formed Times Mirror 
Programming Co., aims to take advantage of digital compression technology that 
will greatly expand the number of channels available to cable TV subscribers. 
The current bottleneck in channel capacity has stymied the plans for dozens of 
new cable TV channels targeted at niche audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Outdoor Life Channel, which is designed to appeal to difficult-to-reach 
male viewers, will feature shows on outdoor sports such as fishing, hiking and 
camping. It will also offer environmental and children's programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror, which owns the country's 10th-largest cable TV operator, said 
the Outdoor Life Channel will be carried by the company's 1.3 million cable TV 
subscribers, including those served by Dimension Cable in Orange County.

CULTURE; DEATH OF SPEEDING STAR PAINS A NATION LOOKING FOR HEROES; AYRTON 
SENNA'S FATAL CRASH SHATTERED BRAZIL, FUELING ANGER AND SADNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAC MARGOLIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Covered in rose petals, their faces painted funereal black, hundreds of 
thousands of Brazilians bade farewell last week to Ayrton Senna, the Formula 
One driver who crashed and died on the racetrack at the Grand Prix at Imola, 
Italy. Senna was buried in tomb No. 11 at Sao Paulo's Morumbi Cemetery to a 
21-gun salute and honors normally reserved for a head of state. 
</P>
<P>
 And no wonder. In life, he was Brazil's, and probably the world's, ablest race 
car driver, who took the sport to new limits. In death, he seems destined for 
even grander things -- for the Brazil that mourned his passing and poured into 
the streets to get a last look at his coffin lost not only a champion, but a 
part of its soul. It was as though Senna, who was 34, had left behind not only 
a grief-stricken family, a desolate girlfriend and an armoire full of trophies, 
but 150 million orphans. 
</P>
<P>
 Papers bellowed his passing. A three-day period of mourning was declared. 
Perhaps half a million mourners watched his coffin pass by in the largest 
funeral procession Sao Paulo had ever seen. Senna is now a postage stamp, a 
logo, a cartoon. Several avenues and racetracks have been renamed for him. 
Dozens of newborn Ayrtons were baptized. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of an idol, especially by sudden death, can stagger any nation, but 
the way each people mourns also tells much about the national character. The 
emotion that washed over Brazil at Senna's death showed a society at once 
fractured and galvanized by grief. Men of industry stood shoulder to shoulder 
with domestic workers to wave goodby as his coffin passed. University students 
wept alongside bricklayers. It was not simply passion that bonded Brazilians at 
this moment but something deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country of brutal contrasts, where the poor see opulence every day but 
may not share in it, the belief in idols can be a balm for the bruises of 
misery and want. Achievers like soccer immortal Pele, or the Olympic gold medal 
volleyball team, or the TV star Xuxa, are worshiped not merely for their 
individual triumphs but because their achievements are public goods, annexed by 
the entire nation. After all, Brazil, says anthropologist Roberto DaMatta, is 
"an enchanted nation." In this way, Senna was not just a champion but a medium. 
He and his racing machine transported Brazil to some higher, richer plane. 
</P>
<P>
 All last week in Brazil was a time of anguish, puzzlement and tears. But there 
were more violent passions raging as well. If countries can be said to have 
self-esteem, the death of Senna shattered Brazil's. Many fell into depression 
or shock. One woman in Curitiba committed suicide and left a note that she was 
"going to join Senna." Others lashed out in fury, throwing invective at the 
wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "You! Indecent people," bellowed Edgar de Mello Filho, director of the 
Interlagos racetrack in Sao Paulo, speaking on nationwide television of Formula 
One officials. The veins in his temples bulged. "Until when are you going to 
keep on killing drivers?" 
</P>
<P>
 Such outrage, though compelling, misses the point. Formula One is a sport 
cherished not only for speed and precision but also for danger. The risk, the 
peril are part of the attraction, maybe the centerpiece of Grand Prix. Defying 
death is what spectators want to see, and why sponsors sponsor it. If Formula 
One were risk-free, would anyone bother to watch? What would be left of boxing 
without bodies crashing to the canvas? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Brazil was nursing injury to its soul last week, and to suggest a more 
dispassionate explanation was to whisper in a gale. "Murderers!" Mello Filho 
howled. "See if you can sleep at night." Some commentators went even further. 
"We are now being expelled from Formula One, a sport for the rich of the First 
World," wrote Villas-Boas Correa, the normally understated columnist for the 
Jornal do Brasil. Senna, by Correa's logic, had been Brazil's and the Third 
World's great dark hope, Caliban's revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Senna spoiled the party for the rich." Not only was Senna murdered, he died 
at the hands of venal capitalists, "a sacrifice on the altar of modernity," who 
got mere "scraps of profits" for running dire risks, said another newspaper 
columnist. And it was not just any capitalists who did Senna in, it was the 
imperialists. "A field hand for a multinational," anthropologist Regina Abreu 
called him. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Senna, the son of a wealthy Sao Paulo landed family, was one 
of the richest athletes in the world, who got that way by skillfully 
negotiating with the sponsors. He plastered his pilot's suit, helmet and car 
with that collage of logos and brand names because of a deal, not servitude. 
Part of the rage was understandable. What else but crime or conspiracy could 
account for such a cosmic injustice? But some deeper malady was mobilizing 
Brazil, one that renders the nation as the imagined victim of the designs of 
others. Even President Itamar Franco showed some of the symptoms. "Since the 
beginning of (Portuguese) occupation, we have had to live with injustice," he 
wrote in an op-ed piece. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many, perhaps most, of the mourners were not even Formula One fans. Many 
probably had no special feelings for Ayrton Senna before he died. More than a 
few, Senna's former rival, Nelson Piquet, told Veja magazine, looked on 
precisely to gawk at the "spectacular accidents" that claimed his life. In 
fact, for years Senna was best remembered for his feuds with the press, his 
moodiness and the barbs he traded with rivals. Hardly a man of the people, 
Senna was private, introspective and something of a mystic, who closed his eyes 
and put both palms on his car before each race. But time endeared Senna to his 
fans -- time and trophies. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a winner, and Brazil has precious few winners these days. There are 
plenty of leaders, but they are hardly a reliable category. When they are 
remembered at all, it is for their misdeeds, mainly helping themselves to 
taxpayers' money. The last time Brazilians rallied by the hundreds of 
thousands, it was to be rid of a president, Fernando Collor de Mello, found by 
Congress to have commanded his own kickback and influence-peddling scheme. Then 
they learned that some of those same righteous congressmen had had their own 
hands in the till. Senna, by contrast, was an honest journeyman hero. "He was 
the right kind of hero. He worked for what he won," said anthropologist 
DaMatta, a longtime student of the national psyche. "He was the Brazilian 
miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the miracle. There it is again. It is as if Brazil's morass -- inflation, 
crime, corruption -- is an ordained infliction. Such conditions require a 
miracle, and miracles are the ouevre of heroes, not humans. Life can make 
champions, but only death, tragic death, can manufacture a mythic hero. Senna, 
the man, the driver, was admired. The late Senna, the martyr, is adulated. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was something disturbing in the outpouring of tears and rage. Does 
it take death (or an impeachment, or a corruption scandal) to fill the streets 
and bring out the bonds of solidarity and national pride? Anthropologist 
DaMatta says no, that the desire for victory is there, dormant, and that even a 
tiny miracle -- an honest pol? a World Cup? -- could awaken it. Yet a 
quarter-century has gone by since Brazil's last World Cup title, the last time 
the whole country hoisted flags and wept for a victory, not defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Brazil seems alloyed more by frustration and loss. "We live a 
nationalism of tragedy more than of triumph," writes Marcelo Coelho in the 
Folha de Sao Paulo. "Everyone comes together in the sense of a tragic Brazil." 
Listen to Marcelo Pontes, a senior political observer: "A tragedy was necessary 
to show that loving (Senna), Brazilians love even more strongly themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this necromancy is moving, but it may ultimately do disservice to 
Brazil's latest champion-turned-legend. In most societies, anthropologist 
Claude Levi-Strauss once wrote, the living strike a pact with the dead. They 
pay homage to the deceased in certain predictable rituals, say a wake or a 
funeral, and in turn the dead agree to stay where they are and not to cause the 
rest of us grief or nightmare. In other societies, we living will not let go. 
Rather, we "conscript the dead," to appropriate their powers, sometimes by 
eating them, or else more symbolically, in politer societies "where the people 
must continually summon the dead to their rescue." 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, as always, things are not so simple. It is as if they want to have 
Senna rest in peace and eat him too. His coffin was lowered in the Morumbi 
Cemetery last Thursday, and the nation said a heart-rending goodby. But Senna's 
mission -- as hero, example and healer -- had just begun.

NATIONAL AGENDA; INDIA OPENS UP THE ROAD TO BUSINESS; THE GOVERNMENT IS 
PURSUING FOREIGN INVESTORS AND TEARING DOWN REGULATORY BARRIERS. AT LAST, 
EXPORTING IS HONORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 P. S. Puri has a dream, one of the millions of ambitious visions energizing 
India's economy these days. It's about a motorbike, parcels and pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 Puri's company, Hero Motors, manufactures a 65-cc two-stroke motorbike, the 
Hero Puch, originally developed in Austria. Exports numbered just 400 in 1991, 
but overseas sales last year climbed to 24,000, almost a third of Hero's total 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior general manager for finance, Puri now has his eye on the American 
market. The Indian-produced bike, he thinks, would be ideal for express-service 
couriers weaving through mid-town Manhattan, or deliverymen carrying pizzas in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hero Puches already zip along roads in Buenos Aires, Istanbul, Tehran and 
Stockholm. Puri thinks Hero could sell 20,000 Puches in America each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually the whole world is our market," says Puri, bubbling with 
enthusiasm. He is bullish not just about the jaunty two-wheeler that gets more 
than 210 miles to the gallon but about India too. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, the world's most populous country after China has 
been undergoing what a New Delhi-based diplomat calls economic "revolution by 
stealth." 
</P>
<P>
 The government's regulatory straitjacket has been shredded, freeing 
entrepreneurs from most of the regulations exercised by haughty babus in 
government offices. And, for the first time in India, foreign investors are 
being eagerly wooed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much remains to be done, making India's economic reforms better known 
to Americans should be a leitmotif of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao's 
first official visit to the United States, which is scheduled to begin Saturday 
. 
</P>
<P>
 After functioning for more than four decades as a virtual economic island, 
whose share of world trade fell three years ago to just 0.5%, India and its 
business elite are hustling to cut themselves a bigger niche beyond their 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Exporting has never been more honored. It was announced a few days ago that 
the Ministry of Home Affairs hopes to hawk abroad the tear gas shells it uses 
to disperse protesters at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The dreams of capitalist entrepreneurs are supplanting the old ideals 
personified by the aristocratic Jawaharlal Nehru, independent India's first 
prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "At present, there are two groups of people in the world," Nehru said in 1936. 
"Out of these two groups, I have no doubt that our country will side with that 
group which stands for independence and socialism." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Nehru would be only half right. Socialism, one joke goes, has been 
supplanted by "Sonyism" -- the lust for televisions, videocassette recorders 
and the other good things that accompany a modern, upscale lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that India is a long way from -- and will probably never reach -- 
true laissez-faire economics. The honors paid Nehru and other fighters for 
Indian independence, the ascetic Mohandas K. Gandhi foremost among them, have 
kept politicians in Rao's government from baldly declaring that "to be rich is 
glorious," as Deng Xiaoping did in turning China's economy outward. But the 
implication seems to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A visitor can best see the changes in this bustling, jarring city on the 
Arabian Sea that is the palpitating heart of Indian business and finance. On 
the streets now are placards that say "America's No. 1 engine oil now in India 
-- Pennzoil" and "Buy now, pay later -- Citibank Card." 
</P>
<P>
 At Bombay's airport, East-West Airlines, Jet Airways and other private 
carriers now compete with state-owned Indian Airways for domestic travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 As India, starting in June, 1991, has lowered its tariff walls, liberalized 
investment rules for foreigners and allowed non-Indians to fully own businesses 
in most sectors -- and implemented other changes -- outsiders have gotten 
excited. In April, India signed the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of the 
General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade, reaffirming its commitment to 
integrate itself into the global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Till about two years back, we were basically an insular country, looking 
inwards rather than outwards," says Arvind N. Kolhatkar, executive director of 
the Bombay Stock Exchange. "When India started opening up, the rest of the 
world realized the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 A little number-crunching shows how great the potential is. India has a total 
population of about 800 million people. There is a "middle class" estimated at 
150 million to 250 million people, who can afford at least some brand-name 
products such as laundry detergent or a dress shirt.  
</P>
<P>
 Indians constitute the third-largest pool of engineering talent in the world, 
it is estimated, and they work in the world's 10th-largest industrial economy. 
Its labor force is larger than the entire U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most sectors, you should be marketing to India now," John S. Wood, U.S. 
commercial consul in Bombay, tells visiting American executives. "In most 
sectors, if you don't have a presence here in 20, 30 years, you won't be 
considered a global player." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Jardine Fleming India Securities Private Ltd., the company was not ready 
for the onrush of foreign capital as the government liberalized the rules for 
foreign investment last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to have 20 research analysts, brokers, etc.," director Rafiq 
Dossani recalls. "We expected $200 million in business in the whole year. In 
just six months, $1.3 billion came in." 
</P>
<P>
 Licensing requirements have been abolished for most industries, except arms 
and munitions, aircraft and warships, atomic energy, coal and lignite (all 
still reserved for the government sector), drugs and pharmaceuticals, consumer 
electronics and a few other items. 
</P>
<P>
 Although domestic and foreign investors no longer have to apply for a 
manufacturing license, they still have to fill out mountains of forms about 
their intentions and details of production, along with requests for customs 
clearance and for power, water and telephone hookups. 
</P>
<P>
 An old joke, therefore, still has currency: There are two ways of making money 
in India -- managing your business or managing the government. 
</P>
<P>
 As India attempts to transform itself, both its people and outsiders are 
asking what role it will play in the modern world. Will it be the next Asian 
economic "tiger" growing by ferocious leaps and bounds? Or is the slow-moving 
elephant a more apt metaphor? 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who puts money into India expecting massive change in the next few 
years will be disappointed," cautions Jardine Fleming's Dossani, who holds a 
doctorate in finance from Northwestern University in Illinois. "India should 
have 5% to 6% growth rates for the rest of the decade." 
</P>
<P>
 For many Indians, used to the "permit raj (rule)," where the government 
decided which company could make what, freedom will hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be painful for everybody," predicts Parag Parikh, chairman of a 
Bombay-based stock brokerage and financial advisory service. "Everybody is 
going to have to change." 
</P>
<P>
 For the business person, India is at once a country of staggering promise and 
one of dizzyingly high obstacles. Educated talent is cheap in most fields. "I 
can hire 20 chartered accountants for the price of an analyst in Hong Kong or 
the U.S.," Dossani notes. But if wages are low, he says, so is industrial 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Painfully conscious of China's dazzling success, Indians know they started 
their reforms much later but believe they have long-term advantages. Among 
them: a cumbersome, maddeningly slow but ultimately independent judiciary. And 
accounting rules that conform to accepted Western standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, Indians say proudly, their country is a democracy, with the 
long-term stability that government by consent of the governed implies. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the need for Prime Minister Rao and his courtly finance minister, 
Manmohan Singh, to build popular consensus for the reforms handcuffs India's 
government in terms of how fast it can promulgate change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The enthusiasm that had been here for mass-scale privatization -- throwing 
people out of work, closing factories -- has been somewhat torpedoed by what 
happened in Poland and Russia," says Nair Radhakrishnan, deputy editor of 
Business India magazine. "The PM is now talking about 'the middle way.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although foreign business involvement in India has soared, the curve has shot 
upward dramatically because the starting point was low. Last year, two-way 
U.S.-Indian trade was a record $7.2 billion, but American trade with much 
smaller Malaysia was twice that.  
</P>
<P>
 In textiles and apparel, its strongest export suit, India exported more than 
$1 billion to the United States, but the Chinese shipped five times that. 
</P>
<P>
 As impressive as the sudden flow of foreign capital to the Bombay Stock 
Exchange and other equity markets was, Indonesia attracted several times more. 
Foreign direct investment of nearly $3.8 billion over the last three years was 
a fraction of what China and the nations of Southeast Asia received. 
</P>
<P>
 Other signs of the prudent approach: Despite the Rao-Singh reforms that 
curtailed India's long obsession with import substitution -- building domestic 
industries to eliminate the cost and job-destroying effect of imports -- 
bringing in consumer goods is still barred. And, as Radhakrishnan notes, the 
backlash that followed "shock therapy" in the former Soviet bloc helped brake 
the selling off of state-held companies here, if the process is going forward 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 By one estimate, only 100 to 150 of India's state-owned companies are 
profitable while twice as many run in the red. 
</P>
<P>
 In line with Gandhi's promotion of hand-spinning yarn as the "salvation" for 
India's masses, officials still consider it their business to bar companies 
from firing workers. Any dismissals from a firm employing more than 100 people 
require approval of the state government, which is usually loath to grant it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When business cycles occur, you need the right to adjust your work force, to 
retrench, to reorganize," says Keshub Mahindra, chairman of auto maker Mahindra 
& Mahindra. "Ultimately it's a matter for negotiations between us and the labor 
unions. Who in the hell are you, government, to come in and tell us what to 
do?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the rules of Indian economics change, the salty-tongued Mahindra and other 
Indian industrial barons are worried about being snapped up or driven out of 
business by multinationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the "Bombay Club" because of a working lunch they held at a posh Bombay 
club, these moguls are now asking Rao and Singh to give them time to adapt to 
new conditions. That should also keep the reforms moving at an elephant's pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not afraid of competition," Mahindra says. "But we want a level 
playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 That means giving India's industries a freer hand to hire and fire, like their 
global competitors. Mahindra, its chairman notes, needed 12,000 employees to 
turn out 33,000 tractors and 49,000 Jeeps, trucks and small trucks last year, 
while Maruti, a newer Indian company tied in with Suzuki of Japan, produced 
130,000 vehicles with 5,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 His company shows the potential and problems of Indian industry in a nutshell. 
Licensed to produce the Jeep in India and the country's largest tractor 
manufacturer, it also got into oil drilling and business supplies because the 
Monopoly Act barred its growth in its core business. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of limits on imports, Mahindra was basically on its own: "In years 
gone by in our business, we made the whole damn thing -- engine, axles, body -- 
the whole damn lot. The government compelled you to make every damn thing 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Bombay industrialist, the world has truly changed. He has sold off the 
drilling and supplies firms to concentrate on making vehicles and tractors. He 
is talking with Chrysler about producing the Jeep Cherokee in India and perhaps 
bolting Mahindra's diesel engines and transmissions onto imported frames and 
bodies.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And, like other Indian business leaders, he has stopped focusing solely on the 
domestic market and dreams of a piece of the international action. His company 
is looking at the possibility of exporting tractors to the United States and 
has decided to set up a sales network there. 
</P>
<P>
 Many questions about India's potential remain unanswered, not least how the 
country can modernize its economy and become a major world player while nearly 
half its people are illiterate and a good one-third live below the poverty 
line.  
</P>
<P>
 In the opinion of economists and business leaders, much remains to be done 
before the planned and controlled economy built up under Nehru in the 1950s is 
sloughed off. Still in the future: cutting and rationalizing taxes; further 
industrial de-licensing and trade liberalization; deregulating the financial 
sector to allow foreign investment in banking and insurance, and a new 
hiring-and-firing policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's infrastructure, including roads, ports, telecommunications and 
power, is also sorely inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Bombay and other cities' business circles, there is an unquestionable 
climate of optimism caused by the shelving of old ideals that, however noble, 
failed to end misery in India, and by government's abandonment of the role of 
sole planner and regulator of industry and business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 10 years down the line, if things go the way they are changing, India 
will be a power to be reckoned with," predicts Parikh, the stockbroker. "Once 
we can go full speed, the West will have stiff competition from India, because 
our growth was curtailed in the past." Outgoing Economy India's exports 
increased faster than imports in the 1980s, but it still imports more than it 
exports.

 The 47th annual Cannes Film Festival opens Thursday on the French Riviera with 
a low U.S. profile. Few major studio films or top American stars will be on 
hand this year, and the excuses vary.

<P>
 Some reports say the American filmmakers are retaliating for the French 
government's success in having the entertainment industry excluded from 
protection under world trade rules, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
Explanations from Hollywood argue that participation at Cannes has become too 
expensive, or that this year's top films will not be ready in time for 
screening there. 
</P>

 The handful of U.S. entries will include independent productions, low-budget

 Bargaining to the last moment, Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization finally put pen to paper last Wednesday, signing the agreement to 
bring self-rule to Jericho and the Gaza Strip.It was the first step in what 
Palestinians hope will become a wider homeland, perhaps a state.

<P>
 The long road to the peace agreement and practical self-rule ended in Cairo, 
where the signing ceremony took place. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin represented the two parties. But deployment of PLO 
officials was off to a slow start by Monday.

BRIEFING PAPER; MIDEAST SPOTLIGHT SHIFTING TO GOLAN; THE BACKGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT and MICHAEL PARKS / TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the barriers surmounted in achieving the first Israeli-Palestinian 
peace pact last week, the next round of Middle East peace talks -- budding 
negotiations between mortal enemies Israel and Syria -- looms as a more 
difficult and perhaps more important step in the search for peace in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 The American role is also likely to be far more demanding than in the 
Israeli-Palestinian talks, which proceeded largely without the good offices of 
the United States. The new shuttle diplomacy of Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher between Jerusalem and Damascus also represents the Clinton 
Administration's most ambitious full-fledged venture into the world's most 
volatile region. 
</P>
<P>
 The rewards for all three parties are, thus, potentially far greater. But so 
are the risks, Israeli and American analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geopolitically, there's much more to be gained with an Israeli-Syrian peace, 
which will set in motion a series of regional changes," said Geoffrey Kemp, a 
former National Security Council staff member in the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. "Because of Syrian involvement elsewhere and its alliances, 
problems like Lebanon or Iranian terrorism on Israel's borders will effectively 
be resolved, while U.S. strategy in the region will be immeasurably helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Peace between Syria and Israel would effectively end the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, since there is little chance of a serious war without Syria's 
involvement, several analysts said. And a formal pact could reap benefits as 
far as North Africa and the Persian Gulf, perhaps fostering new regional 
economic arrangements and isolating extremist regimes in places such as 
Baghdad, Tripoli and Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as the new round of diplomacy begins, a senior Administration source is 
forecasting rough times. "There will be breakdowns," he said. "It's predictable 
and people will say we failed. We'll have to be prepared to take the heat." 
</P>
<P>
 On several levels, the next phase of Middle East peace efforts will be 
different. The Parties 
</P>
<P>
 Syria, a state almost 10 times the size of Israel, has much more leverage than 
the Palestine Liberation Organization. Syria and Israel share a strategic 
border, while the PLO has not even had a reliable front-line position since it 
was forced to abandon southern Lebanon in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Syrian President Hafez Assad has an authoritarian hold on power and 
decision-making, while PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's leadership has been 
dissipating by challenges from moderate, leftist and Islamic forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PLO had no bargaining chips and its internal weakness forced it to give 
in to Israeli demands," said Talcott Seelye, former U.S. ambassador to Syria. 
"But Assad, as much as he may now want peace, is in a stronger position to hold 
out for his terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Assad is also unwilling to 
take the kind of steps necessary to persuade the Israeli people that he is 
committed to peace. In 1977, Sadat flew to Israel and addressed the Knesset, 
the Israeli Parliament, a gesture that opened the way for the Camp David peace 
talks and the return of the Sinai Peninsula. The Issues 
</P>
<P>
 The agenda is theoretically simpler. The centerpiece is a land-for-peace deal 
that would return the Golan Heights, occupied since 1967, to Syria in exchange 
for peace and security for Israel. But the swap is far from straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golan is of great strategic value to both Israel and Syria. "It's not like 
the Sinai," the Administration official said. "It's much harder to use it or 
develop it as a buffer zone in the way the Sinai was between Egypt and Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 A long history of distrust must also be overcome before Israel returns any 
territory. For almost 20 years, Syrian gunners perched on the Golan shelled the 
kibbutzim around the Sea of Galilee below. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's most bitter enemies also fought bloody battles in 1967 and 1973 
on the craggy heights. And the Golan is now home to about 15,000 Jewish 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think our government can accept the Assad approach and give back all 
of the Golan Heights," said former military commander Ori Orr, now chairman of 
the powerful Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and a confidante of 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting a widespread Israeli view, Orr added: "Israel is not ready for such 
a withdrawal. There is just no trust of Assad here, and it will take a 
considerable amount of time to develop it." 
</P>
<P>
 The second basis of distrust has been Assad's use of Lebanon and political 
surrogates, from Palestinian rejectionists to the Islamic Hezbollah militia, to 
pressure Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Any deal on the Golan, thus, also must include fairly explicit guarantees 
about Syria's long-term regional intentions, notably in Lebanon, where Syria 
has tens of thousands of troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the terrorist operations in Lebanon depend on Syria, on Assad personally. 
. . . Assad may talk peace, but we will look to see what he does in Lebanon to 
assess whether he can be believed," Orr said. The Process 
</P>
<P>
 Although Israel is suggesting a three-stage withdrawal over five to eight 
years, the real scope of the talks is all or nothing -- not incremental like 
the Israel-PLO accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about an interim agreement," a senior Administration 
official involved in the process said. "The parties have focused on end results 
of the negotiations rather than putting it off until later. Syria is insisting 
on full agreement on the Golan Heights, while Israel is looking for a full 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the change in Syrian and Israeli leaders' attitudes toward peace, the 
process will require a massive shift in public opinion in both countries. The 
Mediators 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the PLO managed their own negotiations, first in secret in Oslo, 
then in public in several venues. The Israelis were quite pleased to have done 
it themselves. When Christopher was invited to witness the Cairo signing last 
week, a leading Israeli commentator remarked that "it was a celebratory 
photo-op adding some rouge to his pale foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Key Israelis would also prefer direct talks with Damascus. For months, Israel 
sought a secret link, first in contacts between the Israeli and Syrian 
ambassadors to Washington, then by Israeli and Syrian military strategists 
meeting in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assad wants Washington drawn in, first to mediate a framework for talks 
and eventually to guarantee the final terms. American involvement also 
ultimately would pay off on one of the biggest incentives for Syrian 
participation: a better relationship with the world's most powerful country. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Israelis also want an American presence. "Without the United States, and 
Warren Christopher personally, I don't expect we will make much, if any, 
progress with Syria," Yossi Beilin, deputy Israeli foreign minister and the 
guiding hand of the Oslo link, said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials also would prefer direct talks. "It would be better if they 
would talk between themselves," the senior Administration official said. 
"That's one way to make it enduring. But for better or worse, we are now in the 
middle of the Syrian-Israeli deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States would gain politically, economically and militarily 
from a peace agreement, failure also could be a disaster for the Clinton 
Administration. This is the first major initiative it is guiding from the 
start, and it will be unable to blame previous Presidents, if it falls apart.

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT: GREECE GIVES EU A BUMPY RIDE; MANY

<P>
 Greece, the current president of the European Union, is being sued by the 
other 11 members. What's going on in this normally cozy club? The manager has 
been breaking team rules, and the players are furious. 
</P>
<P>
 They are aghast at the Greek economic blockade of its landlocked neighbor, 
recognized by the United Nations and the United States as the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia but proclaimed by the 2 million people of the little 
country as simply Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the word that is inflaming Greek passions, touching deep nationalistic 
chords. Greece insists it holds the copyright on the name Macedonia and all 
related symbols and history. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the biggest -- but just one -- of the problems Athens is having with 
its EU partners. The Greeks, for instance, are also noisily feuding with 
Albania, another Balkan neighbor. They are friendlier with land-hungry Serbia 
than their European allies would like, and the Greeks scarcely draw breath in 
their longstanding campaign of insult against Turkey, its next-door neighbor 
and partner in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much of a manager, and not much of a partner either, other members of the 
European rich man's club are saying. 
</P>
<P>
 In many European capitals, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, EU 
president for the first half of this year, is often considered more 
troublemaker than leader. Other EU members have made it clear that they 
consider Greek Angst over the newly independent country that calls itself 
Macedonia to be gratuitous and destabilizing in the Balkan caldron. 
</P>
<P>
 The Papandreou government's truculence at being hauled by its peers before the 
EU's Court of Justice in Luxembourg is symptomatic of Greece's troubles in 
meshing with the rest of Europe. By nearly every statistical measure -- 
personal income to national inflation to government deficit -- Greece is the 
worst off of Europe's dozen. Like its alphabet, Greece is different from the 
rest of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The EU's legal action against its partner -- essentially accusing Greece of a 
major breach of the union's founding treaty -- is unprecedented. After two 
months of stern warnings and a brief, futile attempt at mediation, the EU's 
executive commission decided last month that legal action was the only way to 
end the Greek blockade of the former Yugoslav republic on its northern border. 
</P>
<P>
 EU treaties forbid any member country from closing its borders unless there is 
a threat of war -- a set of circumstances the EU claims doesn't exist in this 
case. But Athens disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Greeks are saying there's a threat of war because they're the ones doing 
the threatening," explained a commission official familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In late April, the case landed at the Court of Justice, where jurists are 
considering whether to issue a preliminary injunction that would require Greece 
to lift the blockade, at least temporarily. Imposed without warning in 
February, the blockade is squeezing hard on the economy of the little republic. 
The lawsuit is scant solace to the Macedonians: A final ruling on the EU's case 
could take years. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly and privately, the Europeans are sulfurous at what they see as Greek 
disdain for international law. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
complained of blockade measures that "in our view are illegal and certainly 
harm the reputation and the authority of Greece." German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel denounced the blockade as "counter to the normal behavior expected 
between civilized European nations." 
</P>
<P>
 A Dutch official was even more pungent: "Actions like that make you wonder if 
they really belong here (in the EU)." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all opinions are so harsh about Greece, which holds the rotating 
presidency through the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greece may be a burr in Europe's saddle, but it is an important member of 
democratic Europe," commented one senior Western diplomat. "In fact, it is more 
European than it was even a few years ago, closer to the rest in dress, 
consumer goods and habits. At the same time, though, it is Byzantine -- and 
Greek." 
</P>
<P>
 Membership in the union, which came in 1981 in the Socialist Papandreou's 
first government, has turned out to be a boon for Greece: It brings billions in 
aid; it is reinforcement for Greece's democratic institutions, and it confers 
major-league status on a nation of 10 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a rising tide of Balkan nationalism that has accompanied the 
Macedonian crisis, the Greeks, like their government, seem content with their 
place in Europe. "We are in Europe to stay. We believe in Europe," says 
Telemachus Hytiris, the prime minister's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Events have persuaded a fair number of influential Europeans, though, that 
Greece is out of step and that it has scant prospects of picking up the pace. 
Is it a fair judgment? 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters early this year, Theodoros Pangalos, Greek minister for 
European affairs, lamented what he described as a European bias against Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 "First there is a slightly racist view of those who are too Southern or too 
Eastern, who are viewed as different. Second, it is our economic status, which 
we must take care to address, especially the huge public debt and the budget 
deficit. Third is the Skopje (Macedonia) issue. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Macedonia, as a pregnant case in point, has forced an issue on Europe that 
matters only to the Greeks. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that the new republic's name, emblems, national systems and 
constitution signal expansionist designs against the northern Greek province of 
Macedonia. Greece calls the new republic simply Skopje, after its capital city, 
or even Fyrom (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, its U.N. name).  
</P>
<P>
 In Washington last month, President Clinton urged a visiting Papandreou to 
lift the embargo. Papandreou listed conditions: the Macedonian flag being 
stripped of its sun symbol, which Greeks hold as a national icon identified 
with Alexander the Great, and some articles being stricken from the Macedonian 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Macedonia says everything can be negotiated, but only after the blockade is 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the drama plays on. Says Greek nationalist Lakis Lazopoulos, a 
well-known entertainer: 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we poor and small? Yes, we are. But I know what I am and who I am, and I 
didn't say I was somebody else. . . . Europeans don't like us because we are 
the people who say no. We have a different character."

A MATTER OF NAMES AND FLAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dispute between Greece and Macedonia centers largely on Greek demands that 
the former Yugoslav republic change its name and stop using certain national 
symbols claimed exclusively by Greece. Among those symbols is the Macedonian 
flag, which features a yellow sunburst on a field of red. 
</P>
<P>
 Athens maintains that Macedonia's refusal to comply with its demands reflects 
Slavic claims to parts of historic Macedonia, a large portion of which is now 
the northern Greek province of Macedonia. Fearing future claims on its 
territory, Greece has sought to further the distinction between its province 
and its new neighbor, which declared its independence in September of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to resolve the dispute, the European Union suggested the country 
adopt the name "Slavic Republic of Macedonia," a suggestion both countries 
quickly rejected. The United Nations, meanwhile, has admitted Macedonia under 
the provisional name "Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia," or FYROM.

MEDIA; AMERICANS TEACH ALBANIA A LESSON IN FREE PRESS; FOR THEIR EFFORTS, 
THEY'VE BEEN KICKED OFF CAMPUS, DENOUNCED ON NATIONAL TV AND BECOME A CAUSE 
CELEBRE.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three young Americans from Columbia University decided last year to start up a 
student newspaper, not too unusual except this one is in Albania, a place once 
so secluded it was known as a hermit nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tirana, the Albanian capital, wasn't trendy like Prague, where legions of 
young Americans assembled after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc, including 
journalists who found work for English-language papers. Impoverished and cut 
off from the world for 41 years by a brutal Stalinist dictator named Enver 
Hoxha, Albania's Lost Generations were far from romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 But that suited the Columbia triumvirate just fine. They wanted to make a 
significant contribution in a country where the first university wasn't built 
until 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 "Albania is the last frontier; there's nowhere I'd rather be right now," 
declared Stacy Sullivan, 25, a Malibu resident, sitting in her Tirana apartment 
surrounded by plastic buckets she uses to collect and save water when it 
intermittently flows from the faucets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan and her colleagues, Fred Abrahams, 26, and Marianne Sullivan, 28 and 
no relation, received grants from Columbia, the Soros Foundation and the 
International Media Fund, which provided the travel expenses, stipends and 
desktop publishing equipment to start up the paper. But they found Albania more 
challenging than they imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving into their office in crumbling Tirana University, the students 
had to fix two broken windows, replace missing tiles, fill in a ditch on the 
floor, hook up electricity and put steel bars on the door and windows to 
prevent the theft of their computers -- an occupational hazard throughout 
Albania. 
</P>
<P>
 They taught a newspaper course at Tirana University, explaining basic 
journalistic concepts such as free speech and inverted-pyramid story 
composition. 
</P>
<P>
 After 16-hour days spent assigning and editing stories, the first issue of 
Reporteri -- which is published in the Albanian language and distributed 
throughout Tirana -- appeared Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 In an editorial, the three Americans wrote: "For years, journalists were 
mouthpieces for the state, hiding, manipulating or exaggerating facts to serve 
the propaganda machine. . . . Our responsibility is to provide objective and 
balanced information free of political or ideological taint." 
</P>
<P>
 But they soon learned a harsh lesson about Albania's press. Enraged by the 
newspaper -- which included a story on AIDS and an editorial denouncing the 
nation's restrictive new press law that imposes fines of up to $8,000 on 
editors who violate its vaguely worded provisions -- university officials 
locked the Americans out of their office. 
</P>
<P>
 They also confiscated the computers donated by the International Media Fund, 
saying the desktop publishing equipment had been given to the university, not 
to the students. The Soros Foundation was denounced on national TV and accused 
of conspiring with opponents of the government. Lastly, the Americans were told 
that the university no longer required their teaching services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was completely frustrating," says Abrahams, wolfing down a chow mein 
dinner in Tirana's only Chinese restaurant. "You come here and try to help, and 
your help is rejected. You know you have something to contribute, but the 
conservative mentality here keeps this country from moving ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph Marku, chairman of Tirana University's journalism department -- who 
helped draft the press law that Reporteri attacked -- declined a request to 
discuss the matter, saying he was too busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, the Columbia journalists garnered new funds from the Soros Open 
Society Fund of Albania, which invited them to take up residency in its new 
Media Training Center and made Marianne Sullivan the center's co-director. 
</P>
<P>
 George Soros, a Hungarian-born Wall Street financier, has plunged heavily into 
financing projects in formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has a monopoly on truth," he told a recent press conference in New 
York. "So you need democratic governments, market economies and, above all, the 
rule of law, where minority opinions are protected." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ensconced in their new digs, the trio continued publishing Reporteri and also 
launched 12 high school newsletters, training teen-agers how to write stories 
and use the computers. Additionally, they mapped plans for a seminar on 
newspaper distribution and establishing a professional video studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporteri has covered some potentially explosive stories, including the arrest 
of Aleksander Frangaj and Martin Leka, an editor and a reporter at the Albanian 
newspaper Koha Jone, on charges that have been widely condemned as harassment 
by international media organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Center for Foreign Journalists, which keeps track of such 
incidents, the reporter was convicted of divulging military secrets and 
sentenced to 18 months in prison; the editor fled to Greece. The secret 
revealed: that Albanian army officers must leave their weapons in the barracks 
when they go off duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Frangaj, Leka and three other Albanian journalists jailed on various charges 
under the state's rigorous press law were freed recently on the occasion of 
World Press Freedom Day, according to a government newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the American mentors believe that the harassment is having a 
chilling effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Journalists are scared," Sullivan said. "You can notice a marked difference 
in the reporting now -- stories are not nearly as hard-hitting. The crackdown 
on opposition, sadly, seems to be working." 
</P>
<P>
 The state, which owns the only radio and TV outlets, controls all broadcast 
media. More than 50 newspapers and magazines vie for readers, including an 
unauthorized Albanian "Playboy" with fuzzy black-and-white pictures printed on 
smudgy paper. Most of the news-oriented print media are affiliated with one or 
another of Albania's political parties, and the concept of an objective, 
Western-style independent press has not caught on. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reporteri has become a cause celebre in Tirana's intellectual circles. 
Some say the paper and its supporters represent elements that seek to undermine 
democracy in Albania. Others see Reporteri as a test case for freedom of the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a remarkable job," says Avni Mustafaj, executive director of the 
Soros Open Society Foundation, Albania. "What they're doing is extremely 
valuable and important for an independent press. It's turned on the light where 
there wasn't one before." 
</P>
<P>
 The Albanian students are stoic about the paper's fate on campus. "When I 
learned the paper was shut down, I was very angry, very disappointed," says 
Altin Rraxhimi, 20, who speaks Italian, French and English as well as his 
native Albanian. "I believe the press has to be free, but it's a perennial 
problem in our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Rraxhimi says he could not have envisioned a paper such as Reporteri, which 
has allowed students to draw editorial cartoons, profile Albania's first rock 
band and review "Waiting for Godot," which had its Albanian premiere last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his American mentors put up with Third World living and stay wired 
to their homes in the First World with e-mail. REM and the Indigo Girls blast 
from their stereo. Their apartment resembles a college dorm, with young 
Albanian intellectuals dropping by at all hours for story conferences, late 
night philosophical sessions and Albanian Merlot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day you wake up and know that even if you just go to the bazaar to buy 
food, something exciting is going to happen," Abrahams says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he says, the country has been devastated spiritually and 
economically, adding: "If these problems didn't exist, there wouldn't be a 
reason for us to be here."

DOING BUSINESS; AMERICAN BECOMES POLAND'S 'POPCORN KING' IN 3 YEARS; NOW TOM 
HEANUE STRUGGLES TO KEEP UP WITH THE OVERHEATED MARKET HE CREATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KITTY McKINSEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In less than three years, Tom Heanue, the Orville Redenbacher of Poland, has 
created a nation of popcorn munchers where corn was previously regarded as fit 
only for pig fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 Cashing in on the mystique of all things American here, the Yankee 
entrepreneur's Indiana Popping Corn has become a bestseller in the land of 
sausage and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Heanue, a former banker and restaurateur from White Horse Beach, Mass., 
started his business here with just $5,000 and a conviction that there wasn't 
enough food in Eastern Europe to meet suppressed demand. He was working in a 
bank in Prague, Czechoslovakia, at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking back to weekend evenings in front of the family television set, where 
he and his seven siblings sat snacking on popcorn and watching Disney and 
Lassie, the 38-year-old caught the kernel of his idea. 
</P>
<P>
 And he took a word of advice from his mother, a nutrition expert: "She said 
popcorn will go over big because it's nutritious and healthy but above all it's 
just cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 Heanue cheerfully admits he had no idea Poles regarded corn strictly as animal 
fodder. "If I'd known more then, I would never have come here," he says at his 
Lodz packaging plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The company name, Indiana Foods, was the result of Heanue's unique brand of 
market research. He made a list of the Midwestern states that produce popcorn 
seed and showed it to Polish cabbies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indiana" was the only name they could pronounce, he said, and Heanue noted an 
association with Indiana Jones, the movie hero. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So in 1991 he imported his first 44,000-pound container of popcorn seed -- and 
found that no one wanted to buy it. So he went from store to store -- often 
still run by unimaginative state managers -- and demonstrated how to pop corn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine out of 10 store managers said, 'Nobody will eat it,' " Heanue recalls. 
So he went straight to the consumer. He and a Polish actor set up popping 
demonstrations on street corners, handing out 100 pounds of popping corn at a 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 When he couldn't afford a professional actor, Heanue donned a brown fedora and 
leather jacket to impersonate Indiana Jones in snappy television commercials. 
The slogan: "You no longer have to search the Earth to find popcorn." 
</P>
<P>
 The next step was outright bribery of reluctant store managers: They would get 
a cut of the profits if they would just give Indiana Popping Corn shelf space 
in their stores. "They all understand money," Heanue says with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, his popcorn took off. "It sold very well," says Ryszard Krub, deputy 
manager of the Rival Market in Poznan. "Customers didn't have any problems with 
it because there are directions on each package." 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana Popping Corn and Heanue's other product, Kentucky Peanut Butter, went 
onto store shelves all over Poland -- except Warsaw, where stores didn't pay 
their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales last year topped $1 million. They are expected to hit $2 million this 
year. That's a lot of popcorn, because Heanue sells 15-ounce bags to stores for 
the equivalent of 18 cents (retail price: 25 cents). 
</P>
<P>
 "I've fed a lot of people," Heanue says with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also became a victim of his success. The market he created prompted 
"every guy in the country with an uncle in Chicago" to import popcorn. 
Poor-quality imitations flooded stores. Some counterfeiters even photocopied 
Indiana Popping Corn bags and taped the paper inside clear plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Popcorn vendors turned up on street corners all over Poland. Movie theaters 
began selling it. Consumers quickly became blase about what had been a novelty. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first it was a rage, but current sales are low," says Grazyna Jurewicz, 
manager of the Combi food store in Wroclaw. "It was fashionable, but now people 
prefer to buy ready-made popcorn out of laziness." 
</P>
<P>
 Heanue, who expanded into the more profitable peanut butter to boost his 
profit margins, nevertheless is determined to keep up with the market he's 
created. 
</P>
<P>
 He's experimenting with cheese- and caramel-flavored popcorn and is 
considering producing microwave popcorn. "The market is maturing so fast, I'm 
having to scramble to keep up with it," says the stocky Heanue, who looks like 
the hockey player he once was. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for a new gimmick dredged up another memory from childhood: Cracker 
Jack. Popcorn, peanuts . . . and a prize! 
</P>
<P>
 So he's launching an "Indiana sends you to Indiana" campaign. Each popcorn 
package will come with a small Polish-English phrase booklet designed 
especially for Heanue by Indiana University. In addition, buyers will be 
eligible to win a trip to the university for a nine-week English course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you don't win the trip, you're still winning because you're learning 
English," the ever-cheerful Heanue says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Western entrepreneurs in Eastern Europe, Heanue has run head-on into 
the bad habits of employees and distributors bred by nearly 50 years of 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only do you have to do the business, but you have to teach everyone else 
how to do business with you. And after you teach them once, you have to teach 
them again," he says. "You have to explain absolutely everything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But he's optimistic about the future and has an ambitious five-year plan to 
distribute his products to Russia, the Czech Republic and Hungary. German, 
Japanese and American investors have expressed interest in buying into Indiana 
Foods, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't start this company today," he says. "I would have to have half a 
million to $1 million if I was going to come here now and do what I'm doing, 
with the distribution, information and contacts with stores and goodwill." 
</P>
<P>
 And Heanue remains grateful to Poland for the opportunities it's given him: "I 
could never have done this in the U.S."

PHOTO ESSAY; SNAPSHOTS FROM AN ANCIENT CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How do you document a centuries-old culture without a written language? 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the answer is all around you. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what teen-agers in Mexico's Totontepec village recently discovered when 
they became "cultural journalists," tape-recording and photographing their 
families and neighbors -- descendants of the ancient Mixe people.The Mixes, 
numbering about 100,000, are among more than 50 indigenous peoples who inhabit 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Financed by Oaxaca state, by the local Kong Oy Mixe Community Institute and by 
donations from U.S. foundations, 18 students spent five months studying local 
crafts, religious symbols and legends in their isolated farming village 
(population 1,800) in the mountains of Oaxaca. The project was coordinated by 
Laura Vargas Diaz of Oaxaca city and her husband, photographer Jeff Share. 
</P>
<P>
 The students made soap from ashes, lard and plants. They photographed basket 
weaving, traditional cooking and agriculture. In the nearby forest, they found 
the image of a serpent, believed to be revered by the pre-Hispanic culture, 
carved into rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forwarding to modern technology, the teen-agers stored their data on 
computers and produced 17 articles using a new alphabet devised by Margarita 
Cortez and other local linguists to write down their native language, called 
Ayuuk. The articles and 50 photographs were exhibited earlier this year at 
Oaxaca's State Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are now training others to produce a bilingual community 
publication to continue the work of creating a living record of the Mixe 
culture.

FUND-RAISING FIRM IS TARGET OF 2 INVESTIGATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State and local agencies announced parallel investigations into a 
telemarketing business Monday after disclosures by The Times that the firm has 
received donations for nonexistent charities and real charities that it does 
not represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Burns, general manager of the city's Social Service Department, said he 
will begin an investigation of Valley Fund-raisers in conjunction with the Los 
Angeles Police Department bunco/forgery unit and the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking a look at it," James Cordi, Los Angeles-area supervising 
attorney for the state attorney general's Registry of Charitable Trusts, said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Sunday that Burbank-based Valley Fundraisers, which 
collected more than $2.6 million in charitable donations in the last four 
years, deposited checks made out to at least nine charitable organizations that 
had not authorized the firm's solicitations and received no contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm also deposited checks made out to more than 24 names that could not 
be matched to any charity registered with the Internal Revenue Service, The 
Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Galambos, president of Valley Fundraisers, acknowledged in aninterview 
that what he called "mistakes" have been made, blaming overzealous employees 
who had acted without his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has corrected every error he learned of by refunding the donors' 
money. He said he has issued hundreds of refunds over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Fundraisers, a business whose telephone solicitors call households 
across the Los Angeles area, is licensed in California and Los Angeles to 
solicit on behalf of only three charities. Its contracts with those charities 
allow it to keep 85% to 90% of all the money it raises to pay solicitors' 
commissions and operating expenses and as profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cordi and Burns said it was too early in their investigations to discuss 
what sanctions might be sought against the firm. Investigations of other 
charity telemarketing firms have resulted in revocation of solicitation 
licenses, injunctions prohibiting continued operations and prosecutions seeking 
civil penalties. State and municipal laws prohibit fraudulent solicitation but 
have rarely been used, said Burns and Assistant Atty. Gen. Carole Kornblum, 
head of the Registry of Charitable Trusts. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of charities listed as payees on checks collected by Valley 
Fundraisers had differing reactions to the disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Stein, president of Children's Wish Foundation International of 
Atlanta, said the organization's attorney will contact the attorney general's 
office to find out what steps can be taken for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Others feared that the misuse of their names would tarnish the image of all 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Fundraisers' activities "could potentially hurt charities that do so 
much good for so many people," said Ted Federici, chief operating officer of 
the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. "We hope people will not stop 
giving to worthy causes because of this incident." 
</P>
<P>
 "Charity telefunding is one of the newest and trendiest types of telemarketing 
fraud we're looking at," said Sue Frauens, acting regional director in the 
Federal Trade Commission's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the shift from straight commercial telemarketing scams to (charity) 
fund raising is the belief that they've found an enforcement loophole," Frauens 
said. "Many believe that because charities are exempt from a number of statutes 
they can get through these loopholes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, the commission has filed four complaints against charity 
telemarketing firms based in Nevada, which has no telemarketing registration 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Frauens said she could not comment on Valley Fundraisers. Generally, though, 
the trade commission asserts jurisdiction only when telephone solicitations are 
made across state lines, she said.

MILKEN REPORTEDLY WILL RELEASE UCLA FROM VIDEOTAPE CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to end what many say is an embarrassment, UCLA officials are reportedly 
close to persuading fallen junk bond king Michael Milken to release them from a 
business contract allowing the convicted felon to use the Westwood school's 
name to market videotapes of his classroom lectures in exchange for 5% of the 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Regent Ward Connerly said Monday that it was his understanding that Milken 
agreed in principle late last week to rescind the controversial contract, 
releasing UCLA from any financial involvement in the venture and promising not 
to use the school's name or logo. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have to do it," Connerly said Monday. "Clearly, he could have said, 
'Hell with you guys,' and proceeded. I don't know whether it was altruism that 
drove him or the desire to get out of some potentially lingering bad public 
relations. All I know is he's going to do it (rescind the contract)." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to confirm the development in the Milken saga Monday, a UCLA spokeswoman 
said word of a new agreement was premature, adding that discussions "are under 
way and the matter is in the hands of Mr. Milken and his advisers." Joseph D. 
Mandel, UCLA vice chancellor for legal affairs, said late Monday that "at first 
blush, Mr. Milken and his attorneys were comfortable" with the proposed terms 
to rescind the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said it is not a final agreement. "Like all deals, this one could fall 
out of bed," Mandel said. Connerly said the school is waiting for written 
confirmation of the change in the contract from Milken and his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's association with Milken -- the onetime junk bond guru who was 
convicted of six securities fraud violations -- has become a public relations 
reversal for the Westwood school. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the school was lampooned in the nationally syndicated comic strip 
"Doonesbury" for allowing Milken to co-teach 10 three-hour lectures in master's 
degree course at UCLA's graduate management school. 
</P>
<P>
 And in February, state Sens. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) and Patrick 
Johnston (D-Stockton) raised vigorous objections to a contract UCLA officials 
signed allowing Milken's new Educational Entertainment Network of Bel-Air to 
tape and sell videos of the classroom sessions, presumably to other colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 They accused Milken of trying to use UCLA's name to whitewash his image, said 
the school had been seduced by more than $3.3 million in gifts from Milken over 
the years, and blasted the contract as an awful deal for a public institution. 
Under the terms of the agreement, UCLA waived all of its legal rights but 
allowed Milken to use its logo and name in return for only 5% of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy with the bad publicity and irked with the way UCLA handled the 
contract, the UC regents in March asked administrators to approach Milken and 
persuade him to rescind the deal. Connerly said Monday that Chancellor Charles 
E. Young, who has publicly defended the arrangement, was responsible for 
conducting the negotiations with Milken and his attorneys to rescind it. 
</P>
<P>
 Connerly commended Young for persuading Milken, who still intends to sell the 
tapes, to drop all reference to UCLA as sponsors, thus avoiding the 
"implication at all that this is something that is sanctioned by UCLA."  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the emerging agreement, Connerly said, the school will forgo its 5% 
profit but will not be forced, as in other business deals, to buy Milken out by 
reimbursing him for more than $100,000 in production costs his company has 
incurred in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The only remaining issue, said Connerly, is whether the tapes will make 
reference to UCLA by identifying economics professor Bradford Cornell, who 
taught the course with Milken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're getting a good deal by getting out of it," said Connerly. "It 
was an embarrassing situation that wasn't going to produce much in the way of 
profits to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Milken's entertainment company in Bel-Air did not return phone 
calls Monday, and a Washington, D.C., spokeswoman for Milken could not be 
reached.

2 PLEAD NO CONTEST IN RIOT SLAYING; VIOLENCE: THE MEN ARE SENTENCED TO PRISON 
ON REDUCED CHARGES OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THEIR VICTIM WAS A STREET 
EVANGELIST WHO TRIED TO STOP LOOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two men charged with murder in the last major case of the Los Angeles riots 
each pleaded no contest and were sentenced to prison Monday for the fatal 
beating of a middle-aged street evangelist who had tried to stop looters at a 
Hollywood drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidel Ortiz, 22, and Leonard Sosa, 24, both former warehouse workers for a 
Dodger Stadium concessionaire, entered the pleas to reduced charges of 
voluntary manslaughter on the same day they were to go on trial for the April 
30, 1992, attack on Wallace Tope Jr. It was one of only three murder cases 
stemming from the riots, in which 55 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Carlos Moreno sentenced Ortiz to an 11-year prison term 
and Sosa to a six-year term under a plea agreement that angered members of 
Tope's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Tope was rendered unconscious by the beating at a mini-mall on Sunset 
Boulevard near Western Avenue on the second day of the civil disturbances and 
remained in a coma for 19 months before he died at a nursing home last November 
at the age of 54. When he died, the original attempted-murder charges against 
Ortiz and Sosa were upgraded to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa received a lighter sentence than Ortiz because he played a lesser role in 
the attack on Tope, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Lamb and Sosa's lawyer, 
Marvin L. Part. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa, who like Ortiz has already served two years of his sentence, will 
probably be freed in about 18 months, Part said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that was a good disposition under the circumstances," the defense 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz was given the maximum sentence for voluntary manslaughter. With time off 
for good behavior and time served, he could be released in about four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The evangelist's brother, Dennis, an assistant high school principal in Kern 
County, said in a telephone interview that the sentences are "too light for 
murdering my brother." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our justice system has become a legal system concerned with rules and 
regulations rather than justice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb said the plea arrangements were offered to Sosa and Ortiz because the 
injuries to Tope occurred during an altercation between Ortiz and Tope, and 
because witnesses disagreed on exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one witness told police Tope was beaten for several minutes; another 
said the beating was over in seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear there was some kind of argument between Ortiz and Tope, and Tope 
was kicked in the head," Lamb said. "Numerous (other) people ran (toward Tope) 
and possibly could have contributed to his injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Tope, who had a history of evangelical missions, had driven alone to Hollywood 
with religious pamphlets and flyers in hopes of helping to stop the violence 
after watching riot scenes on television. 
</P>
<P>
 When looters, including Ortiz and Sosa, took goods from a Sav-On drugstore, 
Tope confronted Ortiz, telling him he would go to hell if he continued 
lawbreaking, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses' statements indicated that Tope and Ortiz exchanged words before 
Ortiz punched Tope. The evangelist was hurrying toward his car, the witnesses 
said, when Sosa ran to Ortiz's aid, helping him to chase Tope down and pummel 
and kick him. 
</P>
<P>
 The riots flared after not-guilty verdicts in the trial of four Los Angeles 
police officers in the March, 1991, beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 felony cases were filed in Los Angeles County as a result of the 
disturbances, the most celebrated being the attempted-murder case against 
several men who attacked trucker Reginald Denny. The other murder cases 
involved the beating and shooting of a motorcyclist in Long Beach, for which 
six men are serving prison sentences, and the stabbing death of a Pasadena 
woman the same day Tope was attacked. Two men are awaiting sentencing in that 
case after being convicted last month of some of the charges.

 It's a scene as old as cave art: patients seething in the waiting room over a 
3 o'clock appointment that is nowhere close to happening, and doctors steaming 
behind their stethoscopes because they are running late -- all because patients 
arrive late, which they do because doctors always run late because patients 
always arrive late because doctors always run late. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 'Round and 'round it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we asked Liz Brody, senior editor at Shape magazine, and Dr. Jim Allen, a 
Malibu family physician, to fire off the top peeves of doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * Time is a terrible thing to waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors are the reciprocal of dogs -- one of their hours equals seven of ours. 
Why can't we seem to retain this information from one visit to the next? We 
drive through town like pinballs on Ritalin just to sit in the waiting room 
reading back issues of Ornithology Today and chanting oohhhhhmmmm so our blood 
pressure doesn't go through the roof. Obviously we'll never make our next 
appointment on time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Questions, questions, more questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling out medical histories shouldn't be worse than filling out tax returns. 
And how about when they test you on memory loss. You know the routine. I can no 
more remember the dates of my surgeries or which aunt has what disease than I 
can remember how much I spent for doctors visits in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oh, it's only a paper gown. 
</P>
<P>
 The "gown" -- and aren't we overstating the case here? -- looks as if it were 
ripped off a roll of Bounty. I wouldn't mind wearing it if there were some way 
to close it in the back, especially since the thermostat in the inner sanctum 
is always set for Haagen-Dazs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pain of poundage. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it that even if you go in for an infected eyebrow, they make you get on 
the scale? 
</P>
<P>
 * The hand that rocks the prescription pad. 
</P>
<P>
 So does that "Exorcist"-like penmanship read thiamine or Thorazine?  
</P>
<P>
 * The Pavlovian Pee Thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I run to the bathroom all night, come time to give a urine sample I'm 
as dry as a Santa Ana. It's fairly impossible to do it on cue. But for those 
who've mastered this level, there is the next challenge: tinkling within the 
boundaries of that teeny-wee-wee cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * Needles. 
</P>
<P>
 Need I say more? 
</P>
<P>
 * Hypochondriac until proven sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all your limbs are attached, stay away," my friend Ted says. "Unless 
you're missing one, doctors never listen to you." In general, I agree. Tell a 
doctor you've got a Kmart complaint like indigestion or fatigue and their eyes 
glaze over with a look that says, "I'm standing here in front of the fridge and 
can't find a thing to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 * R-e-s-p-e-c-t. 
</P>
<P>
 Find out what it means to me. MDs operate under the illusion that they possess 
IQs; we are Beavises and Butt-heads. It's an attitude thing, starting from the 
time they enter the examining room wearing our chart as a face mask. Then, with 
eye contact still at a minimum, they'll hit you with shred of eponychium on a 
proximal nail fold when they could have said hangnail.  
</P>
<P>
 * Evelyn Wood speed healing dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 After all the waiting, the doctor pronounces you healed. And during that blip 
of an exam, it's amazing how the charges rack up! You can't help but wonder if 
that $400 mole absolutely had to come off or whether Doc needed new polo 
mallets.

</P>
<P>
 So, we asked Liz Brody, senior editor at Shape magazine, and Dr. Jim Allen, a 
Malibu family physician, to fire off the top peeves of doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * The chronically late patient. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a preemptive strike for the traditional complaint of patients about 
doctors. Typically, this patient shows up about the time you're supposed to be 
A) in the O.R. doing the surgical thing; B) in the E.R., attending a critically 
ill patient, or C) on the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Time abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 These are patients who try to expand a scheduled 15-minute sore-throat exam 
into a complete physical, with an impromptu psych consult thrown in for good 
measure. (Another good reason doctors are sometimes late.)  
</P>
<P>
 These patients also wait until 11:30 on a Friday night of a holiday weekend to 
realize that they're out of blood pressure medication and then expect you to 
magically supply them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Something for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 I call it the "While-we're-here scenario" -- as in, "While we're here, could 
you look at Jennifer's ears and Mark's skin rash. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 They would never think of going to a lawyer to discuss suing their doctors and 
then segue into cajoling a free opinion on Aunt Mildred's will. 
</P>
<P>
 (Also in this category: regulars who consistently use the phone in lieu of an 
office visit to secure a diagnosis and treatment.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Getting stiffed for services. 
</P>
<P>
 Patient comes to office with a sexually transmitted disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just passing through," patient says. 
</P>
<P>
 Is treated with compassion and a $25 injection, plus a few starter (free) 
samples of an expensive antibiotic. Check bounces. Phony name and address, you 
get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chronic non-payers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlimited number of excuses. And these same people expect medical reports to 
be filled out and sent out to schools, work, et al., immediately . 
</P>
<P>
 * Non-compliant patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't matter how many risk factors for coronary disease are present, you can 
talk until you're blue in the face but no way will he/she lose weight, give up 
cigarettes or eat less fat. Medications? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sarah Bernhardt Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients who manipulate and over-dramatize any affliction or illness. Usually 
accompanied by an enabler for heightened effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially the most creative field with unlimited stories of pain, allergies 
(to every analgesic known to man except Demerol, natch), dogs eating their 
medication, UFOs sucking up their prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * The can't-quite-get-the-hang-of-things patient. 
</P>
<P>
 This has two forms: A) those who wait until they're at death's door to 
consider a doctor visit, and B) those who pop in at first sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients who have never established an ongoing relationship with soap and 
water.
