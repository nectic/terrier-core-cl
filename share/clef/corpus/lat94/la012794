JETS LOSE GAME AND SELANNE TO LEG INJURY; HOCKEY: SEMENOV RETURNS AND SCORES IN 
DUCKS' 3-1 VICTORY. WINNIPEG WINGER MAY BE OUT FOR SEASON AFTER SUFFERING TEAR 
IN ACHILLES TENDON. 
</P>

 The Mighty Ducks' Anatoli Semenov returned from an injury that had kept him 
off the ice nearly two months Wednesday, but the Winnipeg Jets' Teemu Selanne 
suffered one that could threaten the rest of his season. 
</P>
<P>
 Selanne suffered a tear in his right Achilles tendon when the blade of Duck 
defenseman Don McSween's skate cut him above the boot during the second period 
of the Ducks' 3-1 victory in front of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg Coach John Paddock said he expects Selanne -- who tied Buffalo's 
Alexander Mogilny for the NHL lead with 76 goals as a rookie last season and 
has 25 this season -- to undergo surgery in the next few days. The early 
projection is that he could be out six to eight weeks, but if the tendon is 
completely severed, his season could be over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst part about tonight was seeing Teemu Selanne getting injured," Duck 
Coach Ron Wilson said. "It's terrible for the NHL to see such an exciting 
player go down like that . . . I hope he has a complete recovery, but basically 
what I understand is he's done for the season." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an injury that the Jets, who are in last place in the Central Division 
and recently fired General Manager Mike Smith, cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks can identify with that. The injury they couldn't afford happened 
when Semenov -- then their leading scorer -- dislocated his left elbow Dec. 7 
when he was accidentally caught in a check by his own teammate, Stu Grimson. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, seven weeks later, the Ducks had managed a 9-10-2 record without 
him, and he returned to the ice with the first-year team still in the chase for 
a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up where he left off, scoring a goal on his first shift, less than 
two minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' success this season picked up when Semenov found his stride a few 
weeks into the season, centering a line with Garry Valk and Peter Douris on the 
wings. Wilson immediately reunited that line Wednesday, and Valk brought the 
puck around from behind the net and found Semenov open in front at 1:51 of the 
period for his 10th goal of the season, and first since Dec. 1, also against 
Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Semenov) was outstanding tonight," Wilson said. "He was a little tentative, 
which is what you'd expect. But he scored 30 seconds into his first shift." 
</P>
<P>
 The sellout crowd witnessed another franchise first -- the Jets became the 
first team to be swept by the Ducks in a season series, losing all four. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets didn't want to go 0-4 against a first-year team that is hounding them 
and the Kings for the eighth Western Conference playoff spot. That led to some 
chippy play and two fights between the Ducks' Todd Ewen and Dean Kennedy, but 
the Ducks completed the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a solid performance at home -- one the Ducks had been craving. They 
started strong by limiting Winnipeg to three shots in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 Paddock, like many another opposing coach this season, was frustrated by the 
Ducks' defensive style. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wasn't a hockey game, that was a football game," Paddock said. 
"Basically that's the way they play -- and are allowed to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Semenov's goal put the Ducks on their way to a 3-0 lead, with McSween scoring 
his first NHL goal on a power-play at 17:58 of the first and center Shaun Van 
Allen adding his third of the season at 3:11 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the only goal allowed by Guy Hebert, who has started six of the 
Ducks' last seven games and has lost only once in his last four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always nice to play a lot of games right in a row," Hebert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Myles O'Connor has returned to Anaheim after a conditioning stint 
with minor league San Diego after a lengthy personal leave. . . . Friday's game 
against the Rangers is a sellout, and will mark the ninth consecutive at 
Anaheim Arena.

SCOTT SCORES 19, BUT DIVAC STEALS SHOW AT FINISH; PRO BASKETBALL: CENTER SCORES 
SEASON-HIGH 26 POINTS AND MAKES THE KEY BASKET AS LAKERS RALLY, THEN HOLD OFF 
PACERS, 103-99. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Byron Scott was back in the Forum on Wednesday night, wearing No. 4 and the 
familiar flat-top haircut again, getting cheered by his hometown fans again, 
making shots again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost made a pass to him," Vlade Divac said. "Almost." 
</P>
<P>
 So, with nostalgia in the air, what were the Lakers supposed to do but beat 
Scott's Indiana Pacers, again. This time, it was a 103-99 victory before 11,577 
to sweep the two-game season series for the fourth time in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott finished with 19 points on eight-of-18 shooting in a rare start, and 
backcourt mate Reggie Miller had 21, but the Pacers scored only 21 points in 
the fourth quarter. The Lakers scored 32, Divac accounting for 11 of those, to 
win for the second time in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers trailed, 81-78, with nine minutes left, then charged ahead with a 
15-2 run for a 93-83 advantage with 5:17 remaining. They were still up by nine 
and had 94 points with 4:40 to go, which seemed like a strange place to switch 
off the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers were still looking for another basket as the game neared the 
one-minute mark, by which time the Pacers had closed within 94-92. But when the 
scoreless streak ended with 63 seconds to go, it was pivotal: Divac made a 
jumper from the top of the free throw circle, was fouled by Antonio Davis and 
converted from the line. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave Divac the biggest of his season-high 26 points, to go with 11 
rebounds in 45 minutes, and it gave the Lakers a five-point lead. The margin 
quickly became nine, 101-92, with 33 seconds left as Sedale Threatt and George 
Lynch (19 points) each made two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers commemorated Scott's return with a one-minute video review of his 
10 years in Los Angeles on the scoreboard, then by presenting him with a framed 
version of his former home jersey.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacer Coach Larry Brown noted the occasion by starting Scott alongside Miller, 
returning everyone to their rightful spot midway through the first quarter by 
using Vern Fleming, just off the injured list, at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott still wore No. 4 and he still was a crowd favorite, getting a nice 
ovation from the small audience. But best of all for him, he was playing in the 
Forum again, he was in Southern California again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really looking forward to it so I could see the sun," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other reasons, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely glad I made the trip," he said. "One of the first things I did 
when I signed with this team was look at the schedule and see when we would be 
in L.A. I was sorry I missed the game in Indy (because he had not signed yet), 
but I'm glad to be here for this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being the first time I've done this (play as a visitor), it's definitely a 
little weird. But it's just like the weather in Indy. You deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott missed his first three shots, but then made six of his next 10 by midway 
through the third quarter to help the Pacers to a 64-63 lead. Indiana, looking 
to break a three-game losing streak, had a 78-71 lead heading into the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Christie is scheduled to be one of six players in the slam dunk contest 
next month at the All-Star weekend, but it's far from certain the Laker forward 
will take part. Christie said he wants to have at least a couple of games back 
to test his sprained ankle before competing in an exhibition, high profile or 
not, and the Lakers are saying he could easily be out two more weeks. If that 
becomes reality, Christie might not play at all until after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 How's this for fantasy: a uniform in the Laker locker room, jersey No. 23, the 
name JORDAN across the back. It became a reality Wednesday, except that was 
Reggie Jordan, not Michael, making his debut after signing a 10-day contract. 
"I like to make dreams come true," he said before the game. "Mine and the 
fans'." Jordan made it to the NBA despite not even playing in high school and 
not being drafted out of New Mexico State. His previous pro experience came 
from the Continental Basketball Assn. and a 1993 training camp stint with the 
Pacers. Jordan played three minutes against the Pacers, scoring two points.

SEMENOV MAKES RETURN A TRIUMPHANT ONE; HOCKEY: DUCK CENTER SCORES IN FIRST 
SHIFT SINCE RETURNING FROM INJURY, LEADING 3-1 VICTORY OVER JETS. SELANNE 
INJURED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The injury the Mighty Ducks couldn't afford happened, and on Wednesday night, 
they celebrated surviving it. 
</P>
<P>
 Anatoli Semenov was the Ducks' leading scorer -- and really, their only 
offensive threat -- when he dislocated his left elbow on Dec. 7 by being caught 
in a check by his own teammate, Stu Grimson. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven weeks later, the Ducks had a 9-10-2 record without him, and he returned 
to the ice with the team still in the chase for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up where he left off, scoring a goal on his first shift, less than 
two minutes into the Ducks' 3-1 victory over the Winnipeg Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets suffered a crucial injury when right wing Teemu Selanne partially 
tore his right Achilles tendon on the skate of Duck defensemen Don McSween in 
the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Selanne will undergo surgery in the next few days, and early estimates are 
that he will miss 6-8 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Selanne has 25 goals after scoring 76 as a rookie in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 A sellout crowd of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena saw the Jets become the first team 
to be swept by the Ducks in a season series. The Ducks beat Winnipeg four 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Their success started when Semenov found his stride a few weeks into the 
season, centering a line with Garry Valk and Peter Douris. Coach Ron Wilson 
reunited that line Wednesday, and Valk brought the puck around from behind the 
net and found Semenov open in front at 1:51 of the first period for his 10th 
goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Ducks' 19th victory of the season, but only their sixth at Anaheim 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 They started strong, limiting Winnipeg to three shots in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks extended their lead to 3-0, with McSween scoring his first NHL goal 
on a power-play at 17:58 of the first period and center Shaun Van Allen adding 
his third goal of the season at 3:11 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 McSween, 29, hadn't appeared in an NHL game in more than three seasons before 
the Ducks signed him this month. His goal, assisted by Peter Douris, came in 
his 16th NHL game, including nine in previous seasons with Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Allen last scored on Dec. 2. He came to the Ducks with a reputation as a 
minor-league scorer, but has only 19 points, mostly on assists since coming to 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg didn't score until late in the second period, when it had a two-man 
advantage for 54 seconds because Duck defenseman David Williams was called for 
holding with McSween already off for holding. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrin Shannon made good on the opportunity with a goal from the slot at 
17:42. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the only goal allowed by Guy Hebert, who has played in the Ducks' 
last seven games and started the last six. He has lost only once in his last 
four starts, tying twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Sean Hill missed a ninth consecutive game because of a sprained 
left shoulder, but could return as soon as Friday against the New York Rangers. 
Another defenseman, Myles O'Connor, has returned to Anaheim from a conditioning 
stint with minor-league affiliate San Diego after a lengthy personal leave. . . 
. Winnipeg enforcer Tie Domi did not play after suffering a bruised knee 
against the Kings on Tuesday. . . . Friday's game against the Rangers is a 
sellout, the ninth in a row at Anaheim Arena.

NHL ROUNDUP; TORONTO DEFEATS ISLANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Andreychuk's league-leading 39th goal got Toronto started, and the Maple 
Leafs hung on despite being badly outshot to defeat the New York Islanders, 
4-3, Wednesday night at Toronto and remain unbeaten in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Gilmour, Mike Eastwood and Bill Berg also scored for the Maple Leafs, 
7-0-2 since a 1-0 loss Jan. 4 to Tampa Bay in Hamilton, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Thomas had two goals, and Marty McInnis one for the Islanders, who 
outshot the Maple Leafs, 34-17. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islanders lost more than the game. All-Star center Pierre Turgeon broke 
his right cheekbone when hit by a puck during warm-ups, and was scratched from 
the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Al Arbour, speaking after the game, said Turgeon probably will require 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll need an operation to flip (the bone) back out," Arbour said. 
"It's caved in a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Turgeon was skating near the sideboards when a puck caromed off the glass and 
struck him. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, Hartford 0 -- Patrick Roy stopped 30 shots for his fifth shutout 
of the season, and Brian Bellows scored twice to lead the Canadiens at 
Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellows scored the 400th goal of his career in the second period and added one 
in the third for Montreal. Mike Keane had a goal in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whalers had outshot Montreal, 12-9, in the first period before the 
Canadiens converted on their final attempt with 28 seconds to play. Keane took 
a pass from Kirk Muller and backhanded a shot into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal outshot Hartford, 14-7, in the second period but couldn't score on 
Sean Burke until Bellows tallied a wrap-around goal with 50 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The shutout tied Roy with Dominik Hasek of Buffalo for the league lead. It was 
also the 25th of Roy's career. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 1, Tampa Bay 1 -- John Vanbiesbrouck of the Panthers and Daren Puppa 
of the Lightning staged a goaltending clinic at Ft. Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanbiesbrouck, second in the league in goals-against average at 2.35, stopped 
40 Tampa Bay shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Puppa, fifth in the league at 2.52, stopped 22 shots, including Stu Barnes 
from close range early in the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrei Lomakin scored for the first-year Panthers, 4-0-3 in their last seven 
games. They also finished the season series with a 3-0-2 edge against 
second-season Tampa Bay, which got its goal from John Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanbiesbrouck stopped Tim Bergland and Rob DiMaio from close range midway 
through the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 3, Calgary 2 -- Paul Broten's goal midway through the third period 
lifted the Stars at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Courtnall had a goal and an assist for Dallas, which won for the second 
time in its last six games. Paul Kruse set up both goals for the Flames. Dallas 
goaltender Darcy Wakaluk made 14 third-period saves. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 3, Edmonton 3 -- Stephane Richer scored the tying goal with 11:36 
to play in the third period and Chris Terreri made 39 saves for the Devils at 
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Guerin scored two goals for New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Richer's goal came on a two-on-one break on a pass from Scott Stevens.

MORNING BRIEFING: HIS PUTTER IS FUNNY LOOKING, BUT OGLE GETS THE LAST LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Australian Brett Ogle can't understand why more golfers, especially 
professionals, haven't switched to the long putter, as he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're ashamed to try something that looks odd," Ogle told Mark 
Soltau of the San Francisco Examiner after winning the Hawaiian Open. "I see 
older guys struggling big-time, but they're too worried about their pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not traditional. I worry about me and feeding my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Add long putter: Ogle, who also won at Pebble Beach last year, said he decided 
to switch after taking four putts from 15 feet on the first hole of the PGA 
Championship in Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had tears in my eyes," he recalled. "I couldn't get the putter back." 
</P>
<P>
 He switched to a long putter the next week and one-putted six of the first 
nine greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: USC has produced six NBA coaches. Who are they? 
</P>
<P>
 Pass the ball: When the Clippers' Bob Weiss was coach of the Atlanta Hawks, he 
had a bunch of shot-happy players, but on one occasion a display of teamwork 
brought a victory. To which Weiss said: 
</P>
<P>
 "On offense, we moved the ball extremely well. For a group of guys that at one 
time would rather pass kidney stones than a basketball, it's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunch bet: Seles was a winner in Melbourne this week. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not Monica Seles, who is still recovering after being stabbed last year 
and has skipped the Australian Open she won the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning Seles is a harness racer that won the fifth race at Monday's 
trotters meeting at Melbourne's Yarra Glen course. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it Erik, or Erik? Pity the announcers at basketball games involving Fox 
Chapel High of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Nelson, a 6-foot-7 senior center, is averaging 25 points per game. Erik 
D. Nelson, a 6-foot-4 junior forward, is averaging 19. The two are not related, 
but there is another Nelson, Erik's brother Nate, a 6-4 sophomore forward, on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Add confusion: In Peterborough, N.H., when Contoocook Valley High girls' 
basketball coach John Reitnauer yells to his starters, he uses first names -- 
out of necessity. Four of them have the same last name. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jutras sisters -- twin seniors Christine and Michelle, junior Natalie and 
sophomore Veronica -- make up 80% of the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination works: The Cougars have a 9-1 record after going 17-2 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Special rice: Tennis player Kimiko Date of Japan likes to eat Japanese food 
wherever she goes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th-seeded player in the women's singles at the Australian Open takes a 
number of rice dishes that only need boiling whenever she travels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know some Japanese people like to copy other cultures because they think 
it's cool, but I don't like that," Date said. "If you are Japanese, you should 
be Japanese everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Mack Calvin, Bob Kloppenburg, Alex Hannum, Bill Sharman, Tex 
Winter and Paul Westphal. 
</P>

 Quotebook: Philadelphia 76er Coach Fred Carter, on 7-6 rookie Shawn Bradley:

</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox have been negotiating with Expo President Claude Brochu to have 
Duquette released from his contract, which runs through this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Duquette, a native of Dalton, Mass., was quoted in Wednesday's Boston Herald 
as saying he expected the problems to be resolved within days. The teams were 
said to be considering a plan in which Duquette would join the Red Sox in

 Tonya Harding's former husband talked to investigators for the first time for 
nearly six hours Wednesday, and a source said he was working out a plea bargain 
in exchange for testimony against the figure skater. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Jeff Gillooly was there to implicate Harding in the attack on Nancy 
Kerrigan, FBI spokesman Bart Gori said: "They're asking the appropriate 
questions."

 Gillooly is expected to return to FBI headquarters for additional questioning 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 A law enforcement source told the Associated Press, "The walls are really 
closing in on that girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Burton, an attorney for Harding, again said she had nothing to do with 
the alleged plot to knock Kerrigan out of the national figure skating 
championships, won by Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC News reported on the show "Now" Wednesday night that Harding might be 
charged as soon as today. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Figure Skating Assn. and U.S. Olympic Committee have indicated that 
Harding will remain on the Olympic team unless she is charged. Team rosters 
must be filed with international Olympic officials by Monday. Baseball

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>

<TEXT>

 Beverly Hills resident Wayne Gretzky celebrated his 33rd birthday at home 
Wednesday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He was happy to have a roof over his head. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Our family feels fortunate," he said. "The house suffered a lot of damage 
from the earthquake. We might have to move out sometime while repairs are being 
made. But a couple of houses on our block were destroyed. Next door, they were 
taking down the chimney yesterday." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the quake, Gretzky's wife Janet Jones, three children and 
mother-in-law Jean went back to Jones' old hometown of St. Louis while the 
Kings were on the road. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jean was hit by a car in St. Louis and thrown into a ditch. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "She's undergone a couple of operations," Gretzky said. "There had been some 
concern that she might have to have a leg amputated, but she's better now." . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 In times like these, work might seem trivial. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But ice time this week at the Forum and the America West Arena in Phoenix has 
been an escape for Gretzky. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I can't remember seeing No. 99 in better form than Monday when he scored, 
assisted Luc Robitaille, fed Jari Kurri for the game-tying goal with three 
seconds remaining, and put fear into the Calgary Flames every shift during a 
3-3 draw. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, he set up two goals as the Kings rallied from a three-goal 
deficit to tie the Winnipeg Jets, 4-4. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I've got the feeling now that I can make something happen every time I touch 
the puck," he said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen months ago, Gretzky, who had suffered an unusual back injury, was told 
that he might never play hockey again. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Seven months ago, after the Kings were beaten by the Montreal Canadiens in the 
Stanley Cup finals, he said he wasn't sure whether he wanted to play another 
season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But here he is, way ahead in the NHL scoring race with 87 points on 23 goals 
and 64 assists in 47 games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He needs only 14 goals to break Gordie Howe's career record of 801. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "All the records are special," said Gretzky, who has tied or set 59 NHL marks 
during his 14 seasons. "But this one will be the most special. It will be very 
hard to break. To get to 800, you have to average 50 goals for 16 seasons." . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 He has no plans to stop at 802. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to get 900 or 1,000," he said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And when perhaps the greatest career in the history of team sports is over, he 
will settle down and spend the rest of his years in Southern California. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not moving anywhere," Gretzky said. "This is still the best place to 
live." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 After the Kings' two consecutive ties, Coach Barry Melrose said he was 
satisfied with the five-minute overtime in the NHL. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They can't play any more than this," he said. "You might as well load a gun 
and shoot them." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, he said he would approve of a shootout to settle ties during 
regular-season games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it in the American League and it's exciting as hell," Melrose said. 
"But I wouldn't like to see it in the playoffs." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Carson wasn't allowed to play for Vancouver against Edmonton on Monday 
after Coach Pat Quinn wrote the name of Dixon Ward instead of Carson on the 
pregame lineup sheet. Ward was traded to the Kings for Carson recently. . . .  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Painting will begin today on a 30-by-60-foot canvas of Oscar De La Hoya that 
will be hung outside the Grand Olympic Auditorium to advertise "Oscar Night," 
March 5 when he fights Jimmi Bredahl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Remember that massive Reebok campaign before what was supposed to be a 
decathlon duel between Dan O'Brien and Dave Johnson in the 1992 Olympic Games? 
O'Brien and Reebok have split. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If Clipper guard Ron Harper played all the time the way he did Tuesday against 
Seattle, he would be worth $8 million, not $4 million. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding, huge in the headlines, is 5 feet 1 and 105 pounds. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 My Sullivan Award vote is going to two-sport star Charlie Ward of Florida 
State. Last football player to win it was Arnold Tucker of Army in 1946 and the 
last basketball player Bill Walton of UCLA in 1973. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this Super Bowl week different is that Bruce Smith isn't 
complaining about a lack of recognition. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Howley is the only member of a losing team to be voted most valuable 
player in a Super Bowl. The linebacker played for the Dallas Cowboys during 
their 16-13 loss to the Baltimore Colts on Jan. 17, 1971, at Miami. . . .

<P>
 Average score of the last nine Super Bowls: NFC 38, AFC 15.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; IRISH'S INDEPENDENCE SLIPS AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With each loss, the Notre Dame basketball team is forcing the school's 
administration to reconsider, if not abandon, its status as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week Irish Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal announced that a 
feasibility study on conference affiliation would begin at season's end. By 
then, Notre Dame easily will have lost as many as 20 games, maybe more. 
</P>
<P>
 After a narrow loss to No. 2-ranked Duke on Wednesday, the Irish are 5-12 and 
begin a monthlong stretch that includes games against Providence, No. 1 UCLA, 
Georgia, No. 22 Marquette, DePaul, No. 4 North Carolina and No. 12 Louisville. 
Worse yet, Coach John MacLeod's team has botched its so-called gimme games. 
</P>
<P>
 Since somehow upsetting then-No. 25 Missouri on Jan. 12, the Irish have been 
beaten by Duquesne and St. Bonaventure on the road and Manhattan and Loyola 
(Ill.) at the Joyce Athletic Center. In the loss to Loyola--the first time 
since 1956 that the Irish have fallen to the Ramblers--Notre Dame scored 15 
first half points on five-of-27 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLeod has to assume some of the blame here. In three years, he and his staff 
have yet to attract a single recruit of national stature. The Irish desperately 
wanted Iowa prep star Raef LaFrentz, a 7-foot center who was on every blue-chip 
list in the country. Instead, LaFrentz recently signed with Kansas, later 
telling the Chicago Sun-Times that he chose the powerful Jayhawks partly 
because of their Big Eight Conference ties. 
</P>
<P>
 The year before that, Notre Dame thought 6-9 forward Jared Prickett would 
select the Irish and become a breakthrough player. MacLeod's staff was half 
right. Prickett has asserted himself . . . at Kentucky of the Southeastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple fact is this: High-profile recruits crave winning and the perks 
that come with it. Barring the improbable, the Irish will record their third 
losing season in four years. They will have made only one national appearance 
on NBC and another on ABC. They will be an NCAA tournament no-show for a third 
consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, they will have spent another season dying an independent's death. 
NOTRE DAME DEMISE, PART II 
</P>
<P>
 There are quirks about Notre Dame that make it more difficult for MacLeod to 
turn the program around. The Irish don't accept junior college players, which 
is a traditional quick-fix solution for coaches. The school also features one 
of the more demanding academic admissions policies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the no-JC policy, as well as the high admissions standards, have been 
Notre Dame staples for years. Digger Phelps, stuck with those same restraints, 
used to be good for 20 victories a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The killer is the lack of a conference tie-in. By not belonging to a league, 
the Irish have to start scheduling from scratch each year. Now then, try 
finding 28 quality opponents willing to adjust their schedules to yours. It 
won't happen, which is why the Irish will play four ranked teams in nine days 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he won't come right out and say it, MacLeod wants Notre Dame in a 
basketball conference. He has seen how the infant Great Midwest Conference has 
revitalized programs such as the one at DePaul, a longtime independent. In 
fact, three Great Midwest teams are in the top-25 rankings (Alabama Birmingham, 
Marquette and St. Louis), with two others (DePaul and Cincinnati) not far 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 And like Phelps before him, MacLeod has watched as the Irish's Northeast 
recruiting base has been eroded by the Big East Conference and the Atlantic 10 
Conference. Gone are the days when Notre Dame could attract the best players 
from Philadelphia, Washington, New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 How important is the Northeast to the Irish? Put it this way: Four of the top 
five and six of the top 10 all-time Notre Dame scorers are from that region. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLeod is doing what he can, which isn't much at the moment. His program is 
still paying for the recruiting blunders of Phelps, whose junior class is 
averaging about 2.0 points per game. Of the five juniors Phelps brought in, two 
have left and the other three have contributed little. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps' signees also left MacLeod with few available scholarships. In each of 
his first two seasons at Notre Dame, MacLeod had only two scholarships to 
offer. The lack of scholarships cost him Iowa prep player of the year Jess 
Settles, a 6-7 forward who might have signed with the Irish if they would have 
had a scholarship. Instead, he signed with Iowa last year. THE OPTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third time Rosenthal and his staff have considered the pros and 
cons of joining a conference. For anyone thinking the Irish might take the 
total plunge--that is, bring football and basketball to the table--forget it. 
If Notre Dame joins a league, the football program, and the millions of dollars 
it generates, will remain an independent. 
</P>
<P>
 As for MacLeod's team, who knows? Even in its present dismal state, the Irish 
basketball program would be a welcome addition to any league. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked about Notre Dame from the day we formed," said Big East 
Commissioner Mike Tranghese, whose league began in 1979. "Anybody who doesn't 
talk about Notre Dame has their heads in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Tranghese is a little busy these days, what with the Big East 
athletic directors, coaches and presidents bickering about the possibility of 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tranghese: "I'm not even sure who's in our league right now." 
</P>
<P>
 If Notre Dame were in there, he would remember. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other options. The Great Midwest looks nice on paper, but there are 
rumors that Memphis State and possibly Cincinnati might leave to join a league 
that features both football and basketball. The Big Ten might be interested, 
but in all likelihood a deal would have to include Notre Dame football. Fat 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal insists he will entertain all ideas concerning the Irish's 
independent status. He might want to hurry. Many more Notre Dame seasons like 
this one and nobody will care what the Irish do. BIG EAST MESS 
</P>
<P>
 Hailed as the "Big Beast Conference" in its prime, Tranghese's league 
seemingly had everything going for it. It virtually owned the Northeast 
recruiting territory and was the darling of the New York-based television 
networks, whose executives saw dollar signs whenever, say, Georgetown and 
Syracuse made an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Then life got complicated for Tranghese. The Big East, using Miami as a 
centerpiece, became a football conference of sorts. Now look at it: Eight teams 
play football, 10 teams play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this was relatively fine until Temple, West Virginia, Virginia Tech and 
Rutgers--Big East football members whose basketball teams play in other 
conferences--decided they wanted to become full-time Big East members. The 
request hasn't been a big hit with the league's six members who don't field 
Division I-A football programs. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're into pyrotechnics, circle next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday on the 
calendar. That's when Tranghese and representatives from each Big East school 
get together for their annual winter meetings. It is there, a source familiar 
with the proceedings said, that the league's future will be decided "one way or 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 The first question: Will the Big East expand? The second question: Will the 
10-member Big East invite the aforementioned four schools to join the 
basketball mix? 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the eventual outcome, the Big East could be safe and sound at 14 
or become something else altogether. It isn't out of the question that the six 
non-Division I-A football members--Georgetown, Villanova, Seton Hall, St. 
John's, Providence and Connecticut--might bolt and start their own 
basketball-only league, which, a Big East official jokingly said, would be 
called, "The Wee East." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a new league, guess who would get the first invitation to join the 
ranks? 
</P>
<P>
 That's right--Notre Dame, which is guaranteed at least four games on NBC next 
year. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 NBA superscout Marty Blake didn't make many friends on Tobacco Road with his 
recent comments concerning Eric Montross, North Carolina's All-American center. 
He stopped short of calling him a stiff, but it was clear that Blake wasn't a 
huge fan. The reactions: "Eric, I think, is a tremendous (NBA) prospect," Tar 
Heel Coach Dean Smith said. And this from Clemson Coach Cliff Ellis, who 
described Montross as a "monster," but in the Shaq O'Neal sense: "(Montross) 
would be an impact player right now in the NBA. In my opinion, he would do what 
Shaquille O'Neal would, if not better." 
</P>
<P>
 As teams begin to position themselves for NCAA tournament seedings, remember 
this when handicapping the No. 1 Midwest spot: The Big Eight Conference is 5-0 
vs. Big Ten teams so far. Does that mean Kansas or Missouri might get the edge 
over, say, Indiana or Purdue? Maybe. . . . Loren Meyer, a 6-11 junior center 
from Iowa State, isn't expected to return to the Cyclones' lineup until at 
least the Big Eight tournament March 11. Actually, he's lucky to be back at all 
after a slow-moving train (as if it would matter) struck a friend's pickup 
truck--Meyer was on the passenger's side--during a recent early morning. Meyer, 
who suffered a broken right collarbone in the accident, was leading the league 
in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA scouts are flocking to Connecticut games these days. Depending on whom you 
believe, Huskie junior forward Donyell Marshall is rated the No. 2 pro prospect 
behind Purdue forward Glenn Robinson. Connecticut is 17-1. Two seasons ago, 
Connecticut got off to a 16-1 start, but Coach Jim Calhoun probably doesn't 
want history to repeat itself. The Huskies finished 20-10 that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Big Eight team but Iowa State and Colorado has won a conference road 
game this season. Colorado's difficulties shouldn't come as a surprise. In 
their last 74 league road games, the Buffs are 1-73. Top 10

 Marty Clark tipped in Grant Hill's miss with three seconds to play, lifting 
No. 2 Duke over Notre Dame, 74-72, Wednesday at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Monty Williams scored 34 points for Notre Dame (5-12). But the Irish, who led 
by 12 points late in the first half, made a turnover with 14 seconds to play, 
setting up Clark's tiebreaking tap. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill drove toward the basket and pulled up for a 10-footer that rolled off the 
rim. Clark came from the left side for the tap to give Duke (14-1) the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils won their 87th consecutive nonconference home game. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Kansas 62, Oklahoma State 61 -- Steve Woodberry made a three-pointer 
with 1.5 seconds to play in overtime, giving Kansas the Big Eight victory at 
Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Burley made a free throw with 10.4 seconds left, putting Oklahoma State 
(13-6, 2-2) ahead, 61-59. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kansas took the rebound on the missed second free throw, Woodberry 
swished the game-winner. He led Kansas (18-2, 3-1) with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 North Carolina 90, Florida State 77 -- Derrick Phelps scored a 
career-high 22 points and Dante Calabria added 20 to lead the Tar Heels in an 
Atlantic Coast Conference game at Tallahassee, Fla. North Carolina (16-3, 4-2) 
scored the first 12 points and led, 47-29, at halftime. The Tar Heels held on 
in the second half after Florida State (8-7, 1-6) pulled to within 11 points on 
two occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Kentucky 79, South Carolina 67 -- Jared Prickett sparked a second-half 
run with a tip-in and layup off a steal and grabbed a career-high 17 rebounds 
to lift the Wildcats over South Carolina in a Southeastern Conference game at 
Lexington, Ky. Jeff Brassow equaled a career high with 25 points as Kentucky 
(15-3, 5-2) won its 32nd consecutive game in Rupp Arena. South Carolina is 
5-10, 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Indiana 78, No. 17 Minnesota 66 -- Damon Bailey scored 19 points and 
set an Indiana record for three-point baskets in a Big Ten game at Bloomington, 
Ind. Bailey's four three-pointers gave him 149 for his career, one more than 
the record set last year by Calbert Cheaney. Indiana (12-3, 5-1) led by seven 
points at halftime and held off a brief rally by Minnesota (13-5, 4-2) in the 
closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 Maryland 73, Clemson 53 -- Duane Simpkins matched his career high with 
18 points, including eight in a pivotal second-half run in an ACC game at 
College Park, Md. Maryland (12-3, 5-1) never trailed in its fourth consecutive 
victory. Kyle Freeman had a career-best 16 points and Sharone Wright had 13 
rebounds for Clemson (10-8, 1-5). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 20 Alabama Birmingham 62, DePaul 59 -- Carter Long scored 21 points and 
sparked a second-half spree that lifted the Blazers in a Great Midwest game at 
Birmingham. Long had seven points during a 16-4 run that put UAB (15-2, 3-1) 
ahead, 55-46. DePaul is 12-4, 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina State 84, No. 21 Georgia Tech 78 -- Guards Lakista McCuller and 
Curtis Marshall scored 19 points each to lead the Wolfpack in an ACC game at 
Raleigh, N.C. North Carolina State (6-10, 2-4) watched a 17-point lead dwindle 
to three late in the game behind the play of James Forrest, who finished with 
28 points and 13 rebounds. But the Wolfpack went 17 for 23 from the free-throw 
line to hold on. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 23 Saint Louis 76, No. 22 Marquette 66 -- Erwin Claggett scored 20 of his

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; GOLDEN WEST WOMEN EXTEND WINNING STEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Julie Murdent and Nicole Quinn gave Golden West a strong inside advantage and 
helped the Rustlers to a 65-55 victory over Fullerton in an Orange Empire 
Conference women's game Wednesday at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gives Golden West (24-3, 6-0 in conference) a two-game lead at the 
halfway point in the conference race. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 23rd consecutive conference victory and the 64th consecutive home 
victory for Golden West, the top-ranked team in Southern California. Fullerton 
was the last team to beat Golden West at home when the Hornets did it in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdent, a freshman forward from Fountain Valley High, had 22 points, 
including 14 in the second half. Quinn, a freshman reserve forward from 
Woodbridge High, had a season-high 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West was able to control the game because of strong rebounding. The 
Rustlers held a 75-30 advantage in rebounding, including a 45-12 margin in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdent had 15 rebounds, 12 offensive, and Kristin Brun and Katie Miner had 14 
rebounds each. Brun also scored 11 points, her high this season in conference 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was another ugly win for us," Golden West Coach Dave Stricklin said. "We 
haven't shot well for a while now. But someone always seems to step up. 
Tonight, it was Nicole Quinn. It's been exciting for us as coaches to get to 
the gym each night and see who it's going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (16-11, 4-2) got within 52-47 with 6 minutes 21 seconds left but 
Golden West went on a 9-0 run. Quinn had five points and Murdent had four in 
the run. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Orange Empire Conference women's games: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast 82, Rancho Santiago 50 -- Coach Mike Thornton, in his fifth 
season at Orange Coast, got his 100th career victory. Thornton, who guided OCC 
to its first appearance in the State tournament last season, has a career mark 
of 100-51. LeAnn Kazmer, who missed last Friday's game because of a sore knee, 
scored a game-high 26 points for Orange Coast (16-9, 4-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside 62, Cypress 60 -- Audrey McMurry got a rebound with 18 seconds left 
and host Riverside (20-8, 3-3) was able to run out the clock. McMurry finished 
with 20 points. Yolanda Hearvey (15 points) made two free throws with about 30 
seconds left to cut the lead to 61-60. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange Empire Conference men's games: 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 94, Golden West 80 -- Tyrone Merriweather, a sophomore forward, 
scored 30 points and added 11 rebounds for host Fullerton (20-6, 5-2), which 
has won five in a row. Kevin Carlson added 16 points for the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobie Priest had 21 and Greg Vanden Ordel added 18 for Golden West (8-14, 
1-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago 88, Orange Coast 66 -- Sean Amos scored 23 points and Nathan 
Small had 15 for Rancho Santiago (16-8, 4-3). Chauncey Woolridge scored 34 
points and had nine rebounds for Orange Coast (1-11, 1-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside 71, Cypress 69 (OT) -- Cypress' Mike McGuire missed a three-pointer 
and teammate Jim Falletta missed a tip-in as time ran out. Host Cypress (10-16, 
1-6) scored the final five points of regulation to force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Cummins had 17 points for Cypress and Darryle Flicking had 19 for 
Riverside (20-5, 6-1).

BOYS' SOCCER ROUNDUP; LAGUNAS' GOAL ON PENALTY SHOT GETS SANTA ANA PAST 
HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BARZILAI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ninth-ranked Santa Ana beat a surprisingly resilient Huntington Beach team, 
4-3, in a seesaw Sunset League boys' soccer game Wednesday at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Lagunas' penalty-shot goal with two minutes remaining in the game 
gave Santa Ana (10-4-2, 7-1-1 in league) the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagunas' goal came five minutes after Huntington Beach's Demetrio Ordaz had 
scored his second goal of the game on a penalty shot, tying the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordaz got the penalty shot after Santa Ana's Jorge Valdez inadvertently 
cleared the ball out of the penalty box with his hand. However, the two 
officials apparently saw the play differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The referee on the side it happened didn't think it was a penalty shot," 
Santa Ana Coach Bob Pacieznik said. "But the other official was convinced of 
the call." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana controlled most of the game. The Saints took a 1-0 lead early in the 
first half when Gerardo Velasquez scored on a crossing pass from Jose Cadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach (5-9-1, 2-6-1) had two shots in the first half; Santa Ana, 
which led, 1-0, at halftime, had 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we really controlled the first half," Pacieznik said. "Our defense 
did give up a few weak goals, though, later in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Four minutes into the second half, Ordaz scored for the Oilers, tying the 
score, 1-1. Santa Ana built its lead to 3-1 on goals by Valdez and Velasquez. 
It was Velasquez's second goal of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers battled back, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huntington Beach is a really good team," Pacieznik said. "So I'm very happy 
with the win." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Mata made five saves in goal for Santa Ana. Dieter Bless had 10 for 
Huntington Beach. PETER BARZILAI

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; UNIVERSITY RUNS WILD TO BEAT CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 University's loose interpretation of basketball annoyed, badgered and 
generally unnerved another opponent Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the Trojans played it their way in a 68-63 Sea View League victory over 
Corona del Mar at University. They ran, they pressed-to-stress and threw 
caution, not to mention shots, to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 It was enough to make a coach shake his head, which Corona del Mar's Paul 
Orris was doing afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about playing the transition game when we wanted to, not just 
because University was doing it," Orris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but the Trojans had other ideas. The Sea Kings (11-9, 3-5) are generally a 
pick-and-pass team who work their half-court offense, but University would have 
none of that. The Sea Kings were pulled into a chaotic style. 
</P>
<P>
 University (12-7, 5-3) employed a variety of presses, when they didn't work, 
the Trojans got physical. They had three players foul out, but forced 29 
turnovers, including four in the final 1 minute 33 seconds that helped preserve 
a one-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali Amiri (17 points) made two free throws with 30 seconds left to give the 
Trojans a 66-63 lead. The Sea Kings missed a three-point attempt, then had one 
more turnover left in them. It resulted in a layup by Demitrius Zeigler. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel other teams should adjust to our style, we don't need to adjust to 
theirs," Zeigler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeigler, Orange County's leading scorer, emphasized that point. He suffered 
through a terrible game as a shooter, but he that didn't let that slow him 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeigler scored 30 points, but made only eight of 20 shots, including two of 
eight three-pointers. But, in the fourth quarter, he found his touch. He made 
four of five shots and scored 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice, Corona del Mar tied the score and both times Zeigler answered. 
</P>
<P>
 He sank a three-pointer to give the Trojans a 61-58 lead with 2:22 left. He 
then stole the inbound pass and scored to give them a five-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeigler then made a free throw with 1:33 left to give University a 64-63 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what you have done through three quarters, the fourth quarter is 
it," said Zeigler, who made 12 of 18 free throws. "You have to step up. That's 
what makes superstars." 
</P>
<P>
 It also helps to be in a free-wheeling system with a shot-it-if-you-got-it 
philosophy. The Trojans fired up 22 three-point attempts, making eight. That 
included Dustin White's heave from well-behind the three-point line with less 
than two minutes left and the Trojans nursing a one-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But such madness can create havoc and the Sea Kings couldn't handle it. They 
turned the ball over 13 times in the first quarter and trailed, 37-26, at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramin Bastani scored 16 of his 27 points in the second half to bring the Sea 
Kings back. But, in the end, they were out of their element. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has been able to do what they wanted against us," Coach Mike Dinneen 
said. CHRIS FOSTER

Woodbridge to a 50-46 victory over Santa Margarita, the fifth-ranked team in

<P>
 Santa Margarita (15-5, 7-1) trailed late in regulation, but Brad Finneran's

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal scored 36 points on 17-for-20 shooting and Orlando set team 
records with 65% shooting and its fifth consecutive victory, 145-120, over 
Charlotte on Wednesday night at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic made 20 of 24 shots in the fourth quarter to turn a six-point lead 
entering the period into a 27-point advantage. O'Neal was seven for nine in the 
fourth quarter, with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal's much anticipated matchup with Alonzo Mourning never materialized. 
Mourning left the game with a bruised left calf with 9:30 to play in the first 
quarter after being kicked accidentally by Scott Skiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic rookie Anfernee Hardaway scored a career-high 32 points, and also had 
nine rebounds and nine assists, and Nick Anderson had 29 points for the Magic. 
Eddie Johnson scored 29 points and Hersey Hawkins 23 for the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 116, Phoenix 107 -- Stacey Augmon made all six of his shots as the 
Hawks made 81% of their shots in the first quarter, built an 18-point lead and 
then held off a late rush by the Suns at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins led the Hawks with 26 points and Mookie Blaylock had 25 
points and 11 assists as Atlanta improved its record to 28-10, best in the 
Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Ceballos matched his career high with 40 points for the Suns, who 
dropped their sixth game in nine outings, all with Charles Barkley and Kevin 
Johnson out with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 104, Dallas 90 -- Dana Barros scored 22 points and Clarence 
Weatherspoon had 16 points and 10 rebounds at Philadelphia as the 76ers handed 
the Mavericks their 15th consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Weatherspoon has had double figures in points and rebounds 21 times in 40 
games this season. Rookie Shawn Bradley scored 20 points and Jeff Hornacek had 
16 points and nine assists for the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the 38th in 40 games for the Mavericks, whose only two victories 
this season came against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 108, Detroit 92 -- Latrell Sprewell scored 15 of his 27 points in 
the fourth quarter, helping the Warriors hold off the Pistons at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit played without forward Sean Elliott, who spent the night in an Oakland 
hospital undergoing treatment for inflammation of the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons, losers of 17 of 18 games, erased a 15-point third-quarter deficit 
to pull into a 79-79 tie on Joe Dumars' layup with 7:55 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Sprewell took over, scoring nine of the Warriors' next 11 points after an 
81-81 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 103, Miami 98 -- The Celtics extended their season-best winning streak 
to six games, surviving a desperation comeback at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics led, 99-87, before baskets by Glen Rice, Rony Seikaly and Matt 
Geiger made it 99-93 with 24 seconds to play. Geiger's dunk made it 100-95 with 
14 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Brown made a free throw for Boston, and Miami's last hope vanished when 
Brian Shaw's three-pointer fell short with 7.0 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 100, Utah 98 -- Chuck Person, who missed the three previous games 
because of a foot infection, made a 20-foot shot with 1.9 seconds to play at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Person, hospitalized last week because of an inflammation of connective tissue 
in his left foot, scored 22 points as the Timberwolves beat Utah for only the 
fifth time in 24 games since joining the NBA in 1989. The Jazz won eight of the 
previous nine meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Laettner also had 22 points for Minnesota. Karl Malone had 33 points 
and 14 rebounds for the Jazz.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: DEPLETED BUT NOT DEFEATED, CHAPMAN 
PROVES LESS IS ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After sending more than half his team home from a three-game trip for 
disciplinary reasons last week, Chapman men's basketball Coach Mike Bokosky had 
to make some drastic changes for the final two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing foul trouble with only six players available, he decided to go with a 
match-up zone against Dominican and Menlo. To fight fatigue, he instructed his 
players to rest on offense by holding the ball until about 15 seconds were left 
on the shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate measures? Maybe, but they were effective. After suffering their 
worst defeat of the season, a 107-69 rout by Fresno Pacific with a full squad 
of 13 players last Wednesday, the Panthers -- all six of them -- beat Dominican 
and Menlo on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bokosky had sent home seven players, including three starters, Thursday 
morning after they violated team rules, including missing the curfew, after the 
Fresno Pacific game. The seven -- starters Greg Reynolds, Umahl Anderson and 
Aaron Cornell and reserves Adam Dzierzynski, Edgar Diaz, Steve Van Horn and Rod 
Summers -- were driven home by assistant coach Terry Boesel, who caught a 
flight back to join the team for the Dominican game in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the remaining players -- freshman guard Toby Curto, sophomore forward 
Chris Hacker and junior forward Jason Roczey -- were among the four least-used 
players on the Panthers' traveling squad. 
</P>
<P>
 But with senior guard Brian Wood, junior center Stefan Mumaw, and junior guard 
Anthony Gonzales, they made an effective team. 
</P>
<P>
 Bokosky said Chapman opponents seemed to take the Panthers lightly in their 
weakened state and he compared his team to an animal in a trap that will take 
extreme measures to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our players became very intent and they were focused -- I hate to use that 
word, focus, because it was the Laker phrase of the '80s -- but it's true," 
Bokosky said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an extreme example, but our players were that wounded animal. They would 
do anything to survive. They rebounded better, they played defense better. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew they were in deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Mumaw, a former University High player who transferred from Cuesta College, 
and Gonzales, a transfer from East Los Angeles College, led the charge. Mumaw 
had 22 points and Gonzales had 19 in the 80-73 victory over Dominican, an NAIA 
school. Gonzales, who made 50% of his three-point shots in the two games (11 of 
22), scored 20 and Mumaw scored 13 in the 60-59 victory over Menlo, an NCAA 
Division III team that had defeated UC San Diego, 80-78, the night before. 
Curto scored 14 and Wood 13. 
</P>
<P>
 No Panther fouled out in either game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bokosky met with the seven suspended players Monday at Chapman and said there 
will be no further disciplinary action. He declined to give details of the 
infractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Cornell, a senior captain, said he and the other players involved 
preferred not to comment about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gitte Mejer, Concordia's record-breaking center, was named the Golden State 
Athletic Conference women's player of the week for the third consecutive week 
-- no other player has received the honor this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer, who is averaging 36.1 points in her last seven games and set 
single-game scoring records of 47 and 53 in consecutive victories, scored 31 
before fouling out with six seconds left during an 80-77 loss to Azusa Pacific 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia (10-8, 2-2 in the conference) will play host to Chapman (3-14) at 
7:30 tonight. On Saturday, the Eagles have their homecoming game against 
Southern California College (16-4, 2-1). The women's game is at 5:30 p.m. and 
will be followed at 7:30 by the men's game. 
</P>
<P>
 The SCC men's team (9-11, 0-4) has been depleted by injuries and medical 
problems and is looking for its first conference victory. Concordia (13-7, 2-2) 
has its strongest men's team in Greg Marshall's four years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The time of Chapman men's basketball game against Patten College Thursday, 
Feb. 3, has been changed to 3 p.m. from 7:30, Chapman announced this week. The 
game was originally scheduled for the Occidental tournament Dec. 31 but Patten 
didn't send a team because of ill players. Chapman's Athletic Hall of Fame 
induction dinner at the Doubletree Hotel in Orange will follow the game at 6 
p.m. Marvin Decker, and former Panther basketball players, and Eva Brown, a 
former softball player, will be inducted into the hall. Decker, a 1959 graduate 
who started four seasons for Chapman, averaged 10 points. He is a teacher and 
coach in the Orange Unified School District. Brown, a 1980 graduate who also 
played at Golden West, batted .325 for the Panthers. A Santa Ana resident, 
Brown works as an operations manager for Federal Express. . . . Former Ram 
All-Pro and Notre Dame All-American receiver Jack Snow will give the keynote 
address. Tickets are $35 and proceeds go to the university's scholarship fund.

PARK PLACES AGOURA IN LEAGUE LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agoura High backup guard Mike Park took only two shots Wednesday night against 
Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were three-pointers that gave the Chargers leads, the second coming with 
one second to play and giving Agoura a 41-39 Marmonte league victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory left the Chargers (13-5, 7-1 in league play) alone in first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Park's three-pointer from the left baseline came after Westlake guard Steve 
Aylsworth (14 points) scored on a twisting lay-up to give the Warriors (10-5, 
4-3) the lead with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the biggest shot of my career," Park said. "Coach said anyone who 
was open could take the shot. I was a little surprised I was open." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Damon Blechen helped Agoura rally from an eight-point deficit midway 
through the third quarter by scoring nine of his 11 points in the final 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we just played tougher defense in the fourth quarter," Blechen said. 
"It wasn't too much of a lead to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake surged to an early 9-2 lead, helped by consecutive three-pointers by 
Aylsworth, who was making a rare start. Agoura came back in the second quarter, 
and Park's first three-pointer gave Agoura a 12-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After going six minutes without scoring, Billy Miller (13 points), playing on 
a sprained ankle, scored seven points to help give Westlake a 19-17 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura center Ben Richardson collided with Miller under the basket late in the 
third quarter and had to leave the game.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: PIERCE COACH LENDS HAND AT SCENE OF FREEWAY TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a sight and sound Mitch Graff won't soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Graff, an assistant baseball coach at Pierce College, was helping emergency 
personnel with injured people on the Golden State Freeway after last week's 
earthquake when LAPD motorcycle officer Clarence Wayne Dean plummeted to his 
death from the severed overpass that connects the Antelope Valley Freeway to 
the southbound Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Graff said he heard tires screeching, saw one headlight and then watched in 
horror as Dean's motorcycle drove off the edge. He said the accident happened 
about one hour after the earthquake hit at 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got over to him . . . he was bleeding very badly from the face," Graff 
said. "I looked at his stomach and there wasn't any movement. The paramedics 
said he was dead. . . . It was chaos once the sun came up. The paramedics gave 
me a blanket and asked me to cover (Dean). We didn't want the media all over 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Graff, who lives in Santa Clarita and owns a window-cleaning business, said he 
was working in Glendale that morning and rushed home on the Golden State 
Freeway after the earthquake. He stopped just south of the collapsed overpass 
and tried to lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "After (Dean's accident), I helped one guy who had a fractured foot and 
another guy who supposedly had broken ribs to the (rescue) helicopter," Graff 
said. "I didn't get a hold of my wife until 8:30 in the morning. One of the 
guys who (also) stopped had a cellular phone." CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Eyes on the Irish 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge basketball players admit they are excited about the 
prospect of playing against Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. But no one seems to 
be anticipating the trip as much as Coach Pete Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wouldn't love to walk the halls of Rockne?" Cassidy said this week after 
a practice at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion. "Being Irish Catholic and being raised in 
the spirit of Notre Dame. . . . My kids have been raised in the spirit of Notre 
Dame all their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy's oldest son, Kevin, will be flying missions for the Air National 
Guard this weekend, but the rest of the Cassidy clan -- wife Sandy and children 
Michael and Erin -- are making the trip with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of leaving the Northridge area for another trip at this time 
might be considered an inconvenience. Traveling to Chicago and Notre Dame is 
not just any trip, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Win or lose, it will be refreshing just to be back out there," guard Ryan 
Martin said. "And at a place with so much mystique too. Going to Notre Dame is 
almost like going on vacation. I know I'm not staying in my room. When we get 
in the day before, I want to go out and see everything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Middle blocker Debbie Bueche-Smith has announced that she will not return for 
her final season of eligibility at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Bueche-Smith, a 1990 graduate of Thousand Oaks High, is moving to Tennessee 
with her husband. The earthquake, Price said, was a major factor in their 
decision to leave Southern California. Bueche-Smith ranks ninth on the school's 
all-time list with 152 block assists and 181 total blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One national baseball periodical last season called Cal State Northridge's 
field the worst among NCAA Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody must have been listening. The school spent $25,000 to re-sod the 
infield and replace the infield dirt. Also, gravel has been placed on the 
perimeter warning track. JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Bounced Around 
</P>
<P>
 With the Pierce men's gym closed because of structural damage caused by the 
earthquake, Coach Ken Stanley and the Brahma men's volleyball team have become 
nomads. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas, traditionally one of the leading teams in the state, practiced at 
Pepperdine from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. every day last week. From this week on, they 
will practice three mornings at Pepperdine and one morning each at Agoura High 
and Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding a court to play matches when the season starts early next month 
hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to try to play (at the women's gym) at Valley," Stanley said, 
"but I haven't got a confirmation." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce was scheduled to play host on Feb. 12 to the North-South Classic, a 
tournament with teams from throughout the state and Utah, but Stanley said it 
probably will be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how we could do it," Stanley said. "They (Pierce officials) are 
trying to get the gym back in operating order but they have no idea when that 
will be." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Having mulled it over during the fall semester, Cheaza Figueroa of Antelope 
Valley has decided to compete for the Marauders' track team this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa, the 1993 state champion in the girls' triple jump for Quartz Hill 
High, originally planned to compete for a local track club this year. She 
changed her mind, however, after realizing that this is the last year she can 
compete at the junior (age 19 and under) level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at competing in the junior nationals and that definitely got the 
spark going again," said Figueroa, who also placed third in the 100-meter low 
hurdles and fourth in the long jump in last year's state meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The multi-talented Figueroa plans to focus on the triple jump and the 
seven-event heptathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm most definitely interested in the heptathlon," Figueroa said. "I want to 
see what my potential is in that event." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Figueroa is a novice in three (javelin, shotput and 800) of the 
heptathlon's seven events, she is capable of scoring a lot of points in the 
other four, the 200, 100 hurdles, high jump and long jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mark Covert, who is known for his distance-running expertise, applauded 
Figueroa's change of heart. "She makes our team much better," he said. "She's 
going to make me look like a great multi-event coach."

TENNIS / AUSTRALIAN OPEN; GRAF, SANCHEZ VICARIO REACH FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steffi Graf, seeking her fourth Australian Open title in seven years but her 
first since 1990, overpowered Kimiko Date, 6-3, 6-3, today to set up a final 
against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario, who had lost in the semifinals the last three years, defeated 
Gabriela Sabatini, 6-1, 6-2, to reach her first Australian Open final. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf won the first nine points of the match and quickly opened a 5-1 lead. She 
finished the first set in 31 minutes, then broke serve in the opening and 
closing games of the second set and completed the match in 61 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a match we both didn't have a lot of rhythm," the top-seeded 
Graf said. "She went for a lot of shots and she made a lot of them, but she 
also made some errors. I expected today a tougher match than it ended up." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf won the Australian Open in 1988, 1989 and 1990. The last three years it 
was won by Monica Seles, who is still recovering after being stabbed in the 
back during a match last April. 
</P>
<P>
 Date, seeded 10th, was the first Japanese player in the semifinal of a Grand 
Slam tournament since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 Sanchez Vicario, mixing hard ground strokes with delicate drop shots, 
finished off No. 4 Sabatini in 65 minutes, winning the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf has a 21-5 record against Sanchez Vicario. But the last time Graf lost in 
a Grand Slam tournament to anyone other than Seles was to Sanchez Vicario in 
the quarterfinals of the 1992 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid. I'm going to play my own game -- she's the one under 
pressure," Sanchez Vicario said. "She's beatable. She's human, she's not a 
machine." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, third-seeded Jim Courier had his Grand Slam attitude back, 
beating No. 5 Goran Ivanisevic in straight sets to advance to the semifinals 
against top-seeded Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 Another American, Todd Martin, will face Sweden's Stefan Edberg in the other 
semifinal. It is the first time since 1982 three Americans are in the men's 
semifinals of the Australian Open.

SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE; IF THEY SEE IT, THEY WILL COME

<P>
 Skiers are skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
 Local ski operators swore the recent heat wave was not affecting man-made ski 
conditions at Big Bear, no matter that it felt like July. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, to convince the naysayers, the promotional department at Bear 
Mountain instructed its pitchman to hold up that day's newspaper on its live 
daily television spot to prove the resort wasn't using old footage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had great skiing for a month," Libby Coleman, a Bear Mountain 
spokeswoman, said Wednesday. "But people have this myth about man-made snow, 
that it's something different. But it's all water and air." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, most people need to see snow in the mountains before they 
invest the drive time. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder local operators are delighted with the recent winter storm that 
dropped up to a foot of snow in the local mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like winter now," Greg Ralph, a Snow Summit spokesman, said. "It 
makes a huge difference. The earthquake didn't hurt us nearly as much as the 
warm weather. Warm weather killed us, we were dying off. The people that come 
up, we do exit surveys when they leave and they say, 'I had no idea it was this 
good.' "

 Despite the fact that conditions are not much improved over last week, Ralph 
said business is up about 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really blame them," Ralph said of the skiers. "They want to see 
snow on the side of the road, they want to put on chains, they want traffic. 
But it's not necessary. They could have come up last week and had just as much 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 This week's storm did provide enough new snow to reopen some beginner terrain 
at Mt. Baldy and Ski Sunrise in Wrightwood, which had been closed because of 
lack of snow. 
</P>
<P>
 However, while Mt. Waterman and Kratka Ridge received about six inches, the 
resorts are unable to operate. Lynn Newcomb, owner of Mt. Waterman, said the 
resort will need another foot of snow to open.

 After a slow start, World Cup overall champion Marc Girardelli is back on 
track and making a run at his unprecedented sixth overall title and, possibly, 
his first Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli, the Austrian who skis for Luxembourg, won his first race of the 
season last weekend, a super-giant slalom at Wengen, Switzerland, and moved 
into second place in the overall standings behind Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the 43rd of Girardelli's World Cup career, second only to the 
retired Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden, who won 86 races. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Girardelli says winning an Olympic gold medal is not important to him, 
the circuit's best all-around skier for the last decade appears poised to 
strike in any event at the upcoming Olympic Games at Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli, who began as a strong technical skier and later developed his 
speed skills, is skiing better right now in downhill and super-G than in the 
slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 His super-G victory at Wengen followed a second-place finish in the Wengen 
downhill last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ski Notes

 The Olympic freestyle team, named last weekend at Lake Placid, N.Y., is led by 
Donna Weinbrecht, defending Olympic gold medalist in moguls, and Trace 
Worthington, the reigning men's World Cup overall champion. The men's team also 
includes aerial specialists Eric Bergoust, Kris Fedderson and mogul specialists 
Troy Benson, Craig Rodman and Sean Smith. The women's team also includes moguls 
specialists Ann Battelle, Liz McIntyre and aerialists Tracy Evans, Kriste 
Porter and Nikki Stone. Worthington injured right knee ligaments three weeks 
ago but returned last week to finish third at Lake Placid, an indication that 
he should be ready for the Olympics. Weinbrecht extended her unbeaten World Cup 
streak to five last weekend with a victory at Lake Placid. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Olympics approaching, American AJ Kitt showed some signs of life when 
he finished 12th last weekend at the Wengen downhill. It was Kitt's best finish 
since his 11th place at Val Gardena, Italy, before Christmas. "I'm on my way 
back," Kitt said after the race. "I feel I'm skiing well. It's not a great 
result -- I'm not on the podium and that's where I want to be -- but it's 
getting better." America had four skiers finish in the top 30 at Wengen: Kitt, 
Tommy Moe (19th), Kyle Rasmussen (26th) and Craig Thrasher (30th).

 The Jeep/Eagle Tournament of Champions Ski Series concludes today at Heavenly, 
Calif., with 1976 Olympic gold medalist Franz Klammer seeking his first overall 
championship. The race will be televised by CBS this Sunday at 11 a.m. Klammer 
leads the men's division in the series, which matches former star skiers in 
handicapped races. Norway's Toril Forland leads the women's division.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK; MCGRATH SETS HIS GOALS HIGH

 The last time Jeremy McGrath rode his Honda motorcycle at Anaheim Stadium, he 
was just another hot, young Camel Supercross prospect. He had won the 125cc 
support class two years running but was still untested in the top-of-the-line 
250cc class. 
</P>
<P>
 His first two races of 1993 -- a fourth-place finish at Orlando, Fla., and a 
fifth at Houston -- did not prepare the motorcycling world for what was about 
to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim and its Coors Light Challenge was next. McGrath, 21, gave the 56,000 
spectators a demonstration of championship riding by winning his first Camel 
Supercross. Then he won five in a row and nine of the next 13 to become the 
first rookie stadium champion in American Motorcyclist Assn. history. His 10 
victories broke the record of nine set the previous year by Damon Bradshaw on a 
Yamaha. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, McGrath will be back at Anaheim Stadium for the Coors Light 
Challenge, race No. 3 in the 15-event series. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mickey Thompson stadium off-road race, scheduled last Saturday at Anaheim 
Stadium, was postponed to Feb. 12 because of earthquake damage. However, 
officials of both the Thompson Entertainment Group and the city of Anaheim said 
the damage, which was limited to the scoreboard area, posed no safety threat to 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to win a second championship," McGrath said. "I want to do it by 
winning 11 or more races in one season." 
</P>
<P>
 Such brash talk did not go unnoticed among his supercross peers, but when the 
youngster from Murrieta beat the best in the world in Japan and France during 
the winter, he silenced the skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
 First, McGrath won $50,000 in the Golden Cup Supercross in Fukuoka City, 
Japan, beating fellow Americans Brian Swink, Steve Lamson, Larry Ward and 
Michael Craig. A week later, he was in Paris, where he won the Bercy 
Supercross, generally considered the premier event in Europe. Among those 
beaten was Greg Albertyn, newly crowned world 250cc champion from South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath is well on his way to his projected 11 victories, having won the 
Orlando and Houston races before the series headed West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd also like to get Rick Johnson's record 28 career wins," he said. McGrath 
will be going for his 13th at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The riders most likely to challenge McGrath are Mike LaRocco of La Porte, 
Ind., and Mike Kiedrowski of Canyon Country, two Kawasaki factory riders. 
LaRocco finished second in both races this season and also won the national 
500cc outdoor championship in 1993. Kiedrowski finished second to McGrath in 
the stadium series last year and later won the national 250cc outdoor title. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiedrowski and McGrath, along with Jeff Emig of Highland, brought the United 
States its 13th consecutive Motocross des Nations title in Schwanenstadt, 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 Former three-time national supercross champion Jeff Stanton, McGrath's Honda 
teammate, is also back, hoping to dethrone his youthful partner and become the 
first rider to win four titles. The Sherwood, Mich., rider won in 1989, 1990 
and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing this year are Bradshaw, the 1990 and 1992 Anaheim winner who turned 
his back on a multimillion-dollar contract and quit motocross last November; 
and Guy Cooper, who retired from stadium racing at 31. Cooper will be on hand 
to be presented the Mickey Thompson Award of Excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzuki rider Damon Huffman of Saugus, who won the 125cc race last year at 
Anaheim, will return as the favorite in the smaller displacement event. Huffman 
also won last year's Rose Bowl race. Pedro Gonzales, the Mexican supercross 
champion, will also ride in the 125cc race. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the only Los Angeles-area appearance of the supercross riders. 
The series will be at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 DRAG RACING -- Darrell Alderman, two-time National Hot Rod Assn. pro stock 
champion, will return to racing next week in the Chief Winternationals at 
Pomona Raceway, opening event of the NHRA season. Alderman has been suspended 
for two years because of drug use. . . . Ed (Ace) McCulloch will drive baseball 
player Jack Clark's Taco Bell top-fuel car at the Winternationals. After 10 
seasons driving for Larry Minor, McCulloch, 51, lost his ride when Minor 
switched to Cory McClenathan as his driver this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The second day of the Budweiser Warm-Up, rained out last Sunday, has been 
rescheduled for Friday at noon and Saturday at 9 a.m. at Bakersfield Raceway. 
Kenny Bernstein ran a top-fuel track record 297.71 m.p.h. on Saturday. Shelly 
Anderson ran 293.82 with a quicker elapsed time than Bernstein, 4.87 seconds to 
4.88. 
</P>
<P>
 SPRINT CARS -- Southern California's two non-winged sprint car organizations 
are apparently going head to head this year. The long-established California 
Racing Assn., which sometimes had trouble filling its fields last year, will 
open its season Feb. 5 at Canyon Raceway, near Tucson. The newly formed Sprint 
Car Racing Assn. will open its 30-race season the same night at Manzanita 
Speedway in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kinser, 13 times World of Outlaws champion, will become the first 
short-track driver to compete in the International Race of Champions. Kinser, 
who last Sunday won the 10-race Slick 50 World Series at Canyon Raceway, will 
compete against stock car drivers Dale Earnhardt, Rusty Wallace and Mark Martin 
and sports car drivers Geoff Brabham, Scott Sharp, Juan Manuel Fangio II and 
Tom Kendall when the IROC starts Feb. 18 at Daytona Beach, Fla. Indy car 
drivers will be named later. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- Sandie Simkins, wife of the late Danny Simkins, accepted his 
Santa Maria Speedway track championship trophy before a capacity crowd at the 
awards banquet. Simkins, who died last Nov. 28 after a long bout with cancer, 
won his 10th championship in a 30-year career. The Danny Simkins Award of 
Excellence was presented to Bobbie Miller, who has been with the speedway since 
it opened in 1964. . . . Speedway Videos has released a 60-minute video, "Danny 
Simkins, a Profile in Courage," designed to raise money to pay medical bills 
incurred during Simkins' long illness. The tape is available for $24 from 
Speedway Videos, P. O. Box 3253, Paso Robles, Calif. 93447. . . . Racing in the 
KCF Challenge series at Kern County Raceway in Willow Springs will resume Feb. 
13 after two earthquake-related postponements.

OFF THE TICKER: MAIL ORDERS RISE AS THAW WRAPS UP

<P>
 "Send me the warmest thing you've got" is the common plea heard recently by 
telephone operators at mail-order clothing retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the brief thaw, customers are ringing mail-order phones off their 
hooks as another wintry blast is set to descend late this week. Warm garments 
are going like hot cakes to customers too cold to travel to the mall and caught 
off guard by record low temperatures and icy roads. 
</P>
<P>
 At leading mail-order retailers L. L. Bean and Lands' End, supplies are 
getting mighty thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Even catalogues that don't exactly specialize in winter gear are getting a 
boost from the cold. Victoria's Secret, which sells lingerie, said sales of 
conservative long underwear have boomed.

Wednesday's auction to the lowest level since October.The high yield was 5.10%, 
down from 5.19% at the last auction Dec. 22. It was the lowest rate since 
five-year notes sold for 4.81% on Oct. 27. The notes will carry a coupon 
interest rate of 5%, with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,956.40. A 
total of $12.03 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling $28.68 billion.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. stocks closed modestly higher Wednesday, led largely by consumer, 
banking and utility issues. Japanese stocks surged. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields retreated even though the government's auction of new 
five-year notes was disappointing. Gold prices rose. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The market ran through another active session with buyers firmly in command, 
on the heels of President Clinton's State of the Union address Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials closed up 12.66 points to 3,908.00, and broader market 
indexes all gained. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners topped losers 12 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange on volume of 305 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said renewed interest in some consumer stocks helped the market's 
tone, after tobacco and food giant Philip Morris reported 1993 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a lack of surprises in Clinton's speech may have relieved some 
investors, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, shares surged as foreign investors continued to pile into the 
market. Growing hopes that the government may still get political reform bills 
passed -- despite last week's defeat of the measures in Parliament -- helped 
sentiment. The Nikkei index jumped 489.85 points to 19,138.21. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris shares gained 1 3/8 to 59 1/4, boosting the Dow, though the 
firm reported fourth-quarter operating earnings down 33%. Analysts said Morris' 
troubled tobacco operations are gaining market share and may regain some price 
flexibility this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tobacco issues rising included American Brands, up 1 to 35, and Loews, 
up 7/8 to 96 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Morris' earnings report also may have helped other food companies. Kellogg 
rose 3/4 to 56 1/4, Heinz added 1/2 to 35 1/4, Campbell Soup gained 1/2 to 39 
3/8 and Ralston Purina jumped 1 3/8 to 42. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks were also strong. Johnson & Johnson rose 1 to 41 7/8, Pfizer 
added 3/4 to 62 3/4 and Alza soared 1 1/2 to 26 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restaurant issues sparked to life. Lone Star Steakhouses zoomed 1 1/4 to 22 
1/4, Cheesecake Factory jumped 7/8 to 35 1/8 and Fresh Choice rose 1 1/4 to 28. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among industrial issues responding to earnings, Scott Paper gained 2 1/8 to 
45 1/2. It reported lower 1993 earnings, but said it will slash 25% of its 
jobs. Bethlehem Steel jumped 1 5/8 to 23 1/4 on its earnings report. But 
container maker Ball fell 2 to 26 after reporting disappointing results. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banking issues, many of which have been beaten down recently, revived. 
Citicorp soared 1 1/2 to 41 1/8, Chase gained 1 1/8 to 35 1/4, First Chicago 
jumped 1 to 44 5/8 and First Interstate added 1 1/8 to 66 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electric and phone utility stocks also revived. The Dow utility index jumped 
3.49 points, or 1.6%, to 221.46. Detroit Edison rose 5/8 to 29 1/4, Peco Energy 
added 5/8 to 28 1/8 and Southwestern Bell leaped 1 1/4 to 39 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, some riverboat casino stocks slumped after Missouri's 
Supreme Court ruled the state doesn't yet have laws in place to allow gambling. 
President Riverboat tumbled 3 3/4 to 20, Argosy Gaming fell 1 1/4 to 19 3/4 and 
Station Casinos sank 2 1/2 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index eased 7.9 points to 3,436.1. Frankfurt's DAX 
index closed at 2,119.17, down 7.61 points. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields fell as buyers were enticed into the market, despite a 
disappointing Treasury auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The government sold $12 billion in new five-year notes at a yield of 5.1%, 
slightly above expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the relatively light demand for the notes, the bid-to-cover ratio, 
which compares the number of bids offered to those accepted, was 2.38 to 1. 
That was lower than the average ratio of 2.76 to 1 in the last 12 auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the higher than expected yield on the five-year notes helped 
spur demand for that issue after the auction. That demand spilled into bonds of 
other maturities as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond was 6.30%, down from 
6.34% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, gold rebounded, with near-term futures on the New York Comex 
gaining $3.10 to $384.50 an ounce. Silver added 3.5 cents to $5.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Heating oil and natural gas futures prices soared on the New York Merc on 
signs that demand for heating fuels during last week's cold snap was stronger 
than traders thought. Home heating oil for February delivery jumped 2.41 cents 
to 52.31 cents a gallon; March natural gas surged 11.3 cents to $2.359 per 
1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, March crude oil futures gained 30 cents to $15.47 a barrel.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks finished an active session modestly higher Wednesday and last-minute 
rallies in a handful of stocks contributed to a closing surge for the Dow Jones 
industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields retreated as money managers and other large investors 
emerged to buy securities following the government's afternoon auction of $12 
billion in five-year notes. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said investors had sold stocks earlier in the week, fearing a 
negative surprise in President Clinton's State of the Union address on Tuesday. 
Stocks rose Wednesday on relief that Clinton's speech was as expected, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow finished the session 12.66 points higher at 3,908.00, but short of 
highs reached in the day's hectic, seesaw trading. Broader market indicators 
finished the day slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 304.66 million, against 326.12 million the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower long-term bond yields and stronger prices helped stocks, 
particularly interest rate-sensitive utilities. The possibility of lower 
interest rates also helped banks and smaller companies. The Nasdaq composite 
index rose 2.41 to 788.80.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: LAPTOPS RESPOND TO RIGHT ACCESSORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A laptop computer is an auxiliary to a desktop computer for many people, and 
it can become an even better partner with the addition of a few accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 CursorPower ($50, from North Shore Systems Inc. of Incline Village, Nev.; 
(702) 831-1108) does a great job of making the various cursor arrows and I-bars 
of Windows and OS/2 easily visible on a laptop computer's liquid crystal 
display screen. 
</P>
<P>
 You can choose from several sizes, shapes and colors of arrows and bars 
suitable for the various cursor types in Windows. Or you can design your own. 
Even on the large, high-resolution color screen on my laptop, I frequently lost 
track of the standard Windows cursors. CursorPower cured that problem. 
(Incidentally, it'll work just as well on a desktop monitor.) 
</P>
<P>
 The big advantage of a laptop is portability, but what about room-to-room 
portability within your home or office? 
</P>
<P>
 The Laptop Desktop ($199, available by mail from American Business Concepts in 
Dallas; (800) 877-4797) can enable you to move your laptop around. It is an 
easily movable desk on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed with a height-adjustable, tiltable laptop work surface and a large, 
adjacent flat surface to hold the papers or books you're working with, most 
parts of the Laptop Desktop are sturdy enough for their tasks. But the plastic 
tray that is supposed to hang below the work surface is too flimsy to bother 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 The system comes with a lamp on a flexible boom, a surge-protected power strip 
and a strong platform at the bottom to support a printer. The clever design 
will accommodate both left- and right-handed people and allow you to use the 
desktop with a variety of chairs, perhaps even a sofa. It will also let you 
work in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have both desktop and laptop computers, it is important to be able to 
link them so you can share files and programs. (Many software publishers 
authorize installation of their programs on more than one computer, as long as 
the program is used on one computer at a time.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are three basic kinds of programs to connect laptops and desktops: 
remote control software that lets you run the desktop computer over a telephone 
modem from the laptop, file transfer programs that let you easily and quickly 
copy files from one machine to the other, and file synchronization programs 
that keep data files updated from one machine to the other. Close-Up 5.0 ($199, 
from Norton-Lambert Corp. of Santa Barbara; (805) 964-6767) is an excellent 
remote-control program for running both DOS and Windows programs. Unlike 
competing programs, it easily enables you to work in high-resolution graphics 
mode in Windows on the desktop PC, yet drop down to lower screen resolution for 
remote use. That's often necessary to match the graphics capabilities of 
laptops and reduce the amount of screen image data being transferred. 
Performance on 9,600-bits-per-second or faster modems is acceptable in Windows 
once you get a program running and have loaded the file you'll be working with. 
Startup is slow, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Close-Up 5.0 has password protection, allows file transfers in either 
direction between the computers and can also function as a standard 
communications program to connect with on-line services such as CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling Software Inc. of Bothell, Wash., ((800) 662-2652) has long set the 
standard for laptop-desktop file transfer software with its LapLink product. 
Now it has an expanded package, called CommWorks for Windows ($199). 
</P>
<P>
 One of its modules, LapLink Remote, takes a different approach to remote 
computing. You run Windows programs on your laptop but have access to data 
files on the remote computer via a modem link. You can also print to the remote 
printer. It has the advantage of requiring less data to be transferred, but you 
can't run a program that you don't have on your local computer. 
</P>
<P>
 CommWorks for Windows also includes a fax module, TX FAX, for sending, 
receiving, editing and forwarding faxes. Another module, TS OnLine, is a 
powerful communications program for on-line access. LapLink V, the latest 
version of Traveling Software's standard file transfer program, is also 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 File Express ($149, from Synergy Communications Inc. of Santa Barbara; (800) 
999-7771) is a Windows program offering local and remote file management. You 
can use it in place of Windows File Manager program, gaining some advantages 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can also turn your desktop computer into a remote-access file server, 
complete with restrictions by ID name and password. This controls who can have 
access and what directories and files each remote user can reach. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a good product, for instance, to enable a sales force to call in, 
download the latest product files and deliver their sales reports. Access could 
be controlled so that no one could alter or delete the product files in the 
course of downloading, yet they could send in their own reports and even leave 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 File Express creates a log to record all activity, so it is easy to see who 
has called in and when. 
</P>
<P>
 The program looks a lot like the Windows File Manager on the screen, and it 
allows local and remote "drag and drop" movement of files and even entire 
directories. On the local computer, you can also use File Express to launch 
programs associated with data files. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another approach to file management is used by SmartSync for Windows 
($170, from Nomadic Systems Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.; (415) 335-4310). 
Basically, the program hides in the background while you use your usual Windows 
programs and keeps track of changes in the data files you create and modify. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you can synchronize the file contents with another computer equipped with 
SmartSync, connected either by modem or cable. By sending only the file changes 
between the two computers, there is less data to transfer. That could be a real 
boon if you need to keep large spreadsheet or database files synchronized 
between two or more computers. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have only a few files to keep synchronnized, the easiest way may be to 
use a floppy diskette and FileRunner for Windows ($100, from MBS Technologies 
Inc. of McMurray, Pa.; (412) 941-9076). It determines which files are new or 
updated and lets you decide which versions to keep. It can even compensate for 
time zone differences in determining which file is the latest version. 
</P>
<P>
 Files can be compressed to expand storage capacity on the floppy. You can also 
use multiple floppies as "runner" disks.

ANN CONWAY: SWEET ENDING FOR DRESDEN PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Society supporters gather with featured artists at the Center Club for a 
dessert buffet.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Orange County Philharmonic Society who attended the concert by 
the Dresden Philharmonic on Tuesday night at Segerstrom Hall were stunned by 
the photographs featured at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Displayed on the center's mezzanine level by the Dresden Philharmonic, the 
pictures 
</P>
<P>
 showed the once-beautiful German city after it was reduced to rubble by 
controversial Allied bombing raids during Word War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bombed the hell out of that town," noted Jack Caldwell, the Orange County 
Philharmonic activist who with his wife, Nancy, will chair its Golden Baton 
Gala on May 21 at the Four Seasons in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday night's performance, about 90 philharmonic supporters gathered 
with the concert's featured artists -- cellist Carter Brey, conductor Philippe 
Entremont and violinist Cho-Liang Lin -- at the Center Club for a dessert 
buffet of apple cobbler and strawberry shortcake. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercurrent: the conflict between the philharmonic's Golden Baton Gala 
and South Coast Repertory's End of Season Auction -- both on the books for May 
21. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've asked SCR to reconsider their date because we've had ours on the books 
since last June," said a philharmonic spokesman. Not to mention the fact that 
the event will celebrate the philharmonic's 40th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 (South Coast Repertory is trying to reschedule. "We picked the May date 
because we've always tried to shoehorn that event into July," said Sue Ann Van 
Gemert, SCR's director of advancement. "But we're not locked into it. We're 
looking at other dates. We understand the problem.") 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Caldwells are putting together an all-out smash, they say. The 
$200-per-person dinner will honor past Golden Baton recipients, including Henry 
Segerstrom, Donald Bren and Elaine Redfield, and feature entertainment by 
prominent local artists.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get real nostalgic (at the gala)," Jack Caldwell said. "Forty 
years is a long time. I don't think the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
would have gotten started if it wasn't for the philharmonic." 
</P>
<P>
 How does it feel to be co-chairing an event with his wife? "Oh, we're having a 
great time," Jack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deadpanned Nancy: "I'll tell you when it's over." 
</P>
<P>

 Partying with Opera Pacific: Celebrating publicly with opera stars Placido 
Domingo and Roberta Peters at recent post-performance bashes was great fun for 
fans of Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were some private parties held this week that kept the confetti 
flying. On Monday night, Bud and Paula Lingelbach of Laguna Beach held a dinner 
for opera buffs who flew to the French Riviera in August to hear presentations 
by the Monte Carlo opera. (FYI: Opera Pacific has high hopes of collaborating 
someday with the Monte Carlo Opera. Their dream -- a production presented in 
Monte Carlo and at Segerstrom Hall, with members of Monaco's royal family 
attending. Are we ready for Prince Ranier and Princess Caroline sitting 
resplendent in the First Tier? You bet.) 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Opera Pacific's director, David DiChiera, staged a dinner and 
concert in his Corona del Mar home for featured artists from "The Merry Widow." 
Among opera donors at the event was Sharon Jaquith, who almost fainted when 
opera stars Roberta Peters, Robin Follman and Fred Love sang "Happy Birthday" 
to her and presented her with flowers and balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Also attending the dinner were New York composer Lowell Lieberman, who is 
working on an opera called "The Picture of Dorian Gray," and pianist Alain 
Lefevre, who will perform with the Pacific Symphony at Segerstrom Hall next 
week.

 "In today's politically correct world, no one is daring to dig into these

 Mark Pearce, 17

</P>
<P>
 Shannon Dilday, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Ocean View 
</P>
<P>
 "I think sex education in our school is limited in what they can teach us 
because of the parents' concerns of what their child can hear and learn about 
sex. I believe we have the right to know about sex and AIDS . . . to educate us 
in the future so we can live safer and happier lives."

 San Kashani, 17

 "Dana Hills provides the basic knowledge that the students need to know. But 
after a certain point, it is the parents' responsibility to elaborate on what 
their child needs to know."

emotional sides to it."

 "The sex ed that I received in health class was very brief. It didn't go into

subject at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Ann Horning, 15 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Sonora 
</P>
<P>
 "Sex ed courses in school only cover the physical side to having sex. They 
teach you about protection from diseases and pregnancy, but fail to deal with 
the mental part of having sex. Many teens have sex before they are mentally 
ready to deal with it, because they feel they have to in order to keep their 
boyfriend with them. Teachers need to stress that sex is a big step in a 
relationship and unless teens are completely sure they want to and that they 
can be mature about it, they are not ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Briggs, 16 
</P>

 Tan Tran, 15

 "I think they are valuable because not a lot of kids get stuff on sex from

<P>
 junior, University 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not enough emphasis placed on the importance of abstinence. Safe sex 
</P>
<P>
 isn't 100% safe, and that is what teen-agers need to know."

 Genoa Sibold-Chon, 16

 Shari Brookler, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 "No, because they shy away from the subject of contraceptives. If they taught, 
among other things, how to correctly use them, they would not be promoting sex; 
rather, they would be teaching responsibility."

<P>
 San Clemente High School's population will soon appear a bit older, thanks to 
a three-month pilot program that will transport seniors from San Clemente 
Senior Center to volunteer at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senior Gold Card Program, so named because volunteers from the senior 
center will be given a gold card for a complimentary school lunch on the days 
they are at school, is intended to increase intergenerational contacts and 
boost self-esteem of both the volunteers and students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want very much for seniors to have the opportunity to become more engaged 
with the community in which they live and for students to benefit from . . . 
the expertise possessed by so many of our local seniors," said Kim Marshall, 
district coordinator of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will have the chance to tutor students, share stories about 
themselves, work in special interest areas, proctor tests, assist students in 
the library and counseling office and take part in other activities.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; MY TURN; ACCEPTING THE PAST -- HOLOCAUST AND 
ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA LENETZ, Dana Lenetz is a junior at Foothill High School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is an adage that holds, "Seeing is believing." But for a group of 
Oakland High School students who went to see the film "Schindler's List," 
seeing the atrocities of the Holocaust seemed merely to serve as a source for a 
hearty laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 On Martin Luther King Day, 69 Oakland high-schoolers were evicted from 
Oakland's Grand Lake Theater after many audience members complained of the 
derisive laughter from the students during the matinee showing of Steven 
Spielberg's "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie revolves around the plight of the European Jews during World War II 
and business entrepreneur Oskar Schindler's successful effort to save 1,100 
Jews from concentration camps and, ultimately, death. 
</P>
<P>
 After the eviction, school officials from Oakland said many of the students 
did not understand why they were asked to leave, and one chaperon even accused 
the theater officials of being racist. 
</P>
<P>
 But this incident stems far beyond racism and the politically correct mask 
that today's society dons with feigned interest. When society can sneer and 
laugh at the victimization and persecution of a people, then there is something 
certainly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 I am livid that another person has the audacity to watch a re-enactment of a 
German Nazi shooting a Jewish woman point-blank in the head and claim that it 
was not "realistic enough." 
</P>
<P>
 It both insults the survivors of the Holocaust and distorts the reality of the 
extermination of 6 million Jews and 6 million other Europeans to claim that 
these students are "desensitized to violence because they see it every day" and 
therefore excuse their insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 As a history student, I am sad to live in a time when half of all high school 
students do not know what the word "holocaust" means. As a part of the next 
generation, I am scared that one student was flippant enough to state that 
"(the war and Holocaust) was a long time ago and far away and about people we 
never met." 
</P>
<P>
 The Holocaust did occur approximately 50 years ago. Yet emotionally, the pain 
of generations murdered and relatives lost still scars the collective heart of 
Jews everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Until we, as the next generation, can understand and accept our past, we can 
never advance into the future. 
</P>
<P>
 And as philosopher and writer George Santayana once poignantly stated, "Those 
who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." 
</P>
<P>
 Or have we already?

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; MY TURN; EVERY EARTHQUAKE HAS A SILVER LINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Are earthquakes all bad? Some might say they are; after all, people die, get 
hurt, their homes crumble, businesses collapse. In addition to the tragedies, 
though, earthquakes bring benefits as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a resident of California who constantly experiences earthquakes can only 
lessen the fear of death. Each time you come out alive, you are certainly 
grateful to whatever power you believe in. Yet you also gain confidence and 
grow through that experience. You also have something to talk about now and in 
your old age.  
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes are also good in that each time one occurs, the stress on the land 
is relieved a little. This means that every time we have a minor earthquake, 
the "Big One" won't be as big. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage that an earthquake does is extensive. But it gives us a chance to 
rebuild, restructure and expand.  
</P>
<P>
 But first we must feel the loss, before we experience the gain. Through the 
restructuring, neighbors and strangers alike are brought together. 
</P>
<P>
 People can assemble together to fight off the drastic effects of nature. 
Through the devastating fires, earthquakes and other hazards, people can unite 
for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 So the next time an earthquake occurs, try to look beyond the damage it did. 
Rather, look at the rebuilding you can do.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; CHARITY BEGINS IN WORD AND DEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the curriculum at Calvary Chapel High School includes charity and kindness, 
it definitely fell upon deaf ears of two of its students. 
</P>
<P>
 The unkind remarks made regarding President Clinton and a member of his family 
in the Quote Me column (Jan. 20) were two of the three unkind references made 
about specific individuals (in response to the question, "What is your worst 
nightmare (dream or otherwise")). 
</P>
<P>
 I think these children need to think before they speak unkindly about a 
person, whether or not they disagree with their politics. Personally attacking 
someone is not exactly what my religion teaches. 
</P>
<P>
 We all need a little charity in "word" and deed in this world.

 People like to huddle after an earthquake. And last Friday, the Fashion Circle 
of the Costume Council of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art didn't miss a 
hug in its scheduled dinner and dancing party at Chasen's. The evening honored 
Gloria Vanderbilt, who came from New York and one of the East's worst winters 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Circle chairwoman Donna Wolff tried to explain the ambience: "It's just that 
people were so ecstatic to be alive. There was so much electricity in the air. 
People came out in spite of the broken china and crystal. We actually had very 
few no-shows." 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, the atmosphere was calmer as more than 700 filled the museum's Bing 
Auditorium for "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," a video documentary about 
Vanderbilt by her 26-year-old-son, Anderson Cooper, a Yale graduate and film 
producer. Then, over tea and sandwiches in the museum atrium, everyone compared 
quake experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The video charts Vanderbilt's life from her lonely childhood and the media 
blitz surrounding the transfer from her mother's custody to that of her aunt. 
It depicts her passion for art and her love for writing. (Her new novel is "The 
Memory Book of Starr Faithful," about a young woman sexually abused by a 
politician.)  
</P>
<P>
 The documentary ends with her son's question: "What do you consider your 
greatest accomplishment?" An adoring mother smiles. "You." 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt first gained fame when her father died before her birth, later in 
the child-custody case and, then, on her own, as a socialite who designed the 
Gloria Vanderbilt jeans, fabrics, china and perfumes.  
</P>
<P>
 She's always in social photos, and a large crowd wanted to see her Friday and 
Monday. What they found was a fresh, open, kind woman who says she "would have 
been happy living in a white house with a picket fence and just being loved by 
my family." 
</P>
<P>
 At the museum, Vanderbilt's entourage included New Yorker Phyllis Adams 
Jenkins, arm in arm with Carol Matthau, wife of actor Walter, and one of 
Gloria's best friends. The three women made their debuts in almost the same 
year in New York. As they say, they "came out." But Matthau's debut party was 
canceled because it fell on the day the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, on Dec. 
7, 1941. She lamented: "And Errol Flynn was going to jump out of the bandbox!" 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a cloudy day, Bonnie Black was regal in a fox-trimmed raincoat. 
Sally Cobb, former owner of the old Brown Derby, greeted Vanderbilt. Wolff and 
Mary Martin, Costume Council program chairwoman, were by her side. 
</P>
<P>
 More clustering around were fashion doyen Eleanore Phillips Colt, photographer 
Jean Howard and Heather Shuemaker. David Gill Evans recalled sitting with 
Vanderbilt at the Hollywood Bowl when she was married to conductor Leopold 
Stokowski. 
</P>
<P>
 At the black-tie party at Chasen's, the crowd included Jane and Steve 
Ackerman, Hugh and Lynn Evans, Richard and Sally Mogan, Hal and Eunice David, 
and George and Betsy Link. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday evening, Bea Arthur hosted a dinner party for Vanderbilt and guests, 
including Bob and Bea Scott, Norman and Lyn Lear, the Matthaus and psychiatrist 
Andrew Slaby, Vanderbilt's escort.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooper commented on his mother: "I am very proud of her. She is actually the 
most amazing person I have ever met." Pretty nice, from a son.

 Canceled: The Blue Ribbon event with former President Richard Nixon at the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace was canceled last Wednesday because of the 
earthquake. Said Sandra Ausman, Blue Ribbon president: "He said he'd come out 
for us again."

 Escalation: Allen and Madeleine Paulson have donated their colt Assurance 
(slated to fetch at least $40,000) to the glitzy list of auction items at Nancy 
Davis' second annual Race to Erase MS Feb. 11-12 in Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the fund-raiser to combat multiple sclerosis brought in $1.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the weekend agenda: Feb. 11, a country-Western party and Calcutta pool 
at Hotel Jerome Antler Bar and Ballroom; Feb. 12, the Chrysler/Guess? Race to 
Erase MS Celebrity-Pro ski race at the Little Nell Race Course, and that night 
a gala at the Ritz-Carlton Grand Ballroom with Kenny Loggins, Kenny G and Kevin 
Pollak entertaining and George Hamilton and Dennis Miller engineering the live 
auction. It's a personal cause for Nancy Davis, a mother of three and daughter 
of Marvin and Barbara Davis. During tests done after a ski accident in 1991, 
she was found to have MS.

 The Gay & Lesbian Expo '94 came about because gay and lesbian consumers have 
to be more careful where they spend their money, says R.A. Scott, director. The 
goals of the three-day event are to make people aware of which companies 
support politicians and legislation that promote discrimination against gays, 
and to match gay and lesbian dollars "with companies that practice fairness."

in "A Taste of Gay L.A." Tony winner Jennifer Holliday (Saturday, 8 p.m.) is 
among the entertainers who will perform.  
</P>
<P>
 The event begins Friday, 5-10 p.m., with opening ceremonies at 7 p.m. An AIDS

 Myths are the salt of human consciousness. It is hard to find a place for it, 
though, in our realistic fiction of personal sensibility which, despite the 
experimenters, the meta-fictionalists, the William Gaddises and Thomas 
Pynchons, goes on being written. 
</P>
<P>
 A credible American adult is not properly seen practicing myth unless, as with 
the Washington press corps, it is the myth of de-mythification. So writers turn 
to childhood, where even the most prosaic matters, being unfulfilled, still 
display magical possibility. A cheeseburger comes with a nimbus as well as 
ketchup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hula" tells a grim, tawdry family story radiantly, by telling it through the 
eyes of two pre-adolescent sisters who, I imagine, are 11 and 12 in the first 
part and 12 and 13 in the second.  
</P>
<P>
 Set in an unnamed Southern town in the 1960s, it is narrated by the younger 
girl. In 12 brief chapters, each recording one tiny scene, she gives us 
glimpses of the breakdown of her father, a veteran with a head injury, and the 
breakup of their home. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, who has been in and out of mental hospitals, works desultorily on 
a vegetable garden behind the house. His passion is less for growing than for 
weeding and, above all, burning the weeds in an iron basket. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a violence that he tries to contain but that breaks out in ways that 
border on disaster. He keeps a gorilla mask and gloves, remnants of some 
forgotten costume party. At dinner one night he leaves the table, returns 
wearing the mask and hops around snatching bits of food from his family's 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
 When he removes the gorilla head, the child tells us, there are tears in his 
eyes. There are regular shouting arguments between the father and the mother, a 
dance teacher who stays home for a while to try to hold things together but 
eventually returns to work. The children are sent outside and take refuge in a 
wrecked car on the lawn. From the house come angry voices and a regular 
thumping sound. It is the father beating his head against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been good times. The girls find a grass skirt the mother used to 
wear; she had met her husband, with his brilliant blue eyes and his intensity, 
while demonstrating the hula. The older sister puts the skirt on; the father 
snatches it off and burns it.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, drunk, he shoots holes in the garage with his pistol and ends up 
shooting to bits a pumpkin the children had grown. The narrator maneuvers 
herself across the lawn close to him until she is stepping on the shadow of his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a child's protest; the sisters rebel in various other childish ways. But 
it is also a child exploring a mystery. Inside the tormented head on whose 
shadow she stands is the whole unraveling fate of their family. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, "Hula" resembles Susan Minot's "Monkeys," which also depicted a 
family's disintegration in a series of vignettes told over time and as seen by 
the children. Like Minot, Lisa Shea makes touching, skillful use of the 
counterpoint between what a child can see and relate, and what she cannot. Her 
fabric is a lace of threads and holes that we fall through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hula" is a smaller work; its sadness is less complex and its range more 
restricted. Some of the chapters, dealing with the older sister's incipient 
sexuality, her fascination with a chain gang of convicts working near the 
house, and her roughhousing flirtation with neighbor boys, are nicely told but 
unremarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Hula" achieves an aching intensity in its own right. The narrator lets us 
hear sorrowful things that she can only partly tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea has built, on a structure of voice and silence, the sorrowful image of a 
child's vulnerability to the storms and mischances of her parents' lives. The 
incidents are commonplace. What is magical is the image of two children packing 
and repacking their world, ready for instant evacuation.

O.C. MUSIC REVIEW; DRESDEN BRINGS A GUEST MAESTRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America hasn't seen much of the Dresdner Philharmonie, a.k.a. the Dresden 
Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 This distinguished orchestra, founded in 1870, did make something of a splash 
when it first visited the States back in 1909. But then came a couple of world 
wars. And then came the partitioning of Germany, which left Dresden curtained 
off in the forbidden east. 
</P>
<P>
 We heard recordings, of course, and a few broadcasts. We knew that this was an 
ensemble with a fabulous history involving such conductors as Brahms, Dvorak 
and Tchaikovsky, not to mention Bulow, Busch, Nikisch, Kleiber pere and Masur. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dresdeners never came close to Southern California until this week. 
And now it can be argued -- also lamented -- that we have heard the 
Philharmonie under less than authentic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 For the current tour, the orchestra left one key player at home: its official 
music-director. His name -- not exactly a household commodity hereabouts -- is 
Jorg-Peter Weigle. Although he has been in charge since 1986, the tour sponsors 
probably regarded his international obscurity as a box-office liability. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He may be a neglected genius. He may be a talent unworthy of export. Chances 
are, we'll never know. In September, Michel Plasson, a much-traveled Frenchman, 
will take over; Yuri Temirkanov, the eccentric Russian, will assume the duties 
of principal guest-conductor. The days of musical nationalism are obviously 
drawing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 The man wielding the baton Tuesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
was Philippe Entremont of Rheims, France. Long celebrated as an elegant 
pianist, he has recently joined such colleagues as Daniel Barenboim and 
Vladimir Ashkenazy in the apparently irresistible quest for stellar fulfillment 
on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 He is, without doubt, an enlightened musician, a solid technician and an 
authoritative leader. On this occasion, however, he did not prove himself a 
distinctive or subtle interpreter of Brahms, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That may not be entirely his fault. It takes time to establish maximum rapport 
with an orchestra, and we have no indication that the Dresdeners ever 
encountered Entremont before they packed their bags this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, one had to applaud the attentive professionalism of 
all concerned. One had to admire the unison sheen of the Dresden strings, if 
not the occasionally blaring brass and intermittently nasal winds. One could 
appreciate the special blend of big, bright, slender tone, and the discipline 
in depth. Still, one couldn't help wondering how this orchestra sounds at the 
Kulturpalast am Altmarkt.  
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa concert, presented by the Orange County Philharmonic Society, 
began with a crisp and brisk, emphatically unpompous performance of Brahms' 
"Academic Festival" overture. It ended with a propulsive, colorful, 
emphatically unsentimental performance of Tchaikovsky's "Little Russian" 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles came in between, with Beethoven's wondrous Triple Concerto for 
piano, violin and cello. Entremont made the fateful decision to wave directions 
from the keyboard, and he paid a price for his ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to devote full attention to the orchestra, he had to settle for 
generalities when specific instructions were most wanted. Dynamic subtleties 
were slighted accordingly. Coordination and precision became sometime things. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly distracted by his conducting duties, Entremont played the piano solos 
rather perfunctorily. That is hardly his style. And having to face his 
orchestra meant that he had to turn his back on his fellow soloists. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho-Liang Lin, the dauntless violinist, gave the performance as much finesse 
as he could. Carter Brey, the sympathetic cellist, often found lofty intentions 
compromised by dubious intonation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was little wrong with this performance that a conductor couldn't 
have fixed. Perhaps next time . . . .

TELEVISION REVIEW; DR. JOHN'S PIANO: RIGHT PLACE ON THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What the Super Bowl is to football, New Orleans is to music, and while most of 
the nation is gearing up for Sunday's annual pigskin blowout, KOCE Channel 50 
is offering music fans an excellent prelude to Mardi Gras, the wildest day of 
the year in the Crescent City. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a prelude it is -- an hour alone with Dr. John and his piano, 
courtesy of "The Lonesome Pine Specials" (tonight at 10). 
</P>
<P>
 For the uninitiated, the good doctor, born Malcolm John Rebennack, is a 
singer-composer who follows and extends the tradition of New Orleans piano 
music created in the late '40s by Professor Longhair and practiced by such 
disciples as Huey (Piano) Smith and James Booker. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of all those ivory-ticklers, Dr. John attained the greatest commercial 
success, thanks to his early-'70s hit singles "Right Place, Wrong Time" and 
"Such a Night." Contrary to the title of that first hit, he managed to be in 
the right place at precisely the right time. Radio since has squeezed out what 
little room it once had for such left-field treasures as the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, there are no dazzling lights, no flash pots, no lasers on 
tonight's "Lonesome Pine Special" -- just Dr. John and his 10 pyrotechnic 
fingers, playing boogie-woogie, barrelhouse, stride, and hybrids that don't 
have names yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The high point is a gospel medley that spans from "When the Saints Go Marchin' 
In" to "Will the Circle Be Unbroken." But there's not a down moment anywhere, 
from his soulful balladry in "Georgia on My Mind" through his bawdy tribute to 
the legendary Booker. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who can't make to Mardi Gras come Fat Tuesday (Feb. 15), this hour 
at least will let you feel like you're there. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Lonesome Pine Special" featuring Dr. John is being shown tonight at 10 
on KOCE Channel 50.

DANCE / CHRIS PASLES; REFUSING TO STAND STILL; RON PROTAS SAYS USING THARP'S 
WORK IS IN KEEPING WITH GRAHAM'S PHILOSOPHY OF EMBRACING CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Protas is getting used to being in the hot seat. Criticized for the way he 
has run the Martha Graham Dance Company since even before Graham's death in 
1991, Protas most recently has been taking heat for bringing in choreographer 
Twyla Tharp to create a work for the troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 An outside choreographer for the Graham company? The first in 60 years? Graham 
fans protested. 
</P>
<P>
 But Protas says that Graham herself sanctioned the idea of getting new work 
from outside choreographers and even named Tharp as a possible candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martha didn't want the company to be a museum," Protas said Monday in a phone 
interview from Phoenix, where the company was dancing before dates at the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts tonight and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's very dangerous. Martha felt that the only constant was change. She 
liked that animating force of something new. On the other hand, she said the 
only sin is mediocrity. . . . She did mention Twyla as one of the ones I could 
pick. She also picked (Jerome) Robbins." 
</P>
<P>
 Tharp created "Demeter and Persephone" for the company in October. The title 
refers to the myth in which the ancient Greeks accounted for the seasons. 
Daughter of Demeter, goddess of agriculture, Persephone is abducted by Hades, 
god of the underworld. But Zeus, ruler of the gods, intervenes, and Persephone 
is allowed to return to Earth and to her mother, but only for two-thirds of the 
year. Her annual return is signaled by the arrival of spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, (Tharp) did what Martha would have done -- take a Greek myth and 
give it a universality," Protas said. "It was an interesting choice. (Tharp) 
had just lost her mother, and in a way, the company had lost its mother. This 
was about death and desperation and rebirth. It was a very wise choice." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tharp did not treat the myth "in a linear fashion," said Christine Dakin, 
who dances Demeter. "The dance stands as an abstract piece (and) lots of people 
not familiar with the story can follow it."  
</P>
<P>
 Working with Tharp was "an amazing process," Dakin recalled. "She had really 
fascinating philosophical ideas about cycles of life and relationships between 
family and people, ideas she's working with herself. Yes, she talked about 
that, though not as much as we would have liked, probably." 
</P>
<P>
 Dakin finds the ballet to be "very tightly structured. Tharp is mathematical 
in her organization. For instance, there's a phrase that's reversed, then 
inverted, then inverted and reversed. All that needs to be worked out . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "But it was physically a challenge. Essentially working at that speed was 
basically different for us. A lot of footwork, a lot of quick footwork. And 
that's very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Dancer Terese Capucilli agreed. "First of all we were working in jazz boots," 
she said. "Generally we are barefoot. In working that way, it makes the floor 
very 'fast,' which means slippery. You have to use your legs in a totally 
different way when the floor is that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not used to moving as fast as Twyla moves. The footwork is quite rapid. 
So it was painful. Three weeks of a lot of pain. Other than that, the whole 
piece was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What role does Capucilli have? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the ultimate question," she said, laughing. "Twyla has kind of played 
a joke on everyone by not labeling the who's-who in the program. She's left it 
up to everyone to guess. But it's very clear to me. I am what Twyla called the 
Interloper, kind of like the Greek chorus. I see everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Capucilli said Tharp's new work "shows each of us in a different light, 
something that our die-hard Graham dancers might not be seen doing, although 
many of us do other works on our off-times." 
</P>
<P>
 But she has a reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always that worry when a company starts bringing in an outside 
choreographer that the work of the mentor, the Martha Graham, will diminish 
because the attention will be not be placed in the right direction. The focus 
will have moved. That is a fear of mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "But being who I am and having that fear, I recognize that the Graham 
technique is in my body. I fear mostly for those coming up, those who have 
never worked with Martha. But I believe that this company is really holding 
fast with much integrity to Martha's work and what we have had from her." 
</P>
<P>
 Protas shares the concern and said that while he plans to acquire more new 
work, he will limit such acquisitions to "one a year, and that's it. Because if 
it gets into five new works (a year), you'll lose sight of Martha. You'll have 
evenings when she isn't represented. That makes me very nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Protas and Tharp are "talking," he said, about acquiring two more of her 
works, but dances that are already choreographed. When Hubbard Street Chicago 
acquired the rights to four Tharp works in 1990 for just three years, the price 
tag for the Chicago-based troupe was about $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Tharp created "Demeter" for the Graham company for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would not accept any pay," Protas said. "Martha was her teacher, she 
said. She adored Martha and wanted to do it as a gift." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Martha Graham Dance Company will dance tonight and Friday at 8 p.m. at 
the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700 Center Court Drive, 
Cerritos. Tonight's program includes Tharp's "Demeter and Persephone" and 
Graham's "Appalachian Spring," "Errand Into the Maze" and "Steps in the 
Street." Friday's program includes Graham's "Acts of Light," "Night Journey" 
and "Maple Leaf Rag." $28 to $40. (310) 916-8510.

 Quake Alters Ratings: The A.C. Nielsen Co. won't be counting ratings for Los 
Angeles television stations for last Monday and Tuesday in its monthly 
averages. Nielsen has decided that power outages following the Jan. 17 
earthquake distorted the geographical balance in the five counties comprising 
the Los Angeles market. When Nielsen initially released its ratings for the day 
of the quake, it issued a statement cautioning its clients to limit use of the 
figures because of the low number of sets reporting data, which could have 
impacted on the accuracy of the results. Nielsen has since stricken those 
figures from the subscribing stations' records.

 Losing to the Ratings -- Again: Chevy Chase gets a case of deja vu in his 
latest commercial -- a spot for Doritos Tortilla Thins that premieres Sunday 
during the second quarter of NBC's Super Bowl XXVII broadcast. In the 60-second 
spot, the ratings game once again spells demise for the former talk show host. 
This time Hollywood-type network executives abruptly oust him from a starring 
spot in a "Super Bowl Commercial" because his ratings are low. So Chase is 
shown off the set -- but is permitted to keep a bag of Doritos Tortilla Thins 
for company. OSCAR WATCH

agreed to go to speak at Oakland's Castlemont High School, which drew attention 
last week when 69 of its students were ejected from a showing of the film for 
laughing at depictions of Nazi atrocities. "Steven is enormously interested in 
this, partly because it fits into his desire to take part in the education 
process," his spokesman said. "He feels that there's been so much 
desensitization to violence that these kids can't be blamed for what happened."

In a statement, the group said: "People say we promote violence with our

conjunction with a suit filed against an Akron, Ohio, group once known as "1964

THEATER REVIEW; UCI MEETS DEMANDS OF EXOTIC 'BUTTERFLY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The entertaining theatricality of David Henry Hwang's "M. Butterfly" serves up 
a cross-cultural meditation on the idea that things aren't what they seem. It 
blends a stylish deconstruction of the historic polarity between East and West 
with a titillating story of sexual deceit and romantic delusion. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a full plate for anybody, let alone a college production. It requires 
a level of sophistication not just from mature actors with a flair for the 
exotic, but from designers able to conjure rich and fluid atmospheric effects. 
The last thing "M. Butterfly" needs is a cast exuding a lack of experience or a 
setting that fails to evoke the dreamy, sometimes nightmarish sensation of 
fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, UC Irvine's School of Fine Arts revival at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre more than lives up to the requirements -- thanks largely to a 
convincing, world-weary performance by Alan Shack in the central role of an 
embittered French diplomat duped into believing for 20 years that his male 
Chinese lover was a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a somewhat inelegant portrayal of the deceptive object of his desire -- 
the bashful yet seductive Butterfly, a transvestite Beijing Opera star who also 
turns out to be a spy for the Communist regime -- seems forgivable under the 
circumstances and does not tarnish this impressive production. 
</P>
<P>
 The jewel-box brilliance of the 1988 Broadway original, with its lacquered, 
red-and-black Chinese appointments and its sweeping ramp to suggest a 
post-modern touch of Japanese Kabuki theater, is here translated into a darker, 
less-detailed setting by scenic designer Julie A. Allardice. But it is lighted 
to melodramatic perfection by Lonnie Alcaraz. 
</P>
<P>
 As he has said many times, Hwang took his inspiration for "M. Butterfly" from 
a 1986 newspaper account of a bizarre sex-cum-spy scandal involving Bernard 
Boursicot, a timid low-level bureaucrat posted to the French embassy in Beijing 
during the mid-'60s, and Shi Pei Pu, the opera singer with whom he fell in love 
and for whom he made a habit of stealing embassy documents. 
</P>

 Boursicot's espionage was discovered two decades later, in 1983, after he had 
returned to France and resumed his affair with Shi, who had immigrated 
(bringing along their purported child). At Boursicot's trial in Paris, when it 
was revealed that Shi was a he, the diplomat claimed to be thunderstruck. He 
testified that he had never known his lover was a man. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Hwang retained the basic outline of the story but freely adapted the facts, so 
that his fictionalized drama acquires a larger resonance about cultural and 
political misperception as well as sexual deceit. 
</P>
<P>
 He addresses the issue of Western imperialism and the presumption of Eastern 
submission in particular and imbues it with thematic insights about illusion 
and reality in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "M. Butterfly" begins in a bleak prison cell and often returns to it as the 
convicted diplomat, renamed Rene Gallimard, recalls the events of his deluded 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 He stalks the bare stage under slanting shafts of light, which give him the 
doomed look of someone trapped in a film noir. And he speaks to us directly 
with a combination of irony and shame, pride and bitterness: "I have been loved 
by the perfect woman." 
</P>
<P>
 As scenes unfold in Gallimard's mind, transporting us through the past, it 
becomes apparent that he still believes in the sublimity of his love for 
Butterfly even as he abhors the ridicule she has heaped on him. "Happiness is 
so rare we can turn somersaults to protect it," he confides. 
</P>
<P>
 With his balding head shaved in a prison haircut and his voice edged like 
sandpaper, Shack gives a persuasive account of Gallimard's desperate conflict. 
(He is offering the role for his master's thesis and is said to be a 
professional actor with major credits behind him. On the evidence of this 
performance, there is no reason to doubt it.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shack has the maturity and subtlety needed for Gallimard. He goes from dry 
anguish to glib humor without missing a beat -- and director Keith Fowler is 
lucky to have him in the production. 
</P>
<P>
 As Song Liling, Gallimard's Butterfly, Andre Evangelista has a considerably 
harder time -- not least because of the transvestite role's inherent 
difficulties. But we're ready to give him that. 
</P>
<P>
 If his heavy jawline suggests a bit too much masculinity for a delicate opera 
star passing as a woman, so be it. And if he doesn't quite have the feminine 
grace to deceive us, as he does his lover, we can take that as just one more 
reason to find Gallimard rather pitiable. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, it is the overlay of the Puccini opera "Madame Butterfly" on 
Gallimard and Song's affair that holds our fascination and goes a long way 
toward explaining the enigma of their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 (Gallimard's blindness to sexual reality may not be entirely clarified to 
everyone's satisfaction, even apart from mechanics. After all, naive or not, he 
must have known the Beijing Opera historically used men in women's roles, a 
practice still carried on by the Communists, as Butterfly reminds him.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other aspects of the production also work well -- from the colorful splash of 
the agitprop dancers to the sharp bite of Jane Han's incidental Maoist 
characters to the insinuating secondary roles played by Colby French and Alice 
Welch. But can't somebody dampen the noise of the movable screens that roll on 
and off stage? They rumble like freight trains.

MUSIC REVIEW; DRESDEN BRINGS A GUEST MAESTRO TO ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America hasn't seen much of the Dresdner Philharmonie, a.k.a. the Dresden 
Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 This distinguished orchestra, founded in 1870, did make something of a splash 
when it first visited the States back in 1909. But then came a couple of world 
wars. And then came the partitioning of Germany, which left Dresden curtained 
off in the forbidden east. 
</P>
<P>
 We heard recordings, of course, and a few broadcasts. We knew that this was an 
ensemble with a fabulous history involving such conductors as Brahms, Dvorak 
and Tchaikovsky, not to mention Bulow, Busch, Nikisch, Kleiber pere and Masur. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dresdeners never came close to Southern California until this week. 
And now it can be argued -- also lamented -- that we have heard the 
Philharmonie under less than authentic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 For the current tour, the orchestra left one key player at home: its official 
music-director. His name -- not exactly a household commodity hereabouts -- is 
Jorg-Peter Weigle. Although he has been in charge since 1986, the tour sponsors 
probably regarded his international obscurity as a box-office liability. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He may be a neglected genius. He may be a talent unworthy of export. Chances 
are, we'll never know. In September, Michel Plasson, a much-traveled Frenchman, 
will take over; Yuri Temirkanov, the eccentric Russian, will assume the duties 
of principal guest-conductor. The days of musical nationalism are obviously 
drawing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 The man wielding the baton Tuesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
was Philippe Entremont of Rheims, France. Long celebrated as an elegant 
pianist, he has recently joined such colleagues as Daniel Barenboim and 
Vladimir Ashkenazy in the apparently irresistible quest for stellar fulfillment 
on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 He is, without doubt, an enlightened musician, a solid technician and an 
authoritative leader. On this occasion, however, he did not prove himself a 
distinctive or subtle interpreter of Brahms, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 That may not be entirely his fault. It takes time to establish maximum rapport 
with an orchestra, and we have no indication that the Dresdeners ever 
encountered Entremont before they packed their bags this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, one had to applaud the attentive professionalism of 
all concerned. One had to admire the unison sheen of the Dresden strings, if 
not the occasionally blaring brass and intermittently nasal winds. One could 
appreciate the special blend of big, bright, slender tone, and the discipline 
in depth. Still, one couldn't help wondering how this orchestra sounds at the 
Kulturpalast am Altmarkt.  
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa concert, presented by the Orange County Philharmonic Society, 
began with a crisp and brisk, emphatically unpompous performance of Brahms' 
"Academic Festival" overture. It ended with a propulsive, colorful, 
emphatically unsentimental performance of Tchaikovsky's "Little Russian" 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles came in between, with Beethoven's wondrous Triple Concerto for 
piano, violin and cello. Entremont made the fateful decision to wave directions 
from the keyboard, and he paid a price for his ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to devote full attention to the orchestra, he had to settle for 
generalities when specific instructions were most wanted. Dynamic subtleties 
were slighted accordingly. Coordination and precision became sometime things. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly distracted by his conducting duties, Entremont played the piano solos 
rather perfunctorily. That is hardly his style. And having to face his 
orchestra meant that he had to turn his back on his fellow soloists. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho-Liang Lin, the dauntless violinist, gave the performance as much finesse 
as he could. Carter Brey, the sympathetic cellist, often found lofty intentions 
compromised by dubious intonation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was little wrong with this performance that a conductor couldn't 
have fixed. Perhaps next time . . . .

MUSIC REVIEW; MAYAN A PERFECT SETTING FOR LATINO CHAMBER ENSEMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warrior priests in stone decorate the exterior of the Mayan Theater, a 
still-handsome downtown Los Angeles relic built in 1927. Over the decades, the 
ornate auditorium has been variously a legit theater, a movie palace and an 
elegant purveyor of Spanish-language films. In the 1990s, its theater seats 
removed, it is an attractive and apparently thriving nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, however, it became a concert hall again. Under auspices of the 
Da Camera Society, the Chamber Music in Historic Sites series took over the 
theater to present, within architectural confines inspired by Mayan temple 
sites at Toltec and Palenque, the contemporary ensemble Hecho en Mexico. Not 
surprisingly, given the track record of impresario MaryAnn Bonino, site and 
sound fit perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecho en Mexico, usually a quartet that sings and plays 20th-Century as well 
as historical instruments, became on this occasion a 10-member ensemble 
performing mostly the compositions of one of its founders, Germaine Franco. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco's new, half-hour entertainment, "Quinto Sol -- The Fifth Sun" a musical 
retelling of, in her description, the Legend of the Suns "as translated from 
the Annals of Cuauhtitlan, in the Codice Chimalpopoca," is collage-like, 
fragmented but engrossing. 
</P>
<P>
 It utilizes an abundance of Meso-American musical resources in instruments 
like water drums, conch shells, clay flutes, bone rasps, rain sticks, turtle 
shells and deer hoofs, combining them with a contemporary battery: guitars, 
drums, woodwinds and percussion, as well as, of course, singing. Unobtrusive 
narration and canny pacing maintain the work's continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Talented but not strikingly original, Franco seems to possess compositional 
gifts more attuned to synthesis than to new directions. Her commercial side 
emerged in the following set of seven pieces, played by splinter ensembles from 
the larger group. Here, the composer's eclecticism drew from many 20th-Century 
pop sources, with mostly successful results. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the colleagues, co-founder and guitarist Federico Ramos, guitarist Ramon 
Stagnaro, singer Ali Olma, saxophonist and flutist Alberto Wing, and flutist 
and percussionist Sergio Gonzalez made crucial and admirable musical 
contributions.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; VINCE NEIL TRIES TO SHOW THERE CAN BE LIFE AFTER CRUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE TURMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Vince Neil was fired by big-time metal band Motley Crue in 1992, he 
launched a solo career that sputtered badly. Now he's resurfaced with a new 
Tuesday evening rock club called Ruby Tuesday's, held at the tony Bar One on 
the west end of the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 This relatively low-pressure situation could be a good way for the flashy 
performer to renew his rock 'n' roll spirits, but Tuesday's loose 25-minute set 
was anything but fun. Instead of inspired spontaneity, an air of forced 
joviality prevailed as Neil and two members of his regular band (absent were 
star guitarist Steve Stevens and drummer Vikki Foxx) offered a smattering of 
Crue hits, including "Dr. Feelgood," "Girls, Girls, Girls" and a faltering 
version of "Kickstart My Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The low ceiling and floor-level stage impeded visibility, and the club's 
strong sound system magnified every instrumental and vocal glitch. Neil is a 
basically adequate metal singer, but this format didn't bring out the best in 
his voice, or in the material. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tradition of the defunct China Club, Ruby Tuesday's is being touted as 
an upscale ($15 admission, $5 beers) pro-jam situation, with Neil serving as 
the figurehead as local luminaries drop in for impromptu sets. With old-school 
metal out of vogue, it seems likely that when the initial curiosity wears off, 
it will be goodby Ruby Tuesday's. KATHERINE TURMAN

ART REVIEW; SCULPTURES WITH A TOUCH OF DIGNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephan Balkenhol's carved wood figures initially seem to be nothing more than 
large-scale versions of the ubiquitous knickknacks sold in souvenir shops at 
popular vacation spots. His roughly cut sculptures, however, maintain a 
strangely humane dignity that makes it easy for us to confuse them with real 
people -- if only momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The young German sculptor achieves this uncanny effect by forgoing strict 
verisimilitude. His variously scaled figures, busts and reliefs at Regen 
Projects share none of the cold, clinical precision of Thomas Ruff's seemingly 
endless cataloguing of anonymous Germans in his series of large, passport-like 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do Balkenhol's humble monuments partake of the creepiness relished and 
elicited by Duane Hanson's unsettling, hyper-real manikins, whose latex skin, 
real wigs and everyday clothing give them the presence of alien clones or 
android stand-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 Balkenhol's statues sustain our fascination because they appear to thoroughly 
and comfortably inhabit their bodies. They create the impression that, over the 
years, they have grown used to the particular hang of their arms, the slope of 
their shoulders, the thrust of their hips. More generic than Alice Neal's 
outstanding painted portraits of her friends, Balkenhol's sculptures embody a 
similar sense of in-the-flesh vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 Although traces of resignation and resilience may be found in their features, 
the predominant attitude they convey is optimism. Almost always 
thirty-something, they look like they've never endured real disappointment nor 
made mistakes that can't be undone. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Balkenhol's wooden people don't seem to be spoiled brats or sheltered 
white kids from the suburbs who only know the security of a stable, bourgeois 
upbringing. They exude a no-nonsense quality of working-class practicality. 
</P>
<P>
 This unflappable self-reliance is responsible for their optimism. It gives 
them their power and keeps us coming back to them, to try to read their passive 
features without doing violence to their stillness. 
</P>

NEWS BITES: A NEW MOVEMENT: MILK ACTIVISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People protest in favor of animal rights; they protest against encroaching 
development. But last Sunday, approximately 30 anti-biotechnology activists 
introduced onlookers at the Los Angeles Farmers Market to a new cause of the 
moment: milk. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally, sponsored by the Washington-based advocacy group Pure Food 
Campaign, was staged to protest food industry plans to use a controversial drug 
in dairy cows that could increase milk production about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Feb. 4, Monsanto Co., the manufacturer of bovine somatotropin, or 
BST, can begin marketing and selling the product to commercial milk producers.  
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of BST late last year 
after determining that products derived from the drug are safe for human 
consumption. For instance, the FDA found that milk from BST-treated cows has 
the same nutritional value and chemical composition as milk from untreated 
cows. As a result, the agency decided that no special labeling is required on 
products developed from animals treated with the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of BST say the drug will cause udder inflammation, or mastitis, in 
treated cows. To forestall any such infection, dairy farmers may increase the 
amount of antibiotics given to animals; it's feared that this will lead to a 
corresponding rise in the level of antibiotics in milk for human consumption. 
But FDA and Monsanto both claim that sufficient safeguards exist to discover 
any unsafe drug residues in milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Sunday's small turnout, the Pure Food Campaign has had some success 
locally in thwarting BST. Last November, the Los Angeles City Board of 
Education passed a resolution that prohibits for one year the distribution of 
BST-treated milk or other dairy products in local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Pure Food Campaign is now asking the Los Angeles City Council and the L. A. 
County Board of Supervisors to consider similar resolutions. Failing a sales 
moratorium, the Pure Food Campaign will ask the council and supervisors to 
order that BST-treated milk carry appropriate labeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Danila Oder, Los Angeles area coordinator for the Pure Food Campaign, says 
that a big goal for the group is educating the public. Sunday's rally, she 
says, "was a good jumping-off point for future activities." The 
anti-biotechnocrats may now be just a fringe group, but they could eventually 
pose serious problems for genetic engineering pioneers, much the way activists 
have stalled food irradiation. DANIEL P. PUZO

 1988 Antinori Chianti Classico, "Badia a Passignano" ($30) -- At a time when 
there is such a mania about the red wines of Italy, with prices rising for 
Chianti, Barolo, Barbaresco and even Barbera, leave it to Piero Antinori, the 
master winemaker of Tuscany, to offer a new wine with an even more elevated 
price tag. Fittingly, its label looks like a Swiss bank note. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, 30 bucks isn't cheap for a Chianti, but Antinori is the man who created 
the Super Tuscan fad two decades ago with the release of Tignanello, and this, 
his new top-of-the-line vineyard-designated Chianti, isn't chopped liver. In 
fact, it's superb, combining loads of fresh cherry-like fruit and 
toasty/chocolatey nuances. 
</P>
<P>
 Antinori purchased the Badia a Passignano vineyard in 1988, donating the abbey 
on the property back to the Vallambrosian monks, who had lost the property 121 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 A companion wine, a more conventionally labeled non-Riserva 1991 Passignano, 
is an excellent buy at $10. DAN BERGER

A WINE OF TRADITION

<P>
 Many Americans, if they think of Port at all, think of that sweet, cheap, 
fiery liquid sipped from brown paper bags. But in England, Port is essential at 
fine dinner parties and family gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 The British cleave to Port for good reason: They invented it. Although made in 
the Douro region of Portugal, it was created by British wine merchants as a 
better way to use the local grapes that previously had been used to make a dull 
wine that had been the main product of the Douro. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the 17th Century, Britain and Portugal developed a strong trade 
relationship, formalized in 1703 with the Methuen Treaty, which gave Portugal a 
sort of early version of "most favored nation" trading status. Lower duties 
meant that Portuguese wine cost 25% less than French wine, but the lower price 
wasn't enough to make the English like the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 So the British wine merchants asked the winemakers to stop the fermentation of 
the grape juice before the wine was fully dry by adding brandy. This turned it 
into a sweet, higher-alcohol wine that H. Warner Allen described as "far better 
suited to . . . the caprices of our climate than to those of its native land," 
in his 1954 book "Through the Wine Glass." 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, the largest Port houses were British-owned. Even today, the major 
houses have British names -- Taylor, Sandeman, Dow, Warre, Graham and others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Alec Waugh, in his 1959 book "In Praise of Wine," pointed out: "The 
Englishman and his Port; what a world of Galsworthian tradition those five 
words evoke: of London clubs and college common rooms, and 'stately homes'; the 
pipe (barrel) laid down at a son's christening, the cool dark cellars where the 
wine matures, the ritual of decanting . . . the funnel in the decanter's mouth, 
the light under the shoulder of the bottle, finally the strict conventions of 
the actual drinking, the decanter that must pass always to the left -- 
clockwise, or the way of the sun -- the cigarette that must remain unlighted." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Port trade grew, so did the legend. Port was virtually required at all 
major dinners of state. Indeed, it was mandatory to toast the king or queen 
with Port after dinner. "To drink to the health of the Sovereign in any wine 
but Port smacks almost of high treason," wrote Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 Because great vintages of Port need 15 to 30 years, occasionally more, before 
they are smooth and complex enough to drink, it became a tradition for wealthy 
Englishmen to contract with their local wine merchant to "lay down a pipe of 
Port." A pipe is a 550-liter barrel that yields some 60 cases of Port. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a wine would theoretically be ready for consumption at the scion's 
entrance to college. Not that the Port from the pipe would be consumed at 
college. The prestigious colleges had their own Port specifically bottled for 
their "common rooms." DAN BERGER

WINE: PORT MARKET OVER A BARREL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The world of Port -- as aged and tradition-encrusted as anything in wine -- is 
being turned upside-down these days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, great vintage Port can be bought for little more than what it 
sold for when it first came out. So dramatic have sales been that Bartholomew 
Broadbent, one of the nation's top Port importers, believes Americans bought 
more vintage Port in 1993 than did the British -- a shock when one considers 
that the British consider Port almost the national drink. (Gin lovers may 
disagree.) 
</P>
<P>
 "When the 1983 vintage Ports were released (in 1985), America was the 
eighth-largest Port-consuming nation in the world," says Broadbent, whose 
Sausalito-based company, Premium Port Wines, imports Port and Madeira. "Last 
year, America was No. 2 -- but if you add in all the gray-market Port, I'm sure 
America is ahead of England." (Gray-market wines are imported legally, but not 
by an officially recognized trading company, and their statistics are difficult 
to come by.) 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it is estimated that Americans bought one-third more Graham's 1991 
Port, a high-demand Port, than did British buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When consumers have a chance to buy (vintage Port) at prices they haven't 
seen for a long time, they just buy and buy," says Don Schliff, a vice 
president for the Los Angeles-based wholesale company Wine Warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a buyer's market in Port the last six to eight months, and not just 
for the latest wines, but for Ports from the great vintages, such as '63, '70 
and '77," adds Schliff, who has a huge personal Port collection as well. "Our 
Port sales are off the charts and we can't keep them on the shelves. One 
shipment comes in, it goes out, and we have to order more." 
</P>
<P>
 There are many reasons for the low prices now seen on older vintages of Port. 
The most significant is the weakness in the British economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losses in the Lloyd's (of London) insurance market had a powerful effect on 
Port collectors in England," says Broadbent. He says many wealthy English 
families who lost money in the insurance business decided to raise cash by 
selling their Port collections. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were great families, most of whom had great wine cellars, and a huge 
number of these people are going bankrupt," he says. "They are dumping their 
wines on the market to raise cash." 
</P>
<P>
 The private cellars are showing up on the wine auction market, which is 
frequented by savvy wholesale buyers. Eventually the lower Port prices at 
auction results in lower prices on the retail shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also, International Distillers & Vintners, a division of Grand Metropolitan 
PLC, has been discounting its large Port stocks to raise cash, says a source 
who asked for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now possible to buy many Ports from the excellent 1977 vintage for about 
$55 to $60 a bottle, with some wines from fine houses selling for even less 
than $40. Ports from the 1963 vintage, well-aged wines from what is considered 
one of the greatest vintages of all time, are routinely selling for $110 to 
$120, occasionally for even less than $70. 
</P>
<P>
 The prices for the 1977s are not much higher than when they were released in 
1979; part of the reason is the way wine is sold today compared with the way it 
was sold 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1979 and 1980, most wine merchants took a standard 50% markup on wine, 
so a bottle that cost a merchant $40 would sell for $60. The Wine Club, Wine 
Exchange, Wine House and many other discounters are working on a 12% margin, so 
the wine that cost $40 to the retailer goes on the shelf now at $45 to $48. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the softness in prices is the huge amount of vintage Port 
being sold by those who speculated in the 1977 vintage Ports. After the 
excellent 1970 vintage, six years passed with virtually no vintage Port. When 
the '77s gained high praise, many buyers took large amounts, hoping to sell 
them at a profit through the auction market at a later date. That date has 
arrived for many speculators, though not the hoped-for profits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Los Angeles' vintage Port market is among the strongest in the 
world because of Hollywood's link to the British film industry. British film 
executives who live full- or part-time in Hollywood frequent top restaurants 
and ask for Port for after-dinner sipping. L. A. restaurateurs thus have been 
spurred to add vintage Ports to their wine lists in increasing numbers. Sales 
of Port by-the-glass have rocketed in the last two years, says Broadbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scale of this (demand for Port) is a lot bigger than most of us can 
realize," says Broadbent, who is the son of London wine auctioneer J. Michael 
Broadbent. "Container loads of Port were coming out of England last year in 
such numbers it shocked me, and I'm usually an optimistic person." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Schliff both said prices for vintage Ports are still fairly reasonable, 
but both predicted that the bottom may have been reached. "I think prices will 
rise by the end of March because the discounted lots will have gone," says 
Broadbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, lower prices for the older vintages of Port have had little impact on 
the prices for the excellent 1991 Ports, according to Broadbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1991s sold in excess of my expectations," he says. "In Los Angeles the 
(suggested) price for 1991 Graham's was $32, and you could buy 1983s and 1985s 
for less than that. But people want the latest, hottest thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Broadbent says another reason for strong Port sales in this country is simply 
that here, unlike England, people don't wait decades to drink them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People drink vintage Port young in America," he says. He estimates that 85% 
of California vintage Port buyers prefer younger Ports to older Ports. "We eat 
a lot of chocolate desserts, and young vintage Port goes better with chocolate 
than just about anything," he says. "Also, you are used to drinking young 
Cabernets, so you don't mind the tannin in Port the way the English do." 
</P>
<P>
 But above all, says British-born Broadbent, "You (Americans) don't have the 
stuffy English manor house tradition that Port has to be old. You don't have 
this preconception about Port. You just drink it."

GRAIN COOKING; TALES FROM THE BULGUR BELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bulgur is more than just something to make tabbouleh with. It's also more than 
a quick-cooking rice substitute. In its Near Eastern home, bulgur's special 
qualities -- the sweet earthiness of wheat, the textural possibilities of its 
graininess, the fact that it can be mixed with other ingredients without 
further cooking -- make it the basis of a wide variety of soups and stews and 
snacks, both meaty and vegetarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Its quick-cooking qualities are certainly appreciated in the Near East, of 
course. Bulgur has replaced raw wheat grains in a number of ancient dishes that 
once upon a time had to cook all night. And tabbouleh isn't a health-food 
cliche there; it's a light, refreshing treat. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgur is the sort of thing that couldn't have been invented in a cold 
climate. These days, bulgur is usually made in factories, but the traditional 
technique (still used in small villages) depends on the fact that in the Near 
East, wheat is harvested in July or August, when the weather is still hot, 
rather than in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 When the crop is in, people boil the wheat grains in huge pots a yard or two 
across, a job that requires somebody to stay up all night watching the fire and 
stirring the pot from time to time. When the wheat grains swell and are 
thoroughly cooked, they are spread out to dry on the flat rooftops. 
Traditionally the wheat is carried upstairs by children, who are paid in 
spoonfuls of the tasty brown crust that has formed on the bottom of the pot. 
</P>
<P>
 When the summer sun has dried the wheat and the grains have shriveled and 
hardened, the wheat is hulled. Then a traveling artisan comes around to grind 
the bulgur in a portable, hand-turned mill. He doesn't grind it to the fineness 
of flour, because it's made from a hard wheat, which resists grinding fine; 
like durum semolina, it comes out more or less as grits. The ground bulgur is 
sieved into three or four size grades, ranging from coarse, for soups and 
stews, to very fine, for particular uses such as certain delicate pilafs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The essence of bulgur is that it is precooked. As anybody who has made 
tabbouleh knows, just soaking it in water is enough to make it ready to eat 
(although perhaps in need of some flavoring). Unlike raw grain, it can be 
chewed and digested without further cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 This is obviously a great convenience, but nobody seems to know exactly when 
or where this clever idea arose. Near Eastern cookbooks from the 10th and 13th 
centuries don't say anything about bulgur. The reason might be that medieval 
books mostly described haute cuisine and ignored many everyday foods, but their 
silence might also mean that bulgur was simply invented later than the 13th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, all the theories about the origin of bulgur tend to fizzle out 
at some point. A lot of people believe the Turks invented it, and the word 
bulgur is often confidently said to be Turkish, but there's no linguistic 
reason to think so. Nothing like the word is found in any language related to 
Turkish -- not even in Azerbaijani, which is practically a dialect of the 
language spoken in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 The likeliest candidate for the origin of the word appears to be palkhurd , 
which is a Kurdish word for "crushed," referring to crushed grain; its basic 
meaning is something like "small pebbles" or maybe "crushed with stones." The 
word bulghur has the same meaning ("crushed grain") in Persian -- in the 14th 
Century a wisecracking Persian poet wrote, "I obtained a thousand bulghur : one 
spoonful of grits from the rounded soup pot" -- and it's conceivable that 
palkhurd , or something like it, might have become bulghur in Persian. 
</P>
<P>
 This theory would be a bit more convincing if the unique thing about bulgur 
were that it was crushed, but raw cracked wheat has always been around. 
Unfortunately, we can't tell whether the 14th-Century bulghur was precooked, 
and modern Iranian cooks rarely use bulgur. To add to the confusion, Kurds 
themselves actually call bulgur sawar , a word they borrowed from their 
Armenian neighbors, who call it tsavar . 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, it's clear where bulgur arose: somewhere around the southern 
border of present-day Turkey. A lot of nationalities rub shoulders here -- 
Arabs, Armenians, Turks, Kurds and the Aramaic-speaking Christians known as 
Assyrians. Whichever group it originated among, the Turks were the ones who 
spread bulgur to places within their empire such as Egypt, Yemen, Cyprus and 
Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
 In these new homes, bulgur gained only a relatively small foothold. It's still 
in Syria, Lebanon, northern Iraq and Turkey and among the Armenians -- in the 
Armenian republic, and even more so among the western Armenians who escaped the 
massacres in Turkey at the beginning of this century -- that bulgur is most 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what do they make from it? Tabbouleh, of course, the Lebanese and Syrian 
appetizer that spread widely in the Near East and beyond during this century. 
The original version is a parsley and mint salad given a little heft with 
bulgur, not the green-flecked porridge a lot of health food restaurants make. 
It also has a heartier Turkish cousin called kisir , made with hot peppers in 
place of mint. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious use of bulgur is as a whole grain like rice. Cooks everywhere 
stuff vegetables with it and make it into pilaf. Burghul bi-dfin is a rich 
Syrian pilaf loaded with garbanzos, tiny onions and chunks of stewed lamb. 
This, like keshkek -- a sort of meat porridge known to Armenian, Kurdish, 
Turkish, Iraqi and (in ancient times) Iranian cooks -- may be one of the dishes 
that was made with whole wheat before bulgur was invented. 
</P>
<P>
 Like rice, bulgur goes into soups, above all in Armenia, a bulgur-oriented 
land known for very hearty soups. In spas and its more substantial cousin 
tanabur , the flavoring is yogurt, and kirchik gets a little sourness from 
sauerkraut.  
</P>
<P>
 But the major use of bulgur is kibbeh -- also known as kubba (Iraq), kobeiba 
(Egypt), bulgur koftesi (Turkey) and kuefte (western Armenia). One Arabic 
cookbook gives altogether 30 kibbeh recipes, including a couple made from 
gazelle meat. Kibbeh could be described as a glorified meatloaf/meatball 
mixture, made by moistening a cup or two of bulgur and then pounding or 
grinding it with a chopped onion and a pound of meat until it's a smooth paste. 
(Using a very fine grade of bulgur and a food processor, this can take a minute 
or so, not all afternoon, as it does with a mortar and pestle.)  
</P>
<P>
 Kibbeh can be grilled on a skewer, baked in a pan (like a sort of meat 
baklava), deep-fried or poached in liquid -- broth, yogurt sauce, tahineh 
sauce, tomato sauce, or even a hearty vegetable soup, which is preferred in 
northern Iraq. For both frying or poaching, the mixture is usually made into a 
sort of torpedo-shaped meatball with a stuffing of fried meat, onions, nuts, 
raisins and the like. In some places, such as the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, 
the meatball is large and rather flat, made by joining two thin patties of meat 
around the filling. 
</P>
<P>
 Christians form a near majority in Lebanon and a sizable minority in Syria and 
northern Iraq. To observe their fast days, they have invented meatless forms of 
kibbeh, such as kibbet al-rahib ("monk's kibbeh": balls of bulgur cooked with 
fried onions) and kibbet al-hileh ("trick kibbeh," where the balls of bulgur 
are stewed with lentils). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During Lent, Armenians make topik , a larger bulgur ball that includes ground 
garbanzos, with a walnut and currant stuffing. The Armenian vospov kuefteh is 
balls of bulgur and lentils flavored with chiles, parsley and mint. In fact, 
bulgur and lentils often go together in the Near East, both in pilafs and in 
stews. 
</P>
<P>
 In Syria, marshusha is bulgur cooked with spinach, black-eyed peas and lots of 
onions fried in olive oil. Shalbatu is bulgur with fried onions and eggplants 
and abu shalhub is a stew of bulgur with fried eggplants and cabbage, flavored 
with garlic and cilantro. In Turkey, moistened bulgur is mixed with tomatoes, 
onions, walnuts, peppers and herbs and made into patties called batirik that 
are served raw. The Assyrian Christians make bread dough with flour and bulgur 
that's been soaked in water overnight and bake it into little pizzas with a 
topping of tahineh. 
</P>
<P>
 The part of the world where bulgur originated is also the general area where 
wheat was domesticated in the first place, and it makes uses of wheat that 
aren't found elsewhere, such as kishk and tarkhana. There are innumerable 
recipes for these products, but typically you soak bulgur with yeast or yogurt 
and let it sit for a couple of days. Some versions are eaten raw, others are 
dried and added to soup, and still others are squeezed for their sour juices, 
which flavor soups. In Egypt, yogurt and bulgur are kneaded together, formed 
into balls and dried into the sun to make little balls of kishk that are eaten 
as a sour, chewy snack. 
</P>
<P>
 All these traditional fermented or semi-fermented foods have a combination of 
sharp flavor and pungent aroma that doesn't seem likely to sweep this nation 
off its feet the way tabbouleh did. Of course, you never know. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there are some sweet bulgur dishes, such as the Armenian bulghurapur 
, a soup of bulgur, grape syrup and walnuts. The Turks make a similar dish 
called kesme bulamac , adding sesame and spices.  
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, despite the sweet, earthy wheat flavor of of bulgur, people in Syria 
and Iraq often claim to prefer rice. Rice is both milder and more aromatic that 
bulgur, it's famously easy to digest, and it cooks up whiter, making for a more 
striking appearance on the table. Perhaps most important, it doesn't grow in 
the bulgur belt, so it's an expensive import, a prestige grain. 
</P>
<P>
 So a Lebanese proverb goes, "Honor to rice -- and bulgur can hang itself." In 
an Iraqi folk song, somebody asks, "O people of heaven, o people of hell, what 
do you eat?" and the people in heaven turn out to live on rice and apricots, 
while the people in hell eat bulgur and tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 But hey, that doesn't sound so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenian cuisine is rich in soups, many of them made tart with yogurt and 
thickened with bulgur. This version is flavored with sauerkraut. From 
"Armianskaia Kulinaria" by A. S. Piruzian.

 The "trick" in this Syrian-Lebanese vegetable soup is that there's no meat in 
the kibbeh "meatballs." The idea that a vegetarian dish is a deception 
(vegetarian dolmas are known as yalanji, the Turkish word for "counterfeit") 
goes back at least 1,200 years in the Near East.

GOOD COOKING: STEW OF KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seasonal ingredients are the key to good cooking even in winter, when produce 
bins offer less variety.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider the following menu, which features ingredients typically associated 
with winter -- venison, root vegetables and oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Venison has in recent years become increasingly popular because it's lean and 
flavorful. It has long been considered the meat of kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many home cooks think game is difficult to prepare (mainly because they 
have had little experience with it), it's as easy to cook venison as 
corresponding cuts of beef, with perhaps an even quicker cooking time for 
tender cuts. For example, the venison stew meat is from the shoulder; it cooks 
exactly the same way and for the same time as beef stew meat. In fact, you can 
substitute beef for the venison. 
</P>
<P>
 The venison ragout with red onions, dried cranberries and mushrooms is 
lightened with a combined cooking liquid of ruby Port and beef broth. It's a 
winter dish that is hearty without being heavy. Served over a pillow of pureed 
roots -- celery root, potato and parsnip -- the dinner plate has a great homey 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 A bright, refreshing dessert is in order. Orange slices are the base of a 
sundae with scoops of frozen vanilla yogurt, cloaked with a caramelized orange 
sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ragouts are thick, well-seasoned stews. Here, the ragout is a tart-sweet mix 
of venison, ruby Port and dried cranberries, perfect seasonal dinner party 
food. Stewing beef can be substituted for the venison.  
</P>
<P>
 VENISON RAGOUT WITH RED ONIONS, DRIED CRANBERRIES AND MUSHROOMS 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds venison stew meat, trimmed, cut into 3/4-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 Oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 large red onion, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 2 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups ruby Port 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups beef broth 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup dried cranberries 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Dash allspice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound small mushrooms, trimmed, quartered 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour, salt and pepper in plastic food bag. Pat meat dry with paper 
towels. Toss meat with seasoned flour until evenly coated, shaking off excess 
flour. Remove meat and put remaining seasoned flour into 1 1/2 quart casserole. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 2 teaspoons of butter and 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch non-stick skillet. 
When very hot, sear meat in 2 batches on all sides, about 1 1/2 minutes, adding 
another 2 teaspoons butter and oil as needed. Transfer seared meat to 
casserole. Toss meat with flour in casserole. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 2 more teaspoons of butter and 2 more teaspoons oil in same skillet over 
medium high heat. When hot, add onion and garlic. Cook until onion is tender, 
about 4 minutes. Add Port, beef broth, dried cranberries, sugar and allspice. 
Bring to boil. Pour over venison. Toss to mix well. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake, covered, on center oven rack 1 1/2 hours at 350 degrees. Add mushrooms. 
Mix well. Continue to bake, covered, until meat is tender, about 30 to 60 
minutes longer. Adjust seasonings to taste. Can be made day ahead and 
refrigerated or frozen up to 3 months. Reheat gently. Serve hot, spooned over 
mashed root vegetables. Makes 6 servings.

 A simple blending of celery root, potatoes and parsnip makes these mashed root 
vegetables as smooth as silk without much fat. The russet potatoes have just 
the right starchy texture to thicken the mixture. Celery root browns quickly 
once its surface is exposed to the air, so have the salted water boiling, ready 
for the peeled celery root and potatoes.  
</P>
<P>
 MASHED ROOT VEGETABLES WITH SWEET GARLIC 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium celery roots, peeled, cut into 2-inch chunks 
</P>
<P>
 2 large russet potatoes, peeled, cut into 2-inch chunks 
</P>
<P>
 1 large parsnip, peeled, cut into 2-inch chunks 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 quarts boiling salted water 
</P>
<P>
 4 large cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Plunge celery roots, potatoes and parsnip into pot of boiling water. Cook 10 
minutes. Add garlic cloves. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes 
more. Drain vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Put hot drained vegetables, butter, salt, nutmeg and pepper into processor 
fitted with metal blade. Puree mixture until very smooth, stopping to scrape 
down sides of bowl, about 1 to 2 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste. Transfer 
to greased 5-cup capacity baking dish. Cover dish with foil. Can be made 
several hours ahead and kept at room temperature.  
</P>
<P>
 To serve, bake at 300 degrees until hot, or reheat in microwave oven. Spoon 
hot mixture onto 6 heated dinner plates, dividing evenly. Ladle hot venison 
ragout over, again dividing evenly. Serve immediately. Makes 6 servings.

 SUNSHINE ORANGE SUNDAES 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup orange juice 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons orange zest, removed with zester or grater

<P>
 1 tablespoon cornstarch, mixed with 1 tablespoon water 
</P>
<P>
 4 large navel oranges 
</P>
<P>
 Low-fat frozen vanilla yogurt 
</P>
<P>
 Put butter and sugar in heavy 1-quart pot. Cook over medium high heat until 
mixture turns golden brown, about 5 to 6 minutes, stirring constantly once 
color starts to brown. Crystallized sugar bits will melt once orange juice is 
added. Add orange juice, zest and salt to pot. Simmer until sugar is dissolved. 
Add cornstarch mixture. Cook, stirring, until consistency is somewhat thickened 
and syrupy. (Can be made few days ahead and refrigerated. Before using, gently 
reheat in microwave oven or on stove top until hot.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cut flat bottoms and tops on oranges to reveal flesh. Rest orange on flat 
bottom on board and use sharp knife to remove peel. Also remove any white pith 
on surface. Invert orange, again resting on board, and remove any remaining 
peel and pith. Cut oranges into 1/4-inch slices. Can be sliced day ahead, 
wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, divide chilled orange slices among 6 shallow soup plates. Place 2 
small scoops of yogurt on top. Pour hot orange-caramel sauce over. Serve 
immediately. Makes 6 servings.

HOME COOK: A LEEK IN THE SOUP POT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like most home cooks, I tend to repeat a great new recipe until it is no 
longer welcome -- like a house guest that stays more than three days. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, leek and potato soup is an endangered soup in my house because 
I've cooked it at least five times in the last two weeks. In my defense, the 
soups I've cooked have not been exactly alike. After trying several variations 
on my basic recipe, I became curious about the classic French version of leek 
and potato soup ( potage Parmentier ) and turned to Julia Child's "Mastering 
the Art of French Cooking." As usual, she has something appropriate: a simple 
combination of potatoes and leeks stewed in water, pureed and then enriched 
with cream. 
</P>
<P>
 My recipe is slightly different because the vegetables (I like a little celery 
in the mix) are cooked in water and milk, and I don't add cream. And if you 
want to make vichyssoise, add four cups of water instead of three and reduce 
the milk from three cups to two cups. Cook as directed. After pureeing and 
cooling the soup, add one cup of heavy cream and chill before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 The arugula and iceberg salad will surprise you if you have never mixed these 
greens. This is an example of opposites that really do attract. The dark-green 
leaves of arugula taste sharp and peppery in contrast to the crisp, delicate 
iceberg leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Arugula can be found in many supermarkets, and most farmers markets have a 
good variety of seasonal salad makings such as arugula (also called rocket), 
cress, loose-leaf and lots of fresh herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 LEEK AND POTATO SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 6 small or 3 large leeks, well washed and thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 3 stalks celery with leaves, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups water 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in large pot. Add leeks and celery. Cook 10 minutes over moderate 
heat, stirring often.  
</P>
<P>
 Stir in water, potatoes and milk. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover 
and cook over low heat about 20 minutes more. Stir every 10 minutes, so 
vegetables don't stick to bottom of pot. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from heat when potatoes are done. Put soup into food processor or 
through food mill. Puree until smooth. Add more milk or water if soup is too 
thick. Soup should be as thick as heavy cream. Serve hot. Makes 6 servings.

</P>
<P>
 5 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Put pieces of iceberg lettuce into large mixing bowl. Cut arugula leaves in 
half, if too big. Add arugula to bowl of iceberg lettuce. Toss to combine. Put 
dampened paper towels over top of greens. Refrigerate until time to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine vinegar, water and salt in small jar with lid. Cover jar and shake 
mixture until salt dissolves. Add garlic, olive oil and mustard. Cover jar and

NEWS ANALYSIS; FISHING INDUSTRY: INSPECT THYSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seafood industry , despite a checkered food safety record, is now being 
called upon to police itself with minimal federal oversight under a 
controversial plan announced last week by the Clinton Administration.  
</P>
<P>
 The current, patchwork program -- sharply criticized as ineffective by critics 
-- will be replaced with a system that relies more on detailed company record 
keeping than on state-of-the-art government inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. Food and Drug Administration, responsible for implementing the 
500-page regulation, will usher in the changes without any increase in its 
Office of Seafood's $42 million annual budget. The size of the fisheries 
industry -- including domestic and imported product -- dwarfs the federal 
inspection effort with annual sales of $35.2 billion in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Public doubts about seafood safety have resulted in a five-year decline in 
per-capita consumption of fish and shellfish in the U.S. since a record 16.2 
pounds per person were consumed in 1987. Trade reports indicate that 
consumption levels dropped to 14.8 pounds in 1992, the last year for which 
figures are available. Even industry representatives acknowledge that consumer 
confidence in seafood needs to be "re-established" and applaud the government's 
proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton proposal, seafood companies must implement a system called 
Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point within a year of the publication of 
final regulations, expected in April. 
</P>
<P>
 HACCP, first developed in the 1960s, identifies the most important steps in 
food processing and establishes strict sanitation guidelines for these 
particular plant operations. A company must then chart its own progress in 
meeting the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the critical points in commercial seafood are areas such as storing, 
handling, cooking and packaging. For instance, records of where the fish were 
caught, plant cooking temperatures and freezer levels over extended periods 
must be maintained by the individual firms and be made available to federal 
inspectors on demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the government's task, regardless of the inspection system used, 
is daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 There are an estimated 350 FDA inspectors to oversee 4,846 seafood processors, 
1,571 repackers/warehouses and 924 importers. 
</P>
<P>
 (The Government Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, said in a 1991 food 
safety report that FDA did not know the location of all seafood plants in the 
country and thus could not accurately access the industry's sanitation record. 
FDA officials dispute the GAO claim.) 
</P>
<P>
 The disjointed nature of the seafood industry, ranging from mom-and-pop 
domestic operators to extensive fish imports from dozens of nations, has 
prompted the FDA to concentrate on about 1,000 "high-risk" processors or those 
that prepare ready-to-eat seafood. However, the high-risk plants will receive 
only one inspection per year from FDA; all others will be visited once every 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest way for consumers to understand the new seafood HACCP program is 
to compare the FDA plan with tactics used by the Internal Revenue Service. The 
IRS regularly publicizes the consequences -- fines, jail -- of tax cheating 
but, in reality, is hopelessly understaffed to verify each and every tax 
return. As a result, the IRS targets its resources in specific income groups or 
where there has been a pattern of violations. Like the IRS, the FDA will 
require seafood companies to prepare detailed records of their sanitation 
performance but the agency will be hard pressed to visually inspect, or audit, 
any but the most likely violators once a year. Yet, the companies will be 
liable for criminal penalties if they have been found to violate the 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most sides in the seafood safety debate acknowledge that the HACCP-oriented 
seafood program is a step in the right direction. But some remain skeptical how 
the plan will be an improvement, considering that it requires no additional 
funding, places federal inspectors in processing plants only once a year, at 
best, and relies on the seafood industry's integrity to maintain accurate 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If we find something wrong (in a seafood plant) and then we find out that a 
firm has been falsifying HACCP records then we will take appropriate action," 
said Thomas J. Billy, director of FDA's Office of Seafood. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of the authenticity of the HACCP records will determine the 
program's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Fisheries Institute, an Arlington, Va.,-based trade group, says 
the plan will improve the effectiveness of government inspections because of 
all the additional data available. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tough, new program that places legally enforceable requirements on 
the (seafood) industry," said Lee J. Weddig, institute executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Others claim that all the additional record keeping will become irrelevant if 
inspections are not frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The responsibility for making HACCP work is all on the seafood industry," 
said Caroline Smith DeWaal, with Public Voice for Food and Health Policy. "This 
wonderful program is supposed to save us from bad fish but it doesn't have the 
inspection resources or the people or the enforcement authority to adequately 
get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the deficiencies, Smith DeWaal says FDA lacks the authority to recall or 
seize contaminated fish products from the marketplace and is unable to legally 
close plants operating in an unsanitary manner. Nor does the agency require 
prior federal licensing for companies that process or market seafood as a means 
of knowing who -- and how many firms -- are handling the highly perishable 
food. Further, there will be no dockside inspection of fishing vessels nor 
inspection of trucks that transport the food interstate, Smith DeWaal says. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA officials are quick to state that implementation of HACCP is not an 
abdication of federal responsibility for seafood safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I totally disagree (with claims that FDA is lessening its role)," said Billy. 
"Even now the industry has the responsibility to insure the safety of its 
products (under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act). 
What this HACCP proposal does is prescribe controls that we want to see in 
every aspect of their operation . . . This signifies further strengthening (of 
inspection efforts)."

 Billy said one independent check of the HACCP system will be the continuation 
of FDA's random sampling of seafood at all stages of the food chain in order to 
independently determine whether there are contamination problems. As estimated 
9,000 fish and shellfish samples will be taken annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it has been during such inspections that FDA has found persistent problem 
with the performance of seafood companies. In a survey of 500 of the nation's 
seafood plants between 1991 and 1992, FDA found that 16% of those facilities 
surveyed "had problems with general sanitation conditions in their processing 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, when violations are detected, the FDA will give the offending 
company written notice that the inspector has found a sanitation problem. Then 
the firm is given a choice to either correct the deficiency or challenge the 
finding, which can initiate a lengthy bureaucratic procedure. If the violations 
present a serious public health problem, the FDA can seek court intervention to 
force the company to comply, a cumbersome process. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which operates the meat and 
poultry inspection program, has the authority to simply close a plant operating 
under unsanitary conditions. And the USDA did temporarily close about 30 meat 
plants for serious violations last year in the aftermath of the outbreak of 
illnesses related to contaminated hamburger. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when a multi-state outbreak of gastroenteritis was linked to Louisiana 
oysters in November, the FDA could only issue an advisory that consumers should 
not eat the shellfish from the two implicated harvesting areas. And nothing in 
the new HACCP seafood inspection proposal will empower FDA to do anything more 
than issue similar advisories in the future. Or go to court.

RECIPES FROM A SOUTHERN DUCHESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This past holiday I was offered a sweet little gift, a curious volume entitled 
"Some Favorite Southern Recipes of the Duchess of Windsor." The book of 140 
recipes was published in 1942 by Charles Scribner's Sons, and the royalties 
were donated to the British War Relief Society. 
</P>
<P>
 In an intriguing introduction, Eleanor Roosevelt states that "one of the real 
improvements in American living and health has been the discarding of the 
elaborate and extravagant menus that marked our entertaining as recently as the 
General Grant period. And it has been done without any real loss in the 
enjoyment of fine foods." 
</P>
<P>
 She was happy to see simplification and balance in the food choices of 
Americans. Roosevelt was concerned about vitamins and minerals. She commended 
home economics departments for teaching students "not only the principles of 
nutrition but how to make food appealing in both appearance and taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis Windsor, as the duchess signed her name, was a Baltimore girl, and she 
writes of the South as a region known for its fine foods: "It is the simple 
dishes of my homeland which are the most popular . . . and which are the ones 
most frequently served at my table." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good recipe books document a specific period, illuminating for us the customs 
and tastes of that era. The world was obviously much larger in 1942 than it is 
today, as evidenced by the lack of familiarity with so many dishes in our 
cooking vocabulary today. In the final, short chapter entitled "Some of My 
Favorite Foreign Recipes," there's a chicken madras recipe, one for haddock 
souffle and a risotto. These seem hardly foreign today. 
</P>
<P>
 The repertoire of flavorings is limited to salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, 
sage, thyme, cloves, allspice, mace and nutmeg. There's file powder in two 
gumbo recipes. There's no garlic in the entire book. Tomatoes are used in only 
one recipe -- ravioli with tomato sauce. When vinegar is called for in a recipe 
for pickled oysters, the only specification in the ingredient list is that it 
be hot. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two recipes using terrapin, one for fish roes and one for calf's 
tongue. There are six recipes each for crab and oysters. The bread chapter is 
as large as the meat and poultry chapter. Even in a book on Southern cooking, 
it's obvious that people's tastes were considerably different 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Perusing the duchess' effort, I found the recipes remarkably simple. Most 
recipes call for only four to eight ingredients. By comparison, the average 
recipe in cookbooks today has eight ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice is browned until golden before moistening with water, which gives a 
wonderful nutty flavor. The fried chicken is browned in fat, then cooked with 
fat and a little water until tender. It's a bit silly to give a recipe, as I do 
here, for peaches in January, but I couldn't resist this simple way of making 
brandied fruit. (It works just as well using firm pears.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our cooking today is more complicated, but is it any better? There's no recipe 
in the book that goes on for more than one page. In fact, most are completed in 
only a few steps. The directions are not as precise as in many modern 
cookbooks, probably because more Americans knew their way around a kitchen 50 
years ago. Still, nothing is beyond the realm of a novice cook today. 
</P>
<P>
 The duchess' assumption was clearly that most people cooked every day. There's 
no implied message that cooking is a hobby or a means of relaxation on the 
weekend. In a short beginning section, the duchess gives some typical Southern 
menus. It shows that an average meal -- at least in the duchess' upper-class 
haunts -- consisted of more dishes than we are accustomed to serving today, 
especially more vegetable and bread dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 It struck me that the classic American style of eating 50 years ago consisted 
of many dishes served together on the same plate, a sort of Thanksgiving feast 
every day of the week. In this typically American style of eating, no single 
dish is meant to be the star of the meal. That perhaps explains why each of 
these recipes seems a bit austere by today's style of cooking. In the book, no 
single dish is as robust as what we're used to, and in a sense, each dish is 
like an ingredient in a recipe. When put together into a meal, the total is 
greater than the sum of all the individual parts.

IN THE KITCHEN; BUMPING INTO AN OLD FLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I first started getting serious about cooking, I attacked it with an 
amateur's passion: I read everything I could get my hands on; I took as many 
classes as I could, and I tried out new recipes on the family every night. And 
I was fortunate enough to have friends who would let me come in and work in 
their restaurants (without pay, of course). 
</P>
<P>
 I vividly remember the first time I realized the difference between cooking 
for love and cooking for pay. I was led into the tiny, roasting-hot kitchen of 
a friend's creperie , where a battered four-burner stove was blazing with a 
dinged-up non-stick pan atop each burner. Beside the stove was a bucket of 
batter. 
</P>
<P>
 My lesson began. First, a quick brush of melted butter on the pan, then a 
ladle of batter right in the middle. Turning and tilting the pan spread the 
batter to cover the bottom evenly. Back the pan went on the burner for a minute 
or two, then bang ! A knock on the stove unstuck the crepe. Tilting the pan 
forward gathered the crepe in the lip opposite the handle, and a quick jerk 
flipped it neatly onto the uncooked side. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need 500 of these for a party this evening," I was told. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I still enjoy cooking in restaurant kitchens now and again, but that day 
permanently killed any thoughts I might have entertained about doing it as 
anything but a tourist. Dirty, sweaty, with feet aching from having stood in 
one place for hours and fingers sunburned by the constant gas flames, it didn't 
take a genius to know there had to be a better way to make a living than 
slinging crepes. 
</P>
<P>
 That experience almost killed what affection I ever felt for the thin little 
pancakes, though I did come away with the semi-marketable skill of being able 
to flip them with grand insouciance (something that later got me through many a 
slow night struggling to entertain students at cooking classes). 
</P>
<P>
 But I doubt that I've cooked crepes at home more than a dozen times in the 
intervening 10 years. What is it people say about familiarity? 
</P>
<P>
 Over the holidays I visited the little restaurant where I first learned to 
make crepes. It has a different owner now, but much of the menu remains. Just 
for old times' sake, I ordered a crepe filled with a rich, tangy, lightly 
sweetened combination of sour cream, whipped cream and cream cheese. Then 
another, this time filled with chocolate ganache. Then yet another, filled 
simply and elegantly with honey and chopped walnuts. I was shocked. These 
things were absolutely delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Crepes themselves have little flavor but a slight egginess. What they do have 
is a soft, delicate texture that wraps nicely around a wide range of flavors -- 
both sweet and savory. They work as well with a thick stew of shellfish, cream 
and white wine as with cinnamon sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While crepes aren't difficult to make, there are a couple of mechanical tricks 
that take some practice. The first is the spreading of the batter. It's 
facilitated by the fact that the batter is a smooth liquid that turns into a 
sticky solid when it comes in contact with a hot pan. So, by tilting the heated 
pan in a rough circle, you swirl the batter from the center of the pan outward 
until you form a thin pancake. 
</P>
<P>
 The second trick involves turning the crepe once it is done on one side. One 
easy way to do this is by running a thin spatula around the edge of the crepe, 
then lifting one edge with the fingertips of both hands and turning it 
manually. This is slow. And it's easy to rip the crepe this way. Mainly, it's 
just kind of wimpy. There's nothing like a jaunty toss of a pan to show that 
certain elan that is so vital to impressive crepe making. Dip the front end of 
the pan so the crepe slides forward. Then, with a simultaneous pushing and 
lifting jerk, flip it over. All it takes is a little practice. But trust me, 
500 times is probably overdoing it. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This recipe comes from a tiny restaurant called La Crepe Michel in the Old 
Town section of Albuquerque, N.M. If you're ever in the area, be sure to drop 
in for well-done rustic French food. Just don't volunteer to cook any crepes.  
</P>
<P>
 CREPES WITH WALNUTS AND HONEY 
</P>
<P>
 6 Crepes 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, plus more for sprinkling 
</P>
<P>
 Honey 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly sweetened whipped cream 
</P>
<P>
 On oven-proof serving plate, lay 1 crepe flat. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons chopped 
walnuts down center of crepe. Bake at 350 degrees 5 minutes to warm walnuts 
through. Spoon 1 tablespoon honey over walnuts and fold both sides of crepe 
over, letter-style. Heat another minute, then remove from oven, add dollop of 
whipped cream and drizzle bit more honey and walnuts over whipped cream. Makes 
6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 179 calories; 140 mg sodium; 42 mg cholesterol; 13 grams fat; 13 grams 
carbohydrates; 5 grams protein; 0.72 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For savory crepes, simply omit the sugar.  
</P>
<P>
 Crepes 
</P>
<P>
 2 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 Combine eggs, milk, salt, flour and sugar in blender and puree until smooth. 
Batter should be texture of heavy cream. Let stand at least 1/2 hour, 
preferably 1 hour or even overnight in refrigerator to let batter relax. If 
left overnight before using, pour into mixing bowl and whisk to re-mix. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to use, heat 9-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until 
hot. Pour approximately 1/4 cup batter in center of pan and tilt pan, turning 
to spread batter in circle. Return pan to heat and cook until 1 side is just 
browned, about 1 minute. Pick up crepe from pan with spatula and, using your 
fingers, flip to cook other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, break crepe free by banging pan and shaking gently back and 
forth. Tilt pan to slide crepe to front and, with flick of wrist, flip crepe 
over. Cook 30 seconds on second side and slide onto warmed plate. Any leftover 
crepes can be stacked, separated by wax paper and frozen. Makes 12 crepes.

POLENTA PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps I can help you on a couple of points regarding your article on cooking 
polenta ("Polenta: A Stirring Tale," Jan. 13). My family is from Trentino in 
northern Italy, where I have spent an enjoyable portion of my life.Polenta is 
our basic food. We eat a great deal of risotto also, some pasta, but from fall 
through spring, the mainstay is polenta. 
</P>
<P>
 We also have a modern house, but in the kitchen is the requisite wooden stove 
for cooking polenta (it also heats the kitchen nicely on snowy nights). Polenta 
is always cooked in a deep copper pot, which I also use here, although the 
stove is gas. Newlyweds are generally given a new trisa , or faggio as it is 
called in Alba, which is a sturdy stick made out of beechwood with which to 
stir the polenta. Rarely would anyone use a spoon for the stirring. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing the grain into the boiling water is always a problem, but one which our 
area does not experience. That is because we mix the grain with a small amount 
of cold water first so that it is wet before it goes into the pot. The result 
is that it will not clot into lumps. Try it sometime. 
</P>
<P>
 I completely agree that instant polenta does not work. I have tried many of 
the types now sold in Italy, and they have no flavor or character. Besides, I 
enjoy setting my guests around a platter of cheese and a bottle of wine in the 
kitchen while I do the stirring. It is a good place for conversation.

A LOAF FOUND LACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I tried your recipe for herb ham loaf ("Who Will Speak for Ham?" Jan. 6) and 
found it wanting.From my long years of experience I've found that one needs 
something like cracker or bread crumbs to hold the meatloaf together. The herb 
ham loaf recipe had none and the result is a crumbly meat concoction that may 
be good for stuffing green peppers or baked eggplant.

 This citrus marinade used for grilled shrimp or chicken is naturally low in 
fat with only one tablespoon of oil added. Orange zest and juice, rosemary and 
garlic help boost flavor.It's a great dish to serve as either appetizer or main 
course. 
</P>

A MATTER OF QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Due to space restrictions, my piece in praise of fat ("What's Higher Than a 
Cream Puff?" Dec. 9) was cut and inadvertently reworded in a way that 
misconstrued the meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not (as stated) replace the butter in my cream puff recipe with olive 
oil because I believe it to be more healthful, but only because in this 
particular instance the quality of the item is improved. 
</P>
<P>
 My main point is that theories about what is good for you are constantly 
changing. Jumping on the bandwagon of new theories may only result in unwanted 
calories, which is the greatest danger of all. The important things to keep in 
mind are balance and moderation, and to use each fat in an appropriate and 
optimal manner.

PRIZE WINNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Daniel Puzo's brilliant analysis of food safety concerns in the United States 
("America's Food Supply" Jan. 6) should win him a journalistic prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Faithfully, in the pages of the Food section, he has calmly and lucidly 
alerted us to be aware -- of tainted mollusks, of suspect hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest article was a page-turner for me. Incredibly complex data coalesced 
into matter for reflection and action.

WONDER FOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Your piece on Greek cooking ("Secrets of a Greek Grandmother," Jan. 13) is 
fabulous and is being promptly added to our collection of Armenian cookbooks! 
Both ethnic groups, which are akin in so many ways, seem to approach cooking 
with zest and creativity as well as utmost enjoyment, which shows up in their 
delectable dishes. Feta cheese, which figures prominently in so many ways in 
Greek cuisine, is often avoided by so many of us who are on salt-free diets.Our 
family secret is to have feta cheese first soaked for several days in milk, 
then rinsed in cold water and eaten in a salad or a sandwich or whatever. The 
taste of this desalted feta is still delicious though it may lack the punch of 
the original. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the piece on "The Soul of Pilaf" by Charles Perry (Food, Dec. 9) reveals 
dramatically the multicultural characteristic of this wonder food. Those of us 
who have grown up relishing it have long suspected it and I, for one, am 
delighted that it's now out in the open. I'm adding Perry's piece to my 
collection, too.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: REPORT FUELS A MOBIL-TORRANCE TUSSLE OVER $5.4-MILLION 
TAX BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TAXING MATTERS: The city of Torrance claims that its single largest taxpayer, 
Mobil Oil Corp., has fallen behind in paying its taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is not your average tax scofflaw story. City Hall wants a check from 
Mobil for a whopping $5.4 million in back taxes and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil counters that not only has it paid the tax bill in full, but Torrance 
may actually owe more than $1 million to the oil giant, which operates a 
750-acre refinery in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggering this auditors' skirmish is a 1992 city consultant's report 
concluding that Mobil was not paying the required tax on the natural gas it 
consumed. 
</P>
<P>
 So the city sent Mobil a dunning notice last fall requesting about $4 million 
in back taxes as well as interest and a 25% penalty. Mobil insists, however, 
that the consultant's report was flawed and that Mobil may be due a $1.6 
million refund, plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The tussle will continue at a Feb. 15 hearing before the City Council. But 
officials on both sides hasten to add that the disagreement is not marring the 
relative equanimity that has marked city-Mobil relations since 1990, when the 
two parties signed a consent decree ending a bitter legal battle over refinery 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see this as being a breakdown at all," said Mobil spokesman Barry 
Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no reason to believe that Mobil is going to refuse to pay any tax 
that they believe is legitimately due," added Torrance City Atty. John L. 
Fellows III. "We think they're trying to behave as a good corporate citizen."

 BILLIARD BLUES: Pool halls may once have been havens for sharks, but now 
owners are pitching their places to upscale professionals, families and the MTV 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 In Torrance, for example, plans are afoot to convert the Velvet Turtle into a 
National Sports Grill & Bar, which in other locations attracts a yuppie crowd 
to its pool tables. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be the trend, but not in Manhattan Beach. City planners still think 
that booze and billiards don't mix near residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Planning Commission turned down plans to convert a former 
liquor store at 4005 Highland Ave. into Manhattan Beach Breakers, which would 
feature 14 pool tables, two game areas and a big-screen TV, plus an adjoining 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners objected to plans to serve liquor and keep the pool hall open 
until 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the pool hall, however, dispute that their establishment will 
attract the wrong element. They plan to appeal to the City Council.

 AUTO DECOR: The long-running controversy over the presence of two 1962 Chevy 
Novas in a Lawndale driveway drew to a close last week when the City Council 
decided the cars could stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars belong to City Councilwoman Nancy Marthens, who has described them as 
classics that she hopes to restore. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials concluded last summer that the cars violated the city code 
regarding "inoperable vehicles," and the City Council deadlocked Jan. 6 when it 
tried to resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on new information from the city attorney, however, the council voted 
last week to permit the two Novas to remain in Marthens' driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and the city has decided to take a fresh look at how it defines 
"inoperable vehicles." 
</P>

 SMOOTH TRANSITION: A month ago, it looked as if Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del 
Rey) would lose a connection to the Pentagon's top chief with the departure of 
Defense Secretary Les Aspin. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspin -- a friend since her days in the Carter Administration -- helped her 
get on powerful House committees. And their friendship didn't suffer when she 
and other lawmakers successfully lobbied to keep the Los Angeles Air Force Base 
in El Segundo open. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, however, didn't have the same ties to Bobby Ray Inman, President 
Clinton's first choice for Pentagon chief. And one opponent in this year's 
election predicted she would "lose her sympathetic ear." 
</P>
<P>
 But with Clinton's latest nomination, Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry, 
Harman once again may have a friend in the top spot. She knew Perry from the 
Carter Administration as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an excellent choice," she said. "He's very good for the South Bay and 
very good for this Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, he has set foot in the neighborhood. In June, he went to a 
Hughes Aircraft Co. plant in El Segundo to survey some company projects. QUOTE 
OF THE WEEK

SANTA MONICA'S GREATEST SHORTAGE MAY BE ANSWERS; QUAKE AFTERMATH: WHO GETS 
DISASTER RELIEF? WHAT DO THOSE YELLOW TAGS MEAN? WHAT RIGHTS DO TENANTS HAVE? 
THE CITY, FACED WITH 3,100 UNSAFE APARTMENT UNITS AND THOUSANDS OF JOB LOSSES, 
IS TRYING TO RELIEVE THE ANXIETY.

 Bobbe Paris pushed her baby son's stroller down 2nd Street in Santa Monica. 
Max was all smiles, but, after a visit to the federal disaster aid center, his 
mom was in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no money for me because I'm (already) homeless," Paris said. "How can 
I get President Clinton on the phone?" 
</P>
<P>
 One of the newly homeless, an elderly woman who lived in the now unsafe 
Charmont apartments, had a question of her own. "Are we just supposed to forget 
we have furniture or what?" Joyce Jackson asked city officials at a community 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about paying the rent, rescuing your mother's engagement ring and, 
arguably, the most-asked question over the past week: What does a yellow tag 
mean? 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days after being crippled by the earthquake, there is no end to questions 
in Santa Monica, the Westside city hit hardest by last week's earthquake. But 
there has not been an abundance of answers, as those who live and work in the 
city try to put their lives back together. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous amount of anxiety out there," Councilman Ken Genser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving swiftly to allay tenants' fears that they will be sent packing, the 
Santa Monica City Council on Tuesday passed emergency measures that place a 
moratorium on evictions from unsafe structures and require property owners to 
have a structural report on their buildings in 30 days or face fines. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinances passed unanimously, despite arguments that the laws will do 
precisely what the council promised it would not do -- put an undue onus on 
property owners, rather than facilitate their recovery from disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about the message," Councilwoman Asha Greenberg said. 
"Everything we're doing is punitive in this ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports indicating Santa Monica suffered greater damage than other 
Westside areas -- and perhaps as much as anyplace except around the Northridge 
epicenter -- were reaffirmed this week. The only Westside damage to rival it 
occurred in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The grim update on Santa Monica's damage was provided to the City Council 
Tuesday night by City Manager John Jalili. He reported that 530 buildings have 
been declared unsafe, including 59 multiunit buildings containing 3,100 units 
-- about 12% of the apartment housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that 4,000 apartment dwellers are unable to stay in their units, a 
tally that does not include displaced homeowners, merchants, and owners and 
employees of businesses -- among them St. John's Hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 Though hospital administrator Tom Pyne vows that St. John's is "going 
full-steam ahead" to repair and rebuild, the hospital's 2,000 employees have 
been laid off and told to apply for unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing else to do," Pyne said. 
</P>
<P>
 No job loss statistics are available yet, but the layoffs at St. John's alone, 
the city's largest employer, foretell a much larger problem as businesses with 
no place to operate shed their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report to the City Council, Santa Monica Finance Director Mike 
Dennis estimated the short-term tax revenue loss to the city at $2 million to 
$7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a tactical alert and extra officers on loan from the sheriff's 
department, Sgt. Gary Gallinot said at least two dozen reports of looting have 
been received, including one apartment burglary at which $37,000 worth of goods 
were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 While police tried to keep the peace, Mayor Judy Abdo said she has been 
lobbying federal officials for a bigger share of disaster relief than Santa 
Monica would be entitled to under the usual aid formulas, which are tied to the 
amount of poverty in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The aid "needs to be based on the amount of damage done and the numbers (of 
people) impacted, not on what we normally get," Abdo said. "We have a great 
need for (it) now to recover." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its efforts to reach out to the community, the city conducted a 
public workshop on Saturday, answering questions for two hours. All affected 
city department heads were on hand to provide updates and reassure people, who 
remained calm and positive despite jangled nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Santa Monica," said one resident of the condemned Sea Castle 
apartments. "Where else can you get a call back from a City Council member even 
during a disaster?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Castle residents, who have a history of strife with their landlord, are 
particularly worried that the earthquake will be used as a rationale to get rid 
of them. Other tenants also expressed fears that they could not trust their 
landlord to provide an unbiased structural report . 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the anxiety of residents who couldn't get to treasured possessions 
and important documents, the Fire Department has set up a program to shore up 
buildings to allow rescue teams to retrieve possessions.

DEVELOPER MAKES HIS MOVE; REAL ESTATE: TORRANCE BUILDER IS BETTING HE CAN 
COMPETE WITH PRICEY COMMUNITIES FOR HIGH-END HOME BUYERS. THE JURY IS OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 On Crest Road in Rancho Palos Verdes, a 4,500-square-foot estate home once 
priced at $2 million sold for $725,000 in a bank foreclosure sale last year. 
</P>
<P>
 This was just one of dozens of posh homes on the peninsula that nose-dived in 
value when the bottom fell out of the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 But developer Rob Dick bets that high-end home buyers still want to move into 
a new home overlooking the ocean, even if the $700,000-plus homes are slightly 
smaller and have a decidedly less exclusive mailing address: Torrance. The 28 
homes he plans to build in the Hollywood Riviera, a beachfront section of the 
city that neighbors the peninsula, are among only a handful of pricey digs 
being built in the Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the first four-bedroom model is scheduled to open in the Riviera 
Beach Colony, offering buyers gated access, views of Santa Monica Bay, in-home 
security and built-in stereo systems. 
</P>
<P>
 With interest rates still low, Dick said, house hunters will have the 
confidence by spring to buy once again. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have got to gear up and be ready for when things turn," Dick said. 
"That's when people get caught, when things turn around and they are not 
prepared to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 He said more than 300 people have expressed interest in touring the first of 
the Mediterranean-style homes.  
</P>
<P>
 "You'll always be affected by the layoffs, but there's also a huge percentage 
of people working," he said. "And people forget that there still are people 
moving in, executives relocating . . . or retirees who have a larger home and 
want something a little smaller but still offering an active lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Fran Walsh and her husband, Jim, both 66, looked over the development a few 
weeks ago in hopes of finding smaller quarters than their five-bedroom Rolling 
Hills home built on a half-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people our age want to get out from under the responsibility of a 
large home," Fran Walsh said. "You have the gardeners, all the landscaping, the 
utilities. It all adds up." 
</P>
<P>
 But she is not sold on the Riviera Beach Colony. Because of nearby apartments, 
she said she fears more noise and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick and his sales force plan to impress buyers with amenities: expansive 
master bedrooms with walk-in closets, whirlpool baths and fireplaces; media 
rooms designed to hold home theater systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even with all the frills, real estate agents say his project will be a 
tough sell. Median home prices on the hill have declined from a peak of 
$665,000 in 1990 to $474,000 last year. Sales have picked up -- from 478 homes 
sold in 1992 to 696 sold in 1993 -- but the majority of homes were $500,000 or 
below, said Carolyn Malmquist, a Palos Verdes Estates real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "These will have to be dynamite, wonderful homes," Malmquist said of the 
Riviera Beach Colony. "It's a tough price range." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past eight months, only three of six new homes near the old Marineland 
site have sold. The asking prices were $1.3 million to $1.4 million, but the 
homes have fetched about $900,000, said Larry Arman, broker at RE/MAX Rolling 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 homes repossessed by banks and other lenders on the peninsula may be 
unloaded at deep discounts, Arman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have a hell of a time (in the Riviera Beach Colony)," Arman 
said. "Whoever's doing it now is insane." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick says he has a safety net. Only three homes are under construction, and 
the rest will be built as they are bought. Even selling seven homes a year 
would make the project profitable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we stop building (because of the market), we stop building," he said. "But 
everyone assumes the market is going to turn." 
</P>
<P>
 He remains optimistic even after last week's earthquake, which destroyed the 
chimney of his own Santa Monica home but caused no damage to the Riviera Beach 
Colony. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come here for jobs and stay here for jobs," he said. "The earthquakes 
are part of the equation. It's a negative, but you live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, sales of homes priced at $1 million or more have increased because 
that is where buyers see large discounts and a "window of opportunity," 
Malmquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the Riviera Beach Colony project's planners will have another 
marketing challenge on their hands: convincing buyers that Torrance can be just 
as desirable as the more affluent Manhattan Beach or Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manhattan Beach has gotten too crowded, and you have residents in Palos 
Verdes Estates who want to be closer to the sea," said Mark Paolucci, executive 
vice president of Roddan Public Relations and Advertising in Redondo Beach, 
which is marketing the project. "What you have with this project is a small, 
intimate enclave."

<P>
 Marketers also are touting the area's history. In the 1920s, Clifford Reid 
purchased 640 acres on the Torrance-Redondo Beach border, where he envisioned a 
French Riviera-like colony populated by movie stars. The Depression stymied his 
plans, and just a beach club was built. Reid finally sold the club in the 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s and '60s, modest single-family homes and apartments were built, 
Paolucci said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Riviera Beach Colony is really tied to the whole history of the area," 
Dick said. "It's what the original developer had in mind, just 50 years late."

IS GOD TO BLAME FOR EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE, OR ARE PEOPLE AT FAULT?; AFTERMATH: THE 
ANSWER TRANSCENDS THEOLOGY BECAUSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE AT STAKE. BATTLE 
LINES ARE BEING DRAWN AMONG GOVERNMENT, PROPERTY OWNERS AND TENANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a question that may be raised often in the coming weeks and months: Was 
the destruction caused by last week's earthquake an act of God? Or was certain 
damage actually caused by imperfect acts of humankind? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not merely a theological question. From Chatsworth to Pasadena to San 
Pedro, millions of dollars could be riding on the answer, as lawyers and 
property owners and tenants battle over who is responsible for the losses 
caused by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the opening skirmishes in that battle may be fought at King Harbor 
Marina in Redondo Beach, where the collapse of a small spit of man-made land 
caused an estimated $2.5 million in damages. The marina operators say the city 
should pay for all the damage, including $500,000 or so for an asphalt parking 
lot and small buildings that the marina owners lost when the soil beneath the 
parking lot was turned into mush by the "liquefaction" phenomenon and the 
parking lot collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, on the other hand, say in effect that the damage was God's 
fault, not theirs, and if the marina owners want to be reimbursed, well, maybe 
they should take it up with Him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, if the subsoil (which is owned by the city) goes bad, who's 
responsible?" says Les Guthrie of Marina Cove Ltd., the marina owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach Harbor Director Ray Koke disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start doing it that way, and you're going to have 500 million people 
suing each other for acts of God," Koke says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has its roots in the 1950s, when Redondo Beach decided to build a 
harbor and marina site just south of Hermosa Beach. In the middle of the marina 
basin the harbor developers built a 130-foot by 1,300-foot peninsula, called a 
"mole," to which the marina's docks were attached. Mole "B" had rock and 
concrete sides and was filled in with sandy soil. 
</P>
<P>
 After the marina site was completed, it was leased to a private company that 
built surface improvements, including an asphalt parking lot for boat owners 
and a laundry and restrooms on the mole for boat owners' convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost of the project, which opened in 1961, was about $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The mole and the marina had no damage from the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, the 
1987 Whittier earthquake or the Landers earthquake of 1992. But even though the 
epicenter was 28 miles away, when the Northridge earthquake hit, the King 
Harbor Marina rocked and rolled violently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an experience, being in an earthquake in a boat," said Ernest Wegener, 
61, who lives aboard his 25-foot sailboat "Sagitta" at the marina. "All the 
masts were just whipping left and right." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, the bulkhead or wall on the south side of Mole B was broken, 
and half a dozen boats were damaged, most only slightly. Meanwhile, a 500-foot 
section of the parking lot on top of the mole collapsed, sending some of the 
dozens of parked cars in the lot into a mucky chasm about six feet deep. The 
two laundry-restrooms were structurally damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The "liquefaction" phenomenon that apparently caused the collapse occurs when 
loosely packed, fine-grained soil saturated with water is hit with shock waves, 
causing the soil to become like jelly. Areas of unstable soil abound in Los 
Angeles County, particularly along the coast from Santa Monica to Seal Beach. 
To combat the problem, most structures in the beach communities are built on 
pilings; the new Redondo Beach Pier now under construction, for example, has 
some pilings 120 feet long -- about 10 stories high -- that are driven down 
through the sand to bedrock. 
</P>
<P>
 The city intends to repair its portion of the marina damage -- the mole walls 
and the lost subsoil -- at a cost of about $2 million. Harbor Director Koke 
said he hopes permanent reconstruction will begin within two months, and that 
repairs will be complete in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the parking lot, Koke said he believes that since the mole complied 
with standards in effect in 1961 -- before anyone had ever heard of 
liquefaction -- the city shouldn't have to replace the parking lot, because its 
destruction was an act of God. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach City Atty. Jerry Goddard said it would be premature to comment 
on the matter. He added, however, "All things are negotiable." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he declined to comment on the specifics of the King Harbor case, USC 
law professor George Lefcoe said that while liability clauses in contracts 
vary, "An earthquake is a wonderful example of an act of God." In most cases in 
California, he said, as long as structures complied with building codes in 
effect when they were built, the owners are not liable for acts of God. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, marina owner Guthrie says he'll repair the damage now and see who 
pays for it later.

SOUTH BAY QUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
 At least 188 people were treated at South Bay hospitals for injuries related 
to the quake, according to tallies Monday from 11 hospitals. Los Angeles County 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance treated 43 patients, the most of any 
hospital in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Most patients suffered relatively minor injuries, such as fractures or 
lacerations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men suffered fatal heart attacks and two women were found dead in their 
homes after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 One man died at 8:50 a.m. Jan. 17 at Memorial Hospital of Gardena, where 
officials declined to release his name but said his death is not being 
classified as quake-related. 
</P>
<P>
 The county coroner's office had not determined Wednesday whether the 
earthquake was the cause of the second death, that of Richard Whitfield, a 
56-year-old Inglewood man, at 5:42 a.m. Jan. 17 at Centinela Hospital Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Melton, 80, of Inglewood was found dead in her home at 9:22 a.m. Jan. 
17. Her death is considered quake-related, said Scott Carrier, a spokesman for 
the County Coroner's Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty O'Connor, 70, was pronounced dead at her home in Torrance shortly after 
the quake at 5:19 a.m., Carrier said. O'Connor had a heart condition, but the 
death is listed as quake-related, he said. DAMAGES 
</P>
<P>
 Avalon -- Negligible damage.

RELIGION; ST. MONICA'S UNBROKEN SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hours after Monday's earthquake, hundreds of shaken parishioners hurried to 
check on St. Monica's Catholic Church, one of the older and larger Catholic 
churches in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cried at the sight of the crumbled bell tower, the roofless sanctuary and 
the broken altar, where thousands of babies have been christened, marriages 
blessed and deaths mourned. 
</P>
<P>
 But 10 days later, the church where Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and other luminaries worship is on the road to recovery thanks 
in part to its affluent members and community support. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't hurt that the restoration effort is being guided by a longtime 
parishioner who happens to be a structural engineer working on a project to 
strengthen Los Angeles City Hall against earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The outpouring has buoyed officials of the landmark church, which was founded 
in 1886 and is housed in a 1928 Byzantine granite and terra-cotta building at 
7th Street and California Avenue. Roughly 5,000 families are members. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have come here all last week with tears in their eyes . . . offering 
to help in any way they can," said Monsignor Lloyd Torgerson. "And unsolicited, 
they have (written checks and) said, 'Here, this is to help.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers have helped relocate Masses to St. Monica High School's gymnasium 
and clean up rubble at the church and adjacent elementary school, which 
sustained damage to its gable. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioner Nabih Youssef, a structural engineer who is retrofitting Los 
Angeles City Hall, is a consultant on the restoration of the church and school. 
He estimates the rebuilding will take at least six months and cost $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Youssef oversaw the shoring up of the church after the Jan. 17 quake and has 
begun mapping the restoration of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, he said of the damage: "It could have been a lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the monsignor's chair was destroyed and pieces from the sanctuary 
fell on the granite altar, the building did not collapse, Youssef said, 
principally because it has a reinforced concrete skeleton. After the quake, the 
building was shored up to prevent a collapse during aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to preserve every piece of material and replicate whatever is 
lost," he said. "If it were demolished it would be such a loss to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Many agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Even from as far as Brooklyn, N.Y, donations were collected Sunday from about 
1,100 members of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church at the urging of a cousin of a 
St. Monica parishioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to explain to someone how important St. Monica's is to the 
community," said churchgoer Diane Buzzita, who was stunned to see several 
broken statues lying in the courtyard. "It's not like, 'Oh, the church is 
damaged, so we'll go somewhere else.' I think we'll find everyone will be 
saying, 'OK, what do we need to do to fix it? Let's roll up our sleeves.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some members have offered to hold benefit concerts to raise funds for 
rebuilding the church. Although the Los Angeles Archdiocese has earthquake 
insurance, it is unclear how much of the policy would be paid out for St. 
Monica's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ken Deasy, who has been known to liven up Easter services by donning 
bunny ears and calling himself the "Priester Bunny," turns philosophical when 
discussing the rebuilding effort. He recounted the story of St. Francis, who 
was told by God to rebuild the crumbling church of San Damiano -- but not in 
the secular sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "God meant for St. Francis to rebuild the spirit of it," Deasy said. "Just the 
other day, I was talking about how we are a church not because we are a 
building, but because we are a people. We have served the poor, the sick and 
the aged and we will continue to. Though the doors have been shaken, they 
remain open. Though the bricks have crumbled, our spirit hasn't."

COMMUNITY NEWS: FIRST-STRING YO-YO PERFORMER SEES TOY ON THE UPTURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During normal business hours, Don Harrison is a mild-mannered insurance agent. 
</P>
<P>
 But come leisure time, the 32-year-old Torrance resident becomes a man with 
his hands full, as he unleashes his passion for what many consider a childhood 
pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a yo-yologist," he says, using a term coined by another yo-yo enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison performs impressive yo-yo tricks for community groups and teaches 
local youngsters and senior citizens how to master the toy. "Anyone can yo-yo," 
the South Bay native says. "I can sit down with you and in a matter of minutes, 
you can learn a couple of tricks." He says he seldom charges, adding that his 
love for the device and his desire to educate the public about it are 
motivation enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The yo-yo's popularity goes up and down, Harrison likes to say, but the toy 
has reportedly been around for ages. Although its origin is unclear, history 
indicates the Greeks had yo-yos 2,500 ago, says Dale Oliver, a Seattle resident 
who is chairman of the board of the newly formed American Yo-Yo Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The toy caught on in the United States in 1928, Harrison says, when marketing 
expert Don Duncan hired performers to travel around the country demonstrating 
and promoting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison became engrossed in the yo-yo at the age of 8, after learning from 
his father about the old-time demonstrators and their amazing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, only about 25 yo-yo performers nationwide make it their profession, and 
only five of them, including Oliver, make a living at it by performing and 
teaching full time. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Harrison says, the yo-yo seems to be enjoying a resurgence in 
popularity because of its simplicity and relatively low cost (from $3 for a 
basic plastic model to $75 for a high-performance wooden one). 
</P>
<P>
 In his appearances, Harrison does tricks with more than one yo-yo -- feats 
that require using both hands. "It's almost like juggling, with eye-hand 
coordination," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he teaches, he sticks to the basics, trying to ease the frustration 
of the novice. Harrison, who has three young boys, says, "So many kids give up 
after getting their string in a knot. They just need a good teacher." IRIS

COMMUNITY NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; MONUMENT TO HONOR OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a month after Manhattan Beach Police Officer Martin Ganz was slain 
during a traffic stop, residents are digging into their pockets to help 
commemorate his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Guidone, a Manhattan Beach dentist, has collected $3,000 to erect a 
memorial in a city park.He placed collection tins in school classrooms and 
local shops, and he hopes to raise another $2,000 for the monument. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Officer Ganz) really seemed to have a positive influence on this community," 
said Guidone, a former volunteer in the Police Department. "I hope this will 
help provide a resolution to this tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Police, searching for two suspects in the Dec. 27 shooting, have offered a 
$100,000 reward for information leading to the killer's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council donated $50,000 toward the reward. The police officers 
association added $15,000, and an anonymous resident pitched in $25,000, 
promising an additional $10,000 if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Martin Ganz Trust Fund was established two days after the 
officer's death. So far, $24,000 has been collected for the officer's family 
and a memorial scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the monument fund, call (310) 374-9749. To contribute 
to the reward or the trust fund, call the Manhattan Beach Police Department at 
(310) 545-5621.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HARBOR AREA; QUAKE KNOCKS CRIME OFF ITS FOUNDATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime was curbed dramatically in the Harbor area, as well as the rest of Los 
Angeles, as police stepped up patrols following the earthquake last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrols were doubled at the Harbor Station to prepare for potential 
quake-related problems, said Sgt. Paul Enox. 
</P>
<P>
 Some crimes -- including burglary, robbery and auto theft -- were reduced by 
half or more. For example, burglaries from vehicles dropped from 46 last year 
to 18 reported at the same time this year. And home burglaries were down from 
40 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
 All police cars were deployed in San Pedro, Wilmington, Harbor City and Harbor 
Gateway, and all personnel worked 12-hour shifts, with some working extra days.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HARBOR AREA; FIRM TO FACE CHARGES IN PORT PETROLEUM SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 M.T. Inc., the company that operates Matson Terminals, has been charged with 
polluting water in Los Angeles Harbor last June. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 gallons of petroleum-based hydraulic fluid leaked from drums where 
it had been stored in the facility's maintenance yard on Terminal Island, and 
rain on June 5 and 6 washed it into the ocean, said Mike Qualls, a spokesman 
for the Los Angeles city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The leak was discovered by a Matson security guard during a night patrol. The 
guard reported the spill to supervisors who told authorities and hired a 
private company to contain and clean up the spill, Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignment is scheduled Feb. 24 in Los Angeles Municipal Court on two counts 
of allowing petroleum products to flow into state waters and two counts of 
allowing a substance harmful to fish, plants or birds to contaminate state 
waters. If found guilty of the charges, the company could be fined up to 
$6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 M.T. Inc. spokesmen could not be reached for comment.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LAWNDALE; NO CRIMINAL CHARGES IN SCHOOL STRIP SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teacher's aides at a Lawndale school who strip-searched students in 
December looking for a teacher's missing $400 will not face criminal charges, 
the district attorney's office said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The aides exercised "extremely poor judgment" in conducting the search of 15 
students at Will Rogers Intermediate School, but did not inflict sufficient 
mental suffering to warrant criminal charges, said Deputy Dist. Atty.Monica 
Blodgett. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten boys and five girls were searched Dec. 13 after a field trip to the 
Galleria at South Bay in Redondo Beach, part of a consumer math lesson. The 
boys had to remove their clothes in front of a male aide during the search, 
Blodgett said, and the girls were required to shake out their bras and 
underpants in front of a female aide.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the state education code prohibits strip searches, there is no 
criminal law specifically prohibiting them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aides have been suspended with pay pending the outcome of an investigation 
by the school, said Assistant Supt. David Moorhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of two of the children searched have hired a lawyer, who said they 
will "seek appropriate compensation," but stopped short of saying a lawsuit was 
forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawndale School District Supt. Joseph D. Condon has called the incident 
improper and vowed to review hiring procedures for teacher's aides.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EL SEGUNDO; FIRE CHIEF SLOAN SAYS HE WILL RETIRE IN APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Segundo Fire Chief David Sloan will retire April 15 and take a job in the 
private sector, he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sloan, 55, said his retirement is not related to a no-confidence vote from El 
Segundo firefighters last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had originally planned to leave after five years, and it will be five years 
next month," said Sloan, who plans to work with his son, a real estate 
appraiser in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sloan, who came to El Segundo after 29 years in the Los Angeles Fire 
Department, believes he has improved fire service in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to his accomplishments, including ordering three state-of-the-art 
fire engines, creating a position for an environmental safety officer and 
streamlining the way the department checks building plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But firefighters accused him of being a "totalitarian" who did not listen to 
them, and indicated that they had no confidence in his management style in a 
September vote.

WESTSIDE COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; COST FOR QUAKE REPAIRS COULD HIT $20 
MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the final tally won't be in for months, city officials have estimated 
that the Northridge earthquake caused close to $20 million in damage, 
principally to hundreds of brick chimneys and business facades. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses and residences did not sustain major structural damage, but the 
cost of repairing and retrofitting 1,000 brick chimneys to meet city codes, 
fixing glass windows, tiles and facades in commercial buildings, and replacing 
damaged furniture and merchandise could reach $20 million, city spokesman Fred 
Cunningham said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a ballpark figure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the 600 single-family homes inspected so far sustained major 
structural damage, but there were fallen chimneys and cracks in many 
structures, building and safety director Ron Clark said. A city parking 
structure on South Beverly Drive will be closed for about three months for 
reinforcement work. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials this week began dealing with what they say could be a crippling 
aftershock of the Jan. 17 quake: the onslaught of traffic diverted from the 
damaged Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, residents have noticed an increase in traffic on Olympic, 
Santa Monica, Wilshire and Sunset boulevards, said City Manager Mark Scott. 
Normally, as much as 70% of the traffic going through the city is 
non-residential, said Vice Mayor Vicki Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 The city may change the timing of traffic signals, particularly on Olympic 
Boulevard, but no decision will be made until the traffic pattern is further 
studied, Scott said. The city also will consider extending its morning and 
afternoon street parking restrictions on major streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to work closely with Los Angeles officials, who are weighing 
whether to open car-pool lanes on major streets that run through both cities.

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; DOWNTOWN BAR SHUT AFTER DRUG STING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted to shut down a downtown bar where state officials say 
employees sold rock cocaine during an undercover sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 6-0 vote Tuesday, the council decided to revoke the license of the bar, 
Scorpio I, at 813 Van Ness Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Vazquez, an agent with the state Alcoholic Beverage Control department, 
said he purchased rock cocaine from employees five times during July and 
August. The Torrance Police Department initiated the sting after nearby 
residents complained that the bar could be blamed for stabbings, shootings, 
drunk driving and urinating in public. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar was closed last month after the city's License Review Board revoked 
its business permit. Hever Corral, owner of Scorpio I, appealed to the council, 
arguing that he was not aware of the drug transactions until the sting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had absolutely no knowledge of the events taking place or reason to 
suspect that they were taking place," said his attorney, Gilbert Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez also argued that before the sting, there were no drug-related 
arrests at the bar and that undercover officers never saw any evidence of 
sales.

PEOPLE: NOW HE'S PUTTING HIS SUBJECTS BEHIND THE CAMERA LENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of making film and television documentaries about indigenous 
peoples, Robert Hooper began to feel a little selfish. "I'd go into the 
culture, take the images and leave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooper's determination to do more led him and his wife to Malaysia in 1989, 
where he taught Malaysians how to make documentaries. And next month, Hooper, 
an associate professor at Loyola Marymount University in Westchester, will 
embark on another voyage, this one sponsored by the Fulbright Foundation. This 
time he is heading to Fiji, where he will teach television news and documentary 
filmmaking to students from 12 Pacific Island nations. Those students 
eventually will return to their countries to work with small, emerging 
television stations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as an opportunity to give back," he said. "I won't just take 
images. I'll give training." Hooper, 46, twice named a Fulbright scholar, will 
take his wife, Virginia, and 3-year-old daughter, Julie, with him to the 
capital city of Suva. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years, Hooper has worked with a variety of indigenous peoples, from 
Navajos in the Southwest to Tlingits in Alaska. He started his professional 
life with a desire to make the world a better place: In the early 1970s, as a 
public interest attorney, he helped Northern California farm workers who had 
legal problems.  
</P>
<P>
 "I went into the law to contribute," he said. "I always have enjoyed trying to 
turn things around." But he soon discovered the law wasn't for him. "I loved 
the field work, but the law library was drudgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Television, Hooper figured, was "an even more powerful instrument of social 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 So Hooper returned to school to study film and television and to pursue a 
career in the media. He has produced and directed an award-winning PBS 
documentary, "Alaska's Killer Whales -- Between Worlds" and produced "Decisions 
at 1,000 Fathoms," a documentary about the disposal of nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
 His motivation comes from the challenge of trying to produce quality 
programming in developing countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll put up with a lack of running water to get a good shot," he said. 'It's 
the challenge. It keeps renewing my life and helps me look at the world and 
relationships from different perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you do what I do, you notice things about your own culture that you 
wouldn't otherwise see. When you live in a village and share communally, that 
gives you a very different perspective on life in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 In training students in Micronesia, Fiji and American Samoa, Hooper's mission 
is simple: to give Pacific Islanders the tools they need to create their own 
programming, reflecting their own values. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, they can send it our way," he added. "God knows we need it.'

THE SEABURBS; 'LIVE-ABOARDS' SAY THEY'VE FOUND THE GOOD LIFE, FREE FROM THE 
CONFINES AND HASSLES ONSHORE . . . BUT SERENITY HAS ITS PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Barbara Kelley wed an Inglewood dentist in the boom years of the 1950s, 
the California dream for many young couples was a small stucco home, a 
Chevrolet, perhaps a lemon tree in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley and her husband opted for a different dream: the Gypsy Clipper, a 
52-foot wooden-hulled schooner with a mahogany interior and brass portholes. In 
time, they even cultivated a small garden -- a few herbs, a lemon tree -- on 
the dock alongside their floating home. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vernon Kelley died more than a decade ago. The tree is long gone. And at 
age 73, Barbara Kelley remains aboard the Gypsy Clipper in the same marina in 
Wilmington she has occupied for four decades, a potful of chives still marking 
the threshold. She harbors no thoughts whatsoever of moving ashore to some 
landlubbers' notion of a retirement cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 "A house, no matter how large it is, is a box to me," she said. "And I don't 
like being boxed in." 
</P>
<P>
 This stubborn insistence on staying afloat is what makes Kelley a 
"live-aboard," that resilient breed of Southern Californian that eschews dry 
land, bathtubs and closet space in favor of the freedom of life afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of boats- cum- homes dot the South Bay's coastal pockets and harbors, 
from the working-class docks of Wilmington to the upscale marinas of Redondo 
Beach. These are the dwellings of retirees, professional couples, singles, even 
families with young children, bound by the conviction that a boat equals 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with defense and aerospace layoffs battering the local economy, some 
marinas report an upswing in inquiries from landlubbers curious if they could 
save money by moving aboard boats. Marina operators warn that on the contrary, 
living afloat can prove more expensive than staying ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for residents of a region beset by car-choked roadways, tainted air and 
fears of crime and pink slips, life aboard a boat can seem to be the 1990s 
equivalent of Walden Pond: a simpler lifestyle, free of clutter, a regimen that 
tests your stamina and rewards individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, a boat is an island, set apart from the continent -- if only by a 
few feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "At any given moment, we could drop the dock lines and go, if we really wanted 
to," said retired aerospace engineer Al Erd, 70, who lives with his wife on a 
43-foot sailboat in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that escape route that's there in the back of your mind. Always. Even if 
you never do leave," said Tom Sullivan, 36, who shares a Redondo Beach 
houseboat with his golden retriever, Ashley. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of live-aboards admit to keeping their dock lines secured most 
days, especially as they grow older, venturing out only occasionally to Santa 
Catalina Island or the Baja California coast. They usually stay wedged in boat 
slips in one of a multitude of South Bay marinas, coexisting among the 
recreational boaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat dwellers often form a kind of floating neighborhood, much like 
homeowners who share a suburban cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
 But on weekend mornings, they wake, not to the whine of lawn mowers and leaf 
blowers, but to the cry of gulls and the occasional chugging of an outboard 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
 They are lulled to sleep at night, not by sirens and whirring freeways, but by 
the slapping of halyards against metal masts and the soft creaking of boat 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That is the romantic's view, of course. Veterans are quick to caution that 
amid all that fresh air and those gull lullabies, boats saddle their owners 
with endless chores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boats are love affairs -- and boats are 90% maintenance. You either do it 
yourself or you pay someone to do it," said John L. Quick Jr., 70, who has 
lived on boats in Wilmington for 39 years and has watched short-timers come and 
go. "People don't realize that 90% maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
 One long-timer who knows that well is Barbara Kelley, who spent a recent 
morning perched precariously above the water on a single wire next to the fir 
bowsprit, an extension of the bow. 
</P>
<P>
 She labored over the bowsprit, sanding the varnish by hand. The next day, she 
sat on the wire again, applying new varnish to prevent the wood from cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 40 years, she has grown intimately familiar with every bolt, bearing and 
joint of her floating home. When a visitor admired the gold-painted bronze 
letters spelling out "Gypsy Clipper" across the stern, she responded briskly: 
"Oh, yes. They're tough to get off. Small screws." 
</P>
<P>
 Since her husband's death, she has done virtually all upkeep except for the 
once-a-year "haul out," when the boat is lifted out of the water so its bottom 
can be repainted. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the abundant woodwork consumes can after can of varnish, Kelley 
has no plans to trade in the 1937 Marconi-rigged schooner for more modern 
fiberglass. ("Oh, gawd, I wouldn't even think of it.") She remembers spending 
one night on a fiberglass boat, when the unfamiliar "boom" of water slapping 
the sonorous hull kept her awake. "I didn't sleep a wink. It was never that way 
on my boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, this is the boat she sailed with her husband, and his essence, she 
says, remains aboard. She pulled out a photo of a handsome, laughing man in a 
motoring cap. Another photo shows a younger Kelley aboard the boat at Catalina 
Island, dressed as a mermaid draped with seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 She leaves her boat every morning for a two-mile stroll past the marinas and 
oil wells that line Wilmington's southern shore. She eats breakfast at the 
Yacht Haven marina cafe, where the waitresses bring her "Barbara's special": 
one egg over hard, home fries, two pieces of bacon ("crisp!"), toast, 
boysenberry preserves, a slice of onion and a jalapeno pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she walks down the dock again, ready to fetch the varnish and get to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel good when I work on the boat. Boy, you feel great. I love this 
boat, and I just like seeing it come up and look good. . . . I just think I'd 
die if I couldn't work on the boat." 
</P>

 Bill and Nancy Dewgaw spend their days in the towering Transamerica Center in 
Downtown Los Angeles. He works on the 19th floor in operations accounting. She 
works on the 16th floor in human resources administration. 
</P>
<P>
 When the day winds down, they head down the Harbor Freeway to their home in 
the suburbs: a 38-foot diesel-powered trawler called the Sandcastle, moored at 
Cabrillo Marina in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complete change from our work life," said Bill Dewgaw, 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to Kelley's wood schooner, the Sandcastle is decidedly modern. It 
boasts a galley replete with microwave and spice racks, a guest room/study, 
houseplants, stereo equipment and two "heads" or bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1987, the Dewgaws lived ashore, but now they are committed to the 
live-aboard life. They revel in the sense of being free to break away. "On a 
nice, sunny, summer weekend, we just take our house to Catalina," Bill Dewgaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even their Siamese cat, Joss, relishes life afloat, occasionally leaping 
ashore to go hunting, not for mice, but for the small crabs that scurry across 
the docks. 
</P>
<P>
 There are drawbacks, related primarily to plumbing and space. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Dewgaw, 50, still wistful for the bathtub she left behind ashore, has 
been known to visit relatives toting a bottle of Mr. Bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 When she roasted a 12-pound turkey for Thanksgiving, she had to break the 
breastbone so that the fowl would fit in the on-board oven. They have taken to 
leaving clothes at the cleaners for long stretches to relieve the strain on 
their cramped closets. 
</P>
<P>
 Many live-aboards trade up in search of space, much as a homeowner might 
exchange a condominium for a two-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
 Former sailboat dweller Sullivan expanded into a 34-foot houseboat in Redondo 
Beach's King Harbor. His old sailboat buddies called him a turncoat, but he 
likes the spaciousness of the white-walled living room accented with oak trim, 
the gray-and-white kitchen with its parquet floor, the deck where he is 
thinking of installing a Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of his home: a 100-gallon saltwater aquarium that he installed 
in the living room's west wall. Seawater from far below the houseboat is pumped 
into the aquarium and out again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan spent months changing pumps and mopping the floor before he got it 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the most dangerous thing you could have on a boat," he said. 
"What I've got, in effect, here is a hose running into my boat. If it clogs up, 
I've sunk my boat." 
</P>
<P>
 But now fish swim lazily past the glass. Starfish, sea urchins, assorted 
slugs, even an anchovy-eating octopus have resided in Sullivan's floating 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In time, some live-aboards do move ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hatt left his powerboat home in Wilmington for a Long Beach house because 
he needed more office space for his business. He is still struggling to adjust 
to life ashore, the nighttime discord of traffic and car alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Deborah and Nick Sarris of San Pedro, parents of two small children, are 
wondering if it is time to move off their 32-foot Lotus sailboat in San Pedro's 
Holiday Harbour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just now getting to the point that we'd love to have a house with a 
yard, for our little boy to run around in," said Deborah Sarris, 35, who joined 
Nick on the sailboat when they were married 3 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat's quarters have grown more crowded since then. Energetic Andrew is 2 
1/2, and Halie -- which the Sarrises say is Greek for "sea dweller" -- is 6 
months old. Deborah stores disposable diapers in a locker hidden behind the 
main cabin settee, and Andrew's toys hang in a knit hammock in a corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew has been taught to play in the boat's cockpit, and his parents have 
developed a sixth sense for his whereabouts, much like parents who live on a 
busy street. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick, 40, says he doesn't mind the closeness, because he gets to watch his 
children change and grow. "I'm just real big on family," he said, "and I just 
really like this lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Inclement weather does not dampen their enthusiasm. When it rains, the 
Sarrises simply close the hatch and enjoy the rhythm of raindrops beating above 
them. When the wind blows, the boat leans as though someone is pushing it to 
one side, Deborah says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten used to standing straight when everything else is leaning." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they ponder moving, the Sarrises describe the placid summer evenings 
when they dine aboard beneath the wide-open skies and throw bread crumbs to the 
ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan describes a phenomenon he calls "slip sailing," when a few friends 
drop by to share a few beers and enjoy the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're on the water. You're outside. You're not having to do a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 And for a true-blue boat dweller, even one still tied to the dock, that is the 
definition of heaven. 4 Who Live Aboard 
</P>
<P>
 Map shows where Tom Sullivan, the Dewgaws, the Sarrises and Barbara Kelley are 
moored. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tom Sullivan, Redondo Beach, 34-foot houseboat, 
</P>
<P>
 * Bill and Nancy Dewgaw, San Pedro, 38-foot trawler, 
</P>
<P>
 * Deborah, Nick, Andrew and Halie Sarris, San Pedro, 32-foot sailboat, 
</P>
<P>
 * Barbara Kelley, Wilmington, 52-foot wood schooner. The Cost of Living Aboard 
</P>
<P>
 Boat living is not the economic panacea it might seem. Here is an estimated 
monthly bill for the major costs of living on a 40-foot sailboat at Cabrillo 
Marina in San Pedro. The boat owner is making monthly payments on a used 
$45,000 boat.  
</P>
<P>
 Boat payment: $312 
</P>
<P>
 Slip rental: $326 
</P>
<P>
 Live-aboard fee (includes storage locker, water, electricity, parking): $130 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance, including regular painting and hull cleaning: $125 
</P>
<P>
 Property tax, insurance: $110 
</P>
<P>
 TOTAL: $1,003

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LOS ANGELES: Citing the need for commuting alternatives since the Northridge 
quake, the City Council on Tuesday moved up the start date to Monday for a 
shuttle service between Metrolink trains at Union Station and businesses in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Hollywood Connection, designed for several hundred people a day 
to travel by trains and shuttle buses rather than cars, was set to begin in 
March.But Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, whose district includes Hollywood, won 
unanimous approval for a proposal to begin the service immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 BEVERLY HILLS: In deference to the lingering recession, the image-conscious 
city has reluctantly agreed to allow taxis up to 7 years old to cruise streets. 
The city's municipal code had prohibited taxis more than 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Maxwell Salter complained at a recent hearing that Los Angeles-area cabs 
are a disgrace compared to taxis in Japan and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 But city staff argued that Beverly Hills cabs are not to be confused with Los 
Angeles city taxis, which can be up to 9 years old. MEETINGS NEXT WEEK

WESTSIDE COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; VICTIMS CLING TO SHAKEN HOMES, HOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the worst catastrophe in the community's history, the Northridge earthquake 
left 6,000 people homeless and severely damaged 257 buildings, including 
historical landmarks such as the Brown Derby restaurant, officials said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is much worse than the riots," said Sharon Romano, director of the 
Hollywood Beautification Team, a nonprofit organization that assists quake 
victims. "We have lost a large amount of (affordable) housing and we have 
thousands living in the streets and crowding into shelters." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reported deaths in Hollywood. Sharon Delugach, chief of staff 
for Los Angeles Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents the area, said the 
quake caused more than $40 million in damage and forced the evacuation of more 
than 1,000 residences, most of them apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the damage was to big buildings housing large Spanish-speaking, 
immigrant families -- easy targets for unscrupulous landlords," said Delugach. 
"We've had reports some owners removed red tags, which ban occupancy, and told 
their tenants it's OK to return." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days after the quake, refugees were still huddled with their possessions 
in parking lots near their evacuated buildings. Some said they feared for their 
safety in shelters, while others wanted to protect their homes from looters. 
Many were simply too bewildered to leave their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the week police were clearing the larger sites and insisting families 
move to shelters. The area from 5300 to 6000 Carlton Way was particularly hard 
hit, with families living on the sidewalk in front of sagging duplexes, 
collapsed residences and tilted apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, a plaque swinging from a twisted gate proclaimed: "Lord, help 
me hang in there."  
</P>
<P>
 Many have been reluctant to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't leave our stuff upstairs; it might get stolen," said Mauricio 
Cornejo, 35, a father of three young children, as he pointed to a buckled 
apartment building. But he eventually heeded the pleas of a social worker to 
head for an emergency shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the human misery, LeRon Gubler, head of the Hollywood Chamber 
of Commerce, said nearly 50 historical landmarks had suffered damage. The list 
includes the Egyptian Theater, which closed because of a collapsed back wall, 
and the famous Brown Derby restaurant, which was ordered demolished despite the 
anguished cries of preservationists. ADRIAN MAHER

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: SAUSAGE KING ADDS TO HIS EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jody Maroni's Sausage Kingdom, long a fixture on Venice's Ocean Front Walk, is 
expanding its territory. There's a Jody Maroni stall at the Universal CityWalk, 
and now there are two outlets at LAX -- one at Terminal 1 and another at 
Terminal 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport sites are actually called Fast Fare, two restaurants that offer 
Jody Maroni products. Still, if you are hungry at the airport, or maybe you 
simply just don't want to chance another on-flight meal, this is a good place 
to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Maroni owner Jordan Monkarsh started making sausage 10 years ago; he now 
makes two dozen varieties. Though sausage is not considered health food, 
Monkarsh's sausages contain no preservatives, no nitrates, and have a 
relatively low fat content. The airport sites don't offer the entire line 
featured at his original stand in Venice, but they do feature some of the most 
popular sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these is the Yucatan ($3.95), made with chicken, duck, cilantro, 
Serrano chilies and beer. Like all the sausages, it comes on an onion roll with 
grilled onions and peppers. Another featuring lean chicken with fennel seeds 
and oranges ($3.95) contains only 11% fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionalists might opt for the Polish ($3.95), a mixture of pork and beef 
seasoned with marjoram. The Louisiana boudin hot link ($3.95), is a fiery 
Cajun-style sausage made with beef, pork, rice, green onions and chilies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Maroni sandwiches are sold at the Fast Fare restaurants at Terminal 1 
(USAir) and Terminal 7 (United) at LAX. Open daily 10 a.m. to midnight.

THE GREAT DIVIDE; STRIVING TO BRING TOGETHER VASTLY DIFFERENT IMMIGRANT GROUPS, 
RESIDENTS WANT A NEW FACE ON WEST HOLLYWOOD'S NEGLECTED EAST END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't need a map to tell where one West Hollywood ends and another begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The western end of Santa Monica Boulevard is the flashy hub of the city's 
large gay community, marked by neon-blazed clubs and boutiques where sidewalks 
bop with partyers even on a Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Two miles east, the bright buzz gives way to a darker nightscape ruled by 
mumbling vagrants and transvestite hookers working the shadows of pawnshops, 
boarded storefronts and the fortress walls of a Warner Bros. movie studio. 
</P>
<P>
 If the glitzier west end bears a family resemblance to next-door Beverly 
Hills, the boulevard's poorer east end is the grubby-faced kin of neighboring 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 And right now a lot of folks are standing by with the scrub brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, who blame the seedy image on neglect by City Hall, are flexing 
their muscles through an ambitious new group calling for old-fashioned 
crime-fighting. City officials, meanwhile, are promoting an economic 
renaissance featuring stylish stores and sidewalk cafes like those that have 
drawn the cappuccino crowd to the west end and Melrose Avenue, tantalizingly 
close to the east end. 
</P>
<P>
 The spotlight is revealing the neighborhood's blemishes -- and its 
possibilities -- as never before. On placid, tree-lined streets off Santa 
Monica Boulevard's east end, homeowners complain of break-ins and drug dealing 
and say they are tired of removing used condoms and syringes from their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 At night many residents refuse to answer their doors. "You just don't open. 
You don't know who it is," said a longtime Poinsettia Place resident who once 
saw a badly beaten hooker dumped across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying for a new image, residents have joined under the Alliance of Citizens 
for the East Side and have even stopped calling the neighborhood the east end, 
as it's been known. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'East end' sounds so demeaning," said William Senigram, a 30-year resident 
active in the group, known by its acronym, ACES. "It sounds more quality to 
call it the 'East Side.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope a face-lift -- guided by an 80-page revitalization plan -- will 
make people feel safer by improving lighting on streets and alleys. The plan 
suggests designating the area a redevelopment zone as one way to attract the 
kinds of businesses -- from studios to restaurants -- that would clean up the 
area's image and jump-start its economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood's poorest live in the east end -- one-sixth of its residents 
live below the federal poverty level, a rate 1 1/2 times that of the entire 
city -- as well as one-third of the city's seniors and most of its school-aged 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The area, a half-square-mile of 10,000 people east of Fairfax Avenue, may be 
one of the Westside's more overlooked quarters. It is also one of the more 
unusual -- a bundle of such widely contrasting faces that it stands out even 
amid its polyglot surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 By day, babushkas trundle home groceries from any of half a dozen stores 
bearing Cyrillic window signs and stocking everything from black caviar to 
Russian film classics on video. 
</P>
<P>
 The boulevard is being transformed by the thousands of Soviet Jewish emigres 
who, during the past decade, have poured into an area long a magnet for Jewish 
refugees. The Russian immigrants, many of whom arrived in the recent 
post-perestroika years, now make up 10% of the city's population of 36,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hand-labeled copies of Russian videos line the shelves at Sam's Store, a 
little nook whose younger customers would rather see movies with Steven Seagal 
and Arnold Schwarzenegger. On sunny days, crowds of Russian men play rummy and 
dominoes around picnic tables at Plummer Park -- dubbed Little Gorky Park -- 
while women play at separate tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenian businessman Leon Balasanyan had this clientele in mind when he opened 
Odessa Grocery on Santa Monica Boulevard on New Year's Eve. Jars of Russian 
walnut preserves and cherry syrup sit alongside American ketchup and 
mayonnaise. The cooler is stocked with Russian sausages, fish and cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Russian neighborhood," he said. "We took a chance. We'll see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 American neighbors haven't picked up a taste for Russian gingerbread or 
pickled tomatoes yet, but they are catching on to other customs. The 
immigrants, many of whom don't drive, stroll once-deserted sidewalks -- a habit 
that is encouraging longtime residents to come out of the house again.

 At times it has been an uneasy detente. Officials have had to mediate disputes 
between local gays and Russian youths who harass them. Older newcomers, most of 
whom speak little or no English, remain a riddle to American neighbors who 
sometimes find them brusque and clannish. Some people grumble about housing 
subsidies and government paychecks many emigres receive. 
</P>

<P>
 "They shop in Russian stores. They pay Russian mechanics. They buy produce on 
the streets," said David Bartlett, himself a transplant from England who has 
lived in West Hollywood about eight years.  
</P>
<P>
 The city, which often provides Russian interpreters at east side meetings, may 
soon have to add Spanish to accommodate a Latino population that has nearly 
doubled since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, one in eight east-enders is Latino, although they own few businesses in 
comparison to the many taco shops and pupuserias spicing the boulevard farther 
east in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The two immigrant groups have brought a novel sight to the city: children. 
Many recent emigres are young couples who have -- or are soon expecting to have 
-- children, said Daphne Dennis, a city social service specialist. "Now it's, 
'So you're a regular city. You've got to (offer social) services, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Day-care businesses are sprouting and a preschool at Plummer Park is 
practically filled with the children of Russian immigrants -- a big shift in a 
city with an under-18 population that is less than a third of the county 
average and where social services have focused on the elderly and people with 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "The east side is a melting pot," said longtime activist Ruth Williams, who 
founded the ACES group. "We have the gay community. We have families. We have 
the Russian population and Latinos coming in. That's part of the uniqueness of 
the east side that you don't see on the west side." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents can do without the other east-end hallmarks -- pawn shops, 
thrift stores and X-rated hangouts. The sidewalk in front of the Tomkat movie 
theater bears the handprints of porn legends such as John Holmes. From noon on, 
live dancers perform between hourlong films with names such as "The Protector" 
and "A Male Tale." Down the street, past three Russian stores, two bars and a 
car wash, the style at the Paris House modeling studio is nude, nude, nude. 
</P>
<P>
 At night the card-playing set in Plummer Park gives way to the homeless, and 
as many as 100 street hustlers work the boulevard into the wee hours. The 
hookers will hop back and forth across the city border near La Brea Avenue -- a 
cat-and-mouse ritual they play with the sheriff's deputies patrolling West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow a Main Street feel manages to survive despite the strip malls, adult 
book stores and the anonymous bunkers used for movie production, leftovers from 
the boulevard's industrial past. Dusty little shops offer to fix vacuum 
cleaners, while nearby parts stores serve a string of auto-repair shops. A 
Trader Joe's market anchors the east end's biggest shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Rent control has drawn seniors and poorer residents to the boxy apartments 
south of Santa Monica Boulevard, and yuppies have discovered the quiet charms 
of shaded homes just to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the refrain on these residential streets is one of complaint and 
discontent: We're left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has paid more attention to building up the west side of the city 
because the majority of the (city) council members live on the west side," said 
Senigram of the ACES group. (Actually, six of the nine residents who have 
served on the five-member City Council since West Hollywood incorporated 10 
years ago have come from the midsection, not the west end. Still, only one -- 
Councilwoman Abbe Land -- has lived in the east end, and she recently moved to 
another neighborhood.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some reject the idea of an east-west divide in a city of only 1.9-square 
miles.  
</P>
<P>
 "Part of me really resists the whole notion of splitting the city," said 
Councilman John Heilman, an advocate of redevelopment for the area. "It's a 
mistake to make it an us-against-them mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 While officials acknowledge that the prostitution on the east end is 
particularly vexing because it is so easily seen, statistics show total crime 
there is no higher than for the rest of the city. Those defending City Hall's 
treatment of the neighborhood tick off a host of block grants, storefront 
improvements and other programs based there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The east end, which sprouted from a railroad junction near what is now Fairfax 
Avenue, was the area's wild side going back to Prohibition. Yellowed newspaper 
clippings tell of judges and movie executives rounded up in speak-easys -- and 
even then residents were complaining about the neighborhood's sleazy image. "As 
far as (the east end) being new to the night life -- that's not new to the east 
end," said local historian Ralph Feeley, who is writing a book on the West 
Hollywood area. "That's been its lot in life." 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, longtime residents say the east end took on a more 
Rockwellian look -- of small-town dress shops and lemonade stands along the 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostitution, though, has ebbed and flowed there at least since the 1960s. The 
problem had become so bad by 1980 that business owner Terry Walker plotted with 
a neighbor to get rid of two bus benches serving as hangouts for hustlers and 
thugs near his movie-sound studio. In the dark of night, he recalled coyly, the 
benches just disappeared. "I think they got on a truck and went somewhere," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now more optimistic than a decade ago, Walker and crime-weary neighbors are 
banking on the city to revamp the area. Zoning changes under consideration 
would allow bigger buildings in order to invite more post-production movie 
facilities near the Hollywood border. Walker said such a change would allow him 
to expand his audio business, which sits across from the Warner Bros. studios. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks west, the revitalization plan calls for the kinds of retail 
businesses and housing that would generate pedestrian traffic -- a move some 
hope will push out the street hustlers. The plan calls for an overhaul of 
Plummer Park, improved parking and better upkeep of private properties. And, in 
one sign of the east end's new front-burner status, the council will host a 
town hall meeting -- its second in just more than two months -- on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Already, 100 specially designed pedestrian street lights have gone up along 
the east end of Santa Monica Boulevard and discussions are under way to hire 
private security guards under a joint arrangement with businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also will hire a consultant to study the neighborhood's suitability 
for redevelopment, an often-controversial approach that typically uses a city's 
power to acquire small properties and designate them for big projects. Such a 
scheme was shelved for the east end six years ago for lack of support on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of any rejuvenation effort will hinge largely on whether Warners goes 
through with an approved overhaul of its aging 11-acre lot, an auxiliary to the 
studio's main quarters in Burbank. Supporters portrayed the proposal last year 
as an economic boost, but the studio is making no promises about when it will 
begin the $75-million modernization project. Executives say it will depend on 
production needs and the film industry's long-term outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the hopeful notes, it isn't hard to hear the skeptics in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics say the revitalization plan was written without adequate east-end 
representation. Others worry a huge redevelopment may extinguish what remains 
of the strip's mom-and-pop flavor. And some shift blame for the anemic 
streetscape from the hookers to businesses, such as the Russian specialty 
markets, that don't cater to a wide clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can put all the pedestrian lights and pretty benches and trash cans in 
there and take every pedestrian off," said Ralph Mayo, who runs an AIDS program 
geared toward the hustlers. "Santa Monica Boulevard is not going to turn into 
the Third Street Promenade or Melrose." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Elliott, a member of the revitalization committee, said the liberal city 
will have to loosen rent-control rules to encourage the gentrification that 
businesses need for an upscale customer base. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and other residents are buoyed by renewed interest in the 
neighborhood -- and its potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether it's the election year," she said. "But I'll tell you -- 
we've got their attention." Neighborhood Portrait

ASSETS: TAKING A CRITICAL LOOK AT TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times Westside article concerning the Santa Monica Methodist Church's plan 
to build multimillion-dollar apartment buildings and underground garages on 
church land valued at $7 million follows last month's purchase by Malibu's The 
Churches of Christ and Pepperdine University of a multimillion-dollar piece of 
property in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something wrong here.The Methodist Church, the Churches of Christ, and 
Pepperdine are all nonprofit, tax-free institutions. If they are profit-free, 
how can they afford to own, buy and build massive real estate holdings? 
Tax-free means, of course, that they do not have to share the costs of police, 
fire, schools, etc. with taxable businesses and tax-paying individual 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's time for the tax-burdened American public to look again at their 
gift to religion. The original idea of allowing "the little church on the 
corner" to operate tax-free so that it could survive, has opened the door to 
vast land-holdings and fortunes by various power-seeking giants of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 We tax-paying citizens need help in supporting our civic expenses. If a 
nonprofit institution shows millions of dollars in profit, that money should 
then be returned to the American public, which gave the church its tax-free 
gift in the first place.

TEACHERS: DEBATE OVER PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a response to my earlier letter (Jan. 6) commenting on teaching salaries 
compared to other "professions" and educational spending in the U.S., letter 
writer Georgia Cary Dubrin (Carver Middle School teacher) inquires about my 
"credentials" to determine, among other matters, what a professional is. As a 
California licensed professional for the past 25 years and as an individual who 
has contributed over 3,000 hours of voluntary time coaching at two Santa Monica 
high schools (not to mention donating and raising in excess of $10,000 for 
Santa Monica High the past three years), I suspect that I am fully capable of 
recognizing the distinctions between professionals and well-educated trade 
union members. Many occupations require years of training or education and 
still do not qualify as true professions. Moreover, the professions I mentioned 
are self-regulatory -- something none of the teachers' organizations do. 
</P>
<P>
 My credentials for commenting on the state of education in this country 
include two stepdaughters (19 and 24) who are products of L.A. Unified, a 
household member who is a legal immigrant in her senior year at University High 
School, and too many hours to count discussing our educational system with 
teachers and other academics, and reading intensely about education matters 
(from Dewey to William Bennett, Jonathon Kozol and Thomas Sowell). 
</P>
<P>
 With regard to Ms. Dubrin's assertion that I imply women have less 
"dedication" to their careers than men -- all I can do is let the statistical 
record speak for itself. Any implied conclusion on my part is that I recognize 
women's greater dedication to family and children. In fact, the children of 
women who "drop out" are statistically the most likely to succeed in our 
educational system. As Casey Stengel said, "You can look it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Dubrin's comment, "If teachers were paid by private individuals . . ." defies 
analysis because it is an oxymoron. Teachers are paid by taxpayers and these 
are very private individuals. If on the other hand, teachers negotiated 
salaries without a lock-step union, many would make more money, some less, and 
still others would justifiably be standing in unemployment lines. It's my 
opinion that this would benefit our children. 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent a lifetime of 50- to 70-hour weeks in the private professional 
sector and much of my spare time around teachers and coaches, I don't buy 
Dubrin's claim of equivalency with respect to hard work. Many teachers do work 
quite hard, but many don't know what really hard work is, and far too many are 
retired on the job (and remain there -- protected by their unions.) 
</P>
<P>
 One thing's for sure, though, Dubrin's response resembles the tactics of the 
"credentialed educational elites." They stridently tell parents that they are 
not well-educated enough to make decisions about what our children's best 
interests are and, thus, these credentialed elites are entitled to run the 
system as they see fit without interference or criticism.

CLASS NOTES: A PRIMER IN EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Mary Laine Yarber teaches English 
at Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most students have returned to school after last week's earthquake, and many 
wonder what may happen if a strong aftershock or a new quake hits while they're 
at school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's not news to any of us that seismic experts say a catastrophic quake even 
stronger than last Monday's could strike Southern California, causing more 
deaths, injuries and disruptions in communication, transportation and delivery 
of goods and services than occurred last week. 
</P>
<P>
 What if your child is in school when the Big One hits? 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that most schools are safer and better prepared to take care 
of your child than you may think. Indeed, a campus is one of the safer places 
to be during a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools are "probably safer than anything else because they must adhere to 
specific state, county and city regulations," said Johanna Chase, a disaster 
preparedness specialist at Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake preparation is mandated by the Katz Act, a 1984 state law that 
requires all public and private schools to conduct annual earthquake drills. 
The law also requires that schools keep food, water and first-aid supplies on 
hand, generally enough to last three days. (Even so, students would be wise to 
keep extra water and food in their backpacks, lockers or desks.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are major differences between a drill and a real earthquake. 
The "duck, cover and wait" exercise would be used in the real thing, but 
without bell signals. And evacuation would probably occur from dark halls, 
classrooms and bathrooms because a loss of power would be likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone lines would probably be down, as they were for many areas last week, so 
calls to or from the school would be virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 But your child would be well supervised until you could reach him or her 
because state law allows school districts to detain staff members for at least 
72 hours for supervisorial duties during a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 An important point: Students can be released only to parents or guardians, not 
to siblings, other relatives or family friends. School grounds would typically 
be locked immediately and patrolled so students could not leave on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries are a certainty in a large quake, mostly due to panic and inadequate 
preparation. It's crucial that students stay under desks or tables while things 
are shaking and falling around them. Leaving a room during the quake is asking 
for cuts, bruises or more severe injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the importance of preparation, too many teachers have traditionally 
viewed earthquake drills as trivial and bothersome, Chase said. I suspect, 
however, that few will yawn through them now. 
</P>
<P>
 Classroom safety has also been largely ignored and should be reviewed by 
teachers. It is not unusual to see classrooms with objects that could fall, 
such as bookcases, filing cabinets or boxes. These should be kept below head 
level; any object taller than three feet is a potential hazard and should be 
bolted or braced. Smaller objects, such as books, staplers and computers, are 
dangerous because they can become speedy projectiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers need to take the dangers more seriously," Chase said. "And students 
need to understand that they have a responsibility to participate with the 
system -- not (work) against it."

TORRANCE; YO-YO PERFORMER HAS 'EM ON A STRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During normal business hours, Don Harrison is a mild-mannered insurance agent. 
</P>
<P>
 But come leisure time, the 32-year-old Torrance resident becomes a man with 
his hands full, as he unleashes his passion for what many consider a childhood 
pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a yo-yologist," he says, using a term coined by another yo-yo enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison performs impressive yo-yo tricks for community groups and teaches 
local youngsters and senior citizens how to master the toy. "Anyone can yo-yo," 
the South Bay native says. "I can sit down with you and in a matter of minutes, 
you can learn a couple of tricks." He says he seldom charges, adding that his 
love for the device and his desire to educate the public about it are 
motivation enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The yo-yo's popularity goes up and down, Harrison likes to say, but the toy 
has reportedly been around for ages. Although its origin is unclear, history 
indicates the Greeks had yo-yos 2,500 ago, says Dale Oliver, a Seattle resident 
who is chairman of the board of the newly formed American Yo-Yo Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appearances, Harrison does tricks with more than one yo-yo -- feats 
that require using both hands. "It's almost like juggling, with eye-hand 
coordination," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he teaches, he sticks to the basics, trying to ease the frustration 
of the novice. Harrison, who has three young boys, says, "So many kids give up 
after getting their string in a knot. They just need a good teacher."

SILVERLAKE; ANCIENT TONGUE NOW IN THE COMPUTER AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled from Times Suburban staff reports. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the sophistication of computers accelerates the race toward the future, 
Hector Santos uses his to rescue a piece of the Philippines' rich past. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos has completed a design of computer-generated fonts, or typefaces, to 
print the ancient Tagalog script, which was in danger of being lost and 
forgotten because it could be written only by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagalog, an indigenous language spoken in the Philippines, is rendered in 
print today using the Roman alphabet. But before the 16th-Century Spanish 
conquest of the archipelago, Tagalog was written with a squiggly script, known 
as alibata or baybayin , Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Spanish came they found the people to be literate" in the natives' 
own languages, said Santos, 52, who runs a Silverlake-based graphics design and 
desktop publishing company, Sushi Dog Graphics. The script, generally written 
with a knife and carved in bamboo, "was in the hands of the masses." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the heavy Spanish influence, the script fell into disuse and was 
almost completely replaced by the Roman alphabet by the end of the 18th 
Century, Santos said.  
</P>
<P>
 However, scripts related to the ancient Tagalog one are still used by the 
Hanunoos and Buhids of Mindoro and the Tagbanwas of Palawan, Santos said, 
referring to indigenous peoples on two Philippine islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Santos is developing computer fonts for those scripts as well, his 
work is of interest not just to scholars but also to those who want to preserve 
minority ethnic cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started doing it for fun, but now it's become a mission," he said. "There's 
a visual uniqueness to (the script) that isn't Spanish or Chinese. It is 
genuinely Filipino in shape and form."

REGION; CENTURY FREEWAY PASSES QUAKE TEST

<P>
 The infant Century Freeway apparently has passed its first tremor test with 
flying colors, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary inspection of the 3-month-old freeway found no stress cracks or 
other damage after Monday's magnitude 6.6 earthquake.The 105 Freeway has some 
of the county's highest overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineers said they were not surprised that the 17.3-mile roadway 
between Norwalk and El Segundo withstood the earthquake, while portions of the 
Santa Monica Freeway (10) buckled and an Antelope Valley Freeway (14) overpass 
collapsed onto the Golden State Freeway (5).

 "We've learned from every earthquake we've had in California, and we've 
changed the design standards each time," said Caltrans district director Jerry 
B. Baxter. "The Century was built using the most modern standards, and 
obviously, they worked."  
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said the key factor is that additional steel bars were used to 
reinforce concrete columns supporting the Century Freeway's 12 lanes and 
numerous overpasses, on-ramps and off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans began requiring steel reinforcement in freeway bridges and overpasses 
following the 1971 Sylmar quake, which toppled freeway overpasses. The agency 
is in the middle of a $1.5-billion reinforcement program designed to shore up 
bridges and overpasses with steel encasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Columns supporting the bridges and overpasses along the Santa Monica Freeway 
-- including the three that buckled and partially collapsed Monday morning -- 
were scheduled to be retrofitted this spring, Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we knew (the Century Freeway columns) didn't need to be 
strengthened," Baxter said. "They are about as strong as they come, and were 
built with every safety feature we know of."

 BACK IN ACTION 
</P>
<P>
 The high school athletic season in the Los Angeles Unified School District was 
knocked down, but not out by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of City Section administrators decided Tuesday to resume competition 
in basketball and soccer for boys and girls, and wrestling beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 All City Section athletic events were postponed for two weeks because of the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from schools affected by the earthquake met Tuesday at Grant High in 
Van Nuys to consider options, including the formation of tournaments in place 
of the remainder of the regular season. Administrators decided to allow each 
league to determine its own schedule since damage varied at each school. 
</P>
<P>
 Westside schools suffered less damage than those in the Valley and are 
expected to make up games postponed by the earthquake. Other schools will 
resume their schedules and not play a full compliment of games, according to 
City Commissioner Barbara Fiege. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' and girls' basketball playoffs begin Feb. 23.  
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the conference on the other side of the hill -- the Southeastern, 
Coastal and Southern Pacific -- will make up most of their games because they 
don't have gym problems like the Valley schools," Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fiege, 24 of the City's 49 schools have been affected by the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Six San Fernando Valley schools -- Chatsworth, Kennedy, Monroe, Reseda, San 
Fernando, and Verdugo Hills -- have basketball gymnasiums that suffered either 
structural or water damage and are unavailable indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, schools being used as Red Cross shelters are Belmont, Birmingham, 
Canoga Park, Fairfax, Granada Hills, Hollywood, Manual Arts (small gym), North 
Hollywood, Sylmar and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going be able to get into our gym for practice or games for another 
two or three weeks," Fairfax Coach Harvey Kitani said. "We have people in the 
big gym, the small gym and another building. I heard we were sheltering up to 
200 or 300 people at one time." 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando, which had been used as a shelter, was evacuated over the weekend 
when engineers discovered structural damage to school facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The gyms at Cleveland, El Camino Real and Hamilton suffered minor damage and 
had been unusable until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls' gym had some water damage and the floor has buckled," Hamilton 
Coach Dave Uyeshima said. "It makes it more difficult for both teams to have to 
practice in the boys' gym." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches scrambled this week to find practice sites for their teams. At best, 
coaches were able to arrange practice times for boys' varsity players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to call all over to get a practice site," Kitani said. "For this week, 
we're going over to Loyola Marymount to practice. People over there have been 
good to arrange a practice slot for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax was scheduled to play host to Westchester in a game matching two of 
the top teams in the Western League. But even switching the site to Westchester 
did not prevent the game from being postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a mess, huh?" Kitani said. "An earthquake is devastating for everyone 
and I have respect for the people who have lost their homes and valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accept the fact that we might not be able to have another home game, but 
everyone has to make sacrifices." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to locating playing sites, some coaches must now solve 
transportation problems. Palisades Coach James Paleno was told Tuesday that 
there will be no late buses available for his players who stay after school to 
attend practice. Those players who miss their 3:10 p.m. buses will have to 
arrange their own transportation home. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's tough because we're a young team," said Paleno, whose players are 
bused from the Central City. "We only have three seniors on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Several area coaches were frustrated by the delay in their season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This district is too big," Westchester Coach Ed Azzam said. "If we didn't 
think it was before, we know now. If this district was running the freeway 
system, they would have shut everything down, not just the areas that were 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they are going through problems with the Valley schools, but not with 
the Westside schools. Why did we have to wait to play a school like Venice, 
which is only two miles away?" SIGNINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica tight end Michael Jackson made an unwritten commitment to sign 
with Washington State University, Viking Coach Dan Escalera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who was named to The Times' 1993 Westside All-Star second team, 
rushed 34 times for 100 yards and caught 13 passes for 129 yards and scored 
three touchdowns. As an outside linebacker, he made 10 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 The signing period begins Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rocky Mountain News was reporting that Fairfax running back Tyrone Evans 
and Lion quarterback Myron Terry will sign with Colorado State. However, 
Fairfax Coach Terrel Ray said Evans and Terry will not make a final decision 
until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who led the area in rushing with 1,434 yards and 11 touchdowns, is also 
considering Colorado State and Nevada Las Vegas. Terry, who passed for 707 
yards and five touchdowns, has narrowed his list to Nevada Las Vegas, San Diego 
State and Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax multipurpose star Az-Zahir Hakim is being recruited by USC, 
Washington, San Diego State, Nevada Las Vegas, Hawaii and Colorado State. 
However, Hakim still needs to pass his college entrance examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City defensive back Chris Ellison is being recruited by California and 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back-defensive back Larry Atkins of Venice made an unwritten 
commitment to UCLA Tuesday night. OUT OF ACTION 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads sophomore guard Lisa Ribner suffered a torn ligament in her right 
knee and will be out for the season. She was injured during the Roadrunners' 
Jan. 8 game against Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't discover there was a tear for another week," Coach Larry Wiener 
said. "She was playing a steady floor game and was beginning to hit her shot. 
It was a big loss for us." MEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Pepperdine men's volleyball team misses all-time kill leader Tom 
Sorensen and middle blocker Duane Cameron, who have graduated and are playing 
for the U.S. national team, the Waves appear to have another formidable squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior outside hitter Greg Shankle leads the squad with 34 kills and senior 
outside hitter Dain Blanton has 29. The Waves have a standout setter in junior 
Chip McCaw, who played with the U.S. National B team this summer at the World 
Games in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves, ranked No. 7 by Volleyball Monthly, will play host to No. 3 Brigham 
Young Monday and Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the Fireside Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine beat No. 10 Long Beach State, 15-6, 15-6, 15-8, Tuesday. The Waves 
are 3-0 and 2-0 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine Coach Marv Dunphy recorded his 200th career win at Pepperdine Jan. 
20 when the Waves beat UC Irvine, 15-10, 15-6, 15-6, in their conference 
opener. COLLEGE BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
 The Pepperdine baseball team, ranked seventh by Baseball America, will open 
its 56-game schedule against Westmont at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Eddy D. Field 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Waves finished 41-17, won the West Coast Conference title for 
the third consecutive year and advanced to the NCAA playoffs for the eighth 
time in nine seasons. SEAN WATERS

SCOTT HARRIS: A QUAKE BY ANY OTHER NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earthquakes have a dark sense of humor. In Sherman Oaks, a school for 
prospective building contractors has been severely damaged. Apartment buildings 
here and there are encircled with yellow tape, but signs that say "Newly 
Remodeled!" and "$599 Moves You In!" have not been removed. And if you drive 
north along battered Reseda Boulevard, you may notice a mysterious billboard 
near Sherman Way. "Confidence Soaring in City," it declares -- above a roof 
that has collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther up the boulevard are the half-picked-up offices of the Northridge 
Chamber of Commerce, founded May 29, 1929. For 64 years, this chamber struggled 
to promote an obscure region of Los Angeles. Now Northridge is famous the world 
over -- maybe infamous. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber manager Teri Canfield offers a business card that bears the group's 
slogan. 
</P>
<P>
 "NORTHRIDGE," it declares. "An Address You Want to Have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It actually should have been called the Reseda Quake, not the Northridge 
Quake," Canfield complains. The epicenter "is about a mile due south of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, questions persist about whether the epicenter was southwest or 
northwest of the corner of Roscoe and Reseda. Northridge is north of Roscoe; 
Reseda is south. Amid the death and destruction within and far beyond these two 
communities, it may seem a petty concern. 
</P>
<P>
 But Teri Canfield, whose husband, Bob, is coincidentally the emergency 
preparedness coordinator for the city of Los Angeles, isn't too serious about 
her protest. She knows that Northridge's problems aren't a matter of poor PR or 
media spin. A quake by another name wouldn't hurt any less. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took this position, I said I wanted to put Northridge on the map," 
Canfield says. "But the earthquake wasn't on my marketing plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Beal, the chamber president, remembers how some people would ask "Where's 
that?" if he mentioned Northridge. "Now we're pretty easy to spot." 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, Beal is wearing a T-shirt and shorts -- not the usual attire for 
an attorney. He estimates that he took $30,000 in damage to equipment and 
furniture in his law office on the third floor of a bank building. Now he's 
trying to find new quarters. His home, in an affluent part of Northridge known 
as Porter Ranch, probably had $20,000 damage. "My wife wouldn't go back in the 
house the first three days," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no woe-is-me in his voice. Some people fared better, some worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rings. "Thank you for calling the Northridge Chamber of Commerce!" 
Canfield says brightly. It's a member who is wondering about a mixer scheduled 
for that night at the Northridge Fashion Center, closed since the quake. The 
mixer's been canceled. "We're taking it one day at a time," Canfield says. 
</P>
<P>
 What was once a mission of community promotion has become a monumental job of 
damage control. Canfield says the chamber, with more than 250 members, is 
receiving many complaints about unlicensed contractors -- "rip-off artists" -- 
offering repairs for homeowners and merchants. Beal is looking ahead to 
Celebrate Northridge, an annual dinner to honor civic leaders and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrate Northridge had been scheduled for Feb. 27. The chamber has 
rescheduled the event for May 15, assuming people won't be in a celebratory 
mood for awhile. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Beal says, it will honor the heroes of the quake. "Hopefully, we'll 
be able to work on the theme that Northridge is rebounding," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Beal let out a sigh of fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 "What day is this?" he asked Canfield. "Friday?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she replied. "It's Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When there's so much rubble to be cleaned up and damage to be repaired, it 
seems odd to worry about community image. But long after Cal State Northridge 
is repaired and the Northridge Fashion Center reopens for business, people will 
pause before opening a business or buying a home in a place best known for a 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge could borrow a page from the San Fernando Valley playbook and 
simply change its name. After Sepulveda became known for gangs and graffiti, it 
was re-christened North Hills, despite the flat terrain. Similarly, west Canoga 
Park was reborn as West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, some folks in Porter Ranch wanted to secede from 
Northridge. Homeowners concerned about property values now may like the Porter 
Ranch name even more. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Beal points out, Porter Ranch contains the ridge of Northridge. So now 
what have you got? "'Northburg?" Beal suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians and civic boosters alike might prefer Zelzah. That's what 
Northridge was called before 1929, as named by an early settler. 
</P>
<P>
 The word comes from the Bible. It means "oasis."

A DOUBLY DARING VENTURE; CLINTON AIMS AT BOTH HEALTH CARE AND WELFARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same time 
we tackle health care. But let me point out I think it is inevitable and 
imperative." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, in his State of the Union address Tuesday evening, President 
Clinton signaled a willingness to pursue simultaneously perhaps the two 
toughest and most complex domestic problems this nation faces. 
</P>
<P>
 It's smart politics in pursuit of good public policy -- but indisputably a 
tricky and complex proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Practically speaking, if he does not embrace welfare reform at the same time, 
Clinton is likely to face defeat on his major initiative to provide basic 
health care coverage to all. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Finance Committee, let 
it be known before the President's address that he felt that the need to reform 
the welfare system was more pressing than health care. The New York Democrat 
even suggested he might sideline health care bills in his committee if welfare 
reform was not given the same priority. 
</P>
<P>
 But politics aside, tackling health care and welfare simultaneously can be a 
win-win proposition for Clinton if he does it right. Though each issue is 
uniquely complex, the social and economic impacts of our hobbled welfare and 
health care systems inextricably bind the two issues. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 1 million people are on welfare today because that is the only 
way they can get health care for their children. If they leave welfare for 
entry-level or part-time jobs, in many cases they are without coverage. 
Millions of working Americans who have no health care coverage often must 
resort to expensive emergency services when they become sick or injured. The 
costs of that are passed on to people fortunate enough to have health 
insurance, in the form of higher premiums or reduced coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care reform cuts across all classes. Though recent attention has 
focused on a slowing in the rise of health care costs, total U.S. health care 
spending in 1993 was $942.5 billion, up $102.1 billion from the year before -- 
the biggest one-year dollar increase ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Americans without health insurance has risen as well, to 38.9 
million in 1992 from 36.6 million the year before. So the need for reform that 
provides universal coverage is as pressing as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's address the President said, "We've got to solve the health care 
problem to have real welfare reform." He's right. And by taking on both of them 
at once, he has shown clearly that his State of the Union speech was intended 
to be far more than rhetoric.

QUAKE FINANCING -- LET'S GET REAL; THE POLITICAL FACT IS THIS: EVERYONE HAS TO 
CHIP IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Extraordinary times require uncommon sacrifices -- from ordinary citizens and 
from their government. But even as James Lee Witt, the head of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, was projecting this week that the Northridge 
earthquake would be the costliest natural disaster ever in the United States, 
some elected representatives, even in our own state, questioned the need for 
substantial federal and state earthquake assistance. Let's get real, folks. 
</P>
<P>
 If not everyone is getting with the program, don't blame the Clinton 
Administration. It is hard to imagine a more alert response from the White 
House, which on Tuesday announced a $6.6-billion aid package atop the nearly 
$900 million that it already had committed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are those like Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). Last 
week he and 13 other Republican members of the California congressional 
delegation declined to sign a letter to President Clinton in which the 
delegation urged him to seek emergency aid. Rohrabacher was concerned about 
"off-budget" emergency aid but also held back to engage in more immigrant 
bashing, suggesting that the supplemental aid bill should be amended to 
prohibit disaster assistance to illegal immigrants. There are far more 
constructive ways to deal with immigration problems, and the state needs 
federal earthquake relief now. 
</P>
<P>
 At the state level, some members of Orange County's delegation remain 
stubbornly opposed to proposals that require Californians to help themselves. 
Other than a willingness to consider a bond measure -- which surely would be 
more expensive in the long run -- there was strong sentiment against any talk 
of what we might have to do as a state to show that we're willing to pay at 
least part of our way -- whether through a temporary state gasoline tax 
increase or whatever. This is not politically mature. It's clear that 
Californians will have to contribute something one way or another. We can't 
just go to Washington with hat in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality-denying members of the congressional delegation have to remember that 
one purpose of national government is to help beleaguered localities in times 
of overwhelming crisis. This is certainly one of those times.

QUAKE-DAMAGED FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Earthquakes and freeways do not mix in Southern California. In the many 
years that I have driven in the Los Angeles area, I was always highly amazed to 
see the many elevated on-ramps and off-ramps that were constructed with only a 
single center support column to hold them up, instead of the double center 
support columns that some of the older ramps have. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of construction is common in the Greater Los Angeles area, and I 
have wondered for years which ramps would stand up in case of a severe 
earthquake, because to me this appears to be a very dangerous method of 
construction in earthquake-prone country. On Jan. 17, I received the answer. 
How quickly we forgot about the disastrous Oakland earthquake, and we evidently 
did not learn anything from it. Did we? 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD C. BARON 
</P>
<P>
 Glendora 
</P>
<P>
 * Your Jan. 21 editorial, "Necessary Evil: A Temporary Gas Tax," is on target, 
but you could take it a step further. Combine it with your Jan. 21 article 
"Many Find Comfort and Help On-Line" and a novel new source of highway repair 
revenue could emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 Force employers to either extensively use the new electronic highways afforded 
by today's telecommunications, E-mail and fax, or be required to pay an 
additional highway tax for each employee who is compelled by the employer to 
use the highways to drive to an office, where the work could have been done by 
the employees from their home via telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 The burden of proof should be placed on the employer to demonstrate, for each 
day that an employee drives to the office, why it was impossible for the work 
to be done by the employee at home using PCs and telecommunications.  
</P>
<P>
 This would not only generate substantial additional tax revenues for road 
repair but should help mitigate traffic congestion and be a major factor to 
convert California into a truly high-tech, efficient environment. 
</P>
<P>
 DONALD FENMORE 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Here is a practical solution to the problem of alleviating traffic 
congestion during these post-earthquake times: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Prohibit any street parking from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. on main thoroughfares. 
This will open up an additional traffic lane in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Double the traffic light time for all thoroughfare traffic at the expense 
of cross traffic. Once vehicles are on the thoroughfare, this should speed up 
travel time. 
</P>
<P>
 JEROME RAPPORT 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * The horrible earthquake that Los Angeles has endured served as a wake-up 
call for commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Between two to four hours of commuting in one direction for single drivers is 
absolutely insane. Not only does the commuting waste time and gas and pollute 
the environment, it also causes the driver extreme stress and absolute misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the big quake, I decided to take the Commuter Express bus into 
downtown. The bus rides very smoothly and is extremely quiet. When I take the 
Commuter Express to work every day I read The Times, listen to the radio -- 
sometimes I strike up a conversation with fellow passengers. I come to work 
happy, stress-free and guilt-free.  
</P>
<P>
 DENISE RENE 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * In watching the quake recovery planning, it strikes me that the quicker 
these freeways are back in service the better. The 10 Freeway overpass that 
fell constricts one of our most important freeway arteries, at a time when we 
need access and normalcy the most. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution? Remove the damaged roadway (almost complete already), fill in 
Fairfax with compacted dirt and asphalt, pave over the filled-in section. Other 
alternative: temporary steel structures and military bridges. If this were a 
critical military objective, it would be done in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 After the freeways are flowing again, more time can be taken to plan the 
reconstruction, rebuild half at a time, etc, all the while preserving traffic 
flow.

NO DEFENSE AGAINST BLUSTER; BUT U.S. PATRIOT MISSILES MIGHT HELP SEOUL WITH ANY 
INCOMING SCUDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after CIA Director R. James Woolsey alerted Congress that North 
Korea's leaders were bringing their country to "a heightened state of military 
readiness," the Clinton Administration said it is considering sending Patriot 
missiles to help defend South Korea and the 36,000 U.S. troops stationed there. 
That would be a prudent move, and the sooner accomplished the better. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriot probably would be positioned to defend air fields and ports, 
facilities whose protection is vital in the event of a new conflict on the 
Korean peninsula. Pyongyang can be counted on to charge that this modest 
defensive augmentation is a deliberate provocation. It isn't. The Patriot is an 
air defense weapon, designed to knock out incoming missiles. It is no threat to 
North Korea's territory, only to any aggressive instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 The world was introduced to the Patriot two years ago when it was sent to 
defend Israel and Saudi Arabia against Scud missile attacks from Iraq. 
After-battle analyses determined that the Patriot, which had not been designed 
to defend population centers, did not perform as well as was initially claimed. 
Since then it has been improved. While not foolproof -- no weapon is -- it is 
thought to be more effective now in destroying or deflecting incoming missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea has plenty of missiles, including its own version of the Scud. The 
CIA believes it also has one or two crude nuclear devices, and Pyongyang seems 
hellbent on making more. This is what the tensions with Kim Il Sung's Stalinist 
regime are all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang refuses to permit the international inspection of its nuclear sites 
that the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty requires. Instead it issues dark 
threats about how it might react if efforts were made to force its compliance 
with the treaty. In these circumstances the United States and its South Korean 
ally are wise to look to their defenses. Pyongyang likes to bluster. It's also 
capable of sudden and erratic behavior. Sending in the Patriots won't deflate 
the bluster, but it could usefully affect the actions North Korea might be 
weighing.

 Frustrated by bans on smoking in restaurants that have been enacted by more 
than 100 California cities and counties, Philip Morris U.S.A. -- the nation's 
biggest cigarette maker -- and a small number of restaurant owners are pushing 
a ballot initiative to invalidate such ordinances. The initiative would leave 
regulation of smoking to the Legislature, where smoking laws could be changed 
only on a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco industry lobbyists, who make big campaign contributions to selected 
politicians, would thus have to buy the favors of only a handful of legislators 
in Sacramento to kill controls on smoking in restaurants and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 What this effort to override local controls and sound health policy seeks 
isn't just a license to foul the air but -- given passive smoke's toxicity -- a 
license to kill. As the U.S. surgeon general keeps reminding us, 44,000 
nonsmoking Americans die each year because of exposure to tobacco smoke. If 
passed, this initiative would significantly increase nonsmokers' risks. 
</P>
<P>
 The cynicism behind this effort, the disregard of a mountain of scientific 
studies, boggles the mind. The evidence linking tobacco smoking to heart 
disease and a variety of cancers is overwhelming. The sponsors of the so-called 
California Uniform Tobacco Control Act nonetheless hope they can get enough 
signatures to qualify it for the November ballot. Natural disasters, like 
earthquakes, can't be prevented. But some gross human stupidities can be. No 
Californian should lend his or her signature to this outrageous initiative.

BENEFITS OF GIRLS' SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We at Mount St. Mary's College wholeheartedly endorse the views of Elizabeth 
T. Kennan ("Girls' Schools Are Best for Girls," Commentary, Jan. 19.) Research 
continues to demonstrate that women's colleges offer unique opportunities to 
their students and that the United States would be diminished by the loss of 
them.As Kennan argues, the evidence for this position comes from the success of 
women's college graduates. Given the smaller number of women graduated by 
single-sex institutions, the figures on their achievements and influence are 
truly dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Mount Holyoke, we recognize the urgent need to reverse the "self-esteem 
slide" documented in Sadker's study. Our Strides Toward Educational Proficiency 
(STEP) Program, founded in 1985, has brought hundreds of selected students from 
inner-city high schools to the MSMC Doheny campus for summer workshops designed 
to sharpen their skills in preparation for college-level study. 
</P>
<P>
 We are proud that more than 40% of our baccalaureate students choose to major 
in biology, chemistry and nursing. Of the MSMC students who apply to medical 
school, more than 80% are accepted. Our strong programs in the sciences have 
been reinforced over the years by significant grants from the National Science 
Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, especially with regard to 
encouraging minority women to engage in biomedical research. 
</P>
<P>
 The significant increases in enrollment we and other women's colleges are 
experiencing are attributable to far more than the "Hillary factor." Students 
have a special environment in which to develop their talents fully at women's 
colleges, and we have the opportunity to help prepare many of tomorrow's most 
vital and creative leaders.

SOMEONE HAS TO SAY IT: WE NEED A TAX; CALIFORNIA'S SHARE OF QUAKE-RECOVERY 
SPENDING IS RELATIVELY SMALL. DON'T LET POLITICAL LEADERS SHIRK WHAT HAS TO BE 
DONE.

 President Clinton has thrown down the gauntlet to California in an 
exceptionally compassionate way. He has generously asked Congress for $7.5 
billion -- money that would come directly to California, if only we can match 
the federal spending by 10 cents on the dollar. That means we have to raise 
$700 million of new money fast if we want that federal money to come to us in a 
timely way to rebuild schools and roads and repair bridges and freeways, and 
help the people and businesses that were hurt the most by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local political leaders raced to the scene of the disaster and poked 
their heads in front of every camera and microphone. However, they are ducking 
out of sight when it comes to explaining how California can pay its small 
matching amount for the federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton team has been exceptionally responsive to California's crisis. 
After the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, California legislators had to go to 
Washington to talk with Cabinet officials about housing and transportation 
needs. This time, Cabinet members like Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros and 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena not only came to California, they stayed 
to help. After the 1989 quake, the government required that California match 
federal aid by 25%; the state imposed a 1/4% sales tax increase that raised 
more than $700 million in 13 months. The Clinton proposal offers far more aid 
money for a much smaller matching percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi 
are the only major California political leaders to have immediately called for 
a revenue-raising measure to help pay for reconstruction. State Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown and Gov. Pete Wilson both said last Saturday that proposals to 
raise the sales tax or gas tax were "premature." It's no longer premature. 
Californians need to persuade Congress, quickly, that we are willing to do our 
share. Otherwise we risk having Congress seriously reduce the President's 
proposals or vote to have California pay a much higher matching share of the 
costs. Why, after all, should members of Congress from Georgia and Michigan and 
Texas risk the wrath of their constituents in order to help California? 
Californians have to help the President and his team make our case. We have to 
point to the fact that despite our badly crippled state economy, the state has 
quickly imposed new revenue measures for quake relief. Support for new sales 
taxes or gas taxes to raise the needed money should also be heard from Mayor 
Richard Riordan and the L.A. County Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The politicians' reaction to this crisis should cause us, as voters, to do 
some hard self-analysis. What is it about our voting patterns these last 
several decades that has made politicians so cowardly when it comes to 
discussing directly the obvious need for new taxes? Time after time, when 
politicians suggest new revenues, they lose. Their opponents, who promise "no 
new taxes," win. Consequently we no longer have honest political dialogue. 
Politicians are afraid that if they tell us we can't have our cake and eat it 
too, we will vote them out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 But jobs for many in Southern California are what this federal earthquake 
relief package is all about. The construction sector, which has been one of the 
most depressed parts of our local economy, will have an immediate lift, and 
much of the relief money will be spent to put Californians back to work. 
Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Northridge) lives near the epicenter of the 
quake. Her constitituents would be among the people to benefit most from a 
timely and generous federal aid package. Yet, the day after the quake, she was 
quoted as saying that she did not support a tax increase on Californians to pay 
for rebuilding. If people like Paula Boland and Pete Wilson don't lead in 
raising California's small share of the money, we may all suffer a backlash 
from an angry Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 We are lucky to have a powerful California congressional delegation, two U.S. 
senators with influence in the Administration and a White House team in which 
many people come from and care about California. The members of California's 
congressional delegation should use all of their influence to get their 
colleagues to join them in supporting the President's proposals. Los Angeles 
and California political leaders should take voters' heat if they do not, 
within days, show Congress that we in California are prepared to do what should 
be done to get the money we need. Momentum must not be lost.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE; FEDS COME UP SHORT ON HOUSING; THERE

 FEMA-bashing is a popular sport after a major disaster. In the days following 
President Clinton's promise of speedy federal assistance for victims of the 
Northridge earthquake, thousands of rattled people queued up at disaster-relief 
centers to collect housing vouchers. Instead, they got sheafs of application 
forms to fill out and appointments with FEMA counselors two or three weeks down 
the line. The federal government clearly was overwhelmed, unprepared for the 
scope of Los Angeles' needs. People were outraged, and until the bureaucratic 
reinforcements got into gear over the weekend, the situation threatened to turn 
very nasty. But was the outrage justified? 
</P>
<P>
 No. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelenos, like most Americans, assume that FEMA, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, is there to help them individually when disaster strikes. 
They are misinformed. FEMA was established in 1974 to provide disaster 
assistance when a state's resources are exhausted. The federal government's 
primary commitment is to assist in the reconstruction of public works -- roads, 
freeways, bridges, dams, power and water lines as well as schools and civic 
buildings. Private housing recovery is not integral to FEMA's mission. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Loma Prieta quake in 1989, few natural disasters in the United 
States had caused major damage to the housing stock. As a result, when the 
federal government thought of disaster relief for housing, they tended to think 
of a farmhouse in Kansas hit by a tornado. Thus, the federal model for housing 
recovery is a rent voucher, a small cash grant for lost eyeglasses, 
prescription medicine and the like, and perhaps a repair or rebuilding loan 
from the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government's policy is to treat housing losses as small private 
losses. While the government acknowledges that it has a role in assisting 
homeowners' recovery from uninsured losses, the basic assumption is that market 
forces will work to rebuild apartments and other privately owned rental 
buildings. That model is no longer useful. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five years, there have been five major disasters affecting tens of 
thousands of housing units. The Loma Prieta quake wiped out 12,000 and damaged 
30,000 more. Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki affected at least 50,000 homes, as did 
the Midwestern floods. FEMA's latest estimate for the Northridge earthquake: 
36,000 housing units seriously damaged or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 This should not come as a surprise. Most Americans live and work in cities or 
close-in suburbs; when disaster strikes, the toll will be high. The good news 
is that we in California have a building code system that works. The process of 
regulating building design and construction here is one of the best in the 
world. Yes, some buildings failed last Monday. Yes, some people lost their 
lives, but the number was mercifully small. In India and Armenia, recent 
earthquakes of similar magnitude killed 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Countless Angelenos are alive today because of the controversial 1981 
ordinance that mandated retrofitting of unreinforced masonry buildings. Some of 
them were damaged last week, but no one was killed in a retrofitted masonry 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the good news. The bad news: There is no code, policy or program to 
"retrofit" the lives of the thousands of people displaced by the Northridge 
earthquake. While the federal government has been remarkably prompt and 
generous in responding to this disaster, it is not programmed to help with the 
primary need: housing. In the aid package announced by President Clinton on 
Monday, $757 million is geared to loans for uninsured losses sustained by 
homeowners, renters and small businesses. Another $150 million is earmarked for 
rental vouchers. Missing from the equation is replacement of the lost rental 
units, a major problem for the San Fernando Valley, where more than half of the 
residents are renters. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate lessons from the Northridge earthquake are virtually identical 
to the lessons from Loma Prieta, which have yet to be incorporated in federal 
disaster-relief policy: 
</P>
<P>
 * Housing losses will be large and concentrated in multifamily structures. 
</P>
<P>
 * The real-estate market will never replace affordable housing and will be 
slow to rebuild market-rate rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
 * The concept of recovery as loss replacement is inadequate to the task of 
rebuilding urban housing resources.  
</P>
<P>
 * Housing recovery will not happen unless there is adequate funding in place 
through existing housing agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 As a point of comparison, the price tag on Loma Prieta was $10 billion; 90% 
was spent on roads, bridges, public buildings and infrastructure, 10% ($1 
billion) on housing repair and replacement. Half of the money came from 
insurance claims and the rest from a patchwork of federal, state and Red Cross 
programs that were understaffed and underfunded. More than four years later, 
2,000 to 3,000 units have not been rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Major disasters change the physical and social fabric of cities in unalterable 
ways. An individual rebuilding his house may want to change the design; a city 
may see the need for a homeless shelter. It is within that context that the 
reformulating of disaster recovery policy must take place. First, it must 
recognize the importance of all types of housing in disaster assistance. 
Ideally, it would include a real commitment to protecting the existing housing 
stock and mitigating hazards as well as rebuilding multifamily structures and 
expediting repair funds for homeowners and landlords.  
</P>
<P>
 Federally funded assistance is essential, but the way those funds are spent 
should be decided by local governments, which have the responsibility to 
rebuild community life.

COLUMN LEFT/ LINDA HIRSHMAN: NO LONGER ALONE AGAINST VENGEFUL MOBS; THE SUPREME 
COURT HAS AT LEAST GIVEN PRO-CHOICE WOMEN A TOOL TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA HIRSHMAN, Linda R. Hirshman is a professor of law and director of the 
Women's Legal Studies Institute at Chicago Kent College of Law.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court has ruled that the federal racketeering law applies to 
people who use mob techniques against abortion clinics. This exposes the 
abortion protesters to liability for substantial civil and criminal penalties. 
It thus promises to do for women what the troops in Little Rock, Ark., a 
generation ago did for black schoolchildren -- telling them that they no longer 
had to be alone with a mob. 
</P>
<P>
 As a technical matter, the opinion does not find the defendants, Chicago 
attorney Joe Scheidler and his organization, the Pro-Life Action League, guilty 
of or liable for anything. That will await a federal trial. The opinion says 
that the federal court in Chicago was wrong when it held that the campaigns 
against clinics were immune from the federal laws against racketeering and mob 
action, generally known as RICO. The Supreme Court said that RICO applies, even 
if making money is not the organization's reason to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 But the significance of the decision extends far beyond the limited reversal 
of a mistaken interpretation of RICO. When the Supreme Court decided in Roe vs. 
Wade in 1973 that most laws against abortion were unconstitutional, it removed 
the restraint of state criminal law from women making that choice. Nonetheless, 
in the years since Roe vs. Wade, private pressure groups, encouraged perhaps by 
what looked like an erosion of support for the decision in the conservative 
appointments to the Supreme Court, have tried to create a private system of 
sanctions to make it impossible for women to exercise that choice. These 
"private prosecutors" tried to stop the exercise of abortion rights by 
targeting sites where local law enforcement authorities were less than 
enthusiastic about protecting the constitutional right to abortion. The Justice 
Department, which was arguing for reversal of Roe vs. Wade, was completely 
unavailable to protect the clinics. The ultimate development came last summer 
when a follower of Randall Terry's anti-abortion organization killed Dr. David 
Gunn of Pensacola, Fla., for his role in providing abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this period, women's and abortion rights groups tried repeatedly 
and without success to invoke federal criminal and civil law to protect their 
constitutional rights. But the Supreme Court ruled that even the civil-rights 
acts did not apply to protect women, because people might try to cut off 
abortion rights for reasons other than bigotry. The 5-4 civil-rights decision 
revealed a conservative court refusing to treat sex as entitled to special 
treatment, like race. It began to look as if a constitutional right that 
applies only to women's needs would be a constitutional right that could not be 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 In this way, abortion rights were like the right to be free of domestic 
violence. As women have been saying about such violence for years, too often 
the rule of law stops at the bedroom door, leaving women unprotected by police, 
state's attorneys and courts. As a technical matter, women have the right to be 
free of domestic violence, as they have the right to choose an abortion. But 
without the rule of law and the agencies of law, the right is often nothing 
more than a technicality. Just as the American people have witnessed the state 
of war outside the abortion clinics where there was no effective law 
enforcement, many women live in just such a state of war in their domestic 
situations. For all intents and purposes there is no government in their lives 
at all. The trials of media stars John and Lorena Bobbitt revealed to all avid 
watchers the state of war in which many men and women coexist. 
</P>
<P>
 But no member of the Supreme Court was extremist enough to accept the lower 
court opinion in the the RICO case, which seemed to say that women seeking 
abortions were not even entitled to the minimum protections of criminal law. By 
refusing to carve out an exception to the federal criminal law for abortion 
protesters, the Supreme Court has indicated that one piece of that private 
state of war may be drawing to a close. To Our Contributors

COLUMN RIGHT/ JAMES P. PINKERTON: A LOW-CAL STATE OF THE UNION; PLENTY OF

 In his first State of the Union address, written in Gergenese, President 
Clinton on Tuesday threw a blanket of Reaganesque rhetoric over everything. 
Clinton speaks as easily about family and faith as the Gipper; that's one 
reason why he got so much farther in life than Walter Mondale or Michael 
Dukakis. Unlike George Bush, Clinton doesn't need to say "Message: I care" to 
make sure people get the gist; the exclamation points in Clinton's body 
language reinforce his words. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Clinton's sweeping style obscures a much slighter substance. Clinton 
shows a distinct Bush-like tendency to state his good intentions and then not 
worry much about what happens to them. If Clinton had really wanted to focus, 
laser-like, on health care, the speech would have been half its 63-minute 
length. But Clinton had a lot of good things he wanted to put in about welfare 
and crime . . . and about Superfund, civil rights and reinventing government. 
</P>
<P>
 The most valuable resource in the White House is the President's time. It's 
only natural that every bureaucratic constituency wants to get a presidential 
pat on the back. The problem was that Clinton was so agreeable. He drifted down 
verbal detours from health care, the alleged centerpiece of his presidency. He 
patted everyone on the back for ending gridlock; he thanked his audience for 
"the most successful teamwork between a President and a Congress in 30 years." 
In fact, Clinton has been quite accommodating to Congress: He's the first 
Democrat in more than a century not to have vetoed anything in his first year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to end gridlock when you cave in all the time. But consider what was 
intended to be the most dramatic moment of the speech, when Clinton pulled out 
a pen and said: "If you send me legislation that does not guarantee every 
American private health insurance that can never be taken away, you will force 
me to take this pen, veto the legislation and we'll come right back here and 
start all over again." The words and the prop echoed Reagan's "make my day" 
anti-tax line from a decade ago. Coming from Clinton, it sounds more like a 
pseudo-threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latin root of the word veto is "I forbid." But Clinton is not a 
line-in-the-sand guy. As Prof. John J. Pitney Jr. of Claremont-McKenna College 
puts it, as you evaluate a Clinton caveat, think of Somali warlord Mohammed 
Farah Aidid, North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung and the gang of Serbian 
child-killers. Nothing bad has happened to them. Conversely, before you take a 
Clinton promise to heart, think about the disappointment of middle-class 
taxpayers, gay soldiers and the Haitian boat people. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's artful locutions have enabled him to preserve his political 
viability during personal crises ranging from accusations of marijuana smoking 
to his position on the Persian Gulf War. The latest example came in Tuesday's 
speech. Clinton said he wanted to "guarantee every American private health 
insurance that can never be taken away." Sounds reasonable, but the policy 
buzzword of choice for health-care crusaders is universal, as in "universal 
coverage." The U-word was missing the other night. In a speech so heavily 
edited, that was deliberate. Is Clinton carving out some wiggle room? Nor did 
Clinton cite a target date for the actual implementation of his plan. While he 
demanded action "now," there was no mention of when he expected his health-care 
plan to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this sound like nit-picking? Put it this way: When liquor stores "card" 
youthful-looking customers, that too could be described as nit-picking. But 
it's done for a good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 If he were alive today, George Washington wouldn't have to show two IDs to 
cash a check. Clinton has not earned that level of trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody much trusts the Republicans, at least not on health care. But the GOP 
has one huge advantage: They don't have to make sense of the Clinton plan. 
Republican responder Bob Dole's line, "The President's idea is to put a 
mountain of bureaucrats between you and your doctor," was the familiar 
conservative spiel. But Dole unveiled a powerful Perot-like visual: a huge 
schematic diagram of the Clinton plan. Across America, viewers had flashbacks 
to calculus and Krebs cycles. It's bad enough to have to learn that stuff; it's 
far worse to have to pay a trillion dollars for it. 
</P>
<P>
 If Satan is in the specifics, then the Clinton plan needs an exorcism. And 
what fresh hell is the "Advisory Commission on Regional Variations of Health 
Expenditures," anyway?

METRO FOCUS: PAID COMBATANTS THE WINNERS IN STILL-UNRESOLVED FREEWAY BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether the extension of the Long Beach (710) Freeway is approved or rejected, 
three groups are sure to have benefited from the struggle: the army of 
lobbyists, lawyers and public relations people employed by South Pasadena and 
Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 On the pro-freeway side in Alhambra, where streets are jammed daily by 
thousands of cars spilling onto and off the dead-end freeway, $439,424 has been 
spent on a cadre of legal advisers, Washington insiders and public relations 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena, which would lose 315 homes and see its largely upscale 
residential neighborhoods sliced in half, has so far paid $875,208 to 
attorneys, lobbying firms and planners to argue the anti-freeway cause. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Farfsing said South Pasadena probably will spend much 
more on a massive lawsuit if the California Transportation Commission and 
Federal Highway Administration approve Caltrans' 6.2-mile extension of the 
freeway between the San Bernardino and Foothill freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit would challenge the environmental report on the north-south route 
that would run from the Alhambra city limits, through a portion of Los Angeles, 
South Pasadena and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the freeway fight say legal and lobbying costs have escalated since 
the late 1980s. The South Pasadena City Council at that time decided to use 
Community Redevelopment Agency funds to hire Antonio Rossmann, a respected 
$200-per-hour environmental lawyer, and Ochoa & Sillas, a $90-per-hour 
Sacramento lobbying firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel these people are lining their pockets at the taxpayers' expense," said 
Robert O. Cook, a member of the South Pasadena Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, 1989, Rossmann has been paid $389,049 for work on the freeway. 
Ochoa & Sillas, led by Ralph Ochoa, ex-chief of staff for the state Assembly 
Speaker, has taken in $351,902 since December, 1988. Last month, the city 
manager hired Cochran & Lotkin, a Los Angeles and Washington law firm, to lobby 
the federal government. Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. is also Michael Jackson's and 
Reginald Denny's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra has fought back. It has paid the Los Angeles law firm of Burke, 
Williams & Sorensen $233,004, Read Communications of Pasadena $115,839 and 
Washington lobbying firm The Ferguson Group $77,541 to make its point. Read, 
Ferguson and another Washington lobbying firm, Marc & Associates, are all paid 
monthly retainers of $2,000 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena leaders agree that the freeway fight is costly for a small city 
with a $16-million budget. But they say the consultants have earned their pay 
because there still is no freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa helped persuade the National Trust for Historic Preservation to 
designate South Pasadena as one of "America's Most Endangered Places." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Rossmann successfully challenged a 1982 state law that allowed 
Caltrans to build the freeway through South Pasadena without its permission. 
The judge said the legislation had expired. The decision has been appealed and 
the issue remains clouded. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra officials describe their pro-freeway campaign, which includes taking 
the Caltrans side in a lawsuit over the state law last year, as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are spending on this issue is absolutely justifiable. We want traffic 
off our streets and onto the freeway," said Julio J. Fuentes, city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've spent $5 for every resident compared to $37 for South Pasadena," he 
said, noting that Alhambra has 82,000 residents compared to its northern 
neighbor's 24,000 residents.

WHITE HOUSE TO UNVEIL PLAN TO END TELECOM MONOPOLIES; REGULATION: 
ADMINISTRATION WILL PROPOSE TEARING DOWN WALLS BETWEEN CABLE TV AND LOCAL AND 
LONG-DISTANCE PHONE COMPANIES IN EFFORT TO SPUR COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of political buildup, the Clinton Administration will unveil 
detailed proposals today for spurring competition in the telecommunications 
sector by eliminating restrictions that keep cable TV firms, local phone 
companies and long-distance carriers from invading each others' markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials, working under the supervision of Commerce Secretary 
Ron Brown, were still drafting key elements of the plan late Wednesday. But 
department sources said a central element of the telecommunications "white 
paper" will call for passage of legislation to let regional phone companies 
offer long-distance service if they can satisfy federal regulators that their 
entry will not harm competition in other markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan is still being worked on, but in general, it details our proposals" 
for rewriting the rules of telephone competition, said Larry Williams, a 
spokesman for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 
the Commerce Department unit that oversees telecommunications policy. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, the proposal would open up a potentially lucrative new source of 
revenue for local phone companies, such as Pacific Telesis, that currently are 
required to hand off long-distance calls to American Telephone & Telegraph, MCI 
and other long-distance providers. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for such freedom, however, many experts expect that the 
Administration will back measures that would expose telephone companies to more 
competition by encouraging cable companies to offer local phone service through 
their wired networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Several such proposals are pending in Congress. A bill introduced late last 
year by Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) would allow cable and telephone 
companies to enter each other's markets, but would require them to open their 
networks to use by competitors. Another measure, by Rep. John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.), would allow Bell companies to manufacture telephone equipment and to 
enter the lucrative long-distance market after five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) is expected to introduce a 
measure to foster competition in the telecommunications market.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of momentum out there to address this issue this year," said a 
Capitol Hill aide involved with shaping telecommunications policy.  
</P>
<P>
 Three top Administration officials are scheduled to travel to Capitol Hill 
today to testify before the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee: 
Larry Irving, head of NTIA; Reed Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications 
Commission, and Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general for antitrust. All 
were unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In prepared remarks submitted to the House subcommittee on economic and 
commercial law, Bingaman said it is time for federal regulators to begin 
supplanting the federal courts as chief overseers of the burgeoning 
telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal judges, who in the early 1980s ordered the breakup of the old Bell 
Telephone monopoly and more recently eased restrictions that prevented Bell 
Atlantic Corp. from offering cable television service in its local markets, 
have been key forces in shaping telecommunications policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration believes the time has come to move telecommunications 
policy out of the courts and into the statute books so that Congress, 
representing the public, can establish the far-reaching framework for governing 
the telecommunications world of the future that the nation deserves," Bingaman 
said.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; THIS WAS A 
TELECOMMUTING WAKE-UP CALL, FOLKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The freeways are down. The traffic is terrible. The debate should be over. If 
we really want to improve the post-earthquake commutes, let's not fix those 
fallen freeways quite so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no longer enough to merely "encourage" telecommuting. Southern California 
needs explicit policies and programs that promote mandatory telecommuting, and 
it needs them now. 
</P>
<P>
 People and companies that really care about the community understand that the 
post-earthquake environment is a golden opportunity masquerading as a difficult 
problem. There is no better time than now to focus creativity and commitment on 
fundamentally transforming California's traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The automotive aftershocks of the Northridge earthquake effectively demolish 
the tired arguments that have blocked widespread adoption of telecommuting. 
When you've got a lemon, make lemonade. Telecommuting is no longer an option, 
it is a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 And the task of making it happen falls to government, the private sector and 
the phone companies alike -- by using tax codes and other pressures to force 
change and by making mandatory the various half-steps that have been adopted 
voluntarily and piecemeal by some. The goal of rebuilding Southern California's 
transportation infrastructure should not be the glorious re-creation of 
yesteryear's traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the federal government should make its billions of dollars in 
rebuilding funds contingent upon California devising telecommuting programs 
that are every bit as rigorous and concrete as the freeway reconstructions. If 
the leaders of the city, region and state don't have the courage to require 
this on their own, the nation's taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize a 
Southern California that refuses to learn from experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that California earthquake contingency plans didn't consider 
telecommuting options in the event of freeway collapses represents a planning 
failure that is irresponsible at best and governmental malpractice at worst. So 
just what were the administrations of Govs. George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson 
and Mayor Bradley thinking? That everything would be "business as usual" after 
a major quake as long as millions of lemming-like commuters would get up at 
4:30 in the morning so they could all get to work by 9? 
</P>
<P>
 The critical point, however, isn't analyzing how all these lapses occurred -- 
it's making sure the region moves swiftly toward improving the quality of work 
life for its commuters while preserving the economic productivity of its 
companies. What are the obvious first steps? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Government needs to identify the 15 or 20 companies that generate the most 
traffic. Those filled with "knowledge workers" and paper pushers should be 
required to designate a significant portion of their workers "part-time 
telecommuters" who work at home one or two days a week. Flextime should be 
mandated to smooth the rush hour crush. 
</P>
<P>
 In the best of times, as telecommuting experts and traffic engineers 
acknowledge, even marginal reductions in the number of vehicles can have a 
significant impact on traffic flow. Compulsory telecommuting must be the law of 
the land for companies whose commuters are freeway hogs.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Telesis has long been a champion of telecommuting -- up to and 
including full-page post-earthquake ads. Unfortunately, the company has 
primarily been a champion of its brand of telecommuting: telecommuting centers 
in which work is done from satellite offices. It has otherwise been very 
uncreative in both its marketing and technical approaches. Now is the time to 
link private initiatives with public policy mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 While Pacific Bell Foundation's recent offer to donate a million dollars worth 
of modems is a sweet gesture, it's not meaningful. The phone company should be 
compelled by the Public Utilities Commission to cut by 50% to 75% the cost of 
local daytime phone service in the earthquake-affected local telephone 
exchanges. The company should be compelled to reprogram local switches so that 
large companies can easily and cheaply link their telecommuters together via 
phone mail and call-forwarding services. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, a special surtax should be slapped on mobile cellular phone calls 
to discourage driving. Calls that remain within a single cell would merit 
discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone company should also be allowed to provide voice-over-data modems so 
that telecommuters can fax, compute and chat over a single phone line. The 
temporary loss in revenue can be made up by special statewide tariffs in about 
a year. Better yet, fund it with a 2-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax. PacBell's 
network revenues will inevitably rise anyway as telecommuting takes hold in 
corporate cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt there are dozens of far more creative suggestions and ideas for 
getting companies and individuals to substitute telecommunications highways 
that work for freeway overpasses that don't. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing that prevents California's telecommuting initiatives in the 
earthquake's aftermath from becoming a model for the entire country. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons both environmental and economic, distributed work and 
location-independent enterprise represent the future of American industry. 
</P>
<P>
 If California has the courage not to repeat its mistakes, it has the 
opportunity to turn billions of dollars' worth of destruction into an 
opportunity for a higher quality of work, home life and transportation.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; SLOW DAYS FOR MAULED MALL; NORTHRIDGE CENTER, 
BADLY DAMAGED IN QUAKE, TO PARTLY REOPEN IN 6 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge Fashion Center, by far the mall most severely damaged by last 
week's earthquake, will partially reopen within about six months, its new 
owners told tenants Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the mall's six big department stores could remain closed for at 
least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The lengthy closure of the mall -- whose $350 million in total annual sales 
make it one of Southern California' largest shopping centers -- could mean the 
loss of millions of dollars in revenues for merchants and possible unemployment 
for many of the mall's 2,500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Many area shoppers may need to drive miles farther to alternate malls, such as 
Glendale Galleria or Topanga Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, tenants were told by officials of Dallas-based MEPC America 
Properties Inc., which bought the Northridge mall in December, that there was 
minimal structural damage to the central part of the complex, apart from the 
department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been decided yet how many repaired stores it will take to justify 
reopening part of the mall, located about a mile from the quake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest obstacle to the reopening now is not the condemned Bullock's 
department store and two collapsed parking structures, nor the cartloads of 
broken glass, fallen ceiling tiles, cracked drywall and mangled aluminum wall 
studs. It's the cancer-causing asbestos that was dislodged by the massive quake 
that will now have to be carefully removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the mall, the main passageways and common areas have been swept clean 
of the glass, fallen ceiling tiles and merchandise that crashed through the 
storefronts. Plastic sheets covered the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 As they left the tenants meeting, shopkeepers worried about what they might 
find behind the plastic sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those likely to be hardest hit are the small proprietors who are not part of a 
large chain. Harry Duhanci, owner of the Caprice collectibles shop, said he has 
no earthquake insurance. After looking into it three years ago, he found that 
such coverage would have tripled his insurance payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the loss of his business, even temporarily, is "like a second earthquake," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall workers also worried about their future. While many of the department 
stores are trying to find places for employees at other locations, other 
workers may not be as fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Mather, an employee at Country Works, a collectibles shop in the mall, 
said she has already filed for unemployment and will start looking for another 
job. "Everyone is in the same boat," she said. "With so many other people 
looking, I don't know what my options are." 
</P>
<P>
 Zach Rouse, a Chatsworth High School senior who works at WaldenBooks, said he 
hopes to find work at another bookstore in the chain. "I need the cash," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For several department stores, the time it will take them to reopen remains 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullock's spokeswoman Betty Crogh said the company hasn't decided whether the 
store will be rebuilt, a task that would take up to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the J.C. Penney store may not reopen for more than a year, company 
officials said. Sears is aiming for a late-fall reopening, spokesman Gordon 
Jones said. Officials at Robinsons-May, which has two stores at Northridge 
Fashion Center, and officials at the Broadway said they are still assessing the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As for MEPC, it has earthquake insurance, but a company official declined to 
say what damages might be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 MEPC also has business-interruption insurance that will cover the loss of 
rents while the mall is closed, said John Graham, vice president of property 
management at MEPC. 
</P>
<P>
 But tenants are responsible for fixing any damages inside their shops, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other San Fernando Valley malls continued their quake recovery 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park is planning to reopen Friday, although its four 
department stores will remain closed for a few weeks to a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Saks Fifth Avenue said it will not reopen its earthquake-damaged store at the 
Promenade in Woodland Hills, a decision that will idle 131 employees.

 It was a spectacle right out of Buck Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 A 42-foot-tall, 21-ton, cone-shaped rocket lifted 150 feet above the New 
Mexico desert, stopped, moved sideways 350 feet, stopped again, then floated 
back to Earth, landing tail-first on its four pods as smoke and flames poured 
from its engines .  
</P>
<P>
 Never had anyone seen such a vertical landing by a rocket, except in 
science-fiction movies. And despite lasting only 60 seconds, the maiden voyage 
last August of the unmanned Delta Clipper-Experimental (DC-X) generated waves 
of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 But now it appears the DC-X has sputtered out. It is only days from being 
mothballed by its builder, McDonnell Douglas Corp., for lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
 The DC-X exhausted its initial $58-million Defense Department funding in 
October, after it had made three of 10 planned test flights. Congress had 
earmarked another $5 million to complete the tests, but it appears the cash 
won't be forthcoming from the Pentagon -- at least not for now -- because of 
shrinking U.S. defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Pentagon has already told McDonnell that its contract to continue 
testing the DC-X at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico will end 
Tuesday, said Bill Gaubatz, who heads the project for McDonnell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's their decision," he said, referring to officials at the Pentagon. "We 
have no place to go, and we and the whole program essentially have to pick up 
and move off of White Sands." 
</P>
<P>
 The DC-X is a dramatic illustration of how difficult it is for futuristic 
technology tied to Pentagon funding to survive budget cuts in the post-Cold War 
world -- even if the technology makes the public sit up and take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The rocket's uncertain status also reflects the continuing national 
uncertainty about exactly what kind of space launch vehicles the United States 
should build in the future. Despite the DC-X's showy performance, the White 
House and the Pentagon are evaluating other ways for the United States to 
modernize its launch capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Champions of the DC-X believe it would be a cheap, reusable and dependable 
space launch vehicle that would not need to toss away expensive boosters and 
other hardware and could be quickly refurbished and launched again. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatched by the Pentagon as part of its "Star Wars" defense program, the DC-X 
is also an ideal prototype for a rocket that could launch commercial payloads 
for far less money than either the Space Shuttle or existing unmanned rockets, 
proponents say. In that role, it could bolster the United States' role in the 
increasingly crowded space launch business. 
</P>
<P>
 The DC-X that has been tested so far is one-third the size of the rocket 
ultimately envisioned. The final model would be able to lift up to 25,000 
pounds of cargo into orbit around the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Gaubatz said, McDonnell will probably haul the DC-X back to its space 
division in Huntington Beach, and it has already begun reassigning some 
employees of the DC-X's 30-member team. 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour Himmel, a space consultant and former NASA engineer, said he hopes the 
DC-X has a future. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to talk about a national launch vehicle family, then this 
ought to be considered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Himmel noted, the DC-X still suffers from confusion about its ultimate 
role in space -- a role that has already changed in a major way since McDonnell 
began building the craft in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The rocket was spawned by the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense 
Organization. The agency wanted to develop the DC-X as a way to ferry missile 
defense shields and weapons into space, and the rocket's initial financing came 
through the BMDO. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the end of the Cold War, and of most of the Star Wars project, the 
BMDO is no longer interested in funding the DC-X. So for fiscal 1994, which 
began Oct. 1, Congress appropriated $5 million for the DC-X's remaining seven 
test flights as part of the budget for the Pentagon's Advanced Research 
Projects Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Tim Kyger, technology adviser for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach), ARPA soon got word from the office of Defense 
Undersecretary John M. Deutch, who oversees ARPA, not to release the cash to 
the DC-X. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher is a staunch supporter of the DC-X, and his district includes 
McDonnell's Huntington Beach plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a deliberate effort over there (at the Pentagon) to keep this money 
from being spent and to shut this whole thing down," Kyger said. "Deutch has a 
policy of no new launch vehicle programs, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Walker, a Pentagon spokeswoman for Deutch, had no comment on the DC-X's 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides its technical accomplishments, the DC-X had provided a welcome splash 
of good publicity for McDonnell, which has been burdened by its troubled C-17 
cargo plane, sluggish passenger jet orders and cutbacks in its space station 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 So why doesn't McDonnell simply spend the $5 million to keep the rocket going? 
</P>
<P>
 "Even $5 million these days is quite precious to all companies," said 
McDonnell's Gaubatz. Moreover, he said, McDonnell probably would have to spend 
at least another $2 million to relocate the DC-X's operation to another site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just gets to be so open-ended that it's not a practical plan at this 
point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaubatz said that while he's disappointed the DC-X program could abruptly end, 
McDonnell collected valuable data from its tests that will be applied to future 
spacecraft. Even though the DC-X sits idle on the ground, he said, "we're still 
on a high from what has been accomplished."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; LENDERS BEAR UP UNDER QUAKE LOSS; INSURANCE, 
AID FOR HOMEOWNERS SEEN AS FACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While certainly shaken and battered by last week's earthquake, most mortgage 
lenders in Southern California say they have not sustained severe damage to 
their balance sheets -- at least for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 While the long-term outlook remains cloudy, lenders generally say the quake's 
immediate impact will be minimal because the number of borrowers whose homes 
were damaged or destroyed is still relatively low. Earthquake insurance, 
federal disaster aid programs and special loan programs for distressed 
borrowers are also expected to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Federal, which is contacting each of its 15,000 mortgage borrowers in 
quake-affected areas, said only about 1% of its single-unit and small-apartment 
owner-borrowers sustained serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised, because with the density of the population, I think it could 
have been much worse," Executive Vice President William J. Birch said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Great Western Bank, the earthquake is not a "material event" in terms of 
its financial impact, according to spokesman Ian Campbell, whose view was 
echoed by California Federal Bank in Los Angeles and Fidelity Federal Bank in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the unlikely event that all the 4,300 houses and apartment buildings 
thought to be seriously damaged end up in foreclosure, they would still 
represent only a fraction of the 60,000 foreclosures initiated in Los Angeles 
County last year, said Dale Dykema, president of TD Service Financial Corp. in 
Orange, a nationwide firm that assists lenders with foreclosures.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a situation where, for the most part, lenders are going to work with 
people who have suffered from the earthquake," Dykema said. "No. 2, the 
problems statistically are not going to be very severe."  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Dykema and others say some foreclosures are inevitable, 
particularly among owners who refinanced or bought their homes since property 
values peaked in 1990 and who have since seen their home equity wiped out by 
falling values. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those owners are simply going to walk away from their houses, Dykema 
predicted, rather than take out a new loan to fix them. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Paine Webber analyst Gary Gordon, the quake's longer-term implications 
are more critical than the number of actual mortgage defaults. "My guess is, it 
will cause some problems and might suggest to some people to get out," Gordon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 DRI/McGraw-Hill, a research firm that follows the construction industry, says 
the earthquake will damage the Southern California economy because insurance 
reimbursements and direct federal assistance will fall far short of covering 
the cost of the damages.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents will have to dig into their savings, resulting in a "loss of wealth" 
for area residents, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now at least, the financial damage is expected to be contained because 
of aid programs set up to help property owners. Low-interest loans from the 
Small Business Administration of up to $100,000 are available to homeowners who 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Those whose incomes are not high enough to qualify for SBA loans are eligible 
for Federal Emergency Management Agency grants that pay rent at another 
residence. Spokesmen for both programs say the agencies are trying to process 
applications and disburse money within seven to 10 days of receipt of the 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 Also mitigating lenders' potential losses is the fact that an unusually high 
percentage of Los Angeles area homeowners -- 25% or more -- have earthquake 
insurance -- even though the deductibles on those policies are generally quite 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders are also offering concessions, mainly in the form of deferred mortgage 
payments, to distressed borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The offers include deferments of up to three months of mortgage payments with 
no late fees, though the deferred amount is typically due in full once payments 
resume. Conscious of a delicate public relations issue, lenders rushed to 
publish full-page newspaper ads explaining the loan deferrals against a 
background of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 But quake victim Jim Pearson, a real estate agent whose Sherman Oaks house 
sustained $40,000 in damages, and others claim the offers are not flexible 
enough.  
</P>
<P>
 Pearson says he tried and failed to persuade Bank of America to restructure 
his $390,000 mortgage. He wanted to add the deferred payments to the end of his 
loan, instead of at the end of the three-month grace period.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big PR campaign to say, 'Look at us, we are a big company and we are 
helping people.' I think it's a scam and unfair," Pearson said. BofA and other 
lenders insist their efforts are sincere but note that not all loans can be 
modified.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the loan deferments, BofA and others are offering customers 
extended limits on personal lines of credit. Most banks and thrifts are also 
allowing depositors to withdraw time deposits without penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Dykema's clients have asked him to postpone all foreclosure sales for 
at least a month, partly out of sympathy for quake victims and partly, he said, 
because some lenders "don't particularly care to take properties back that have 
no value to them."

 Arco Will Slow Its Oil Hunt in Alaska in 1994: Atlantic Richfield Co.'s 
$1.9-billion capital spending budget for the new year reflects a decline in the 
amount of money set aside for petroleum exploration in Alaska, where the 
company produces two-thirds of its oil.In 1993, Arco spent $415 million 
drilling wells to evaluate earlier discoveries at Kuvlum, on the North Slope, 
and at the Sunfish site in Cook Inlet. Both areas yielded disappointing 
results. This year, Arco will spend $300 million to drill in the state.

 Chevron Chemical Co. to Cut 475 Jobs: The reductions amount to a tenth of the 
work force at oil giant Chevron Corp.'s chemical division and are to occur over 
the next three years, mostly from operations the company is closing or selling. 
About 345 of the positions are with operations scheduled for shutdown or 
sale.About 110 of the remaining 130 job cuts will come from offices in San 
Ramon, Calif., with the rest coming from other cities. San Francisco-based 
Chevron Corp. reported that its fourth-quarter profit fell 73% because of 
onetime charges, mostly to pay for bonuses to employees and reassessment of its 
crude oil holdings. The company earned $294 million, or 91 cents a share, for 
the October-December quarter, compared to $1.09 billion, or $3.30 a share, for 
the last three months of 1992.

 GM Posts Record Sales in Latin America: The auto maker said sales rose 28% in 
1993 to 402,000 vehicles, the most in any year since 1980. "Despite the 
onslaught of new competition in the region . . . GM's market share in Latin 
America, at 18%, was about even with 1992, and it remains the area of GM's 
highest (foreign) market penetration," said Richard C. Nerod, General Motors 
Corp. vice president for Latin America, Africa and the Middle East.

 Senate Bill Aims to Stop Mutual Savings Bank Abuses: Democratic and Republican 
leaders of the Senate Banking Committee introduced the legislation, intended to 
keep directors and officers of mutual savings banks from taking excessive 
profits when such depositor-owned institutions are converted to stockholder 
ownership. A similar bill in the House of Representatives, introduced two 
months ago, would be less restrictive than the Senate version. The Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. has proposed guidelines for mutual savings bank 
conversions, but they have been criticized as not strict enough.

PARENT OF GAS CO. SETTLES SHAREHOLDER SUITS; COURTS: CASES WERE FILED AFTER 
PACIFIC ENTERPRISES SUSPENDED DIVIDENDS DURING ILL-FATED DIVERSIFICATION 
ATTEMPT. 
</P>

 In another move to close out its disastrous attempt at diversification in the 
1980s, Pacific Enterprises Inc., parent of Southern California Gas Co., 
announced Wednesday that it has settled two class-action lawsuits filed in 1992 
by angry shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The $45-million settlement includes a $17-million payment from Pacific 
Enterprises and undisclosed amounts from Deloitte & Touche, the company's 
auditors, as well as unnamed insurers that indemnified the company under a 
directors and officers liability insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting these lawsuits behind us now removes the uncertainty, cost burden and 
management diversion" of a jury trial, Pacific Enterprises Chairman and Chief 
Executive Willis B. Wood Jr. said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement will not affect the financial position or dividend of Pacific 
Enterprises or the gas company, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're satisfied with the settlement," said Len Simon, a partner at Milberg, 
Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach in San Diego who worked on the plaintiffs' case. 
"It's a lot of money to receive without undergoing the risks of trial." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement terms must still be accepted by Judge J. Spencer Letts of U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles, who will consider the agreement March 28. If 
Letts approves, the plaintiffs' law firm will mail claim forms to shareholders 
and brokerage houses that have dealt in the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits were filed after Pacific Enterprises announced in February, 1992, 
suspension of its stock dividend and a drastic restructuring of the company, 
including sale of its non-utility businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, under then-Chief Executive James R. Ukropina, who resigned in 
December, 1991, Pacific Enterprises launched an acquisition drive that the 
company said would counterbalance -- and make it less dependent upon -- its 
regulated utility business, as well as provide more opportunities for growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The company bought and has since sold the Thrifty Drug chain, Big 5 Sporting 
Goods and three smaller retail chains. In 1990, it also moved into offices in 
the new Library Tower in Downtown Los Angeles that were criticized as 
extravagant by shareholders and the gas company's unions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suits, shareholders had charged that Pacific Enterprises management had 
failed to adequately disclose its acquisition plans "and, even more important," 
plaintiff attorney Simon said, "how badly they were doing" with the new 
companies.

 Spectrum Acknowledges It Is Under SEC Probe: Spectrum Information Technologies 
confirmed that it is the target of a Securities and Exchange Commission 
investigation relating to statements company executives made about the value of 
patent license agreements. The wireless communications company made the 
admission one day after John Sculley, Spectrum's chairman, told the Dow Jones 
News Service there was no such probe.Spectrum claims basic patents on key 
cellular communications technologies. President Peter Caserta said in May that 
the company's licensing agreement with AT&T would be worth "hundreds of 
millions of dollars," but AT&T has disputed that. Sculley on Tuesday also 
denied reports that he would be leaving Spectrum. He joined the company in 
October, after having made his name as chairman of Apple Computer Inc.

EARNINGS: GLENDALE FEDERAL LOSES $39.8 MILLION; COAST SAVINGS ALSO HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hurt by declining loan revenue, Glendale Federal Bank reported a $39.8-million 
loss for its second quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a loss of $79.4 million 
for the same period in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Also hit was Coast Savings Financial, the parent of Coast Federal Bank, which 
reported that fourth-quarter earnings declined to $3.7 million from $24 million 
in the fourth quarter of 1992. For the full year, Coast's profit was $17.2 
million, down 67% from $48 million in 1992. The 1992 results included a onetime 
tax benefit of $19.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At Glendale Federal, continued losses have drained its core capital, which is 
now only $29 million above the minimum required by federal regulators, raising 
doubts about its ability to survive if the current level of losses continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Glendale Federal says it expects income to improve shortly and that it 
will sell assets if necessary to raise more capital, some analysts expressed 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are only $29 million over capital requirements and losing $40 
million a quarter, that doesn't leave a lot of leeway," Gareth Plank of Mabon 
Securities said. "The earthquake will bring in continued collateral questions 
that make me a little nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Fed, which recently raised $451 million in capital in the securities 
markets to avert a federal seizure, said net interest income -- revenue from 
loans and other assets minus interest paid to depositors -- declined 22% from 
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months ended Dec. 31, Glendale Federal's loss totaled $59.7 
million, compared to a loss of $96.2 million over the same two quarters in 
1992. Glendale Federal has assets of $18 billion and 216 branches in 
California, Washington and Florida.  
</P>
<P>
 Coast, which has $8.1 billion in assets and 88 branches in California, 
continued to boost its loan quality. Non-performing assets declined for the 
11th consecutive quarter to $220 million, or 2.7% of assets. That was down from 
$319 million, or 3.8% of assets at Dec. 31, 1992.

SCOTT PAPER TO CUT ANOTHER 25% OF ITS JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Paper Co. announced its third restructuring in four years Wednesday, 
saying it will cut another quarter of its work force to try to bring costs in 
line with those of competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 With the plans to cut 8,300 jobs, Scott joined other big manufacturers and 
consumer products companies that have made drastic payroll cuts and closed 
factories recently in hopes of catching up with more productive rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts, through a combination of layoffs and voluntary retirements, will 
reduce Scott's payroll to 24,700 from 33,000 within two to three years. About 
4,500 of the 8,300 cuts will be in foreign operations and affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will take a $381-million restructuring charge after taxes, 
leaving a net loss for the three months ended Dec. 25 of $370.3 million, or 
$5.01 per share. During the same period in 1992, the company made $44.8 
million, or 61 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales fell 6% to $1.2 billion, from $1.28 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had told us they were going to take a charge, but I would say that the 
magnitude of the charge was larger than expected and the reduction in head 
count was certainly larger than expected," said Chip Dillon, a paper and forest 
products analyst with Salomon Bros. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year, Scott reported a loss of $277 million, or $3.75 a share, on 
sales of $4.75 billion. Excluding the restructuring charge and other special 
charges, the company said it earned $117.6 million, or $1.58 a share. In 1992, 
Scott made $167.2 million, or $2.26 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales fell to $4.75 billion from $5.09 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott shares surged $2.125 to $45.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

EARNINGS: PHILIP MORRIS' PROFIT PLUNGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Philip Morris Cos. tallied the damage from the Year of the Cigarette Price War 
and confirmed the battle's heavy toll on its earnings, but expressed optimism 
about its chances for a rebound. The New York-based tobacco and food 
conglomerate, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, Velveeta cheese products, Oscar 
Mayer meats and Miller beer, said its profit tumbled 71.7% in the fourth 
quarter and 37.4% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 It cited lower domestic tobacco sales, a huge charge for closing plants and 
work force reductions, and a big accounting change. 
</P>
<P>
 For the three months ended Dec. 31, Philip Morris earned $339 million, or 38 
cents a share, down from $1.2 billion, or $1.34 a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue slipped 1.4% to $14.7 billion from $14.9 billion in the fourth quarter 
of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest results reflected a $741-million pretax charge for the 
restructuring, which reduced earnings after taxes by $457 million. Excluding 
the restructuring charge, its earnings were down 33%. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year, Philip Morris earned $3.09 billion, or $3.52 a share, down from 
$4.94 billion, or $5.45 a share, in 1992. Revenue for the year rose 3% to $60.9 
billion from $59.1 billion in 1992.

KODAK UNVEILS CHANGES IN BASIC FILM LINE; PHOTOGRAPHY: GENERICS AND OTHERS HAVE 
CUT INTO THE COMPANY'S PROFITS. 
</P>

<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. is changing its consumer film product line, adding a 
discount brand and changing its Gold and Ektar labels in hopes of fighting 
competitors who undercut its prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak said Wednesday that it will reformulate the top-of-the-line Ektar film 
and rename it Royal Gold. Kodak Gold will also be reformulated and repackaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The discount film, called Funtime, will be offered during fall and spring, 
when sales are traditionally slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak devised the strategy to encourage sometime buyers of its film to become 
more loyal to the brand. The company's profit margins have been slipping, 
partly due to pricing competition from generic brands as well as from Fuji 
Film, Konica and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The company announced its plans at a news conference at which it also 
introduced 30 new products, including cameras with flash attachments designed 
to reduce "red eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak also demonstrated computer kiosks that allow customers to add graphics 
and text to photos. They will be deployed to retailers later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock closed up 50 cents at $43 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts gave the strategy on film brands mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way to differentiate without antagonizing customers," said Sharon 
Dorsey Wagoner, an analyst at Argus Research. "This should be a positive for 
Kodak, customers and retailers." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think that's going to help their numbers," said Alex Henderson, 
an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. "The basic problem is their prices are 
too high and people can come in underneath them and still make a profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Wasilov, Kodak's general manager and vice president of U.S. marketing for 
consumer brands, said the strategy fits the way research shows consumers 
approach film. They're willing to pay for higher-quality film for special 
events, such as holidays, weddings and graduations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak will roll out a new advertising campaign for the 
Gold line during the Winter Olympics, suggesting that people buy it because 
they never know when a "Kodak moment" will come along. Ads for the Royal Gold 
line will say it is the best choice for special occasions and enlargements. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will not advertise Funtime, which will be available in just two 
speeds and sold in early spring and early fall. It will cost about 20% less 
than the Gold line, Wasilov said.

 Republic Chief Confirms He Is Leaving: Russell Goldsmith confirmed a report, 
published in The Times, that he will leave the company soon rather than run the 
combined Republic Pictures and Spelling Entertainment when the two companies 
are merged in a few weeks. Goldsmith said he will continue to serve as a 
consultant to video rental giant Blockbuster Entertainment, which will control 
the merged companies. Goldsmith is leaving in the wake of Blockbuster's 
$8.4-billion merger with Viacom Inc. A Republic spokeswoman said Goldsmith 
plans to work at the company until the merger is completed.

 Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s results improved in the fourth quarter, but much 
of its effort to cut costs was offset by lower crude prices, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based firm reported a net income of $57 million, or 15 cents a 
share, in the three months ended Dec. 31.A year earlier, the company lost $588 
million, or $1.94 a share. Sales fell to $2.02 billion from $2.315 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The net income figures for both periods were skewed by one-time gains and 
losses associated with getting out of the coal business. 
</P>
<P>
 For the full year, Occidental reported net income of $283 million, or 80 cents 
a share, on sales of $8.12 billion. In 1992, the company lost $594 million, or 
$1.97 a share, on sales of $8.49 billion.

COMPAQ TO USE AMD'S CLONE OF INTEL'S 486 MICROPROCESSOR CHIP IN SOME OF ITS 
PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a blow to Intel Corp., Compaq Computer Corp. said Wednesday that it picked 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. as an additional source for microprocessor 
components. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-tier personal computer makers have stayed away from AMD for fear of 
getting tangled in the legal battles between Intel and AMD. Intel, the world's 
largest independent maker of microprocessors, and AMD have traded several 
lawsuits to determine if AMD has the right to copy Intel's best-selling 486 
family of microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston-based Compaq said Wednesday that with AMD as a supplier in addition to 
Intel, Compaq has the flexibility to deliver a greater range of computer 
products "with the right combination of price, performance and features." 
</P>
<P>
 "Intel remains our primary microprocessor supplier and a strategic partner of 
Compaq, and they will continue to provide the majority of microprocessors for 
Compaq computers," said John Rose, senior vice president and general manager of 
Compaq's desktop PC division. "However, AMD and Intel each offer unique 
combinations of features, price and performance not available from the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "By working with them both, we can -- over the long term -- more likely 
deliver a computer that meets the specific needs of every consumer and business 
customer," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 AMD shares gained 62.5 cents to $20.625 while Intel fell $1.375 to $63.625. 
Compaq lost $2.125 to $81.125. 
</P>
<P>
 AMD said initial shipments to Compaq of its 486 microprocessors will begin in 
the current quarter. Compaq computers using AMD chips can be expected in the 
first half of the year, Compaq said. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Compaq Computer Corp. said it earned $151 million in the fourth 
quarter, a 70% jump from a year earlier, as sales climbed around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is one of just a handful of PC makers to improve both market share 
and profitability in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-largest maker of personal computers earned $1.74 per share in the 
three months ending Dec. 31. A year earlier, Compaq earned $89 million, or 
$1.11 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales were $2.2 billion, up 54.7% from $1.4 billion a year ago.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: WAKING UP TO THOSE CALORIE COUNTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each year, in early January, I start dreaming about moving to the Midwest -- 
at least the Midwest of my imagination. That's the place where people eat foods 
filled with cream cheese and butter all the time, not just during the holidays. 
Every day is fried chicken day. And it would be considered an affront to refuse 
the mashed potatoes and that really white, viscous, 40-weight gravy. 
</P>
<P>
 In my calorie-laden dream town, everybody pretty much looks like the mashed 
potatoes, but nobody cares. Life is just an endless series of potluck dinners 
and company picnics, with all of us tucking into Parker rolls with one hand 
while we adjust the elastic waistband on our stretch pants with the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I wake up and find I'm back in the land of much sun and little clothing. 
And thoughts of barbells replace visions of meatloaf. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, I surfaced from my reverie to find Bill Locey standing by to pitch 
me a story. Locey, who writes the weekly Night Life column in Ventura County 
Life, knows his way around an exercise machine about as well as he knows his 
way around a local club. 
</P>
<P>
 A while back, he realized he was spending too much of his time in one of two 
positions: seated or prone. That is when he decided to throw down his fork and 
get into shape. Who better to write this week's cover story, an annotated guide 
to the gyms of Ventura County? 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years ago, I started riding my bike everywhere and I joined a 
gym," Locey said. "I've lost 20 pounds since then, and I've kept it off." 
</P>
<P>
 So why did Locey, who belongs to one of the gyms listed in today's story, 
decide to join the one he did? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it involves a 14-mile bike trip from home and it is close to the 
office," he said. "Like I said in the story, territoriality is a principle 
reason for choosing a gym. Most of the people I talked to seemed to join gyms 
that were near their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 And many others, according to local fitness experts, tend to lose interest in 
the gym within minutes of joining one; regular attendance is quite low at some 
of the county's gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 Locey, who says he works out at his gym at least three times a week, is 
convinced this will not happen to him -- he's hooked on exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be," he said. "I drink too much beer. Otherwise, I would weigh 300 
pounds and look like Meatloaf." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he have to mention meatloaf?

SIGHTS; SCULPTURE BRINGS AN AIR OF LEVITY TO STAID PUBLIC SETTING; BILL 
MCEWEN'S LOOMING STRUCTURE OF IRREGULAR ORGANIC SHAPES OFFERS 'SLY HUM OF 
IRONY' AT THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 News of the unveiling of a public sculpture often elicits yawns, at best; 
cynical smirks, at worst. There is nothing inherently suspect about art in 
public places, or the possibilities thereof. But when it comes to art made 
public, and at least semi-permanent, what tends to get approval is work that 
has been deemed safe and decent for general consumption by the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 And the general public can be infamous for fearing infamy. 
</P>
<P>
 But something funny and intriguing happened last week outside the Ventura 
County Government Center, where Bill McEwen's spindly and looming new piece was 
officially welcomed to the entrance of the courtyard area. McEwen's gangly 
steel creation, far from being generic, brings levity and individuality to a 
utilitarian, often authoritarian, property. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no pithy euphemism for a title here: The plaque reads, with an almost 
comical artspeak literalness, "Organic Form, Activity at Transition Points, 
Defined Space." That it is, and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 A bundle of contrasts and contradictions, McEwen's work embraces 
discontinuity, but also disguises its rebellious intentions. Irregular organic 
shapes, such as a fragmented tree or animal limbs, form the sculpture's base. 
But its dramatic height is scaled by more symmetrical, industrially rendered 
poles, set at an angle. 
</P>
<P>
 These two varied elements are joined with a seeming precariousness by loosely 
wrapped cables. The poles teeter, as if verging on collapse. From the haphazard 
look of it, you wouldn't want to be nearby in the event of an earthquake. But 
subtle welding joints assure its stability. 
</P>
<P>
 At root, McEwen's piece is a subversion of the tradition of heroic and 
monumental sculptures placed out of begrudging obligation to the arts. The tall 
cylinder, ascending 30 feet, resembles a flag pole -- appropriately enough, for 
a place of official, government-related business -- or a ship's mast. 
</P>
<P>
 All it lacks is vertical solidity, or the other typical aspects and cliches of 
formal rectitude. A sly hum of irony envelopes it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Organic Form..." has all the right accouterments to be just another pleasant 
excursion in public art. A surrounding flower bed gives it a colorful home. A 
concrete base announces its status as an artwork worth looking at. It is placed 
in a key spot, flanked by the three wings of the Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But, instead of being just another inert sculptural ornament, McEwen's piece 
turns out to be the best and wittiest example of public art the county can 
presently call its own. Activity at transition points, indeed. T.O. POTPOURRI 
</P>
<P>
 The first show of the year at the Thousand Oaks Community Gallery is a 
mixed-bag. The four artists share little common ground, except that they 
definitely qualify as contenders under the show's title, "All Things Under 
Heaven." Here, African elephants, Dante-fied figurines, equestrian abstractions 
and Orient-loric screens are the reference points under said heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Although curiously lacking basic information about the titles of works or the 
artists behind them, the show has an unfinished, strangely scattershot 
appearance. But closer examination reveals some admirable artistic ideas at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture of Karen Coburn ranges from straight-postured Robert Graham-like 
nudes, at best, to a series of figures illustrating moral attributes taken from 
Dante's "The Divine Comedy." There, any sense of free-standing artwork gives 
way to literary reference. 
</P>
<P>
 In 2- and 3-D, Lyla Fernandes Paakkaanen's lavishly painted screens, fanning 
out accordion fashion, come decorated with serpents and other free-flowing 
exotica. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Mason-Sica's "Vanishing" series takes as its subject African 
elephants, which, as her statement reads, "are symbolic of all the things that 
we humans are systematically destroying in our greed and shortsightedness." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not the symbolic resonance rings true, her finely detailed graphite 
pieces show skill and playful compositional approaches. On the gallery's floor 
sits a sculptural shrine to the elephant, a gathering of bones and tusks with a 
garland. 
</P>
<P>
 But the drawings themselves are more clever than mournful, as she lionizes her 
elephants by blending their ears with the form of the African continent and 
placing them on ethereal backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of background vs. foreground becomes a central conceit of the 
"Horsescapes" of Randy Osherow, the finest work in the show. As if representing 
a sort of cheeky cowboy minimalism, Osherow's equestrian images are deceptive, 
looking from a distance like monochromatic panels.

 Straight, realistic renderings of horses appear discreetly, tucked along the 
bottom of the frames. Pieces of leathery, unstretched canvas behind plexiglass 
are thickly painted, mostly in one color. 
</P>
<P>
 Tactile skeins and ridges add to the surface texture, underpainted with 
markings that suggest either brands of ranches or equations out of a physics 
class. The result is a strangely poetic convergence of ideas on a theme. 
Agrarian and aesthetic elements meet and find a way to get along.

NIGHT LIFE: IF THERE ARE JUST 3 GUYS, HOW COME 1 OF THEM IS NAMED 13?; THIS AND 
OTHER MUSICAL QUESTIONS MAY BE ANSWERED WHEN SAN PEDRO'S CONSTANT LLAMA 
PERFORMS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 San Pedro's Constant Llama is a band that consists of a couple of Joes and a 
guy who sounds like he fell off a personalized license plate. Joe Jones sings 
and hits the drums; Joe Dean sings and plays bass while Tom 13 sings and plays 
lead guitar. Tom 13? Maybe Bob Seger was more prophetic than he knew in his 
"Feel Like A Number" song. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant Llama plays very tight, three-minute, hook-filled rock songs. You can 
hear them Wednesday night when they play at the Midnight Hour in Ventura. Their 
new CD, "Will Play for Food," contains songs about Rodney King, the hole in the 
ozone, and the inevitable and endless fiasco with Ms. Wrong. Best, however, is 
a self-explanatory no-brainer, "Stick It in the Middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from their groovy practice site in San Pedro, the Llamas discussed 
their band, which is named after a South American ruminant. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened to the first 12 Toms? 
</P>
<P>
 13: They were killed in a meat grinder accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones: Naw, he's really got a 13-inch foot; there's 13 letters in Constant 
Llama, and he was born on the 13th day of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Right. So who's to blame for the name Constant Llama? 
</P>
<P>
 Dean: It was made up spontaneously during a van trip. A llama is a beast of 
burden whose consistency is the key. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a San Pedro scene? 
</P>
<P>
 13: Sure, there's some cool bands. The Del Rubio Triplets are from San Pedro; 
so were the Minutemen. There's a cool coffeehouse scene here. 
</P>
<P>
 So the band hits the road a lot? 
</P>
<P>
 13: You have to play as much as you can as often as you can. Never say no to a 
gig. We've been as far north as Northern California and as far east as Las 
Vegas and Phoenix. We go until our money runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of local Ventura bands think they need to go to L.A. to play. Do they? 
</P>
<P>
 Jones: No. Stay where you are. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean: I think it's good to go to L.A. just to see what the other bands are 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 13: There's a lot of cool places to play, but I don't think you should wait to 
be discovered. In L.A., everyone tries to figure out the newest fad. For a 
while, it was Metallica, then the Chili Peppers; but I think you have to just 
do your own thing. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you think Constant Llama music sounds like? 
</P>
<P>
 Jones: It's a psycho country thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean: As the newest member, I look at it from an outsider's perspective, and I 
think it's sort of a San Pedro SST sort of thing. I don't mean the punk stuff 
on SST Records, but more like their country stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 13: We like to claim everything. I have a lot of country influences while Joe 
drummed for a heavy metal band. So I see us as a country/psycho/space music 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 Why a trio? 
</P>
<P>
 Jones: There's lots of reasons, but mostly, it's easier when we get paid plus 
we can all fit in one car. There's other cool trios such as ZZ Top, the 
Minutemen, Firehose and the Meat Puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 Is "Will Play For Food" the only CD? 
</P>
<P>
 Jones: We have a bunch of four-song tapes, but only one CD. We actually did 
play for food last night. We played at UC Irvine for four pizzas. We've done 
that quite a few times. 
</P>
<P>
 So I take it there's no day jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 13: We dabble a bit in various things. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones: I don't work, so the coolest thing about being in the band is that it 
gives me something to do that day. Otherwise, I'd probably be a really good 
surfer. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the band get started? 
</P>
<P>
 13: My girlfriend -- she's my wife now -- introduced me to Joe at a gig at 
Fender's Ballroom in Long Beach in 1988. It turned out we only lived two blocks 
apart. I was looking for a drummer and he was looking for something. We got our 
first gig after the first night of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones: Yeah, you've heard all those stories about how Led Zeppelin clicked at 
their first practice. It was the same with us. We had our own little style, and 
it was just flowing. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does Constant Llama get signed? 
</P>
<P>
 Jones: We're more interested in putting out our music, and just getting out 
there to play. We don't have to wait for someone else to get excited because 
we're already excited about our music. There's going to be a Minutemen tribute 
album coming out soon with a lot of established bands on it. We're going to 
have a song on it too. 
</P>
<P>
 Your bio sheet lists a lot of radio stations that play your stuff. How does an 
unsigned band get on the radio? 
</P>
<P>
 Jones: Usually, we just approach the music director and basically just do it 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a basic Llama fan? 
</P>
<P>
 13: That's hard to say. Our crowd is usually friendly and easygoing -- no 
posers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones: A lot of flannel and a lot of hair, that's us. Everyone is getting into 
flannel, but people have been wearing flannel in San Pedro for 20 years.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: SPAGHETTI WESTERN SERVES UP FRESH, DANCEABLE MIX OF SOUNDS; 
THE BAND, WHICH IS COMING TO VENTURA, SINGS THE PRAISES OF TRUCKERS AND 
GOOD-HEARTED WOMEN.

<P>
 You never can tell what you might find in bowling alleys, or "entertainment 
centers," as they're now calling themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 I was club-hopping three weeks ago and discovered a nice surprise in Goleta's 
Galleon Room, inside the Orchid Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on weekends, the line dancing isn't as feverish as it is at the City Line 
Club or Red Dog Saloon in neighboring Santa Barbara. Many folks come just to 
hear the band, so the floor is open for two-steppers. And the Galleon Room is a 
smaller, more intimate club than its two competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was nice to escape the overly familiar sets played elsewhere as I found 
myself dancin' and romancin' with my fella to songs by Spaghetti Western that 
extol the virtues of truckers and good-hearted, forgiving women. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers who haven't traveled up the coast to dance may not know this band, 
since they play mostly at the Galleon Room, City Line and Red Dog. But now you 
won't have to go farther than the Ventura Concert Theatre to catch their fresh, 
danceable music and harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be opening for Carlene Carter on Feb. 19. And they are ready -- 
complete with their own T-shirts (designed by the lead vocalist's 15-year-old 
son) and a new tape of 14 original songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what the group's founder, Joe Ferrario, had to say between aftershocks 
during a recent phone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spaghetti Western" is a catchy name. Where'd you get it? 
</P>
<P>
 We took that from the old Clint Eastwood movies like "The Good, the Bad, and 
the Ugly" and "A Fistful of Dollars." A couple of us are Italian. Besides me, 
there's our lead vocalist, Frank Sunseri. And there's Kenny Warren, lead guitar 
and honorary Italian. The three of us started the band in the summer of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Describe your sound. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not your typical Nashville pretty-boy glam band. We try to have fun when 
we play, and we have no hypocrisy about being a human jukebox for the dancers. 
I'd call us a contemporary country band with a little of the old stuff thrown 
in -- the honky-tonk, Buck Owens sound, sort of like what Dwight Yoakam does. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the lineup? 
</P>
<P>
 We don't have keyboards. Two guitars (Sunseri and Warren), bass (Ferrario), 
drums (Art Meckauer) and steel (Randy Maseda) is all we really need. Kenny also 
plays mandolin. And we're just now breaking in a female singer, Jill Miles, who 
plays guitar and sings some backup and leads to enhance the harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell us about the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 All 14 songs are originals. And we hope to have it out in stores in Santa 
Barbara in about six weeks. Musically, it's selected more like a demo tape. But 
I would say it's good for listening and dancing. We're calling our own little 
homespun record company Bent Records. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape is named after one of the songs Frank wrote called, "For a Fistful of 
Pasta." It's a fast, humorous two-step about this guy who's craving pasta and 
sitting with an empty bowl in front of him. There's a fly doin' a backstroke in 
his beer and the garlic toast is as hard as his wife's brassiere. And the 
chorus is: "For a fistful of pasta, I would kill. In this world there ain't one 
thing pasta can't heal. For a fistful of pasta I would die. Take my dog, my 
wife, my best friend too. Just hit me with some Ragu." 
</P>
<P>
 Does anybody want to claim credit for that? 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny, Frank and I are the main songwriters. We have been playing in various 
bands together on and off since the mid-1970s. Musically, we've done 
everything, from country back then, then rock 'n' roll, Top 40 and funky R&B. 
Of course, we'd like a record or publishing deal. We all have day jobs. . . . 
It would be nice to make a living off our music."

THEATER REVIEW; MAMET AMUSES BUT LEAVES 'EM GUESSING; IN 'THE WOODS,' A 
PUZZLING RELATIONSHIP PROGRESSES TO MUTUAL ANTAGONISM AND HOSTILITY. THE 
LITERARY SMALL TALK IS INTRIGUING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Trying to describe the first act of David Mamet's "The Woods" is like 
crotchety Morley Safer condemning contemporary art on "60 Minutes": "Why can't 
he paint a nice flower?" "Why don't his women look like women?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of "The Woods," in production at the Santa Paula Theater Center, 
the questions might include "Who are these people?" "Where's the plot?" and 
"Why should we care about them if they don't even care about each other?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of Act I, the question isn't what will happen in Act II, but will 
anything happen in Act II? 
</P>
<P>
 So how, then, to communicate that Mamet's play is often great fun, certainly 
entertaining, and like nothing that's been seen in Ventura County since the 
Santa Paulans presented "Waiting for Godot" nearly two years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 Like "Godot," "The Woods" -- first produced in 1977, one year after Mamet's 
"Sexual Perversity in Chicago" and five years before his breakthrough 
"Glengarry Glen Ross" -- is quite different from conventional theater, and a 
bit oblique. Unlike "Godot," anybody can follow it easily, though some may find 
more layers of depth than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick (Taylor Kasch) and Ruth (Krista Bakula) are off for a couple of days at 
Nick's lakeside cabin. They've recently become lovers (Ruth's word), and are 
taking the time to discover each other. 
</P>
<P>
 What the audience learns, early on, is that the two have little if anything in 
common: He's dyspeptic, probably misogynistic and from all appearances, a 
loner; she's superficial and talkative -- bubbly to the point of popping. When 
he asks her to shut up, she would like to oblige him, but can't. When he asks 
her, later on, "Why did you come here?" many in the audience will pondering the 
same question. Somehow, that she's attractive and enthusiastic about this 
romance isn't quite enough. And what does she see in him, other than the 
opportunity to make him over? 
</P>
<P>
 In Act I, the two exchange small talk; so small that it makes the dialogue in 
an episode of "Seinfeld" sound like Greek philosophy. Further, they do so in a 
speech pattern that never lets you forget they're reading lines: The words are 
literary, repetitive and rife with clipped phrases and pregnant pauses. It's 
maddening until you get used to it, at which point it becomes, to say the 
least, intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 The small talk continues in Act II. "Larvae are really eggs," he tells her, 
inaccurately. "I know that," she replies, lying. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship shifts, from her trying to please an indifferent him, to 
mutual antagonism and hostility that eventually results in (shall we say) 
excitement. While curt, Hemingwayesque dialogue continues throughout, the 
stream of foul language identified with Mamet plays doesn't appear until Act 
III (don't worry, the acts are brief), when it spews from both mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasch, Bakula and director Lena Frederick all commute from Ojai. He was last 
seen at Santa Paula in last year's "Blithe Spirit." The others are making 
welcome debuts with the company, now under the administration of artistic 
director David Ralphe. 
</P>
<P>
 Both performances are strong and assured, and Frederick's direction keeps the 
difficult play on a sure course. Also of note is the way that Frederick and set 
designer Jeff Garcia have turned the Santa Paula Theater Center "backstage" 
area into a thrust-stage theater of approximately 50 seats. In this case, it's 
a "thrust" stage in part because the actors are practically sitting in the 
front rows. Larry C. Wright has come up with some nice sound effects. 
</P>
<P>
 While clearly not for everybody, "The Woods" may appeal to more people than 
one might expect. For one thing, it's a great play to bring a date to -- you'll 
be discussing it for some time afterward. More important, presenting Mamet in 
Ventura County is another important cultural step. It gives the local audience 
credit for craving something with a bit more bite than Neil Simon. Details

WORDS & IMAGES: WORKSHOPS TO EXPLORE PUBLISHING FOR KIDS; SEMINARS WILL TRACE 
HOW BOOK IS PRODUCED -- FROM IDEA TO PUBLICATION. CHILDREN WILL TELL WRITERS 
WHAT THEY LIKE TO READ.

 If you've been wondering about how to pursue the art and craft of writing and 
illustrating books for children, pencil in the following workshops and 
seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 Two award-winning experts in the field, Jody Fickes of "Adventures for Kids" 
and author/illustrator Robin Rector Krupp will preside over the third annual 
"Creating and Sharing Children's Literature" seminar. Recommended for 8- to 
14-year-olds and their parents, the seminar will include a demonstration of how 
a book is produced from idea to publication by Robin Krupp, whose books include 
"Get Set to Wreck," "Let's Go Traveling" and "The Comet and You," written with 
her husband E.C. Krupp, director of Griffith Observatory. Fickes will involve 
the audience in a discussion of how families can enjoy books together, and 
writers will learn firsthand from the children what they like to read. It all 
happens from 9 to 11:30 a.m. Saturday in Guthrie Hall, Ventura College, 4667 
Telegraph Road. The fee is $6 a person. Call Margaret Gosfield at 652-7229 for 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 The following Saturday, Feb. 5, also at Ventura College, Joan Prestine will 
conduct workshops on "How to Write Children's Picture Books for Fun and Profit" 
from 9 a.m. to noon, followed by "How to Find a Publisher for a Children's 
Book" from 1 to 4 p.m. Each session costs $35. Call 654-6459 for registration 
information. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Literary toilers continue to insist that writers are a creative lot and should 
not have to concern themselves with marketing their work. They distance 
themselves from the business of publishing, which leads to failure and 
rejection. "This is a problem for many writers," says free-lance journalist 
Patricia Fry, who will conduct a class on "The Business of Writing Nonfiction 
for Publication." The class is aimed at individuals who seek to make a living 
or supplement their income by writing. Fry, an Ojai/Ventura native, has been 
selling to regional and national magazines for 21 years and says 1993 has been 
a great year for her. Her books on local history include "An Illustrated 
History of the Ojai Valley" and "Nordhoff Cemetery: Book One," profiling Ojai 
Valley pioneers who were buried in the cemetery between 1876 and 1900. Her 
"Hints for the Backyard Rider" was published by A.S. Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee is $40 for the four-week class, which begins Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the 
Ojai Art Center, 113 S. Montgomery St. It will cover recognizing article and 
book ideas; developing one subject into several articles; interviewing; 
locating the markets; reprint rights; research techniques; record-keeping and 
taxes. Call 646-3045 for details.

THEATER REVIEW; 'A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE' IS A PASSIONATE FAMILY DRAMA; THE 
ARTHUR MILLER PLAY EXPLORES HOW A LOVE AFFAIR SPARKS CLASS STRIFE AMONG 
SICILIAN IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Opening the Conejo Players' 1994 season is "A View from the Bridge," a '50s 
kitchen-sink drama by Arthur Miller. Perhaps unexpectedly, the play resonates 
strongly 40 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one-third of an unplanned and uncoordinated Arthur Miller Festival taking 
place in Ventura County during the next month or two: the Santa Paula Theater 
Center will present "The Price" next month, and the Camarillo Youth Theater has 
"The Crucible" on deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "A View from the Bridge" takes place among Sicilian immigrants in Brooklyn. 
Eddie Carbone, a longshoreman, is living relatively happily with his wife, 
Beatrice, and niece, Catherine, when two relatives sneak into the United States 
without proper entry papers. Seventeen-year-old Catherine falls in love with 
one of them, and Eddie develops a sudden case of xenophobia. His niece can't 
marry Rodolpho, he says, because "he's not right." 
</P>
<P>
 By "not right," Eddie notes, Rodolpho doesn't look Sicilian: he's blond and 
thin. "If you close a book real fast, you could blow him over." 
</P>
<P>
 For Eddie, apparently, this is really about class (Rodolpho and his brother, 
Marco, are fishermen), and jingoism (they're off a more recent boat than the 
one that brought Eddie and his family to the United States). 
</P>
<P>
 Also involved, though never stated, are Eddie's feelings for Catherine, which 
may be a bit more than paternal. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie tries to chase Rodolpho out of the house. When that doesn't work, he 
phones in an anonymous tip to immigration officials, hoping to have the pair 
deported. That doesn't work either. Then Eddie gets really mad. "I want my 
respect!" he cries. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's play is taut, violent and seethingly passionate under Marianne 
Corney's direction, with exceptional performances by Lou Joffred as the 
explosive, emotionally confused Eddie, and Elizabeth Bauman as the 
unself-consciously sensual Catherine. 
</P>
<P>
 Only slightly less effective because of weak accents are Rodrigo Botero and 
Carmen Mormino as Rodolpho and Marco. Botero may remind some of Chico Marx; 
Bauman sounds like a cross between Edith Bunker and Minnie Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Doreen Zetterlund is fine as Beatrice, and Scott Mansfield is solid as 
attorney-narrator Alfred, Miller's surrogate in the play, who steps in every so 
often to explain things. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Tachco designed the atmospheric set, with art by Dick Johnson. The 
music makes good use of cool jazz and Mills Brothers records. 
</P>
<P>
 When first produced on Broadway in 1955, "A View from the Bridge" was a long 
one-act play, coupled with the briefer "A Memory of Two Mondays." Here, 
"Bridge" is performed in two acts, clocking in at a just-right two hours, with 
"Two Mondays" just a memory. Details

KIDS ON FILM; 'TOMBSTONE' MAKES CRIME LOOK BETTER THAN LOVE; IN "TOMBSTONE," 
GUNSLINGER/LAWMAN WYATT EARP SEEKS A PEACEFUL DOMESTIC RETIREMENT IN THE 
ARIZONA TERRITORY WITH HIS BROTHERS, DOC HOLLIDAY AND ALL THEIR WOMEN, BUT 
FALLS IN LOVE WITH AN ACTRESS, IS FORCED BACK TO PEACEMAKING BY A VIOLENT CRIME 
WAVE AND WINDS UP IN A BLOODY VENDETTA WITH THE BAD GUYS THAT GOES WAY BEYOND 
THE O. K. CORRAL. (RATED R)

<P>
 The prologue to this movie tells us we are about to see "the earliest example 
of organized crime in America." But the violence much more resembles modern-day 
street gangs -- Bloods and Crips in spurs. Massacres inspired by personal 
slights. Drug-related shootings (in this case, opium). Even gang members 
targeted by their attire (in this case, red scarves for the cowboys). 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder kids who weren't raised on Westerns and don't much care for the ones 
they've seen on TV responded to this one. The Old West never seemed so 
familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was great," said Jeffrey Djernaes, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was really great," said his friend Austin Blount, 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exciting," said Lauren Kampff, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 One hopes that this blood-soaked movie was not meant for children, although it 
seemed to draw more than the number usually found in R-rated movies. Some came 
with adults, some without. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin said some parts made him sad, particularly the opening, when an entire 
wedding party is massacred and "when some of the good guys got killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Robison, 13, said she normally doesn't mind seeing shooting as long as 
people are just shot and fall down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to see them suffer," she said. "This was too bloody." 
</P>
<P>
 In this reincarnation, Tombstone is a sort of sin city, with 24-hour gambling, 
drinking and opium. Earp's wife loses herself in laudanum, while Holliday is on 
the verge of death from his excesses throughout the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 In these films, the hero may kill people. But he feels really bad about it. In 
this one, Earp kills countless more cowboys than the three the encyclopedia 
credits him with. But as a thoroughly 1990s antihero, he cries and asks a lot 
of philosophical questions. 
</P>
<P>
 He receives some pop psych and pop poetic answers. Some of these musings might 
be accessible to kids. But when Earp goes on a bloody rampage after his brother 
is killed, Holliday's explanation ("Make no mistake, it's not revenge he's 
after. It's a reckoning.") escaped me, as well as the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger children who can't help but see stories and characters in black and 
white were clear on who was good and who was bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good guys won," Austin declared. "They killed all the bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
 For most, it seemed to be the action that kept their interest for a 
quick-moving two hours and 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kids said they appreciated the acting, particularly Kurt Russell as Earp 
and Val Kilmer as Holliday. "All of them were good," said Marie Mallat, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever kept their interest, it wasn't the love story between Earp and the 
actress -- a romance-novel kind of chemistry between a strong independent woman 
and a tall, dark, semi-articulate stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 "What love story?" Austin asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love story," Marie mused. "Was that another movie?"

JAUNTS; RIDING PROGRAM GIVES VISITORS CLOSE-UP VIEW OF BACK COUNTRY; OJAI 
VALLEY INN HAS OPENED AN EQUESTRIAN CENTER AT AN OLD RANCH. THROUGH MARCH, 
COUNTY RESIDENTS GET A REDUCED RATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who like to see the back country from the back of a horse, there is 
good news out of Ojai. The Ojai Valley Inn has opened a horseback riding 
program with trail rides deep into secluded areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inn took over Rancho Dos Rios, an old ranch near the exclusive hotel, and, 
with extensive renovation, turned it into an equestrian center. It's one of 
just a few places in Ventura County where horse enthusiasts can leave the 
corral and take to the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to give it a try, though, be prepared for some slightly awkward 
logistics. First, the Inn doesn't allow anyone to simply drive to Rancho Dos 
Rios, located on Creek Road below Ojai. You must park at the Inn, board a hotel 
van and be driven the 1.5-mile distance to the ranch, and back afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that the hotel wants to draw local residents, not just hotel 
guests, to the equestrian center, so for awhile Ventura County folks will get a 
break on the trail rides. Ordinarily, the cost is $40 on weekdays and $50 on 
weekends for rides that take up to 90 minutes. But through March at least, the 
fee is $28 for county residents who ride Sunday through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch is in a picturesque setting in Lion Canyon where San Antonio Creek 
meets Lion Creek, hence the name. Looming above are Sulphur and Black 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in the early 1920s, the old white ranch house with its big veranda is 
still there, now occupied by Nina Wiger who manages the ranch. The barns and 
stables, built in the 1930s, are the original structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch has been privately owned and operated through the years, supporting 
agriculture, cattle and horses. Trails crisscross the 800-acre property, and 
one of them, along a creek, is the original route into Ojai from the Ventura 
coast, according to the Inn's Alison Brainard. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Inn opened Rancho Dos Rios last October, it acquired 28 horses, all 
geldings, for its equestrian program, which includes trail rides, as well as 
riding and horsemanship instruction, and carriage and hay rides for hotel 
guests and the public. (The hotel had previously offered horseback riding from 
its grounds, but phased it out seven years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you sign up for a trail ride, don't feel squeamish if your ability is nil. 
First-time riders are welcome, and on one recent Sunday outing, most of the 
seven riders were novices. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the ranch even has a three-step platform for riders to stand on to 
make it easier to mount the horse. Once astride, trail guide Terree Pencak 
explains exactly how to hold the reins and what it takes to make the horse 
stop, go and turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have rides for more experienced riders, beginners shouldn't 
worry about being thrown from a galloping horse. All the horses are kept to a 
walk, Pencak advises, unless all riders agree to a faster pace. Helmets are 
provided, and on our ride, all seven riders strapped them on. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride stretches over green meadows, under canopies of oak trees, along 
creeks where the trail is narrowed by thick stands of reeds, up and down 
hillsides, under cliffs, and along ridges with majestic mountain views. 
</P>
<P>
 It's secluded, except for the cattle that graze on the property, as well as 
hawks and other wildlife. This is Chumash country and one spot along the route, 
identified as Chumash Gardens, is believed to be the site of an ancient Chumash 
campground. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride lasted the entire 90 minutes. (Some novice riders tire early and the 
ride might be shortened to an hour.) No one was anxious to trot, so the 
excursion was a slow, steady, peaceful retreat away from civilization. 
</P>

FOR THE KIDS; YOUNG TV ACTOR DONS A NEW COAT FOR PLAY; FOR JASON NARVY, IT'S A 
BIG SHIFT FROM CHILDREN'S TELEVISION TO THE LEAD ROLE IN 'THE OVERCOAT,' A 
CLASSIC RUSSIAN TALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If your kids are hooked on the afternoon television show "Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers," they sometimes see Newbury Park teen Jason Narvy who plays "Skull" in 
the offbeat show about kids battling intergalactic monsters. 
</P>
<P>
 But this weekend Jason's acting takes a 180-degree turn. He stars in the 
Conejo Players production of "The Overcoat," an adaptation of a Russian story 
from the 1840s by Nikolai Gogol. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its serious overtones, the play is billed as a family offering by the 
Conejo Players' Afternoon Theater group. It opens Sunday, with shows also 
scheduled for Feb. 5, 6, 12, 13, 19 and 20. All performances are at 2:30 p.m. 
at the Conejo Players theater, 351 S. Moorpark Road, Thousand Oaks. All tickets 
are $5. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Overcoat," Jason plays a pathetically poor Russian clerk named Akaky 
who spends his days making copies of government documents. It's a dreary job, 
but the hard-working Akaky takes pride in his penmanship and gives it his all. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bitterly cold winter and Akaky's tattered coat is threadbare, but he's 
too poor to buy a new one. How he gets a new coat, and what happens to it and 
him form the basis of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is far from anything I've ever done," the 19-year-old Narvy said during 
a rehearsal break. "Akaky is a little, broken man." 
</P>
<P>
 As "Skull" in the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," Narvy plays kind of a school 
bully. Along with a sidekick, the pair provide some comic relief for the show, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show airs weekdays on the Fox network at 3 p.m. and features five teens 
who periodically transform themselves into Power Rangers to save the world from 
Rita Repulsa and her intergalactic evil forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Narvy is not one of the Power Rangers. As Skull, he pokes fun at their 
outlandish missions and their robotic dinosaurs. Narvy started out with an 
occasional spot on the show a year ago and is now something of a regular. 
</P>
<P>
 He has lived in Ventura County since he was 7 years old and graduated from 
Newbury Park High School in 1992. It was there, as a freshman, that his acting 
career took root. He signed up for drama as sort of a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, why not try it -- and I stuck with it," he said. While in high 
school he wrote, directed and appeared in a production he calls "Shoot Out at 
the Dead Cow Saloon." 
</P>
<P>
 That gave him the writing bug, and his goal, beyond acting, is to do more 
writing. For now, however, he is happy to have landed the role in "Mighty 
Morphin Power Rangers," his first television part. 
</P>
<P>
 The part of Akaky in "The Overcoat" isn't easy. It calls for the lanky teen to 
do pantomime at times. Although the plot has dark overtones, it is something of 
a comedy and a fantasy with dream sequences. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is loaded with music -- 25 selections taken from the music of Peter 
Ilich Tchaikovsky, according to Georgeanne Lees, director of the production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico puppeteer Loren Kahn will be in Ventura Friday with her entourage 
of characters including Natalia, the Jewish grandmother who tells tales, 
riddles, proverbs and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn's show, called "You Can Lead a Horse to Water, If You've Got a Horse," 
takes to the Ventura College Theater stage at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn has worked in puppet theater since 1973 when she dropped anthropology 
studies and became a street performer, traveling through the western United 
States. Since then she has performed with several puppet companies and directed 
her own puppet theater in Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Her show is a collection of vignettes and short plays. One of her stories is 
"How Cat and Bear Went into Business," based on a Czechoslovak folk tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance tickets are $6 for children, $8 for adults ($1 more at the door). 
Tickets are available at Kideos in Ventura and Serendipity Toys in Ojai. To 
charge by phone, call 650-5900. For more information, call 646-6997. Details

THEATER REVIEW; CRUCIAL FLAW HAMPERS 'CHRONICLES' ENJOYMENT; WENDY 
WASSERSTEIN'S WELL-HONED SATIRE OF BABY BOOMERS' QUEST FOR THE MEANING OF LIFE 
COMPLETELY IGNORES FAMILY TIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From high school dances, Eugene McCarthy rallies and tie-dye T-shirts to 
feminist collectives, encounter groups, power lunches and "Boomer" magazine -- 
the iconography in "The Heidi Chronicles" is right on the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as playwright Wendy Wasserstein's self-absorbed baby boomers parade across 
the stage -- in their episodic, rudderless quest for meaning in a society 
shaped by fads -- an inescapable oddity is their complete absence of family 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues of life fulfillment, equal rights and personal relationships receive 
plenty of Wasserstein's well-honed satirical scrutiny. Yet not one of her 19 
characters is involved with -- or even mentions anything about -- his or her 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as though the entire bunch had sprung fully formed into the world, like 
Athena from the head of Zeus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our friends are our families," Wasserstein's heroine -- intellectual art 
historian Heidi Holland (played in this PCPA Theaterfest production by Karen 
Barbour) -- offers in an off-handed attempt to plug the hole, and the subject 
receives no further treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's because Wasserstein's previous play ("Isn't It Romantic?") had 
examined the shackles of parent-child neuroses to borderline sitcom excess. 
</P>
<P>
 But when this play presents itself so insistently as the chronicles of an 
entire generation -- as seen through Heidi's bemused and often contrary point 
of view -- the missing part of the equation leaves the representation suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when the underlying conceit of the characters (and of the 
playwright as well) is that they're facing life issues that have no historical 
precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, director Roger DeLaurier's staging relegates the broader 
sociological sweep to the backdrop wherever possible, and finds its greatest 
success in the personal dimensions of Heidi's story. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly her involvement with the two men in her life -- her lover Scoop 
(Paul Klein), a pushy magazine editor, and her lifelong friend and confidante 
Peter (Jeremy Mann), a cynical but loyal doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 As Heidi, Barbour makes the most of her revelatory scenes -- talking about her 
obsession for Scoop in an encounter group, or breaking down and confessing her 
sense of inadequacy when addressing a luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, these scenes are few and far between. Throughout much of the 
play, Heidi remains a self-styled "informed spectator," simply witnessing the 
ever-shifting world around her. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling that passivity with an engaging performance is a tough challenge. The 
attempt here has been to render Heidi with an outright perkiness that often 
clashes with the thoughtful reserve she's called on to demonstrate (the art 
history lectures are particularly unconvincing). 
</P>
<P>
 And while Mann's Peter is a finely nuanced portrayal (his scenes with Barbour 
ache with emotional honesty), Klein never manages the irresistible charm that's 
supposed to make Heidi (and us) like him in spite of his arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 Without any margin for coasting in a particularly difficult and unforgiving 
script, the production offers an equal measure of triumphs and missed 
opportunities. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "The Heidi Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Tonight through Feb. 6, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays 
at 7 p.m.; 2 p.m. matinees Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays.

EARTHWATCH: GEOLOGIST USES QUAKE IN A REAL-LIFE LESSON; HER VISIT HELPS 
STUDENTS TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week I visited Dos Caminos Elementary School in Camarillo to see how a 
bunch of 8-year-olds would respond to a real-life geologist. It was right after 
the earthquake, although the visit by scientist Elizabeth Weed had been 
scheduled for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was a coincidence that she met with the 31 kids and their teacher, 
Janice Clark, only 18 hours after they all had to dive under their school desks 
during a 5.1 aftershock. The previous day, nervous parents had kept half the 
class home because of the 6.6 quake. Would there be panicky questions? Soothing 
reassurances? A chasm between information-disadvantaged kids and an 
information-over-advantaged scientist? 
</P>
<P>
 Weed works in Ventura County for a branch of the U. S. Department of the 
Interior, which bears a name as grand as its sphere of activities -- Pacific 
Outer Continental Shelf Regional Office of the Minerals Management Service. The 
office regularly lends its scientists to county schools to help teachers in 
earth science classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became a geologist because rocks are fun," Weed said. She then added in a 
more serious tone, "but they do move around." 
</P>
<P>
 Weed then polled the class about their recent earthquake experience. One boy, 
Mason Lauritson, cheerfully reported that a bookcase had fallen on him. He did 
seem to have a slight trace of a black eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom gave me an aspirin and I went back to bed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of the class, in a show of hands, indicated that they had slept 
through the main quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids made several observations that indicated a keen interest in earth 
science that was more than 38 hours old. "You guys have studied rocks!" Weed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at that moment that I noticed a hand-lettered poster on the classroom 
wall with the title "What Is The Earth Made Of?" 
</P>
<P>
 Weed, meanwhile, was leading a class discussion of rocks, and the kids were 
throwing around terms like metamorphic, sedimentary and igneous. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly I was afraid Weed might call on me to answer a question. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the conversation quickly returned to earthquakes. One child asked 
the difference between new earthquakes and aftershocks. The answer -- remember 
you read it first in Earthwatch -- is that aftershocks happen on the same 
epicenter, whereas a new quake has a different epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 After the class, the teacher showed Weed some student projects made as part of 
the earth sciences study unit. Suddenly I realized why the children had been so 
composed about the topic at hand. Each of them had, several weeks prior, made a 
little paper model of tectonic plates -- a sort of origami puzzle showing how 
subterranean forces work to cause earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably why the kids know more than their parents do," ventured 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Weed and I departed for our normal appointed rounds. She, with her colleagues, 
to inspect drilling rigs and shut them down if they're about to leak or mess up 
the ocean floor. Me to write a story about kids' sophistication about earth 
science and the hope that sparks, at least in me, for the future of the earth. 
</P>

 Get ready for some serious picking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masters of the Banjo tour, featuring seven top musicians trained in the 
gamut of banjo styles, will hit the UC Santa Barbara campus Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Performers include Seleshe Dameassae (on the African krar), Ralph Stanley 
(bluegrass), Will Keys (old-time, two-finger style), Kirk Sutphin (on the claw 
hammer) and Seamus Egan (on the Irish tenor banjo). 
</P>
<P>
 "The show definitely goes to dispelling the (negative) stereotype myths of the 
banjo," said the 24-year-old Egan. "It gives a broad view of what banjo playing 
is capable of and where it comes from, and an indication of where it's going." 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, produced by the National Council for the Traditional Arts, will 
begin at 8 p.m. at Campbell Hall. General admission is $18, $15 and $12. Call 
893-3535.

 If you're looking to get away from the tube while everyone else is in front of 
it on Super Bowl Sunday, you might consider checking out the White Winds Studio 
in Montecito. This new performing arts spot will play host to a 3 p.m. concert 
by the Santa Barbara "neo-jazz" ensemble Headless Household. Tickets are $10. 
The studio is located at 113 Middle Road. Call 969-5718. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance is the first arts event at White Winds Studio which, up until 
now, has been strictly used for yoga classes. Future plans for the studio 
include visits by authors, artists and musicians, art exhibits and film 
screenings, in addition to the yoga classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be 50% yoga, 50% art," said Leslie Westbrook, who is handling the art 
side of things. "This will be a place for people to congregate in Montecito. If 
you want to do something cultural you have to go to Santa Barbara. There really 
isn't a place to see experimental films or go to lectures in Montecito." 
</P>
<P>
 Westbrook said she will tie the films, lectures, and exhibits to central 
themes each month. Coming up Feb. 20: A tribute to jazz cornetist Wild Bill 
Davison, featuring music, a documentary, and a visit by his widow. Appearances 
by Jonathan Winters and Laura Huxley (author and wife of the late Aldous 
Huxley) are in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What time is it? That's a pretty easy question to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 What is time? Now that's a bit more tricky. But it's a question that a dozen 
artists are trying to tackle in the "In Terms of Time," exhibit at Santa 
Barbara's Contemporary Arts Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by guest curators Rabbi Laura Geller and artists Ruth Weisberg, the 
exhibit features artists' perceptions of the passage of time -- through 
references to the life cycle, to ancestors, to birth and to death. The artists 
use paintings, etchings, videos and mixed media to share their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Terms of Time" will continue through Feb. 26. CAF is located on the second 
level of the Paseo Nuevo shopping center, at Chapala and De La Guerra streets. 
Call 966-5373 for more information.

MUSIC; RAW SILK INSISTS IT'S R&B DESPITE THE JAZZ IMAGE; THE GROUP, COMPOSED OF 
VETERAN MUSICIANS, ALSO DOES POP, FUNK AND FUSION. REGARDLESS, THEY DRAW 
REGULAR CROWDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Raw Silk has fans, not just the girlfriend, the boyfriend and the roadie, 
either. Long before the Cowboys were finished making the Niners look like the 
Rams, people began filling the Bombay Bar & Grill in Ventura, waiting for Raw 
Silk's Sunday afternoon gig. In no time, the dance floor was packed, just like 
the Niners' bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Raw Silk has been around since 1986 when George met Leslie. George is George 
Friedenthal, who is the keyboard player. Leslie is Leslie Lembo, the vocalist. 
The lineup fluctuates like the lunch shift at McDonald's, but for now, it's Ray 
Pannell on guitar, Mychal Lomas on bass, Del Franklin on sax and Donzell Davis 
on drums. For the moment, blues belter Barbara Wood has been standing in for 
Lembo who will return from vacation for the Wednesday gig. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the band is a veteran musician, so they're tighter than the 
stomach muscles of a 45-year-old man at a Spencer the Gardener gig. As the last 
eight minutes of the game became 20 minutes, Raw Silk kicked into a 10-minute 
funky instrumental. Between sets, Friedenthal discussed his favorite band. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like every year Raw Silk gets voted "Best Jazz Band" in the Santa 
Barbara entertainment papers. Are you guys a jazz band? 
</P>
<P>
 We do pop and funk and some jazz and some fusion stuff, but hey, we're an R&B 
band. Since we have a sax player and we do some instrumentals -- you know how 
Santa Barbara is -- they think we're a jazz band. We have a lot of R&B and funk 
influences, and I hear a lot of James Brown, Tower of Power and '70s funk bands 
in our music. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Raw Silk get going? 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986 I was playing at the Harbor Restaurant on the pier in Santa Barbara 
with a jazz quartet, and one night this gorgeous blond walks in and wants to do 
a song. I wasn't about to say no. That was Leslie Lembo. Soon after, we started 
playing there as a duo and it just took off right from the very beginning. We 
just packed 'em in. Leslie sounds like a black blues singer with all kinds of 
soul, plus she blows the harmonica like crazy. Then people started sitting in 
with us. Del was first, then Stevie Ray Davis, this Texas blues guitar guy. 
Those guys also started to develop their own following and the whole thing just 
kept building. We stayed there for a year and a half when the Red Lion Inn 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't Fess Parker ever show up and do some Davy Crockett songs? 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, not. We were up to a seven-piece by this time and we played five 
days a week, from Tuesday through Saturday. I think Stevie's wife or girlfriend 
made him quit the band, and we got Ray a few years after he left. I just got a 
CD from Stevie not long ago. He's living in Alabama now. 
</P>
<P>
 Five nights a week is serious. So the band must have a zillion songs? 
</P>
<P>
 We've got a lot -- maybe 200 or so. We also have a lot of originals, maybe 40 
or so. We don't do 'em all, usually 10 or 15 originals a night. What we play 
depends on where we play. On Thursdays, Del and I play the Acapulco Restaurant. 
On Fridays, as a four-piece, The Grill in Montecito is always packed; we'll 
have to wait and see about the Pierce Street Annex. It just opened -- it used 
to be the old 1129 Club. We do well every other Sunday at the Bombay in 
Ventura, and the Whale's Tail in Oxnard on Wednesdays is working out. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Santa Barbara scene happening? 
</P>
<P>
 It's changed a lot, I think. There's still a pretty big scene on lower State 
Street for all the young rock dudes, but I think it's pretty tough for 
musicians right now. There's only a few bands that make any money now -- 
Spencer the Gardener, Zack & A Modern View, maybe Tao Jonz. 
</P>
<P>
 When did you know you were going to be a musician? 
</P>
<P>
 It was kind of late for me. I really didn't think I'd be a musician until 
after college. I have a B.A. degree in Asian studies from the University of 
Pennsylvania. It's just a piece of paper -- I don't even know where it is. This 
is it for me now. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Raw Silk trying to get signed? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it would be nice to get signed but we're not actually pushing it right 
now. We have a live tape that's a few years old and we're working on a CD, but 
everyone in the band is doing a lot of other things. Three of the guys go on 
the road with Mary Wilson of the Supremes once a month. I used to do that too, 
but I got tired of it. If we tried to get signed, getting a manager helps. You 
have to beat on doors and do the showcases. You'd have to spend a lot of time 
in L.A. because that's where all the record companies are. They're not going to 
come to Santa Barbara because the scene is down there. 
</P>
<P>
 And record deals aren't always as good a thing as they seem to be. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. We've been around long enough to be a bit cynical about the 
whole thing. Ugly Kid Joe got signed from here, had Top Ten singles but they 
still don't have any money. All the tour support money and studio money is just 
a loan, and you end up incurring all these debts. You have to hang around for 
three or four albums to pay off your debts. It's not all it's cracked up to be. 
For us, I think songwriting and publishing is a more lucrative deal. Details

COVER STORY: WHERE TO GO TO SWEAT OUT SHAPING UP; COUNTY HAS A WIDE RANGE OF 
GYMS AND HEALTH CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ralph: Norton, when you see me walking down the street, you move to the other 
side.  
</P>
<P>
 Norton: Ralph, when you walk down the street, there ain't no other side.  
</P>
<P>
 So another round of holidays have ended and besides being broke, you now have 
the waistline of the Goodyear blimp, the muscle tone of the Pillsbury Dough 
Boy, the appetite of the Tasmanian devil and guilt enough to start your own 
religion. If you're fat, you can do something about it; if you just hate your 
looks, well, there's always therapy or strong drink. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a boom month for gyms, cashing in on old bad habits and New Year's 
resolutions. Gyms and health clubs are all over Ventura County, many offering a 
variety of enticing specials, designed to get you off that couch and into beach 
shape by summer. 
</P>
<P>
 To lose weight: Eat less. We all know that. But according to experts, it isn't 
enough. Along with eating less and eating right, comes tiresome exercise, often 
accompanied by unpleasant bending. According to Dr. Irv Loh, medical director 
of the Ventura Heart Institute at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, the 
most important kind of exercise is what gets your heart pumping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cardiovascular exercise will increase stamina, improve blood circulation, 
improve heart rate and also reduces the risk of certain types of cancer," Loh 
said. "Lifting weights will do nothing to help your cardiovascular system. You 
may look good, but your cardiovascular system may be no better than a guy who 
sits at a desk all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiovascular exercise includes aerobics, Lifecycles, Stairmasters, 
treadmills and rowing machines. Aerobics, is like going to a nightclub except 
you get to dance every dance without being hit on. Loh recommends a minimum of 
20 minutes of aerobic activity three times a week. Local fitness expert Scott 
Meyer, manager of Harold and Jean's Gym in Oxnard has a more rigorous program. 
"You can do cardio every day," he said. But, he added, unless you work on a 
different muscle group each day, the free weights should be done every other 
day or three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Free weights include the old-fashioned dumbbells, with bouncer-sized guys (and 
some women, too) flexing in front of the inevitable mirror. Then there are the 
specialized fitness machines with Nautilus, perhaps, the most recognizable 
brand name. Some of these machines are positively ingenious and stretch muscles 
you didn't know you had. These exercises, according to fitness types, are 
intended to build muscle, and not necessarily to burn fat. 
</P>
<P>
 County gyms, like their clients, come in all shapes and sizes. There are 
monster gyms as large as a K mart and small, one-room neighborhood gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the smaller gyms claim better one-on-one service and the larger 
ones stress space and variety of equipment. All gyms have, in varying 
quantities, Nautilus-type machines, free weights and cardiovascular equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices vary, but around $30 per month is average. Business hours are usually 
from around 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. with the hours of 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. being the 
busiest block of time. 
</P>
<P>
 All the gyms have showers and locker rooms, and some have saunas. Only a 
couple have pools. Most gyms offer an endless schedule of aerobics classes and 
most offer child care. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important thing in choosing a gym is to know what you expect to get 
out of it. No gym can make Tom Cruise out of Don Knotts or Sharon Stone out of 
Philadelphia Cream Cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 There are pickup gyms, workout gyms, far-out gyms. Location seems to be an 
important consideration; people tend to end up at the gym that is closest to 
home or office. 
</P>
<P>
 Signing up and showing up, however, are two different things. Some gyms such 
as Family Fitness in Oxnard have about a 10% regular-attendance rate for 
members while the Gym in Ventura claims around 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows are thumbnail sketches of most of the gyms in the county. There 
are a few women's only facilities, but for obvious reasons they wouldn't let me 
in. Bally's Aerobics Plus 
</P>
<P>
 1313 E. Los Angeles Ave., Simi Valley, 520-2380 
</P>
<P>
 The county's newest facility -- a mall monster with a monstrous exterior color 
scheme that includes tan, purple, turquoise and pink -- has a problem with a 
portion of its ceiling as a result of the earthquake. So aerobics classes are 
temporarily on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, the place has a nice new car smell, and all the equipment is 
shiny bright and operational. Everything is high tech like the Stairmaster 
Gravitron, which is like a video game that fights back. The Life Circuit Seated 
Row could be a steady job for Ben Hur -- it hurts as much as his galley job but 
provides fewer whips and sea battles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about all the treadmills, Stairmasters and stationary bicycles 
anyone could want, and nearly as many TVs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: Bally's has various membership plans, as well as earthquake specials and 
grand-opening specials. Right now, there is no initiation fee and monthly dues 
run between $19-$37. Body Focus 
</P>
<P>
 77 Rolling Hills Drive 103, Thousand Oaks, 496-1834 
</P>
<P>
 There are 620 muscles in your body, and you can use a bunch of them just 
walking around this place -- it's huge. Recent remodeling has increased the 
size of this two-story site to 14,000 square feet. Everything's clean, 
everything works and there's plenty of machinery to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several free weight areas, all the usual Nautilus equipment, and 
enough cardiovascular equipment to save every fatso in the Conejo Valley. The 
aerobics schedule is nonstop, plus there's saunas and Jacuzzi, tanning booths, 
free child care, and nutritional counseling available. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the usual house of mirrors scenario, there are even windows so 
you can check on that BMW in the parking lot. There are actually living plants 
all over the place. Sally Jesse Raphael was on every tube in the cardiovascular 
area where several women were pedaling like there was no Oprah. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: If you can get off your fat rear before the end of this month, Body 
Focus is offering a serious deal -- one cent to join, then $28.95 per month 
thereafter. Don's Gym 
</P>
<P>
 520 W. El Roblar Drive, Meiners Oaks, 646-1146 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing you notice about this place is all the trophies by the door 
won by Don Williams himself. Autographed photos of famous body builders line 
the wall -- Don has friends. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has the only gym in beautiful downtown Meiners Oaks. It's basically 
one big room featuring Nautilus, Polaris and Icarian equipment. In a separate 
room next door, Don offers approximately 10 aerobics classes and karate 
training twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: Don offers three-month, six-month and yearly memberships at $125, $185 
and $275. Family Fitness Center 
</P>
<P>
 300 W. Esplanade Drive, Oxnard, 988-6000 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the neon rock 'n' roll gyms where you can meet your dream date 
even as you tone. About half the people here don't even look as though they 
need to be here -- they're already perfect and just showing off. This is a 
commuter gym (no bike racks) and you have to be in fairly good shape to make it 
across the ever busy Esplanade Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by Ray Wilson, who used to jog with Jack LaLanne, there are catchy 
little sayings all over the wall. The Four Basics According to Ray include: 1. 
Moderate consistent exercise. 2. Proper nutrition. 3. Proper rest. 4. Proper 
mental attitude; be positive, not negative. Avoid association with negative 
people; they drain your energy. 
</P>
<P>
 There are enough machines for a remake of "Metropolis," but no exotic 
varieties, such as pneumatic air pressure machines. There are over 25 
Lifecycles. 
</P>
<P>
 This gym is jamming. There are instructors on the floor and people at the 
front desk. No TVs, but all the while, the disco/dance/funk/hip hop music is 
pumping like all the bouncers-to-be in the free weight area. 
</P>
<P>
 There are over 60 aerobics classes per week, a senior fitness program, an 
aerobic program for kids, and child care is available. If Mariah Carey or 
Madonna were looking for a gym in the county, this would probably be it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have more toys in your playroom, more kids come to play with your 
toys," said assistant manager Patrick Nebeker. "We have most stuff for most 
people and we get 200 to 500 people here every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: Initiation fees at publication were $94, with $4 weekly dues. Fastrac 
</P>
<P>
 147 Brent St., Ventura, 652-5064 
</P>
<P>
 This gym, owned by Blake Winger -- is located on the third floor of the 
building across the street from Community Memorial Hospital. Open to the 
public, Fastrac gets a lot of seniors, as well as referrals from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no aerobics, but the usual machines, lots of free weights, and a less 
than hectic atmosphere. Once the optimum number of clients is reached, there's 
a waiting list, but this only happens on occasion. Parking is available in the 
building because street parking in this area is a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: Membership is $240 per year or $100 for three months. For patients 
referred from the hospital, yearly membership cost $215, or $85 per quarter. 
Gold's Gym 
</P>
<P>
 5120 Ralston Ave., Ventura, 644-4653 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by Joe Gold in Venice in 1970, Gold's is a large corporation of over 
400 independently owned gyms that are located the world over. Some of the more 
famous Gold's clients include Jane Fonda, Isaac Hayes, Morgan Fairchild, Lou 
Ferrigno and Bo Svenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sartorially speaking, Gold's Gyms rival the Grateful Dead in sheer variety and 
volume of logo laden clothing and accessories. At this location, there were 15 
different Gold's shirts for sale and even Gold's license plate frames. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold's is a medium-size gym that attracts your hard-core work-out dude. Though 
some women go to Gold's, and they do have their share of Nautilus machines, 
Stairmasters, stationary bikes and other machines, this is the sort of place 
where you'll mostly see a lot of very big guys making faces in the mirror with 
their pals, the free weights. Child care is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $25 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 There's another Gold's location in Simi Valley at 2975 Cochran Ave. 522-9100. 
Great American Nautilus Gym 
</P>
<P>
 122 S. Mill St., Santa Paula, 525-7609 
</P>
<P>
 You know that Sam-the-owner Salas is a local. His neighborhood gym, which has 
been around for 11 years, features Raiders, Dodgers and Kings logos. He also 
has friends. Around the front desk are autographed posters of, among others, 
Crystal Gayle and the one-name Kiana. She is, in fact, Kiana Tom, who joins 
Rick Valente on ESPN's "Bodyshaping." She's just torturing everyone because 
she's already perfect. She also sells posters of herself from a Sunset Beach 
P.O. Box. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sam, his one-room gym offers free weights, Nautilus, a sauna, 
showers, "in a hometown atmosphere." There are no aerobics classes but plenty 
of classic rock on the stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $125 for six months. The Gym 
</P>
<P>
 2498 E. Main St., Ventura, 653-9151 
</P>
<P>
 Across from Carpeteria and next to one of those 6 a.m. bars, The Gym has been 
in operation for 23 years. It has around 600 members, most of whom actually 
show up to sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to fight with a bunch of kids for the equipment," according to 
trainer Richard Horne. "We don't have a huge overhead here, so we can spend 
more time with our clients. There's no aerobics -- this is just a basic gym. 
There's not a lot of chrome, not a lot of neon and not a lot of flash and 
trash. Half the people here are word-of-mouth referrals after they've tried 
other gyms." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gym has four Lifecycles, a couple of Stairmasters, and enough free weights 
to tire a Terminator. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't raised our prices in the last seven or eight years," said 
certified personal trainer Shawn Mackey Freeman. "January is a good month, but 
things really pick up around here once the bikinis hit the rack." 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $295 per year. Harold & Jean's Health Club 
</P>
<P>
 1930 Saviers Road, Oxnard, 486-2898 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best club there is," said Harold's kid, Scott Meyer. "Harold 
still comes around everyday -- I can't get rid of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold & Jean's is the oldest health club in the county. It's been around for 
33 years and is the second oldest, same-owner gym in the state. The membership 
is about 50/50 between men and women. Every other day it's male only or female 
only. This place has an indoor pool and Meyer to hassle you if start goofing 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get you in such good shape, you won't need to go to those meat markets 
anymore," he said. "Everyone has their own personal program. I find out why 
you're here, then design a program for you. Oh, and I'll call you if you don't 
show up. Over 70% of our members actually show up because we service our 
members. We haven't raised our prices in eight or nine years. Once we reach 500 
to 600 members, that's it. We start a waiting list." 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $265 per year. L.A. Fitness Center 
</P>
<P>
 4542 Las Posas Road, Camarillo, 482-2582 
</P>
<P>
 So, I wonder if there's a Camarillo Fitness Center in L.A.? It's best not to 
time your workouts here by the clock tower above the building. One side says 
it's 8:30, another 3:15, another 5:10 and one side has no hands at all. So show 
up whenever you want and stay as long as you want, as long as it's between 5 
a.m. and 11 p.m. on weekdays and between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the Lifecycles line one glass wall, offering a swell view of the 
parking lot and some farmland. There's a large free-weight area, all the usual 
Nautilus machines, plus a large aerobics room where up to seven classes are 
offered a day. The club offers men and women-only Jacuzzis and saunas and child 
care is available, as are professional massages at $40 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: The club offers individual, couple, family, senior citizen and corporate 
rates. Enrollment fees and monthly dues vary widely, with single memberships 
ranging between $15-$49 per month. The club also offers one-week free trial 
memberships. Mapes Gym 
</P>
<P>
 4301 Valley Fair Drive, Simi Valley, 581-1205 
</P>
<P>
 Located in a little strip mall off Tapo Street, this is a meat and potatoes, 
no frills sort of gym. There's a locker room and a shower -- that's it for 
amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 There are free weights, a couple of stationary bikes and some Stairmasters -- 
one of them a top-of-the-line model. Mostly, this place is Gruntsville. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do actual weight training here," said manager Dale Adrian. "It's not a 
social club for people who want to hang out and get picked up or be seen. 
People who come here want results and actually work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: At present, Mapes is having a deal with a six-month membership for $89. 
Sweat all you want; and chances are good no one will ask your sign. Oakridge 
Athletic Club 
</P>
<P>
 2655 Erringer Road, Simi Valley, 522-5454 
</P>
<P>
 The accent here is on "club" at this high-tech, young professional 
sweat-ar-ia. There are a number of tennis courts, a pool, and a parking lot 
larger than those at most gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakridge is also the best landscaped gym with calendula, periwinkles, 
impatiens, agapanthus and cape honeysuckle in bloom everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, it's like a hotel lobby dominated by a huge TV screen larger than my 
Chrysler. Big couches and comfy chairs are everywhere. Through glass walls, you 
can watch racket ball players sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, it's the gym. There's charts all over the wall depicting aerobic 
target heart rates, the muscular and skeletal systems of both sexes. There are 
two rooms of gym equipment in two different color schemes: green and white and 
tan and blue, depending on one's preference. 
</P>
<P>
 There's another large room where aerobics, which are going on virtually 
nonstop -- becomes "body sculpting." Weight training instruction is provided. 
Nursery care is available daily at 8 am. This place is huge, and it's cleaner 
than Felix Unger's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We serve, serve, serve," said manager Gay Bosch. "This is non-contract club, 
so it's month-to-month and we have to earn the repeat business of our 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: Prices vary, depending on the type of membership and the number of 
people in your family. Initiation fees run from $150 to $275. Monthly fees run 
from $35 to $75. There are also full facility and health club only memberships. 
Oceanside Fitness Center 
</P>
<P>
 420 W. Pleasant Valley Road, Oxnard, 488-2664 
</P>
<P>
 Located in a strip mall, this one has been in operation for nearly 3 1/2 
years. The Hueneme High School Vikings basketball schedule is in the window. 
Q-105 is on the stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a gym, not a meat market," said Patty Kelleher, the woman at the desk. 
"It's like one big family here. A lot of people are joining now because they 
want a fresh start. After you've spent half an hour on the Stairmaster, you'll 
think twice about stopping for a burger on the way home." 
</P>
<P>
 This one has child care, nearly 40 aerobics classes per week and all the usual 
machines that hurt so good. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing they have that no one else has is free karate classes for women. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oceanside also has workout clothes on sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $249 per year. Ojai Fitness 
</P>
<P>
 309 E. Aliso St., Ojai, 646-5076 
</P>
<P>
 This is your basic neighborhood gym with a free weight room, plus another room 
full of Polaris equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceiling fans are necessary for those Ojai summers, and this year, winter. 
There's a fenced-in yard for child care. 
</P>
<P>
 But the single most interesting feature here is the aerobics room -- it's 
actually an old Church of Nazarene, complete with stained glass windows -- so 
you can pray to be thin and get thin all at once. They offer 27 classes per 
week, none on Sunday. A massage therapist and a chiropractor are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $325 per year. Pitbull Gym 
</P>
<P>
 1950 N. "C" St., Oxnard, 981-4630 
</P>
<P>
 This one is located in the Carriage Square shopping center around the corner 
from Vons, across from the post office. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a large room full of the usual equipment and a good size aerobics room 
upstairs, where around 17 classes per week are held. There's a couple of saunas 
plus the pictures of some L.A. sports heroes. The best one is a signed poster 
of Ah-nold in full-study pose with the following promise: "To Pitbull Gym -- 
Train here or I'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: The Pitbull Gym is offering a special right now -- $99 for six months or 
$149 for a year, no initiation fee. Powerhouse Gym 
</P>
<P>
 880 Hampshire Road, Westlake Village, 371-5850 
</P>
<P>
 This one is located in a maze of office buildings that all look alike. The 
rock 'n' roll is pretty hip -- KLOS, KLSX or KROQ. Only problem is, last week 
they rocked and rolled a little more than was comfortable, thanks to the 
earthquake, and they will have to close for a week of repairs commencing on the 
27th. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, this is a pretty casual place where customers do some serious 
exercise, so maybe they won't mind a little mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're doing is more important than what you're wearing," said manager 
Philip Feldson, his muscles bulging under his corporate sweat shirt. "We have a 
very down-to-earth atmosphere here. We're sort of off the beaten path, and not 
on some main boulevard. At this time of year, a lot of people are driven by 
their conscience to join a gym. About 20% stick with it, and about 80% don't 
even show up because working out is a pain in the (butt). It takes a 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 This Powerhouse has the usual ton of Nautilus equipment, free weights and 
cardiovascular equipment, plus more than 30 aerobics classes per week, and 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
 Also available are swing dancing classes, yoga and martial arts instruction. 
The usual Powerhouse line of clothing can be purchased, plus everything the 
well-dressed kick boxer might need. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: The January special is $199 to join, $14 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a Powerhouse Gym at 411 Central Ave. in Fillmore, 524-1111, and 
at 1657 Pacific Ave, in Oxnard, 483-2557. Shape Shop 
</P>
<P>
 711 E. Santa Barbara St., Santa Paula, 525-0990 
</P>
<P>
 There are a couple of scraggly podocarpus plants languishing on either side of 
the door to this neighborhood strip-mall gym. There are quite a number of free 
weights and the inevitable mirrors, plus a few stationary bicycles and 
Stairmasters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back is an aerobics room, which offers about 30 classes a week. The 
club also sells some clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one club that has somewhat eccentric hours: they are open Mondays, 
Wednesdays and Fridays from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8:30 
a.m. to 9 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to noon. Starting in February they 
will be open on Sundays by appointment only. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $50 to enroll, $25 per month. Ventura Athletic Club 
</P>
<P>
 5353 Walker St., Ventura, 644-9561 
</P>
<P>
 They just moved into the old Pennysaver building a few months ago and the 
place still smells new. It is huge; the logo on the wall is bigger than some 
gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 On the lower floor, there's a basketball and volleyball court, plus all sorts 
of free weights and more dumbbells than a Three Stooges film festival and more 
mirrors than Zsa Zsa and Prince could possibly need. There is a large aerobics 
room, plus a women-only workout room. There's another women-only room upstairs, 
but segregation of the sexes is optional. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second floor, the cardiovascular equipment lines a railing offering a 
panoramic view of what's below or also the four TVs with the sound off. Music 
is usually KTYD, Q-105 or The Bus. 
</P>
<P>
 They offer a wide range of nutritional drinks such as Turbo Tea, Carbo Pump 
and Muscle Mass, which gives you a head rush similar to the one you get from 
eating too much ice cream too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Athletic Club is affiliated with the Camarillo Athletic Club and 
the Channel Islands Athletic Club in Port Hueneme, the latter two specializing 
in handball. A membership with one is good at all three locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: At the time of publication the enrollment fee was $99 and monthly fess 
were $35. YMCA 
</P>
<P>
 3760 Telegraph Road, Ventura, 642-2131 
</P>
<P>
 Remember all those '40s movies when all the guys were being thrown out of 
their fancy Manhattan apartments and crashing at the Y? You still can, but not 
in Ventura County -- the nearest residential facility is in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 This is your basic, wholesome, PG-rated health club. If Ward Clever let the 
boys work out, you'd probably find Wally and the Beave at the Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The main attraction at the YMCA is it's indoor pool, which is a lot less 
crowded than the beach, and the parking is cheaper. But you do have to have a 
shower cap if your hair is shoulder length or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Y has all the equipment of other gyms, but the place usually isn't so 
crowded. And they offer the widest selection of classes of any facility in the 
county. And more printed material. There's information on CPR, abdominal fat, 
target heart rates, general training procedures, parent/child programs, youth 
karate and tumbling, racqetball, aerobics classes, even country dance lessons. 
And there's no obnoxious disco music cranked up to 11, scaring both your 
remaining brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign on the wall pretty much sums up this scene: You can work out 
anywhere, but you belong at the YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a Y in the Conejo Valley, which has a pool, and one in 
Camarillo, which does not. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: The Y requires a one-time $145 membership fee, which is transferable to 
other Ys if a member moves to another city. Monthly fees are $38 for 
individuals and $54 for family membership. There are other fee structures for 
students, seniors, teens, youth and those needing financial aid.

OUT AND ABOUT: TARTS AND FLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a flower shop with a twist: It doubles as a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Rita Flora Kitchen and Flower Shop, the aroma of fresh flowers is 
rivaled only by the culinary offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at La Brea Avenue and 6th Street in Los Angeles, Rita Flora offers a 
menu complete with muffins, sandwiches, specialties and salad plates. Popular 
choices include cheese tortellini with pesto, steamed vegetables and Thai 
noodles with chicken in peanut sauce. (Selections range from $5.25 to $7.95). 
Top it off with a dessert, such as a chocolate brownie or sugar-free fruit 
tart, which are baked fresh daily. 
</P>
<P>
 While customers savor gourmet delights and sip frothy espressos, they sit on 
tall stools, gazing out on the busy street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always liked the atmosphere," said Lisa Annala, a semiregular 
customer. "There is no place like it in the area. It's a casual place . . . 
being around the flowers is great, the doors open out (onto the street) and the 
menu is good." 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Rita Azar opened Rita Flora six years ago. When the space next door 
became available three years later, she expanded and opened the restaurant 
portion, which has enjoyed enormous success, both for dining and takeout. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, the clientele varies from business and entertainment 
executives to neighborhood residents. Patrons can read, chat or people-watch 
without interruption. And, of course, they can buy flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Pepper, who stopped by for a quick lunch last Friday, said: "I like to 
get flowers for my wife afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Flora Kitchen/Flower Shop is located at 460 S. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles. 
Hours are 8 a.m. to midnight daily. Flowers cannot be purchased after 10 p.m.

FASHION; EXERCISING THE OPTIONS OF WORKOUT CLOTHING; FIRST, THERE'S THE ISSUE 
OF COVERAGE -- SKIMPY OR MODEST. THEN COMES THE CHOICE OF FABRIC, COLOR AND 
PATTERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WILLIAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When there are more women coal miners, there will be fashion in coal mines. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't believe it, look at gyms. These are places where you go, 
basically, to sweat. Most women prefer to sweat in color-coordinated outfits in 
the latest style, with matching headbands. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be because health clubs are really less about health than they are 
about hard bodies -- as you might guess from ads showing people flexing exposed 
muscle groups that are nowhere near the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 We have to admit a robust EKG pattern would make a pretty boring ad. But, 
couldn't the models be a little more demure? 
</P>
<P>
 We went looking for demure exercise fashions at local shops. Right away, at 
The Body Shop in Thousand Oaks, we found a solid-color, ballet-cut leotard with 
tights. Understated and classic, it put focus on the head and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not quite a bull's eye with the aerobics crowd, though. Only 1% of them 
go for that look, said Pam Papin, who has been selling exercise and dance wear 
for more than a decade. The rest are into shorts, the high-cut "French" 
leotard, or its anorexic cousin, the thong. 
</P>
<P>
 The thong is popular, especially with younger women, according to Papin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to move in," she said. "If (women) have always been brought up to 
think of it as a normal thing, it's comfortable. Otherwise, some people think 
of it as gross." 
</P>
<P>
 Worn over contrasting spandex shorts, the narrow thong leotard tends to bring 
attention to the lowest dorsal area. 
</P>
<P>
 We noted this at a fast-paced aerobics class at Body Focus in Thousand Oaks. 
Lisa Flanagan, who teaches at the club, said she does not wear the style for 
this reason. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "Definitely, skimpier is in -- the thongs and open midriffs." 
</P>
<P>
 While the scanty style may be growing locally, it is shrinking elsewhere, said 
Glen Greenbaum, vice president of sales at Danskin Inc. At one time, the thong 
accounted for 45% of their leotard sales; now it's 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the leotard itself is in a downtrend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a movement to more casual styles -- drawstring waistbands, a looser, 
casual fit that can go into day wear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Separates are in demand. "(Women) can take a bra top and a thong (pant) over 
shorts and still be covered; their midriff is exposed and they will be able to 
show off a lot of body and a lot of muscle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is there this coverage decision to make; one must choose fabric, 
color and pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny spandex is out, Papin said. Everyone wants cotton blends, or the new 
Supplex nylon. 
</P>
<P>
 As to pattern, "It goes: solids, prints, stripes, solids," said Papin. "Two 
years ago florals were the biggest thing; now florals are out." 
</P>
<P>
 While women ponder these variables, men get by mostly in gray jersey shorts -- 
both in the weight room, and in aerobics, should they choose to join in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men are more function oriented," said Debra Sanders at Sport Chalet in 
Oxnard. "They look for practical purchases, and they stick with those." 
</P>
<P>
 Men buy a couple of tank tops or T-shirts, a couple of pairs of shorts, 
Sanders said. Some like to wear body-fitting black spandex shorts for support; 
but most want gym shorts over these for modesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of modesty, some women were wearing the gym shorts in that aerobics 
class too; but they were distinctly in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
 The way we see it, there's a modesty cycle -- which we are now at the bottom 
(or top) of -- that operates in gyms as in life. Following the law of cycles, 
this trend toward skimpy will soon reverse, and produce an opposite demand. 
</P>
<P>
 So we plan to buy that classic leotard at the first opportunity. It should put 
us ahead of the pack.

TO ACHIEVE FITNESS.

 This must be January. Almost everyone we know has joined a gym, purchased a 
Stairmaster, or at the very least, talked about doing something to improve 
fitness. So how much does an improved you cost? Can you afford to get in shape? 
How do you keep the wealthy along with the healthy and wise? 
</P>
<P>
 We have many ideas for fitness under $100. 
</P>
<P>
 And we don't recommend spending more. (Unless it's much more.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's common knowledge now that a great way to stay in shape is to walk. Walk, 
walk and walk! A good pair of athletic shoes, along with the naturally 
beautiful terrain of Ventura County, will help you achieve and maintain your 
fitness goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic shoes are sold at almost all the local shoe shops and department 
stores. The biggest selection, however, will probably be at a sporting goods 
store or at a sports shoe store like Big Five or FootLocker. Big Five 
advertises almost every week with sales and specials. We took a look and found 
some good deals in the shoe department. 
</P>
<P>
 We found men's and Nike Air in styles "Sonic Flight" or "Assault Flight" for 
$39.99 from $69.99. Women's Saucony "Jazz 2000 Classics" were $32.99 from 
$64.95. Avia's "Cross Training" shoes were down to $35.99 from $59.99. Most 
impressive were the $19.99 selections, which included brands by Pony and 
Turntec. 
</P>
<P>
 When you shop for athletic shoes, try on many different styles. Walk around 
the store. A good pair of shoes will be flexible, comfortable and will have 
wiggle room for your toes. 
</P>
<P>
 If you already have good shoes, or you are ready to upgrade your workout, look 
for some weights. One of the most popular brands for walkers is called "Heavy 
Hands" and Big Five has the "Combo Pac" for $32.99. 
</P>
<P>
 These weights add an upper body workout to your walk. They include one-pound 
and three-pound end caps so you can start out slowly. (Heavier end caps are 
sold separately.) 
</P>
<P>
 What to do when the weather won't permit walking? Inexpensive indoor exercise 
can be achieved through fitness videotapes, rubber-band workouts and "step" 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Target has a vast collection of fitness videotapes. From the ubiquitous Jane 
Fonda tapes (priced at $17.95) to Dixie Carter (also $17.95). You can pick your 
movie star mentor. Personally, we'd rather watch Cindy Crawford who offers 100 
minutes for the same $17.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested in tai chi or yoga? These forms of fitness are also covered. Karen 
Vight's fitness tapes received high ratings from Shape Magazine. Looking for 
"Buns of Steel?" These tapes are priced from $8.99 for one to $24.99 for a 
three-pack. 
</P>
<P>
 We found an inspiring array of books on fitness. From Covert Bailey's "Fit or 
Fat" to Tamilee Webb's "Rubberband Workout" -- for $9.95 this manual includes 
the biggest rubber bands you have ever seen. The bands add resistance and 
toning to your workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Step" exercise programs provide a terrific home workout. They are similar in 
principle to a stair climber. That is, it's harder to climb than walk on an 
even surface. The steps themselves are like wide step stools on (and off) which 
you do an exercise routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Target and Big Five have a daunting selection of "Steps." Test them out. The 
cheaper models may slip under your feet if you are really working hard. We 
liked the "Step Circuit Trainer" at Big Five. For $99 it includes a 90-minute 
video (featuring Nadia Comaneci), resistance bands and a "Step" that adjusts to 
your ability. Target has a foam step box designed for low impact. This one also 
includes an instructional video. All for $19.99. Try out that box although it 
does look small. A step at every size and price in between is also available. 
</P>
<P>
 Just for fun, we grabbed a Hula Hoop from Wham-O for $4.99. We're hoping it 
will be a real waist whittler. Don't forget a Frisbee! (Only $7.99 also at Big 
Five.) They provide great exercise for you and your mate. 
</P>
<P>
 OK. Say you want to look like Madonna or Marky-Mark and money is no object. 
The Fitness Store in Thousand Oaks is the place to go. Their machines are the 
Porsche Carreras of exercise. They have top-of-the-line treadmills, 
computerized bikes and home gyms. Their prices are the lowest we've found. 
Times are tough, so bargain just like you would when buying a new car. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Trotter" treadmills sold here are the same kind used at the Pritikin 
Health Centers. Sales Manager Pete Hernandez said their top-of-the-line 
"Trotter" treadmill would probably last a lifetime.

BLUE CROSS ENDS ALL LIMITATIONS ON COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 In the private health care industry's most significant step toward universal 
health coverage in the state, Blue Cross of California has begun offering 
guaranteed coverage to all individuals regardless of their medical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, rival Kaiser Permanente announced a venture with Pacific 
Mutual Life Insurance Co. to give Kaiser's 4.6 million California patients the 
option of using doctors and medical facilities outside the vast Kaiser network. 
</P>
<P>
 It marks the first time that Kaiser's HMOs have allowed all of its California 
members to seek medical help from non-Kaiser doctors. A pilot program in 
Bakersfield has existed since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves by the state's two largest health carriers reflect both the 
wrenching competition in the California health care market and the impetus that 
federal and state health reformers have given the private sector to come up 
with its own solutions to the health care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program announced Wednesday, Blue Cross -- which insures 5.7 million 
Californians -- will no longer reject any individual applicants because of 
disease or illness. Instead it will separate them into three different 
categories based on their medical condition, setting fees and co-payments 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an excellent move in the direction of reducing and finally eliminating 
prior conditions and other barriers to health care access," Albert Lowey-Ball, 
a Sacramento-based managed-care consultant, said. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law that took effect Jan. 1 limited the kinds of waiting periods and 
other restrictions that health insurers may place on individuals seeking 
coverage. But even before the law took effect, insurers were scrambling to go 
the reformers one better. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield of California, for example, announced that it was dropping all 
waiting periods and "waivers" that exclude benefits for specified medical 
conditions. However, Blue Shield said that it would still refuse coverage to 
some applicants with health problems and in fact would probably increase the 
percentage of applicants it rejects. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross, California's largest insurer of individuals with 750,000 such 
enrollees, decided to take all comers but retain six-month waiting periods for 
certain applicants' pre-existing medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Mark Weinberg, Blue Cross executive vice president, said the company's goal 
for years has been to offer coverage to all comers, but it did not become 
practical until government reforms pushed the industry in that direction, 
forcing all carriers to take some of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any government health reform plan that has been suggested, healthier 
people will subsidize sicker ones, Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Cross program is divided into three categories. Level I, which the 
company said would include about 75% of all applicants, offers a choice of a 
health maintenance organization with a $10 fee per office visit or a 
preferred-provider network, with the enrollee paying a 20% co-payment (up to 
$2,000) for services. 
</P>
<P>
 All healthy individuals would qualify for Level I, as would most patients with 
such ailments as asthma, epilepsy, skin cancer and ulcers. The average premium 
for Level I coverage would be $96 a month, Blue Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Level II, for those with more serious conditions such as diabetes, Hodgkin's 
disease and hypertension -- about 20% of applicants -- offers only a 
preferred-provider network plan, with a 20% co-payment of up to $10,000. The 
monthly premium is be 50% higher, averaging $143 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Level III, with average monthly premiums of $214, is offered to people with 
such life-threatening conditions as AIDS, cancer and heart disease. There is a 
$50,000 annual limit on benefits, plus a 20% co-payment, up to $2,000. Also, 
applicants must be on the waiting list for the state's Major Risk Medical 
Insurance Program, the traditional coverage of last resort for those with 
severe health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Level I will be profitable for Blue Cross, Level II will break even and Level 
III will lose money, Weinberg said. Together the program will make money, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If President Clinton's (health reform) activity has had any effect," Weinberg 
said, "it has been to challenge the industry to fix the health care system's 
problems ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser's venture with Pacific Mutual, the largest state-based life insurance 
company, is a response to increasing demands for greater choices for employees 
and simplified billing and administration for employers, as well as to 
Clinton's health care reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Kaiser and Pacific Mutual face an increasing need for providing 
choices," said Michael Berumen, senior vice president for marketing at Pacific 
Mutual's group health and life insurance subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both are very mindful of the need to offer a full range of managed care, 
and Kaiser is sort of the paradigm of managed care," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser also is rolling out similar programs, called point-of-service plans, in 
Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina and the Northeast, though the plans will be 
phased in slowly, said Kirsten Cherry, a spokeswoman for Kaiser Permanente of 
Northern California. Altogether, Kaiser has 6.5 million members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 While the alliance is perhaps the biggest venture of its type, as well as one 
that doesn't involve a merger, point-of-service plans have been proliferating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kaiser had no choice if they wanted to catch up with the rest of the 
marketplace," said Bert B. Wagener, president of CIGNA Health Care of 
California, which has had a similar program operating since 1988.

 JUST DUCKY: After the media beating Disney took over its Euro Disney Resort 
and Virginia theme park projects, the Burbank brigade could use some good 
reviews. They get one in the current New Yorker, as the literary, high-brow 
weekly offers a lengthy and glowing assessment of the Mighty Ducks' performance 
on the ice and their marketing wizardry off it. . . . But Disney did take one 
hit: The Iceman, the ill-fated team mascot that lasted all of one game in 
Anaheim, was blasted in the piece as a "major dork-o-rama." 
</P>
<P>
 PAST DUE: South Africa's most prominent playwright, Athol Fugard, says he's 
thinking about a trip to Costa Mesa for the revival of his latest work at South 
Coast Repertory. (OC LIVE!) "Playland" opens Friday and runs through Feb. 27. . 
. . While the county's only professional resident company has done three other 
Fugard plays, he has never shown up. "I owe them," admits Fugard, who 
revolutionized South African theater decades ago by putting blacks and whites 
on the same stage. 
</P>
<P>
 D.C. CONNECTION: Irvine PR man Bob Nelson caught some flak from fellow 
Republicans when he broke ranks to support Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, but it 
has paid off. First he helped on the Clinton transition, and now he's been 
named to an economic panel that advises the President and Congress on U.S. 
competitiveness abroad. . . . The only drawback, he says: often "nightmarish" 
FBI background checks on such issues as domestic help. "It's just irritating. I 
can sure appreciate Bobby Inman's feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 NO YOLKING MATTER: If you like your eggs soft-boiled or sunny side up, beware: 
the County Health Care Agency last year received 91 reports of salmonella 
enteritidis . . . . The disease comes from eating under-cooked, infected eggs. 
The county's Dr. Hildy Meyers says such incidents, transmitted from infected 
hens, are increasing steadily. Symptoms: fever, diarrhea and nausea.

 SEEKING SHELTER: Fewer people are spending the night outside at Red Cross 
shelters (above). . . . But the number housed at indoor centers has hardly 
fluctuated since the quake. Every night, about 6,000 sleep inside, while those 
remaining in tents outside has dropped substantially the last few nights. 
</P>
<P>
 DOWN THE HATCH: For many anxious Angelenos, the quake and aftershocks have 
caused more than nightmarish commutes, bureaucratic hassles and awkward 
sleeping arrangements. Many have turned to pills and alcohol to relieve the 
stress, say local pharmacists. . . . Survivors also have developed other new 
habits, from what they wear to bed to how close they drive to freeway 
overpasses. (E1) 
</P>
<P>
 LUCKY LENDERS: Surveying the condemned and damaged homes, one might assume 
Southern California lenders are big-time losers in the wake of the 6.6 quake. 
But it's not so. Glendale Federal said only about 1% of its homeowners had 
serious damage; meanwhile, a Great Western Bank spokesman said the quake did 
not hit the Chatsworth lender hard. (D1) 
</P>
<P>
 PLAY BALL: The Cal State Northridge gymnasium remains a mess, but at least the 
track and field, baseball, softball and tennis squads have been given clearance 
to practice at outdoor facilities on campus. . . . In fact, the gym may be 
ready early next week. The basketball team is using UCLA's Pauley Pavilion for 
practices, and the volleyball squad is working out at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 TOO LATE NOW: You probably didn't know it, but since the quake, parking 
enforcement officers haven't had the time or personnel to check most meters. 
But this incidental kindness cost the city about $100,000 a day, so the 
reprieve is about to end. City Councilman Nate Holden has instructed officials 
to go back to regular collecting, except in areas around shelters, disaster 
application centers and collapsed parking structures. (B6) Seeking Shelter

 UNCROWDED SKIES: Here's a way to avoid those traffic-choked freeways into Los 
Angeles: Fly over them. . . . "We've been getting lots of calls" since the 
earthquake, said Tom Driscoll of Channel Islands Aviation, a charter service at 
Camarillo Airport. Some are commuters bound for Long Beach or Ontario. Others 
are air passengers worried about missing their flights. . . . "They just don't 
want to fight the traffic," Driscoll said. On Wednesday, two people chartered a 
plane to LAX to connect with a commercial flight. Cost: $110 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 OIL AND WATER: Ventura County oil production has declined from 40 million 
barrels in 1960 to 12 million in 1991. But the industry is still here, as 
evidenced by recent spills: 168,000 gallons spilled into the Santa Clara River 
east of Piru, and 84,000 gallons leaked into McGrath Lake near Oxnard. . . . 
Now the company responsible for the McGrath spill has made its initial report 
to state officials (B1). Still unexplained: What caused the leak . . . The 
report does provide an upbeat assessment of the spill, which killed more than 
200 birds. "Effects were limited to transient visual impacts," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 LEAN TIMES: It's easy to gain weight: Just eat more -- which a lot of us did 
during the holidays. But going the other way is more complicated. You have to 
both eat less and exercise. . . . Which explains why January is boom time for 
Ventura County's workout palaces (Ventura County Life, Page 24). 
</P>
<P>
 WINTER WALKS: Spring and summer are when most people hike the Los Padres 
National Forest, but winter offers its own attractions. . . . "There's more 
water in the creeks, and you see lots of ducks and migratory birds," said Ojai 
District biologist George Garcia. "You may not see as many animals, but you're 
a lot more likely to see tracks" on the soft trails. . . . What you won't see: 
crowds of people. . . . Be prepared for sudden changes in weather, including 
snowstorms, he said. "It can be nice in Ventura, but when you get on those 
ridge tops it can be twice as cold."

HEAVING TOMATO IN PROTEST'S ONE THING -- BUT 350 TONS?

 Farmers, tired of sagging tomato prices in Europe, protested by heaving 350 
tons of the fruit over a cliff in the Canary Islands, a local cooperative 
official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he suggested that the demonstration will have little effect on the market 
because Europeans shivering in unusually cold weather are eating fewer 
tomatoes.

OPERA REVIEW; INTIMACY WITHOUT PASSION IN SAN DIEGO'S 'ONEGIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lurid ads are popular with opera companies these days. Impresarios everywhere 
-- well, almost everywhere -- have decided that Hollywood hype is useful when 
it comes to selling the lyric muse to the unwashed masses. 
</P>
<P>
 The blurb for "Yevgeny Onegin," which opened the belated San Diego Opera 
season on Saturday, was interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Russia With Love," it blared, "and Betrayal and Jealousy and Death." 
</P>
<P>
 Socko. Wacko. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, as a perverse fate would have it, there was more passion in the 
pitch than in the performance. Hardly anyone at the Civic Theatre seemed to get 
very excited about the inherent emotional traumas. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems began in the rather scraggly pit, where Kenneth Montgomery, the 
Irish conductor from Amsterdam, seemed intent on evading storms at all cost. He 
obviously valued grace and sentiment, and he wasn't afraid to slow things down 
nearly to the stalling point whenever maximum introspection loomed. But he did 
little to accommodate, much less propel, the seething, throbbing, thrashing 
pathos with which Tchaikovsky delineated Pushkin's drama. 
</P>
<P>
 This might not have mattered too much if the stage had been populated with a 
cast of singing-actors who could muster turbulence on their own. But Ian 
Campbell had assembled a rather placid crew for this revival of the Canadian 
production first seen here in 1985. Compounding the expressive alienation, he 
had the mostly Anglo-Saxon cast dutifully mouth phonetic Russian while the 
audience dutifully followed a translation screened atop the proscenium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Onegin" had been a gripping theatrical experience eight years ago. Now it was 
just a nice concert with pretty costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 One artist managed to suggest what might have been. Hans Peter Blochwitz 
offered a sensitively detailed, overwhelmingly poignant portrait of the poet 
Lenski. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtly, bookish and eminently vulnerable, the German tenor looked pretty much 
like the impetuous 19-year-old described in the libretto, and he sang the 
reflective passages with bel-canto tones worthy of Mozart. It will be difficult 
to forget the choked pianissimo phrases with which he launched the great 
second-act ensemble, or the stunned resignation with which he defined his 
farewell to life in "Kuda, vi udalilis." 
</P>
<P>
 Nature did not endow Blochwitz with much thunder for the heroic outbursts. He 
refused to force for impact, however, and thus managed to make a dramatic 
virtue of vocal frailty. One could believe his desperation as well as his 
ardor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Black was undertaking the title role for the first time. The hulking 
Australian baritone sang very well when the line didn't rise above his comfort 
level, and he made a conscientious effort to convey the drastic change in 
Onegin's character after the fatal duel with Lenski. He succumbed to 
exaggeration, however, making the St. Petersburg dandy an insufferable prig in 
the early scenes (how could Tatiana love this man?) and a slobbering fool in 
the later episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Fleming, one of the few bright prospects in the new generation of spinto 
sopranos, sang Tatiana's music with radiant tone, ample thrust and, in the last 
act, exquisite shading. But she did little to suggest the heroine's romantic 
torture, or to differentiate adolescent longing from mature renunciation. In 
other words, she couldn't compete with memories of Kathryn Bouleyn (a.k.a 
Kathryn Day), who left her unique imprint on the role in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Hegierski, more a mezzo-soprano than the contralto required by the 
composer, returned as a properly pretty, properly flighty Olga. Stefan 
Szkafarowsky conveyed little noble dignity in Prince Gremin's wonderful aria, 
but his rough-edged basso coped impressively with the range extremes. Douglas 
Perry waved a Pavarotti hankie (it's time to lay that easy cliche to rest) as 
an all-too prissy Triquet; at least he avoided caricature in his singing of the 
old pedant's sad little aria. The maternal duties were pleasantly dispatched by 
Martha Jane Howe (Mme. Larina) and Debria Brown (Filipievna). 
</P>
<P>
 John Copley's well-focused staging scheme, devised for Festival Ottawa in 
1983, remains a model of narrative intimacy. The same can be said for Robin 
Don's lightly stylized sets -- up to but not including the tacky St. Petersburg 
palace. The visual illusions were compromised by a series of lighting mishaps 
on this occasion, and Terry Gilbert's mock-Russian choreography looked better 
in Larina's country than in Gremin's city. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Rizzo's supertitles actually respected and reflected the stresses of 
the Russian text. Still, "Onegin" in English would have made better sense on 
both sides of the proscenium.

CLUB REVIEW; NOSTALGIC NIGHT OWLS ALIGHT AT THE LAVA LOUNGE 
</P>

 If contemporary thinking holds true, L.A.'s disparaged strip malls may very 
well be the artists' lofts of the future. And Hollywood's Lava Lounge could be 
spearheading the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The plush venue is neighbored by a coin laundry, a dental office and a 
run-down liquor store on strip-mall central -- the decidedly un-trendy part of 
La Brea Avenue between Sunset and Hollywood boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny tiki-room, with its lava-textured walls, sting-ray hangings and 
nostalgic music selection, has been drawing a heavy turnout of night owls in 
search of something different since it opened a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lava Lounge's main appeal to its patrons, most of them in their 20s and 
30s, is a deejay-engineered return to their childhoods, when Petula Clark and 
Engelbert Humperdinck reigned supreme. As couples snuggle in the five booths, 
the deejay spins hit singles from the late '50s and early '60s by the likes of 
Clark and Humperdinck, Lulu and Tom Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesdays, a nameless trio plays standards such as Stan Getz's "Girl From 
Ipanema" and Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat (Day-O)" with a practiced lounge 
precision that Bill Murray would envy.  
</P>
<P>
 The one disconcerting thought that lingers as you put down your 
umbrella-adorned drink and leave the club is that the old adage has proven 
correct -- you do indeed become your parents.

STANDING PAT WITH A FEW BLUE CHIPS REAPS A BONANZA; PHILANTHROPY: RETIREMENT 
HOME REAPS $4.5 MILLION FROM $12,000 TRUST CREATED WITH 100 SHARES OF FLEDGLING 
IBM STOCK IN 1928. 
</P>

<P>
 Folks at the Scripps Home retirement facility in Altadena will be the first to 
tell you that some things get better with age -- particularly IBM stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit home for the low-income elderly announced Wednesday that it had 
inherited $4.5 million from a trust created in 1928 with 100 shares of IBM 
stock, when the fledgling International Business Machines Corp. was hardly a 
household name. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scripps Home became a beneficiary of the trust after the death of Anne 
Smith Bundy of Pasadena, whose grandfather-in-law founded one of the companies 
that became IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director James Graunke said the money will help ensure the home's 
ability to provide care for its 150 residents, all of them older than 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made a promise to care for them for their lifetime," said Graunke, 46, 
who has been with the Scripps Home since 1977. "This will give us a stronger 
financial base to secure that commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 The trust was established by Julia Bundy for her son, Bruce, in 1928. A 
provision stated that if Bruce Bundy and his wife, Anne Smith Bundy, had no 
children, trust money would go to several charities -- including the Scripps 
Home, which was founded in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
 After Anne Smith Bundy died without children in October, the home was in line 
to receive the portfolio that blossomed from the shares of vintage IBM stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about maturing gracefully. The stock, worth $12,300 in 1928, split 
several times and the money was reinvested in several other holdings -- so that 
Scripps' share of the trust was valued at $4.5 million, a 36,600% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The appreciation shouldn't be a surprise considering the stock -- and it's 
owners' -- blue bloodlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Bundy's husband, Harlow, founded the Bundy Time Machine Co. in 
Binghamton, N.Y., with his brother, Willard, in 1890. Willard had invented the 
world's first time clock, which, for better or for worse, enabled employers to 
record employees' work hours and identification numbers.  
</P>
<P>
 The company grew and merged with several competitors and related businesses to 
become IBM in 1924. Although Harlow Bundy had retired and moved to Pasadena in 
1915, he is credited with planting the seeds that blossomed into Big Blue. 
</P>
<P>
 The money comes at a good time for the Scripps Home. According to Graunke, the 
home has spent more than $6 million over the last 15 years to modernize its 
apartments, improve its medical facility and bolster its earthquake readiness. 
He said the new money will help keep the facility on firm financial footing 
after those expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful facility and the residents here are proud of the facility," 
he said, "and the fact that we've been supported so well by the community."

EDUCATORS MOBILIZE TO HELP SOLVE SHORTAGE OF CLASSROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A coalition of educators and community leaders announced the formation of an 
emergency group Wednesday to help the Los Angeles Unified School District find 
immediate and long-term solutions to its school building crisis, intensified by 
severe quake damage at San Fernando Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to rebuild and repair up to 20 hard-hit schools in the Valley must 
also address the critical problem of the lack of space in inner-city schools, 
coalition leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make opportunities out of crumbled buildings," said Mayor Richard 
Riordan, who joined the meeting for a time. "The facility problems in our 
schools has only escalated in the aftermath of the quake." 
</P>
<P>
 Inner-city campuses are so overcrowded that 18,000 students are forced to take 
buses to faraway schools with open seats. The schools with space are primarily 
in the West Valley, where the worst quake damage occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel agreed that the emergency at hand calls for the community to embrace 
new ways of thinking about school buildings. A vacant warehouse, offices, even 
a mini-mall could be transformed into classroom space so children would have 
the option of attending school closer to home.  
</P>
<P>
 The task force was pulled together by LEARN -- Los Angeles Educational 
Alliance for Restructuring Now -- which is leading the district's major 
educational reform plan. The group includes prominent architects, attorneys, 
developers, corporate executives and neighborhood activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are calling on the district to rethink the notion of what a school should 
look like," said John Mack, president of the Los Angeles and a co-chairman of a 
LEARN task force that studied the district's facilities problems. "There are 
many major challenges, many priorities facing our city. But I believe there can 
be no greater priority than to make sure every student is effectively 
educated." 
</P>
<P>
 No one suggested that safety at alternative school sites should be a secondary 
concern. But several in the coalition said that emergency state legislation 
will probably be needed to give the district the ability to cut through the 
volumes of building and zoning laws that regulate school construction and 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday, Supt. Sid Thompson announced that 15 more 
quake-damaged schools will open today as school officials continue their 
scramble to make schools safe enough to occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 In total, 47 campuses, all in the Valley, are still closed, leaving 48,000 
students at home. Thompson said he hopes to have the number of closed campuses 
whittled down to the 20s by Friday. Most of the closed campuses, he said, are 
still without utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Five schools -- Kennedy High School, El Camino Real High School, Northridge 
Middle School, Lawrence Middle School and Van Gogh Elementary School -- are 
closed indefinitely. Students who attend those campuses should expect to be out 
of class until the middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson will announce plans early next week for alternative classrooms for 
those students, which will include housing some in portable bungalows. As a 
last resort, students will be bused to other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance throughout the district Wednesday hovered in the low 80% range, 
about 10% below normal. More students returned to Valley schools, where 
attendance was estimated to be between 65% and 70%, a significant jump from 
Tuesday, when less than half of the students showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, please bring your children back to school. It's good for them to be 
with their friends and teachers. It's good for them to feel secure," Thompson 
implored parents. "I want you to know that those school buildings are built to 
specifications that are more rigid than your home. We are not going to open 
schools unless they are ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson has said that he seeks to keep children at the schools they attended 
before the earthquake, to reduce the upheaval in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 At the facilities task force meeting on Wednesday, however, he agreed with the 
panel of leaders that the district must also use the quake as an opportunity to 
address the needs of the displaced students, rather than focusing on broken 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN President Mike Roos said the group's blueprint, adopted by the school 
board in March, lays out long-terms plans for making better use of school 
facilities. The district cannot afford to pass up the opportunity to implement 
this branch of the plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why on earth would we want to reconstruct the same footprint of a structure 
that is dysfunctional for so many children?" asked Roos, referring to the 
district's lack of space in the inner city and abundance of classrooms in the 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The LEARN plan calls on the district push for state legislation to allow 
commercial buildings to be used for classrooms, allow schools to locate in 
mixed-use developments and explore using the district's own vast amount of 
office space for classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the panel agreed to take a two-pronged approach to the problem. 
They agreed to help the district meet its immediate needs of classroom space by 
either finding appropriate office or other space. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects and planners said they are prepared to help the district with more 
long-term design needs for constructing non-traditional school buildings in the 
inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the brainstorming session produced a number of provocative ideas for 
structures in which to educate children, actually building the new schools 
could present complex problems. 
</P>
<P>
 There are neighborhood development plans to consider, strict zoning laws that 
regulate the location of schools and fears among some neighborhood associations 
that schools attract traffic, noise and rambunctious youths to their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Several community leaders suggested that planners should not rush to the 
conclusion that every parent has a negative view of school busing. Several 
thousand, in fact, voluntarily bus their children to schools in faraway 
neighborhoods in an effort to give them a better education, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the children who are bused to West Valley campuses every day have 
stabilized dwindling enrollments in those schools, allowing the schools to keep 
enough students to offer strong academic programs and maintain teaching staff. 
At several high schools, nearly half the enrollment is from outside the 
neighborhood. Closed Schools 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Wednesday, the Los Angeles Unified School District said 47 schools 
-- all in the San Fernando Valley -- will not reopen today; parts of some of 
these campuses may be cleared for reopening later this week, and others may 
remain closed much longer. Closures include any magnet schools on the same 
campus. District officials will update the school closure list daily. Parents 
should call their child's school for more information.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; A HELPING HAND FROM TENANTS 1,983 MILES AWAY; 
CHARITY: MICHIGAN'S NORTHRIDGE MEADOW HOPES TO RAISE $10,000 FOR VICTIMS OF 
COLLAPSED VALLEY COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One thousand nine-hundred eighty-three miles from the epicenter of last week's 
disaster, a special sort of empathy has launched a fund-raising effort for 
victims of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants of the Northridge Meadow apartments -- in Northville, Mich. -- 
have set up a collection for residents of the collapsed Northridge Meadows 
complex, where 16 died in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 It is pure coincidence, the tenants' group says, that their 112-unit, 
Colonial-style complex has almost the same name as the quake's best-known 
casualty. Until this week, resident manager Eva Pieper said, she had no idea 
that somewhere out there, another community of "1 and 2 br apts with a/c and 
w/w cpt" bore such a similar name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then a resident of ours called me at work and said, 'Do you have a TV?" 
Pieper said. "I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Well, turn it on -- Northridge Meadows 
just went down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned and intrigued -- she didn't hear the telltale "s" -- Pieper switched 
on the TV in her suburban Detroit beauty salon. And there it was, a scene of 
devastation that was occurring far away but suddenly seemed close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, clients here kept asking if we were the same company, and I would say 
no," Pieper said. "Then the owner of our complex called this weekend and said 
he wanted to do something because these people must need so much help." 
</P>
<P>
 Pieper too was touched. An immigrant from Poland, she recalled the sense of 
rootlessness she felt as a child when she and her parents came to the United 
States carrying one suitcase apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had nothing," the 26-year-old beautician said. "I know what it's like to 
have someone give you a helping hand." 
</P>
<P>
 So, at the behest of the owner and his daughter, property manager Beth Brooks, 
Pieper on Monday set up the Northridge Meadows Relief Fund, and began 
soliciting donations from Detroit-area merchants and the tenants in her 
complex. The goal, she said, is to raise $10,000 to disburse on the basis of 
need to the survivors and the families of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
 Assisting her, she said, has been the Northridge apartment manager, who has 
promised to help locate tenants so Pieper and Brooks can present checks to them 
personally when the goal is reached. Pieper said it took her most of a day to 
track down her counterpart, whom she finally located at the Northridge United 
Methodist Church.  
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge manager could not be reached for comment, but volunteers at the 
church confirmed that Pieper has conferred with them and the manager almost 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she felt like they were a sister city sort of, except in this case 
it was a sister apartment house," church volunteer Jean DeMint said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reaction has been, of course, grateful. But we can't tell her yet who 
will need the money the most because we just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Pieper said, the fund is building steadily, with donations large 
and small. Half of the $2,000 collected in the last week came from the 
apartment owner and his family, she said. The rest has come from customers at 
Pieper's Shear Impressions Salon, where she has offered free haircuts to $200 
contributors, and from the Northridge Meadow tenants in Northville, who have 
been adding $20 and $40 donations to their rent checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have promised the people here that we will give this money directly to the 
victims themselves, and not use it for anything else," Pieper said. "It'll 
probably take us about two weeks to meet our goal, but we plan to fly down and 
write checks to the actual people. We're going to pay for the plane tickets 
ourselves, unless an airline wants to sponsor us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pieper admitted 1,983 miles is a long stretch for a helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the point is this," she said: "These people were sleeping happily in 
their homes, and in the middle of the night, within 20 seconds, their world 
turned upside-down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lost everything. And something like that could just as easily happen to 
any of us, at any time."

GAMBLING PROBE IMPLICATES 8 INGLEWOOD POLICE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE OFFICERS ARE 
SUSPENDED. AN ANONYMOUS LETTER ABOUT A LONGTIME BOOKMAKING RING PROMPTED 
DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Eight Inglewood police officers were suspended Wednesday after an internal 
investigation uncovered an illegal bookmaking operation that had gone on for 
several years, police and city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers, described only as veteran members of the 201-officer force, were 
relieved of duty, said Police Chief Oliver M. Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 More officers could have participated in the sports-betting operation, as well 
as people outside the department involved in organized crime, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting with the department, and then we will branch out," he said at 
a news conference. "We're talking about a small number here at the present 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson declined to say whether officers made transactions while on duty, or 
to disclose the amount of money involved. It will be up to the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office to decide whether charges will be filed, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police chief said he ordered an internal investigation Dec. 9, the day he 
got an anonymous, typewritten letter that tipped him to the bookmaking 
activities and to some of the officers allegedly involved. He informed the 
district attorney's office of the letter several days later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the department has obtained search warrants for locations in Inglewood 
and Simi Valley, including the homes of some of the officers, Thompson said. He 
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My initial reaction (to the letter) was shock," Thompson said. "It hits you 
below the belt. But I've learned in this business that anything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expressed concern that the bookmaking ring might undermine the 
integrity of the department, which is struggling to get the upper hand on gangs 
and drug-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it very difficult for the police officers on the street," said 
Councilman Garland Hardeman, himself a former Los Angeles police officer. "It 
becomes an integrity issue." 
</P>
<P>
 None of those suspended were patrol officers, and there is no indication that 
any supervisory personnel were in on the bookmaking operation, Thompson said.

 Hardeman said he plans to find out why the department's ranking officers were 
unaware of the operation. "I'm concerned and disturbed that this could take 
place for this length of time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he and other city officials praised Thompson for ordering the 
investigation and making its results public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important to emphasize that these are a few bad apples," said 
Councilman Curren Price Jr. "The Police Department is handling this right away, 
and I'm pleased with the way things have progressed."

L.A.'S POST-EARTHQUAKE REPRIEVE FOR PARKING SCOFFLAWS IS ENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Start saving your quarters, dimes and nickels to feed the parking meters. 
Authorities will begin citing parking violators again, now that a week and a 
half has passed since the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, frazzled Angelenos could at least rest easy in the knowledge 
that parking enforcement officers were not issuing citations for cars parked at 
expired meters. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws were "suspended by Mother Nature," said Robert Yates, general manager 
of the city's Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Councilman Nate Holden instructed parking officials Wednesday to go 
back to regular enforcement, except in areas around shelters, disaster 
application centers and collapsed parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do the crime, you should do the time," said Holden, chairman of the 
council's Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 After last week's temblor, parking enforcement officers halted most citation 
duties to focus on traffic control at intersections where traffic signals had 
been knocked out of service, Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we suspended (parking enforcement); it's that we didn't have 
the people to do it," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 But they didn't sanction parking anarchy. The most essential laws were still 
enforced, including rules against parking by fire hydrants and at curb spaces 
needed to make room for peak-hour traffic lanes on such roads as Olympic, Pico 
and Sunset boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The reprieve came to motorists who parked at metered spaces and at curbs that 
set parking limits to allow for street sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of parking tickets issued by the city dropped from about 10,000 on 
an average day to about 3,000 daily after the quake, Yates said. That amounts 
to a loss of about $100,000 in fines daily. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the drop in revenue that prompted Holden to take action. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the revenue we need to balance the budget," he said. "If you put 
money in the meters, we get it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few days, Holden said, the city will put up signs in areas where 
parking regulations are not being enforced. HUGO MARTIN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN; GIRLFRIEND OF 
HOSTAGE SUSPECT KILLS SON, 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The girlfriend of one of the suspects in a Jan. 16 hostage standoff in 
Downtown Los Angeles killed her 4-year-old son before trying to commit suicide 
in Reno, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip from Los Angeles police that Maria Leacando Calambro, 23, 
might have made a suicide pact with her jailed boyfriend, Reno officers went to 
Calambro's mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 There they found Binh Canto Calambro, his wrists slashed and a rose on his 
chest, lying dead on the bed next to his unconscious mother. Calambro had 
slashed her wrists, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calambro's boyfriend, Duc Cong Huynh, 38, a suspect in the Jan. 3 murders of 
two employees of a Reno business from which Duc had been fired, and Alvaro 
Calambro, 20, were arrested in Los Angeles early on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officers alerted Reno police to a possible suicide pact between 
Duc and Maria Calambro after Duc allegedly tried to kill himself in his jail 
cell over the weekend.

 Roadside humor: One of the jokes that parents crack to misbehaving kids in his 
West L.A. neighborhood, says Hans Laetz, is: "Go play on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Little did Laetz know that the day would come when Elise, 6, and Emily, 4, 
would take him up on it. He snapped a photo of them frolicking on a portion of 
the eastbound Santa Monica Freeway that was closed because of its recent 
deconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Laetz said, by the way, that he and his daughters came upon "lots of coins on 
the freeway that the sweepers apparently missed. We found about a dollar's 
worth of nickels and dimes that we put in a Red Cross jar." 
</P>

 Fishy protest: Talk-show host Charlie Tuna, of almost-all-sports KMPC radio, 
has questioned our investigation casting a skeptical eye on suggestions that 
there's a link between lost pets and earthquakes. We realize our reputation as 
an animal researcher has suffered a bit since we mistook a cockatoo for a 
cockapoo and reported it was a dog. The cockatoo, that is. Or maybe we said the 
cockapoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Tuna dived into the quake controversy after we declared there was no 
evidence to back the theory of northern Californian geologist Jim Berkland that 
newspapers carry more lost-dog items than usual before a shaker. We pointed out 
there were an unsensational 45 dog and cat notices in the Jan. 17 L.A. Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkland and Tuna argued that the numbers must be tabulated for several days 
beforehand. . . . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Challenge accepted: Here are the totals of lost and found dogs and cats for 
Jan. 11-17 of 1994 and 1993 (a quakeless period). 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 11: 42 (1994) 32 (1993)

 Hope he's not as mad as the devil: We forgot to mention Wednesday that Eric 
Draper shot the Associated Press photo of the plaster angel watching over the

 A black armband for City Hall? No, that isn't a symbolic black shroud wrapped 
around the top floors. It's some dark mesh netting installed to prevent terra 
cotta tiles from falling off the 65-year-old landmark. City Hall was scheduled 
to undergo seismic repairs even before the quake.Emily Laetz (in the No. 2

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; STATE DEALS 
SETBACK TO PLAN FOR HOLLYWOOD PARK CASINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Efforts to open a card club at Hollywood Park racetrack were dealt a setback 
when the state attorney general's office turned down the application of the 
club's prospective owner. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hollywood Park official said plans will continue for the Hollywood Park 
Casino card club to open this year in a building near the grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
 The park had planned to lease casino operations to California Casino 
Management and its president, Edward Allred. In California, an individual who 
wants to run a card club must get a gaming license from the state Department of 
Justice.  
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general cited Allred's prior ownership of stock in companies 
outside California that engage in gaming that is not permitted in this state, 
according to a statement from Hollywood Park. Allred plans to appeal the 
decision, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 G. Michael Finnigan, Hollywood Park executive vice president and chief 
financial officer, said the park will interview other possible casino operators 
but hopes to delay a decision pending the outcome of the appeal. Hollywood Park 
had planned to operate the card club itself until Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed a 
bill that would have allowed the park to apply for a card club license. Under 
California law, only individuals may hold such licenses.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN; BUSINESSES ON 
BROADWAY TO BE CHARGED CLEANUP FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Businesses along Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles will be charged from about 
$200 to as much as $7,000 a year to help pay for increased cleanups, security 
measures and promotions under a special assessment district approved by the Los 
Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The establishment of the Broadway Business Improvement District, the first of 
its kind in the city, drew sharply mixed reaction along one of the city's 
oldest commercial streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business operators said the payments will be worthwhile to spruce up the 
neighborhood and attract more customers. But others said they are already 
financially strapped and the payments could put them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of written protests were filed with the city, but not enough to stop 
the district, which can be halted only by an appeal from owners of businesses 
who represent more than 50% of the area's sales. The district, between 2nd and 
9th streets, will officially come into existence on July 1. A board of business 
people will help decide how the estimated $500,000 annual budget will be spent.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY TO 
SETTLE MOTORIST'S BRUTALITY SUIT FOR $399,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles has agreed to pay a motorist $399,000 to settle a 
brutality lawsuit in which a jury found that Los Angeles Police officers 
violated the man's constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Hassell, who ran a red light on the evening of Jan. 28, 1990, and 
attempted to evade officers during a pursuit, was struck in the head by an 
officer's baton when he was finally pulled over. Last January, a jury found 
that the altercation exacerbated Hassell's glaucoma and awarded him $346,500 in 
compensatory and punitive damages. The settlement approved by the City Council 
will save the city treasury an additional $100,000 in attorney's fees and other 
costs, officials said.

BELL SAYS INVESTORS ARE UNABLE TO FUND THE REOPENING OF CARD CLUB; GAMBLING: 
THE PARTNERS IN THE CASINO PROJECT HAVE HAD A FALLING OUT, ACCORDING TO 
OFFICIALS. ITS FORMER GENERAL MANAGER, WHO WAS CONVICTED OF MAIL FRAUD AND 
OWNING AN ILLEGAL GAMBLING BUSINESS, WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AS A GENERAL COUNSEL 
ON GAMING MATTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 A deal to reopen Bell's dormant card club has fallen through because investors 
are unable to front the $1.35 million in good-faith money that the city 
requires, Councilman George Cole said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city will continue to retain Pete Werrlein Jr., the casino's 
former general manager who was convicted of mail fraud and owning an illegal 
gambling business, as a general counsel on casino-related matters, Cole said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The partners started falling out with one another months ago," Cole said. The 
two investor groups, California Bell Casino of Los Angeles and Worldwide 
Entertainment Centers of Carlsbad, have asked the city to return a $500,000 
deposit, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 California Bell Casino is made up of partners Russell Armstrong, 29, and Randy 
Haag, 34, who are stockbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas C. K. Yuen, founder of Irvine-based AST Research Inc., who Armstrong 
said would provide the club's $5-million start-up funds, said he is not 
involved in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never expressed the desire to be part of this group," Yuen said. "I am in 
the high-tech area, and this is not a deal that suits my background." 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide President Hugh Lyttleton said his organization has ended its 
partnership with California Bell Casino and is unsure what his company's next 
move will be. Lyttleton said Worldwide considered itself the operator rather 
than an investor.  
</P>
<P>
 Casino owner Jim Knapp did not return phone calls made to his Orange County 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 38-page city ordinance tightening card club operations, the 
partnership must pay rent to Knapp before it files an application with the 
city. The city must receive a gambling license application along with a $500 
fee to begin paperwork to reopen the casino, Werrlein said. The city has never 
received an application from California Bell Casino, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 California Bell Casino signed a lease agreement in October with Bell 
Associates to run the 75-table casino, located in a warehouse district off the 
Long Beach Freeway. Once the state's largest poker parlor, it has been closed 
for more than a year and a half. California Department of Justice officials 
have expressed concern about Werrlein's deal with the city. His company, 
Western Gaming Associates, was to receive 15% of the city's revenues from the 
club during its first year of operation and 10% in the following years. 
Werrlein managed the once-thriving California Bell Club until he pleaded guilty 
in 1984 to the mail fraud and gambling charges. He served 10 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rizzo, the city's chief administrative officer, had hoped the casino, 
which once brought the city $2 million a year, would boost the city's sagging 
finances. Rizzo said he is optimistic about finding additional investors to 
take over the casino.

EX-BRADBURY CITY MANAGER CHARGED WITH FRAUD; CRIME: D.A. ACCUSES DOLLY VOLLAIRE 
OF STEALING $53,000 IN PUBLIC FUNDS. THE ACTION FOLLOWS PROBE THAT BEGAN IN 
SPRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The district attorney's office filed charges Wednesday against former Bradbury 
City Manager Aurora (Dolly) Vollaire, alleging that she stole more than $53,000 
in public funds and falsified documents to conceal her actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-count criminal complaint, filed in Los Angeles County Municipal Court, 
climaxed an investigation that began last spring when Vollaire was fired aft er 
two decades in her job in the wealthy San Gabriel Valley enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier Times investigation revealed that Vollaire spent tens of thousands 
of city dollars on personal luxury items, ranging from china to designer 
sunglasses. City books contained a host of cut and altered receipts for the 
purchases, but some bore the insignia of fine department stores and boutiques. 
No Bradbury city officials checked the receipts in the course of their duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollaire, 54, was charged with grand theft in the amount of $53,462.11, 
embezzlement of public funds by a public officer, presenting fraudulent claims 
to a city, keeping false accounts of public money, falsifying public records 
and misuse of public funds, according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the amount exceeds $50,000, she could face a one-year addition to her 
prison sentence if convicted. If found guilty on the embezzlement count, a 
judge would have to deny her probation unless he found unusual circumstances, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol J. Straughn added. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollaire has agreed to turn herself in for arraignment Friday. Recommended 
bail has been set at $5,000, according to the complaint. If convicted on all 
counts, Vollaire would face a maximum state prison sentence of five years, 
according to a district attorney's spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 An independent audit and a civil complaint filed against Vollaire by the city 
indicate she misused more than $80,000 in funds over a decade. But the 
complaint filed Wednesday examines only a four-year period, from 1989 on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went after the more blatant, egregious purchases," Straughn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of those purchases were concentrated in the four years between 
January, 1989, and December, 1992, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not even begin to represent that we are going after every single item 
that we think is fraudulent. I just went after the most obvious ones," Straughn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also concentrated on cut receipts. There is a jury instruction on evidence 
that's been tampered with."  
</P>
<P>
 Vollaire served simultaneously as city manager, planning director, city clerk 
and finance director during her tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the City Council approved her monthly expenses and the mayor and city 
treasurer signed all city checks, her spending habits did not come to light 
until a gadfly dug through city trash last year and found city credit card 
statements betraying her personal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollaire's attorney, Rayford Fountain, said he could not comment on the 
complaint because he had not yet seen it. However, he said his client will 
enter a not guilty plea on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bradbury, interim City Manager Keene Wilson said the filing of charges 
marks another step in the slow normalization of a city that was rocked by 
political upheaval. Two council members were recalled in the wake of the 
Vollaire scandal. Their seats were filled Monday.

MAN SHOT AFTER POINTING GUN AT OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who allegedly pointed a gun at plainclothes police officers in 
South-Central Los Angeles was shot and critically wounded by one of the 
officers Wednesday afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Meigham, 21, was driving along Avalon Boulevard next to the unmarked 
patrol car when he said something to the officers and pointed a handgun at 
them, said Lt. William Hall, who heads the Los Angeles Police Department's 
officer-involved shooting section. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared that Meigham was upset," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Ray Morales fired six rounds out the window of the police car at 
Meigham, who drove on for a short distance until he ran into a parked car, Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meigham was taken to California Medical Center at 14th and Hope streets, where 
he was being treated for bullet wounds to the head and a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no explanation as to why Meigham pointed the gun at officers," Hall 
said. "It is also not known if Meigham even knew they were officers."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; PANEL ADDRESSES CLASS SHORTAGE; EDUCATION: TASK 
FORCE CONFRONTS LACK OF INNER-CITY SPACE AND EARTHQUAKE'S IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A coalition of educators and community leaders announced the formation of an 
emergency group Wednesday to help the Los Angeles Unified School District find 
immediate and long-term solutions to its school building crisis, intensified by 
severe quake damage at San Fernando Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to rebuild and repair up to 20 hard-hit schools in the Valley must 
also address the critical problem of the lack of space in inner-city schools, 
coalition leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make opportunities out of crumbled buildings," said Mayor Richard 
Riordan, who joined the meeting for a time. "The facility problems in our 
schools has only escalated in the aftermath of the quake." 
</P>
<P>
 Inner-city campuses are so overcrowded that 18,000 students are forced to take 
buses to faraway schools with open seats. The schools with space are primarily 
in the West Valley, where the worst quake damage occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel agreed that the emergency at hand calls for the community to embrace 
new ways of thinking about school buildings. A vacant warehouse, offices, even 
a mini-mall could be transformed into classroom space so children would have 
the option of attending school closer to home.  
</P>
<P>
 The task force was pulled together by LEARN -- Los Angeles Educational 
Alliance for Restructuring Now -- which is leading the district's major 
educational reform plan. The group includes prominent architects, attorneys, 
developers, corporate executives and neighborhood activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are calling on the district to rethink the notion of what a school should 
look like," said John Mack, president of the Los Angeles and a co-chairman of a 
LEARN task force that studied the district's facilities problems. "There are 
many major challenges, many priorities facing our city. But I believe there can 
be no greater priority than to make sure every student is effectively 
educated." 
</P>
<P>
 No one suggested that safety at alternative school sites should be a secondary 
concern. But several in the coalition said that emergency state legislation 
will probably be needed to give the district the ability to cut through the 
volumes of building and zoning laws that regulate school construction and 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday, Supt. Sid Thompson announced that 15 more 
quake-damaged schools will open today as school officials continue their 
scramble to make schools safe enough to occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 In total, 47 campuses, all in the Valley, are still closed, leaving 48,000 
students at home. Thompson said he hopes to have the number of closed campuses 
whittled down to the 20s by Friday. Most of the closed campuses, he said, are 
still without utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Five schools -- Kennedy High School, El Camino Real High School, Northridge 
Middle School, Lawrence Middle School and Van Gogh Elementary School -- are 
closed indefinitely. Students who attend those campuses should expect to be out 
of class until the middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson will announce plans early next week for alternative classrooms for 
those students, which will include housing some in portable bungalows. As a 
last resort, students will be bused to other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance throughout the district Wednesday hovered in the low 80% range, 
about 10% below normal. More students returned to Valley schools, where 
attendance was estimated to be between 65% and 70%, a significant jump from 
Tuesday, when less than half of the students showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, please bring your children back to school. It's good for them to be 
with their friends and teachers. It's good for them to feel secure," Thompson 
implored parents. "I want you to know that those school buildings are built to 
specifications that are more rigid than your home. We are not going to open 
schools unless they are ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson has said that he seeks to keep children at the schools they attended 
before the earthquake, to reduce the upheaval in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 At the facilities task force meeting on Wednesday, however, he agreed with the 
panel of leaders that the district must also use the quake as an opportunity to 
address the needs of the displaced students, rather than focusing on broken 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN President Mike Roos said the group's blueprint, adopted by the school 
board in March, lays out long-terms plans for making better use of school 
facilities. The district cannot afford to pass up the opportunity to implement 
this branch of the plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why on earth would we want to reconstruct the same footprint of a structure 
that is dysfunctional for so many children?" asked Roos, referring to the 
district's lack of space in the inner city and abundance of classrooms in the 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The LEARN plan calls on the district push for state legislation to allow 
commercial buildings to be used for classrooms, allow schools to locate in 
mixed-use developments and explore using the district's own vast amount of 
office space for classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the panel agreed to take a two-pronged approach to the problem. 
They agreed to help the district meet its immediate needs of classroom space by 
either finding appropriate office or other space. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects and planners said they are prepared to help the district with more 
long-term design needs for constructing non-traditional school buildings in the 
inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the brainstorming session produced a number of provocative ideas for 
structures in which to educate children, actually building the new schools 
could present complex problems. 
</P>
<P>
 There are neighborhood development plans to consider, strict zoning laws that 
regulate the location of schools and fears among some neighborhood associations 
that schools attract traffic, noise and rambunctious youths to their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Several community leaders suggested that planners should not rush to the 
conclusion that every parent has a negative view of school busing. Several 
thousand, in fact, voluntarily bus their children to schools in faraway 
neighborhoods in an effort to give them a better education, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the children who are bused to West Valley campuses every day have 
stabilized dwindling enrollments in those schools, allowing the schools to keep 
enough students to offer strong academic programs and maintain teaching staff. 
At several high schools, nearly half the enrollment is from outside the 
neighborhood. Closed Schools 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Wednesday, the Los Angeles Unified School District said 47 schools 
-- all in the San Fernando Valley -- will not reopen today; parts of some of 
these campuses may be cleared for reopening later this week, and others may 
remain closed much longer. Closures include any magnet schools on the same 
campus. District officials will update the school closure list daily. Parents 
should call their child's school for more information.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; L.A. LEARNS FROM ERRORS OF FLORIDA; RELIEF: 
SENSING THE PARALLELS AFTER HURRICANE ANDREW, THE SOUTHLAND IS DISCOVERING WHAT 
TO DO AFTER A DISASTER.

 Tent City, Lanark Park. Hundreds of the newly homeless wait in the afternoon 
sun as relief workers hand out milk, shampoo, oranges and canned food. 
Camouflage-clad soldiersplay catch with little children. Fraternity brothers 
from Pepperdine flip burgers on a grill. Older folks retreat to their tents to 
steal some much-needed sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy McCain, head of a team of volunteer physicians from Phoenix surveyed 
this organized chaos and felt a twinge of deja vu. On back of her red T-shirt 
was: "Hurricane Andrew, 1992." 
</P>
<P>
 With long food lines, makeshift disaster assistance centers and olive drab 
military encampments dotting the landscape, parts of Los Angeles are beginning 
to resemble South Florida in the wake of the hurricane, which until last week's 
quake was the country's costli est natural disaster. Sensing the parallels, 
Southland authorities -- from school officials to the mayor to relief workers 
such as McCain -- are tearing a page from Andrew's lesson book. 
</P>
<P>
 They are learning as much about what not to do as what to do. In the wake of 
the hurricane, Florida's tentcities remained up for more than two months, and 
one was reopened six months later when authorities discovered that 5,000 people 
were still homeless. Mayor Richard Riordan has vowed that will not happen in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at the dark side of what happened in Florida and that is the 
inability, in the short term, to put people in permanent housing," said 
Geoffrey Garfield, the assistant deputy mayor who is overseeing the city's 
earthquake emergency operations center. "We are making our moves very 
aggressively to not have that happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 Relief agencies, remembering how quickly food rotted in the hot Florida sun, 
have urged donors to deliver non-perishable goods -- or better yet, to send 
cash. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, sorely criticized for its slow 
response to the hurricane, arrived in Los Angeles within hours of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from United Teachers-Los Angeles, meanwhile, have been working the 
phones, calling their South Florida counterparts for advice. They say they have 
received several crucial tips: To get mental health counselors into the schools 
immediately, to reshuffle teaching assignments so that commutes are shortened, 
and to request emergency help from the Seabees -- a Navy construction battalion 
-- who could rebuild damaged schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made us think that maybe it wasn't just a dark tunnel," said union Vice 
President Denise Rockwell-Woods, "and that maybe we wouldn't be in bad shape 
for years and years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Florida history is any guide, Los Angeles may take longer to recover -- 
physically, and especially, psychologically -- than many people think. The 
people of South Florida have learned that nature leaves a heavy footprint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are going to be some problems here stretching out for the rest 
of this century," said Charles Blowers, chief of the research division for the 
Dade County planning department. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, nearly 18 months after the hurricane, 18,000 housing units -- more 
than-one third of those rendered uninhabitable by the storm -- have still not 
been repaired. A major shopping mall has not reopened. Four schools were 
leveled by the hurricane and have not been rebuilt; students attend classed in 
mobile trailers. At other schools, there have been only patchwork repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses that shut down will probably never come back. Many people 
moved out of the region and will not return; county planners estimate that by 
2000, the population will be 20,000 fewer than if the hurricane had not hit. 
And FEMA still has not come forth with some low-interest loan money it 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
 "FEMA is very cooperative at first," said Cynthia Curry, Dade County's 
hurricane recovery coordinator. "But once time passes, when the threat to lives 
is not so apparent, then different people take a look at previous decisions and 
the likelihood of reimbursement decreases." 
</P>
<P>
 Some damaged apartment complexes were never rebuilt, creating a patchwork of 
empty lots. Alex Muxo, city manager of Homestead, the area hardest hit by the 
storm, says the owners of more than 800 apartments simply took the insurance 
money, paid off their mortgages, cleared their property and left it vacant.  
</P>
<P>
 The storm wiped out 43% of Homestead's tax base, and drove at least 8,000 of 
the city's 28,000 residents out of the area for good. Meanwhile, FEMA still 
keeps 1,000 trailers in the area to house an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 people 
left homeless by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Reale, his wife, Jackie, and their two young children are living in one of 
those trailers. Tom, 47, is a plumber whose business has gone to seed while he 
works on repairing his house. The family is living on the money saved for the 
children's college tuition, and Jackie is receiving unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you've been through this, you can't imagine what it's like," Tom Reale 
said. "What has it been? Eighteen months now, and we're still not back in. 
That's a hell of a long time to have your life totally upturned." 
</P>
<P>
 Reale's neighborhood is crisscrossed with Andrew's scars -- abandoned homes, 
boarded-up businesses and vacant lots where stores once stood. The wind-swept 
landscape is dotted with more trailers than trees, and the trees that were not 
uprooted are stumpy and short. Watching the news from Los Angeles brings back 
painful memories of long lines at FEMA centers and Red Cross stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once is enough for anybody," Reale said. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional trauma of the hurricane has run far deeper than many in South 
Florida initially anticipated. In the school system, the number of referrals to 
a counseling program for teachers quadrupled last year. Crisis counselors are 
still stationed in schools to cope with the fallout among students. 
</P>
<P>
 A University of Miami psychologist who followed 560 third- and fifth-graders 
after the quake said that one year later a third were still experiencing 
moderate to severe signs of stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the children in our sample reported feeling more alone," said the 
psychologist, Annette La Grega. She added that many youngsters refused to visit 
neighborhoods that were severely damaged by the storm, and some reported that 
they were unable to concentrate as well at school because memories of the 
hurricane interfered.  
</P>
<P>
 Already in Los Angeles, evidence is pointing to a similar psychological toll. 
Now that the immediate injuries caused by the quake have been tended to, said 
Pamela Spencer, a spokeswoman for Kaiser Permanente in Woodland Hills, "the 
biggest medical issue that we're seeing is mental trauma -- post-traumatic 
stress." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no two disasters are alike, and the fallout from the Northridge 
quake -- which federal officials say is the costliest disaster in U.S. history, 
surpassing Andrew's $30-billion toll -- will not precisely mirror that of the 
hurricane. In South Florida, the destruction was concentrated in one area. In 
Southern California, it is scattered across the urban sprawl of Los Angeles 
County and the suburbs of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Although transportation was difficult in the immediate aftermath of Andrew, 
there was nothing on the order of the collapsed freeways that are creating 
nightmarish traffic in Los Angeles. The hurricane, meanwhile, created huge 
amounts of debris -- more than enough to fill a chain of 18-wheel big-rigs 
parked bumper-to-bumper from the Empire State Building to the Golden Gate 
Bridge and back again. Los Angeles' debris problem is not likely to be that 
severe. 
</P>
<P>
 What the two disasters have in common are the huge numbers of people they 
displaced. On this score, residents of South Florida took a harder hit. Andrew 
destroyed 48,000 housing units, leaving an estimated 100,000 homeless. Thus 
far, inspectors in Los Angeles have declared at least 14,500 housing units 
uninhabitable, a figure that does not include damage outside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many people pushed out of their homes, Mayor Riordan was forced, 
reluctantly, to do what officials in South Florida had done: permit the 
military to set up makeshift tent cities. As of Monday, an estimated 3,500 
weary earthquake refugees were living in the four National Guard encampments in 
San Fernando Valley parks, including the one at the Lanark Recreation Center in 
Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida tent city experience was not a positive one. "Tents are not a 
long-term solution," said Andy Menendez, director of homeless programs for Dade 
County. "They are a long-term headache." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who moved into the Florida tent cities brought with them many of the 
problems that plague society: dysfunctional families, substance abuse and 
unemployment. Also, the so-called chronic homeless -- people who lacked housing 
before the storm -- moved in, attracted by free shelter and the promise of 
three meals a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in close quarters, people already traumatized by the storm and the loss 
of their homes were prone to squabbles. Sexual liaisons formed, and that led to 
problems. Sometimes, violence erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 There were three tent cities in South Florida, erected by the military and run 
by FEMA, sheltering 3,000 people. (The Los Angeles tents, although put up by 
the National Guard, are being run by civilians -- the Salvation Army.) The 
South Florida encampments were taken down in November, 1992, more than two 
months after the storm -- too quickly, in Menendez's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, after his office took a survey and found 5,000 people still 
homeless, Dade County got into the tent city business. With borrowed FEMA 
tents, the county re-erected a tent city for 500. But without federal funds or 
military help, the county had to buy ready-to-eat food, provide private 
security, rent portable toilets and pay for day-care services.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the problems with tent cities, Menendez said Dade County would 
have been better off leaving them in place until everyone found permanent 
housing. "The first lesson," Menendez said, "is that regardless of what FEMA or 
anyone else says, those tents should not be dismantled until everyone is 
convinced there is no need." 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of that experience, Riordan staffers say the mayor is determined to 
relocate the displaced and take down the tent cities -- which they call 
"short-term transitional centers" -- as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 With 830 building inspectors fanning out across the quake-devastated region, 
plus "reassurance teams" designed to coax people into going back to apartment 
buildings that have been declared safe, Riordan's office predicts that the 
encampments may come down as soon as next week.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CREWS TOIL NONSTOP TO REBUILD FREEWAYS; ROADS: 
MORE THAN 1,500 WORKERS FAN OUT TO 500 SITES. CALTRANS AND ITS SUBCONTRACTORS 
AWARD 17 REPAIR AND DEMOLITION CONTRACTS.

 Standing on the southbound Golden State Freeway and staring at a 2,000-foot 
gap in what once was a connector bridge from the Antelope Valley Freeway, 
engineer Henry Amigable drew an arm along his brow and gestured at the 
well-orchestrated bustle of his company's heavy machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 A worker in a crane used giant shears to rip away dripping, spaghetti-like 
reinforcement bars hanging off the end of the broken bridge. Crews on the 
ground used hydrohammers to smash fallen concrete slabs into small rocks. 
Bulldozer operators dodged around the defacto obstacle course, loading the 
wreckage of the connector ramp into waiting dump trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the remains," said Amigable of Granite Construction Co., a Caltrans 
subcontractor. "And we're the ones who deal with the remains." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, Amigable and others who deal with such road remains 
struggled to do just that. Some left the wreckage of their own homes to report 
to their jobs; most worked bone-wearying hours, through tremor after tremor on 
unstable and crumbling ground, to begin to put the transit system back together 
again like so many pieces of a giant, fractured maze. 
</P>
<P>
 And all around the construction sites was an urgent reminder of the importance 
of their duties: the excruciatingly long lines of rerouted cars visible to the 
workers as they went about their tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the day the quake crumbled crucial arteries of the city's freeways, more 
than 1,500 workers have fanned out to 500 sites in the city's interstates and 
highways, from the Westside to the West Valley to the Newhall Pass. Their 
mission is to inspect, to rip down and to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first week after the quake, Caltrans and its subcontractors awarded 17 
repair and demolition contracts and identified 12 unsafe bridges, said Caltrans 
spokesman Rick Holland. Seven of those bridges will be shored up and 
restabilized; five are not salvageable and will be ripped down and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The race to restore a sane commute began just after dawn on Jan. 17, with 
crews cleaning and clearing. 
</P>
<P>
 On a fractured one-mile section of the Santa Monica Freeway, demolition crews 
have rapidly torn down and removed more than 70 million pounds of reinforced 
concrete and debris from two collapsed freeway bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't stopped since we started," said Roy Fisher, a Caltrans senior 
bridge engineer and the person responsible for demolition on the Santa Monica 
Freeway. "We've probably done a month's work in a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Nighttime rain and cooler temperatures gave no reprieve. When darkness fell 
and commuters' cars lined up for miles along the freeway's flank, the 12-member 
night crew moved in and pushed on with the task of knocking down the fractured 
Venice Boulevard bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Two crane operators worked side by side, hammering away at the broken bridge. 
Several bulldozers scooped up the fallen blocks of concrete and loaded them 
onto dump trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got soaked, but we worked right through it," said Tony May, 45, who has 
spent the days since the quake loading trucks and digging pits for new freeway 
columns. "It doesn't bother us; work is work. When it rains, it just means you 
get wet." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Fisher, 32, has seen very little of his wife or 17-month-old baby in 
Gardena since the quake. Shifts have been a minimum of 15 hours long. There 
have not been any days off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sleep and dream about this stuff all night and all day," Fisher said. "This 
is my focus, 100%. We won't stop until the job is done." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 a.m., a new 30-member crew arrived and quickly huddled with Fisher to map 
out the day's strategy. Their plan was to work through the night to clear 
Venice Boulevard of debris from the fallen bridge and then reopen it to 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 And they were successful. Fisher and his team were able to clear out the 
broken bridge early Wednesday and expect to reopen Venice Boulevard today. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Los Angeles, on the Golden State Freeway, under the hulk of the broken 
Antelope Valley Freeway connector ramp, crews of 20 Granite Construction 
workers toiled day and night to clean away the broken bridge. After sundown, 
they worked under 10 light towers perched on hillsides above. 
</P>
<P>
 The long hours paid off. Originally projected as a 10-day job, clearing 
instead was finished in four. The freeway break, smoothed over and cleaned of 
its dripping cables, now looks as if it was cleanly cut by a giant knife. 
</P>
<P>
 After the heavy-equipment operators finished their hauling and after the water 
truck drivers moved on to cool down another site, Granite called in the 
services of two last workers with four last pieces of equipment: Trace Boden 
and Oscar Ostos, and their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do a lot with equipment," explained foreman Frank Eppler, on his 
third 12-hour-plus day. "But you can't do it all." 
</P>
<P>
 So Boden, 27, and Ostos, 30, worked their way down the quieted stretch of 
freeway. The pair bent over and scraped at the freeway floor with their hands, 
pulling up leftover bits of stone and twisted metal and tossing them into a 
heap.  
</P>
<P>
 Both men are from Canyon Country. Both lost belongings and bits of their homes 
to the quake and both left the disarray in favor of work. They were 
matter-of-fact about their tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we're out here to do the dirty work," Boden said, using a short break 
to stand up tall, squinting in the bright sun and stretching his long back. 
"It's mostly heavy machinery, then it's us." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the city, six maintenance crews and six bridge crews from 
throughout the state have spent the past week and a half evaluating and 
repairing the shaky above-ground transit ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Perched precariously underneath a buckled and separated connector bridge 
between the Foothill and Golden State freeways, bridge maintenance worker 
Robert Orozco worked his eighth-straight day of 16-hour shifts on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 His home in Sylmar also showed the force of the quake: cracks in every room, a 
separated foundation, treasures collected over the years crushed. Orozco's 
confidence in his wife, who worked at home cleaning up and caring for their 
three children, enabled him to focus on his job despite his fatigue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about my family when I'm at work," Orozco said. "I just know that 
they're in good hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Orozco and four other men were charged with shoring up the bridge, which had 
separated and dropped by several inches at its connector joints. The men used 
timber lifters, as if they were old-fashioned ice block carriers, to together 
hoist up 400-pound, 12-by-12-foot wooden support beams. 
</P>
<P>
 While others worked on the top part of the bridge, filling in cracks and 
replacing strained reinforcement bar, the five men underneath jammed the timber 
beams into the concrete base of the bridge and nailed them down. The beams, 
called bents, are meant to last until the structure can be replaced, explained 
John Hogan, a Caltrans area superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 A mirror image of the two teams was busy at work at the bridge's other 
connection point. 
</P>
<P>
 An aftershock stopped the men on top for just a second, as they looked around 
and reaffirmed that they were safe and that the bridge had stopped shaking like 
a tree branch in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans says that construction workers have suffered no major injuries, in 
spite of the long hours, difficult and dangerous work and a grueling pace. But 
motorists have not been so lucky: early Wednesday, a woman drove off a 22-foot 
portion of the freeway's broken bridge at Fairfax Avenue and a week ago, a 
catering truck driver careened off the broken Antelope Valley Freeway 
connector. Neither was critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling really good all week," said Fisher, the Santa Monica Freeway's 
demolition supervisor. "But I'm a little down right now because this woman flew 
off this bridge. That bugs me. I didn't want to see anybody get hurt on this 
job for any reason, whether it's us or the public. I feel bad about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Out at what used to be the Antelope Valley connector, Eppler, deeply tanned 
and with etched lines around his eyes from years as a Granite Construction 
foreman in the California sun, folded his burly arms across his blue shirt and 
orange safety vest. 
</P>
<P>
 He struggled to find the right words to explain a construction worker's 
attitude at times like these -- why he does what he does and how he finds the 
energy to do it is not something he normally thinks about, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a job to do: Clean up this road and get things back to normal for 
all of us," he finally said. "You work and you put your own personal problems 
behind you. Don't you?"

SALVAGE OPERATION BEGINS IN FILLMORE; QUAKE: A SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM WORKS TO 
RETRIEVE VALUABLE ITEMS FROM STRUCTURES THAT ARE SCHEDULED FOR DEMOLITION SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Trying to save what they can before the wrecking ball falls, a rescue team 
began Wednesday to retrieve valuables from earthquake-damaged businesses in 
Fillmore that are scheduled for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Fillmore city officials, an Urban Search and Rescue Unit of 
58 firefighters from San Diego County arrived in the city early Wednesday with 
the task of salvaging items from 14 buildings that the city plans to tear down. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue team will have to work fast. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure residents' safety and to protect nearby buildings in case any 
damaged structures collapse, Fillmore officials have ordered that demolition be 
completed by the end of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue workers' first job Wednesday was to retrieve a large, brand-new 
refrigerated compartment from a tiny flower shop on Central Avenue that was 
devastated by the earthquake. And this morning the team plans to salvage some 
of the $300,000 worth of medical equipment stranded in a now-closed clinic for 
low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 All owners of buildings doomed to demolition will have the chance to give 
rescue workers a wish list of valuables to be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all residents or business owners will have their wishes fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Following engineers' inspections early Wednesday, rescue team leaders quickly 
ruled out conducting salvage operations at three downtown buildings that are 
deemed too dangerous to enter: the Fillmore Theater, the Masonic Building and 
the Fillmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Some former residents of the Fillmore Hotel had asked city officials for help 
retrieving immigration documents left in the building after the quake, which 
toppled an entire wall of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Black, a technical team manager for the rescue unit, said the hotel 
building was simply too perilous for his workers to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I basically just wrote that off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the rescue team's decision on the hotel, Fillmore Fire Chief Pat 
Asken said city workers will attempt to demolish the hotel one section at a 
time to allow retrieval of papers and other valuables left by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to selectively demolish it," Asken said. "Some of those things 
people can't go on with their lives without." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 80 people who lived at the hotel were migrant workers who may need 
their immigration documents to prove that they are in the country legally, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue unit leaders said they would send workers into the hotel, theater or 
Masonic Building if it were necessary to save a person's life, but not to 
salvage papers or other goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would do that for life but we wouldn't do it for equipment," said John 
Hale, a technical team manager with the rescue unit. "Safety is the most 
important issue. Everybody that goes in we want them to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in buildings deemed safe for salvage operations, rescue workers take 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Fillmore Flower Shop, for example, rescue workers would not enter the 
building until they first knocked off all the bricks remaining on the parapet 
above the store's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because half of the parapet was torn away in the quake, rescue team leaders 
said they were concerned that loose bricks would fall on workers as they 
entered the building. 
</P>
<P>
 At other buildings that are in worse shape than the flower shop, the rescue 
team will erect wood supports to hold up falling walls or sagging ceilings long 
enough for firefighters to get in and out of the structures safely. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue team worked on the Fillmore Flower Shop first because they 
considered it a relatively easy job. They succeeded in removing most of the 
cooler by Wednesday night and planned to finish the job today.  
</P>
<P>
 But they will turn to the Fillmore Family Clinic next because of the clinic's 
value to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Run by the Oxnard-based nonprofit agency Clinicas del Camino Real Inc., the 
clinic served 1,500 to 1,800 low-income clients each month before it was 
damaged in the quake, clinic manager Roberto Rojas said. Now clinic workers are 
serving patients from two trailers in a church parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rojas watched the rescue team descend on Fillmore's tiny but devastated 
downtown district Wednesday, he said he is eager to salvage X-ray machines, 
examination tables and other items from the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he wishes he had more time for retrieving the equipment and 
clearing out the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rojas said he agrees with city officials that the clinic must be torn 
down, he doesn't understand why the demolition must take place so soon and he 
plans to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating that we can't have as much time as we like to get our 
equipment out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that all owners of buildings condemned to be torn down are 
welcome to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all merchants sympathized with Rojas' frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business owners whose buildings withstood the earthquake said they are 
eager to see ruined structures leveled so that the protective fencing that has 
been erected around the entire downtown district can be removed and life can 
return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once it's over with it'll probably be better," said Harvey Patterson, the 
74-year-old proprietor of Patterson Hardware, which is across Central Avenue 
from the Fillmore Family Clinic. "I want to get the mess cleaned up and get 
back to work. When the junk is out of here they can start rebuilding."

REPORT FAILS TO IDENTIFY CAUSE OF OXNARD OIL SPILL; ENVIRONMENT: BERRY 
PETROLEUM STUDY ALSO DOES NOT ADDRESS HOW THE ACCIDENT WENT UNNOTICED FOR THREE 
DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A report issued by Berry Petroleum, the Taft-based oil company responsible for 
one of the worst pipeline spills in Ventura County history, fails to address 
what triggered the spill and how it went undetected for three days, state 
investigators said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-page document, which said the cause of the rupture is still unknown, 
was submitted to the Regional Water Quality Control Board after the oil company 
received a two-week extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there are a few things that need to be figured out," said Shirley 
Birosik, a state water quality investigator. "I will be asking for a 
supplemental report that would include more information." 
</P>
<P>
 But a Berry Petroleum official on Wednesday said the report represents all of 
the information about the spill the company has been able to piece together. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 84,000 gallons of thick crude leaked from an underground pipeline 
into ecologically sensitive McGrath Lake and the ocean near Oxnard, after at 
least six law enforcement agencies failed to follow up early reports of the 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruptured pipeline spewed heavy crude for at least three days before a 
federal Minerals Management Service worker spotted offshore oil slicks early 
Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 21 report downplays the effects of the crude oil on the environment, 
concluding that roughly a quarter-acre of reed and marshland was damaged and 
that "the effects were limited to transient visual impacts." 
</P>
<P>
 The state released copies of the report Wednesday after consulting its 
attorneys and investigators. It concludes that there is no apparent or 
potential ground water contamination attributable to the spill, and that it has 
caused no known public health risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Winn, the Berry Petroleum environmental coordinator who prepared the 
analysis, listed more than 215 birds and other species that died after the 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he wrote, "It is important to note that it has not been established that 
the attached list represents species killed as a result of the (oil) release." 
He declined Wednesday to discuss his findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead birds include two California brown pelicans, which are on the federal 
government's list of endangered species. However, one of the two was found 
badly decomposed and likely died from other causes, Winn reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Caywood, the state Department of Fish and Game inspector heading the 
investigation, also called the report incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 "It lacks some fortitude as far as exact cause and responsibility and not 
noticing (leakage) for a prolonged period of time," said Caywood, who by April 
will recommend to local prosecutors whether criminal charges should be brought 
against Berry officials.  
</P>
<P>
 "However, it's quite normal to get kind of a wimpy (report)," he said. 
"They're not going to put anything in writing as long as there's a chance of 
litigation. It's normal that when anything can be litigated, you keep your 
mouth shut and let the attorneys do the talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Caywood said he already knows much about why Berry failed to shut down the 
pipeline for "a period of days," but declined to discuss the ongoing 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got answers, but I can't say they're entirely satisfactory," said 
Caywood, who said the cleanup may be signed off by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 An oil company official said Wednesday he had no idea how workers failed to 
notice for three days that the oil was not reaching its designated holding 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we have an answer to that we'll address it to the agencies and it will 
become available," said spokesman Ray Hatch. "All the information that we have 
is in the letter we sent to the regional water board." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators first suspected that interference from nearby pipelines equipped 
with electric safety devices hastened the break because Berry Petroleum never 
installed one of the units on the ruptured pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathodic protection devices emit small electric currents that help prevent 
external corrosion, but they are not always required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 An official with the state division of oil and gas said earlier this month 
that the top two likely reasons for the break were structural failure or 
internal corrosion, symptoms unrelated to electrical interference. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the oil has been cleaned up from the different spill sites. On 
Wednesday, a crew of workers manned a single boat on the lake surface, 
apparently gathering samples from the lake bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Togstad, a fish and game environmental specialist, said cleanup crews 
now are concentrating their efforts on the creek and upper portion of the tiny, 
10-acre lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are cutting vegetation from the entire perimeter of the lake," she said. 
"Entire trees have been taken out of the creek to remove oily debris, sediment 
and roots." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rojas, chief ranger for the Channel Coast District of California State 
Parks, said experts are now evaluating how best to remove oil that has settled 
to the bottom of McGrath Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we don't yet know how to do it, whether we should try to dredge it out, 
suction it out or drain the lake and remove it that way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Birosik, the water quality investigator, said she would request a supplemental 
report from Berry Petroleum early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm eventually going to get the information," she said.

GOVERNING BODY STUDIED FOR AIRSTRIP; POINT MUGU: SOME EXECUTIVE MEMBERS OF THE 
PANEL EXAMINING POSSIBLE CIVILIAN USE OF THE NAVY RUNWAY CALL THE IDEA 
PREMATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Although the feasibility of civilian passenger and cargo flights at Point Mugu 
Naval Air Station has yet to be determined, a countywide committee studying the 
idea may establish a governing authority to run the proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
 But the concept of establishing such an authority -- proposed by some on the 
70-member study committee -- was criticized by several members of its executive 
panel during a meeting Wednesday at Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "This seems to me to be putting the cart before the horse," said Ventura 
County Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, a member of the executive panel. "What has 
given you folks the sense that we're in the rush mode here?" 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk and other executive committee members called the idea premature 
until a feasibility study on civilian use of the Point Mugu airfield is 
completed. Even then, they said, the Navy would have to sign off on the 
proposal before it could proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a governing authority now, they said, could send a misleading signal 
to the public that the proposal was a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing VanderKolk was Camarillo City Councilwoman Charlotte Craven. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be sending a very strong signal that this thing has been approved," 
Craven said. "And, clearly, that's not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Assn. of Governments is conducting the feasibility 
study on civilian use of the Navy's 11,000-foot airstrip. The study is being 
funded by a $150,000 grant provided by the Federal Aviation Administration and 
is due to be released in late March. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Navy first proposed possible civilian use of its facility, Capt. 
Tom Boothe, the Navy's top-ranking representative on the committee, said Navy 
approval of the concept is not a foregone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once this committee gets its act together, (this proposal) will have to go up 
the chain of command for approval," Boothe said. "So far, we have received a 
lot of vertical nods and no horizontal nods on this thing. Maria's right, 
though, there is no formal approval for this project yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea to establish the so-called "joint powers authority" came from a 
subcommittee on organizational structure led by former Oxnard City Manager 
Vernon Hazen and attorney Wayne Lemieux. As proposed, the authority would be 
made up of representatives from Ventura County and the cities of Thousand Oaks, 
Camarillo, Oxnard, Ventura and Port Hueneme along with the Oxnard Harbor 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both Hazen and Lemieux said that by contacting potential members of such an 
authority now, vital time could be saved later if the feasibility study reaches 
favorable conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea behind this is to save time," Hazen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive panel members decided on a go-slow approach. They directed Hazen and 
Lemieux to sound out representatives of the county, city managers of the five 
cities and representatives of the harbor district on the authority idea and 
report their findings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, SCAG spokesman Tim Merwin said that the first phase of the 
feasibility report -- once expected in February -- will be delayed a month 
because analysts need more time to research radar capacity, missile range 
scheduling and other details. The report is now due to reach the full committee 
in late March. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will next meet March 2 at the County Department of Airports 
offices in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials first proposed sharing their Point Mugu runway with commercial 
passenger and cargo carriers early last year. A steady decline in military 
flights has left the airfield with flight time available. Selling flight time 
could help the Navy defray the costs of running the naval air station, but 
opponents fear that it could lead to development of a full-scale regional 
airport.

JUDGE DELAYS BOY'S MURDER ARRAIGNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Wednesday murder arraignment for a 16-year-old Fillmore boy was delayed 
until Feb. 4 -- against the objection of a prosecutor who said gang friends of 
the suspect have threatened key witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Allan L. Steele appointed a new attorney to represent Armando Murillo, 
who will be tried as an adult, and granted the delay to give the lawyer time to 
prepare for court. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele said the extra time was needed in order for attorney James M. Farley of 
Ventura to review court and police records in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Murillo is charged with murder in connection with the stabbing death of 
Rodolfo Molina Mora, 27. The victim died after an altercation with the 
defendant in the 700 block of Blaine Street in Fillmore on Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley argued against delaying the arraignment. 
The prosecutor described Murillo as a gang member and said the boy's associates 
have made numerous threats to the people who witnessed the Mora stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Murillo's friends pleaded guilty in juvenile court on Tuesday to 
witness intimidation in connection with the case, Frawley told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Frawley said the only person so far charged with intimidating a 
witness is that juvenile. He declined to discuss the specifics of that case 
because of the age of the defendant, and would not specify what threats were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Frawley did say of the witnesses: "Everyone feels incredibly 
intimidated because of the defendants' friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators in the case could not be reached for comment Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Murillo, who is being detained at Juvenile Hall, stood at the defense table 
next to attorney Joel B. Steinfeld, who appeared on Farley's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinfeld told Steele the defense needed the extra time because it had not yet 
read police reports or the grand jury transcript in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached later, Farley said the judge made the right decision in granting the 
delay. He also said Murillo cannot be making the threats because he is behind 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously it's not my client doing any intimidation -- he's in jail," Farley 
said. "If my client is not doing it, how is it accomplishing anything by not 
allowing an attorney to prepare for a case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a murder case," Farley said. "The case has to be investigated. It has 
to be looked at. I'm sorry if there are problems on the street, but that's for 
law enforcement to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Stephen P. Lipson, who represented Murillo when the 
case was still in juvenile court, said he saw no evidence that his former 
client was a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is everyone is lumped into the same category," Lipson said. 
"Every Mexican kid in Fillmore is called a gang member. Every black kid in 
South-Central L.A. is called a gang member." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lipson said he can believe that some of the witnesses in the case are 
feeling uneasy. But he blamed that on "the code" of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The code is you don't cooperate with the police," he said. "A lot of people 
might be afraid. But to somehow place that on the back of a 16-year-old is to 
give him more credit than is due."

ELECTIONS / BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; SIMI COUNCILWOMAN CHALLENGES HOWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley City Councilwoman Barbara Williamson on Wednesday announced her 
bid for county supervisor, emerging as the first candidate to challenge 
incumbent Vicky Howard in the June election. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by half a dozen supporters on a scrubby hillside overlooking the city, 
Williamson criticized her opponent for indecisiveness on the county budget and 
for permitting trash from elsewhere in Southern California to be dumped at the 
Simi Valley Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our county supervisor has lost touch with this community," said Williamson, 
48, a banking executive. "The supervisor's job is to know the concerns of the 
people 365 days a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who refused to comment on Williamson's criticisms, questioned the 
timeliness of launching a campaign when many residents are struggling to 
recover from the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she wants to run around and campaign, that's fine," said Howard, 60, a 
former Simi Valley councilwoman who is in her first term as supervisor. "But 
I'm going to take care of the needs of people who have been hurt by this 
terrible disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark City Councilman Scott Montgomery, 40, who is considering a run for 
the 4th District seat, criticized both Howard and Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vicky's weakness is leadership, while Barbara is stronger in leadership but 
much weaker in experience," Montgomery said. "The ideal candidate would offer 
both." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he plans to announce a decision within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Inaugurating her candidacy in front of a red, white and blue campaign sign 
hammered into the hillside, Williamson touted her role in defeating a measure 
to allow the construction of a Wal-Mart store on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure you have read articles comparing this fight with Wal-Mart to that of 
David and Goliath," Williamson said. "But I will step in front no matter how 
difficult the issue may seem, because the issue is leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 If elected to the board, Williamson said, she would work quickly to stem the 
flow of out-of-county trash to the Simi Valley Landfill and ensure that revenue 
from the half-cent sales tax is spent beefing up police and fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time we got someone at the county level who can clean things up and 
focus on the needs of the people," Williamson said. "I think I'm the one for 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson was elected to the City Council a little more than a year ago, 
along with incumbent Bill Davis, from a field of 13 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 She has worked on the campaigns of U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) 
and state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) -- both former Simi council 
members. She also worked on Davis' failed bid to unseat Howard in the last 
supervisorial race. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said she plans to raise between $80,000 and $100,000 to campaign 
for the 4th District seat, which serves residents in Moorpark, Simi, Somis and 
the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said she would quit her job as a vice president at Simi Valley Bank 
if elected to the Board of Supervisors. As a supervisor, she would make $64,543 
in salary and between $10,000 and $20,000 in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the supporters attending Williamson's press conference were three 
officers of the Service Employees International Union Local 998, which 
represents 4,200 county workers, including clerks and secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director Barry Hammitt said he supports Williamson because he likes 
her quick, decisive style and is tired of tussling with Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammitt, an outspoken critic of pay raises granted to the county's top 
officials in October, was sharply critical of Howard, who supported the raises. 
</P>
<P>
 "She says some employees get raises while others will have to be laid off and 
we'll do it based on merit," Hammitt said. "We say what is merit? She says I 
don't know, I'm going to have to think about it."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; TOLL FROM QUAKE REACHES $25 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Burbank suffered $25 million in damage from the Northridge 
earthquake, which has also closed the freeways and driven up the numbers of 
commuters who now use the city as a key transportation link. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is responding with grants to homeowners and no-interest loans to 
businesses until federal assistance arrives and also is revamping parking for 
the Metrolink station in Burbank, while increasing security and handling other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Total daily ridership on the Metrolink train into Burbank has jumped from 600 
to 6,000, said city planner Rick Pruetz. Bus and shuttle services connecting 
with the station also have increased dramatically, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council on Tuesday approved $200,000 in community development 
block grant funds to be split between no-interest loans for businesses and 
grants for residents made homeless by the earthquake. Residents can get up to 
$2,500 each, the same amount is available for small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The business loan would be repaid after the owner gets federal or other 
assistance, but the loan would be forgiven if the help does not come through, 
Community Development Director Bob Tague said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank's emergency operations center was closed Wednesday and city inspectors 
had nearly completed checking 2,650 buildings that had been inspected. Of 
those, 21 buildings were declared unsafe, and 160 were listed as having limited 
access, meaning that only part of the structure has been occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the damage was in the Magnolia Park neighborhood of Burbank, in the 
city's flat section, particularly near the intersection of Hollywood Way and 
Magnolia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every merchant sustained broken windows along Hollywood Way," said Carolyn 
Berlin, leader of a neighborhood association actively involved in city issues. 
"Had the quake lasted a few more seconds, there would have been a lot more 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
 "The doors of my office were sheared off at the hinges," said David Gordon, a 
Magnolia Park optometrist, who reopened for business shortly after the 
earthquake. "I'm still one of the lucky ones; I'm not complaining." 
</P>
<P>
 At the American Red Cross shelter at McCambridge Park, about 150 earthquake 
victims were still staying overnight, said Steve Goldfarb, the Burbank chapter 
of the Red Cross health and safety service coordinator. On Tuesday, the Red 
Cross started shuttling those in the shelters to a service center at 2600 West 
Victory Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 At the service center, the Red Cross finds out what each quake victim needs 
and how each can best be helped and get new housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting people from North Hollywood, Northridge and from all over Los 
Angeles," Goldfarb said. The Red Cross also has scheduled a free earthquake 
seminar at the Media City Center Mall from 6 to 7:30 p.m. Friday, which will 
include a psychologist who will explain how to help children through the 
crisis. Editor's Note

 This is one in a series of Focus reports spotlighting individual Valley 
communities and how they are faring in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 earthquake.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; THE POOR NOW FACE MOUNTING DESPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the rifts that actually narrowed after the Northridge earthquake was 
the one in Pacoima that lies between barely making it and desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 people waited for a bag of food or an appointment with doctors 
inside a motor home in front of the shattered office of the El Proyecto del 
Barrio social service group on Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife is inside," said Miguel Angel Avalos, 39, an unemployed machinist who 
left his native Durango, Mexico in 1972. "She's a little nervous, and her head 
and back hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Avalos, his wife, and two children moved into a garage last year to save rent 
money. He gets by with help from his siblings, he said, but now they too need 
help.  
</P>
<P>
 Avalos' story was all too familiar for workers at El Proyecto del Barrio, 
which has served as a hub of disaster assistance for Pacoima's predominantly 
Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
 El Proyecto is set up to provide medical help to about 35 people a day. Now it 
serves about 100 per day in the parking lot in front of the building, said 
Corrie Alvarez, administrator of the clinic. Inspectors placed a yellow tag on 
the structure itself, limiting access.  
</P>
<P>
 Local hospitals and national aid groups have since come through with badly 
needed antibiotics, vitamins and insulin, but all of those are running short 
again, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular worry is the insulin, which needs to be refrigerated, said 
Alvarez. And statistically, the Latino population has a higher rate of diabetes 
than the population at large, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on Pacoima's residential streets, tents remain in yards. Many recent 
immigrants still fear going back into buildings, recalling the un-reinforced 
structures that tumbled during earthquakes in Mexico and Central America, 
Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most businesses along Van Nuys Boulevard were back in operation this week, but 
they lacked customers. Monica Gonzalez figured she would sell a lot of 
second-hand clothes, furniture and household goods from her store, Ney Segunda 
Mano, at Van Nuys Boulevard and San Fernando Road. But she has been bored 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying they're going back to their countries, or moving to places 
they think are safer," she said. "Business is dying." GEOFFREY MOHAN LOS

WEST: RESEDA; QUAKE DEALT BLOW TO REVITALIZATION EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plywood on windows is not an unfamiliar sight in Reseda. Long before the 
ground started shaking Jan. 17, some property owners were favoring wood to 
cover up not earthquake damage but simple neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the same activists who used to complain that plywood was blight find 
themselves surrounded by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of broken glass and a lot of frightened people," said Rayna 
Gabin, field deputy for City Councilwoman Laura Chick.  
</P>
<P>
 In Reseda, the earthquake has dealt a formidable blow to efforts to revitalize 
Reseda's declining shopping area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were desperately trying to get ourselves back on track as being a safe 
place to shop," lamented Steve Aufhauser, part owner of Continental Art Supply 
on Reseda Boulevard. "Now, when people drive by and see (boarded-up windows) 
are they really going to say this is a safe place?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city officials, 142 of the 1,143 buildings inspected so far 
in the West Valley City Council District that includes Reseda have been 
determined to be unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially hard hit were apartment complexes. More than a third of the 
dwelling units inspected so far in the same area have been deemed unsafe, and 
several blocks of Sherman Way and Reseda Boulevard are lined with the building 
department's ominous red and yellow tags.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of Reseda's old-timers see a silver lining. Gabin said she hopes 
that the quake will bring a needed revamping of older, decrepit storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners, who met in an informational session Tuesday night, talked of 
using federal disaster relief money to rebuild Reseda into a quainter, more 
upscale version of itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to try to create a theme, like maybe Old Pasadena," said Gabin, 
displaying the heady optimism of Reseda's most enthusiastic boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake, said Aufhauser, will succeed where relentless community 
pressure has failed: Those who have refused to properly maintain their 
buildings must now repair them or tear them down. The result will be the 
weeding out of the most unsightly of his neighbors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Kinzle, executive director of the Reseda Chamber of Commerce, said she 
also sees hope in a change of attitude in Reseda since the earthquake. In the 
past, revitalization efforts have been plagued by apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the road toward a more high-rent Reseda is likely to be a long one. Across 
the street from the flower shop and upholstery shop, pawnshops and 
check-cashing stores -- businesses frowned upon by many of Reseda's older 
business people -- have pluckily reopened, their hand-painted signs belying 
broken glass and shattered plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the earthquake seems to have united Reseda's ethnically diverse 
business community and inspired them to pursue common goals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pulling together and really getting to know each other," she said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; FAST-TRACK BUSINESS RELOCATION

 Out-of-town businesses looking to relocate in Thousand Oaks due to 
earthquake-related damage can receive one-stop permitting and help navigating 
the area's commercial real estate market, Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is primarily aimed at businesses needing space from the San Fernando 
Valley," said Steve Rubenstein, president of the Chamber of Commerce, which 
will be the site of the special emergency assistance office."Whether they're 
looking for office or industrial space, we will fast-track everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber has teamed up with the city of Thousand Oaks and the local utility 
companies to offer businesses new to the area a variety of services in one 
office that they otherwise would have to make many calls to obtain. The 
services are for businesses planning temporary or permanent relocation.  
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison, Southern California Gas Co. and GTE all have 
agreed to give service priority to relocating businesses, attempting to install 
services within 48 hours of the company's request. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber will provide information on the city and connect the businesses to 
commercial real estate brokers who can help them find facilities to lease or 
purchase. The city will allow one-stop permitting -- usually handled at city 
offices -- to be done at the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is the greatest enemy to destruction of a business," said Gary 
Heathcote, the chamber's president, speaking of the assistance effort at 
Tuesday's City Council meeting. "Orders need to be fulfilled, services need to 
be performed, and this can only happen with great speed and organized 
assistance on our part." 
</P>
<P>
 More information is available by calling the chamber, 499-1993. CONSTANCE

toxic substances that were damaged in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection centers, approved Tuesday by the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors and coordinated by the county's General Services Agency and Waste 
Management Department, will be open through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The waste collection centers will accept motor oil, paint solvents, auto 
batteries, household cleaners, pesticides, fertilizers, antifreeze and other

at Central Avenue and Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents can take hazardous waste to the Simi Valley Library,

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PARKING FEE BACKED FOR CIVIC ARTS 
PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing the need to establish a balanced budget, the Civic Theaters Commission 
on Wednesday endorsed the idea of charging a parking fee during performances in 
the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 A $4 fee for parking in the multilevel garage would bring in annual revenues 
of roughly $200,000.That sum represents nearly one-quarter of the theaters' 
projected operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 A parking fee could generate as much revenue each year as a 
multimillion-dollar endowment, said Tom Mitze, executive director of the 
theaters. Money from the parking fee would subsidize tickets for senior 
citizens and students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been charged with making this thing fly without any subsidy from the 
city," said Virginia Davis, who chairs the seven-member theaters commission. 
"This parking fee is one of the things we have to do" to achieve a balanced 
budget, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Elois Zeanah said she worried that even a nominal parking fee, 
tacked on to ticket prices that could run up to $50, might deter some Thousand 
Oaks residents from attending shows when the auditorium opens in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want it to be self-sustaining," Zeanah said, "yet I want it to be 
affordable. I don't want it to be elitist." 
</P>
<P>
 The parking fee would be assessed only for major performances in the 
1,800-seat auditorium. Visitors to City Hall would not pay for parking.

<P>
 Michelle Quist and Nish Baakza will be honored this evening as the Conejo 
Valley Chamber of Commerce's Outstanding Teen Volunteers of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of them were very focused on how they are giving back to their 
community," said Woody Brokenburr, the chamber's membership vice chairman and 
interim chairman of the awards committee. Brokenburr said the chamber 
considered seven candidates for the award, finally coming to a tie vote on 
Michelle, a Thousand Oaks High School senior, and Nish, a senior at Westlake 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle, 18, estimates that she volunteers six to eight hours each week for a 
variety of organizations, including the Special Olympics, Los Robles Regional 
Medical Center in Thousand Oaks and the Hospice of the Conejo. In addition, she 
works 15 hours a week as a teller at Bank of America, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She began volunteering in seventh grade, when she and her mother joined the 
National Charity League, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle feels she often gets more from her volunteer work than she gives. 
"The kids at the Special Olympics, they make me realize the importance of a 
smile," she said. "And the hospital -- well, it doesn't take a lot from me, but 
it does a lot for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nish, 17, also volunteers at Los Robles, running errands for doctors and 
nurses, delivering medication and bringing flowers to patients. In addition, 
she volunteers with the Special Olympics and counsels peers at her high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Nish began volunteering at the hospital in the ninth grade because she was 
planning on a career in medicine. Last year, she was trained in an oncology 
volunteer program and now works with cancer patients in addition to her regular 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "My older brother passed away 3 1/2 years ago from brain cancer," she said. 
"That gave me strength to work with the cancer patients and their families. I'd 
already been through it and that's what made me strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber officials will present the awards to the girls at tonight's mixer, 
starting at 5 p.m. at the Terrace Caffe, 105 Brazil St., in Thousand Oaks. 
Admission is $2 for members and $5 for non-members. For more information, call 
the chamber at 499-1993. CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PANEL FORMED TO AID DAMAGED LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of Thousand Oaks have formed a committee to raise money for the 
Thousand Oaks Library, which suffered $2 million in damage during last week's 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, which will be made up of members from Friends of the Thousand 
Oaks Library and the library's fund-raising foundation, hopes to raise $250,000 
to help pay for repairs not covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've created the committee to pay for things that fall through the cracks," 
library director Marvin Smith said. "Insurance will cover some of this and some 
will be covered by our FEMA application, but there will undoubtedly be expenses 
that go uncovered." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the damage to the 12-year-old building occurred when metal ceiling 
panels collapsed, rupturing sprinkler pipes and crashing down on books and 
shelves. Nearly the entire children's book collection was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah, who suggested the fund-raising committee, said the 
outpouring of support for the library has been enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after the earthquake, I had just come out from a tour of the library 
and a man came up to me who was returning some books," Zeanah recalled. "Right 
on the spot, he wanted to contribute $100." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said the interest is not surprising, considering the library has an 
average of 2,000 visitors a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major cultural and recreational resource for the city," she said. 
"People here are committed to restoring it to the way it was." MATTHEW MOSK

 The Ventura Fire Department is scheduled to honor Darrell Kays as Firefighter 
of the Year at its annual Employee Recognition Night at City Hall tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an exemplary firefighter," said Jeff Wiens, a spokesman for the 
72-member department."He works his rear end off." 
</P>
<P>
 Kays said he was surprised and pleased by the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor because it comes from the other employees, not management," 
Kays said. "I like serving the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Kays, 33, joined the department in 1981 and is responsible for testing pumps 
on the department's fire engines. Kays, an engine driver, also does rescue 
work, helps construct maps for the department and maintains breathing 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recognition awards are also scheduled to be distributed. The event, 
which is free, begins at 6:30 p.m. in the Community Meeting Room at City Hall, 
501 Poli St. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; FBI IDENTIFIES BANK ROBBERY SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI officials on Wednesday identified two of three suspects in a Ventura 
takeover bank robbery as a 15-year-old male from Los Angeles and an 18-year-old 
Denver woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The third suspect, a male in his late 20s or 30s, remained in serious 
condition at Santa Paula Memorial Hospital after being struck by a 
tractor-trailer rig on California 126 as he scrambled to flee from police, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the second man has not yet been positively identified, FBI Special 
Agent Larry Dick said investigators believe the suspects have "some gang 
affiliations." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Shoente Lynn McKinzie, is suspected of driving the getaway car. She 
had been staying with an aunt in Los Angeles, Dick said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinzie is being held in County Jail on $20,000 bail but is expected to be 
transferred to federal custody today and to face federal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery occurred shortly after 11 a.m. Tuesday when two men burst into the 
Bank of America at 2698 E. Main St. and ordered customers and employees to get 
down on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 One man wearing a nylon stocking over his head waved a sawed-off 12-gauge 
shotgun around the room while the other leaped over the counter and scooped 
money from tellers' stations into a pillowcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick estimated that the suspects were in the bank about a minute before they 
escaped in a rented Cadillac with a Nevada license plate. All three were 
captured after being spotted by a CHP officer and abandoning their car inside a 
Fillmore mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
 As they dashed across California 126 toward downtown Fillmore, the one suspect 
was hit by the truck. McKinzie stayed with him, while the 15-year-old continued 
running north for 300 yards before being caught.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the second takeover bank robbery in Ventura County this month. The 
other one occurred Jan. 5 at the American Savings Bank on South A Street in 
Oxnard. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; BUSINESSMAN NAMED NEW CHAMBER LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard businessman Don Facciano has been named executive director of the 
Oxnard Chamber of Commerce after the resignation of Penny Hoffman, chamber 
officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Facciano, 57, who recently ended a 35-year career with Sears, Roebuck & Co., 
will assume his new duties Feb. 22.Hoffman's last day is Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make this a continuous flow," said Facciano, a longtime chamber 
member. "We are not going to drop a step, we are not going to pause the 
momentum that has been gathered under Penny." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman, who became executive director of the chamber last May, said she 
resigned her post after her husband, Eric, accepted a position as president and 
partner of a Kansas City pharmaceutical company. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman said she has applied for an executive director's position at a small 
chamber of commerce in the Kansas City area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was obviously something that was not planned," Hoffman said of her 
departure. "We thought we would be in California forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman said she is most proud of the chamber's role in reopening the city's 
tourism bureau and of the effort to put the chamber office under the same roof 
as the newly formed Greater Oxnard Economic Development Corp. and the Greater 
Oxnard and Harbors Tourism Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Those three agencies will be housed at Oxnard's Heritage Square starting March 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was just starting to make a little bit of a difference," she said. 
"Now I don't get to stay to see the fruits of my labor." FRED ALVAREZ

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; AGRICULTURAL LAND DEAL TO RECEIVE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura City Council subcommittee on Wednesday recommended considering the 
rezoning of 87 acres of city-owned agricultural land to permit residential 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura-based developer Ron Hertel wants to swap agricultural land that he 
owns with the city's land and put up single-family houses on the city land at 
Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue.In exchange, Hertel would give Ventura $2 
million to build a park on 92 acres of celery fields that he owns at Telephone 
and Kimball roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an agreement would contradict the city's Comprehensive Plan, which calls 
for both areas to remain agriculturally zoned. If the council wishes, it can 
amend the Comprehensive Plan to accommodate Hertel's land proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members said they like Hertel's idea, but no deal has been 
finalized yet. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the housing subcommittee of the council recommended with little 
discussion that the council consider changing the zoning on the city's 
property. The council is scheduled to vote on the zone change Feb. 14. PEGGY Y.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CITY DELAYS ACTION ON KRISHNAMURTI SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council has delayed a proposed land deal with the Krishnamurti 
Foundation of America, opting to await the outcome of a statewide ballot that 
would allocate almost $2 billion to buy parklands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Krishnamurti Foundation asked the City Council to acquire the development 
rights to a 72-acre lot the group owns in exchange for permission to build 12 
to 15 residential units on a smaller parcel nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members, under intense pressure from dozens of audience members at 
Tuesday night's meeting, refused the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard nothing of any urgency that would encourage action until after 
that time," Councilman James D. Loebl said before making a motion to delay any 
action until after the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Stasse, who represents the foundation, said his client has no intention 
of developing the site any time soon. He said the group was approached by 
county planners in the midst of an area plan update and asked to submit 
land-use recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ojai is involved only because the land abuts the city borders and 
is included in the Ojai sphere of influence. It would need to be annexed by the 
city if it is developed.  
</P>
<P>
 The June ballot would ask voters to approve bonds of almost $2 billion to buy 
and preserve open space. Ojai would receive $3 million if the initiative 
passes, money that would be spent to purchase the Krishnamurti site if the 
foundation is willing to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Steve Olsen said that if voters fail to approve the bond, the city 
should investigate passing its own local bond to finance acquisition of the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 The acreage lies just north of California 33 by the city's western boundary 
and is considered by residents to be an attractive entryway to the city. JEFF

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; COUNCIL SEEKS DELAY IN RADAR TOWER USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of a microwave radar tower have enlisted the aid of the Ojai City 
Council to help prevent a 98-foot weather-tracking station from being switched 
on next month. 
</P>
<P>
 After an unscheduled presentation at Tuesday night's meeting, the City Council 
voted to consider the matter as an urgency item because the system is scheduled 
to be turned on Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted unanimously to send a letter to federal officials 
requesting that more detailed health studies be performed before the government 
switches on the system. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Sulpher Mountain Road residents has sued the federal government for 
what they say is the government's failure to properly notify them of the 
project or conduct adequate tests to determine the tower's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acknowledge that the system emits low-level radiation that some 
studies have linked to leukemia.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need your help on this," Patricia Givner told the council. "This thing is 
big, it's dangerous and it's got to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than oppose the project outright, the council decided to direct staff 
to write a letter urging the government to delay turning the tower on until 
more analyses have been done. JEFF McDONALD

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SHARING OFF TO A CHAOTIC START; EDUCATION: 
ROYAL OPENS ITS DOORS TO CROSS-TOWN RIVAL SIMI HIGH, WHICH WAS DAMAGED IN THE 
QUAKE. STUDENT REACTION IS MIXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, Simi Valley High School senior Jamin Huber arrived early 
for classes at Royal High School. Not that he was excited about the rival 
schools sharing a campus for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamin was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after school let out for Royal High students at 11:35 a.m., Jamin and 
his friends looked at a class list posted on the library window and then 
scanned a campus map posted nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in (Room) 9-2. Where is that?" the 17-year-old asked. "I don't know where 
I'm going. I can't believe -- my senior year at Royal. I just hope I don't have 
to graduate here." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials don't know how long the two schools will have to operate on a 
split shift under the same roof. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least a few weeks, until quake damage at Simi High can be repaired, 
Royal students will continue to start one hour early, at 7 a.m., and get out 
before noon so that Simi High can hold afternoon classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should do it all year," said Aida Robles, 17, a junior at Royal 
who gave the thumbs up to shorter 40-minute classes as she headed home at 
midday. 
</P>
<P>
 The controlled but chaotic transformation from Royal High to Simi High 
occurred within a 45-minute buffer between classes. Shortly after Royal 
students and teachers poured out of the campus, the Simi students began to 
arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi High teachers came early for a staff meeting in the library, each 
toting identical boxes containing class lists and other materials supplied by 
school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Math teacher Don Kyle said he was happy to be back at work as he settled into 
his temporary room to welcome his first-period class. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my desk," he said, waving his arm toward the small white box holding 
a dearth of materials. "We don't know what we're going to do for books right 
now. But we're just going to do what has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Doug Crosse dubbed the scene "Simi Royal High School." 
Others blended the names of the two schools' mascots -- the Simi Valley 
Pioneers and the Royal Highlanders -- to create the hybrid "Pioneering 
Highlanders." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this has brought the community together," said Vicki Spilka, 
president of the Parent Teacher Student Assn. at Royal, who helped direct the 
Simi High students around campus. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of the students agreed. Kim Vanbuskirk, 16, stood in front of 
Royal waiting for friends to arrive and avoiding going inside for as long as 
possible. She wanted to return to school, she said, "but not at Royal." 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend, Arianne Hartlove, agreed. "This is our cross-town rival. It's 
depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Royal student Kelly Nasser said some students resent the Simi invasion, but 
many don't mind at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them have tagged up the desks with 'Simi sucks,' but half the 
students really don't care," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi High students had other concerns. If not for the quake, final exams 
would have been given this week. Instead, the semester was extended one week to 
Feb. 4, so teachers could reschedule tests. After that time, the students will 
face a new schedule of classes at an unfamiliar school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're good kids, they're resilient," said design and journalism teacher Peg 
Morris. "Once they figure out everything is fine, they'll get back to regular, 
whatever regular is at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was the biggest potential problem that school officials worried about, 
said Royal Principal Mike McConahey. A handful of buses transported several 
dozen students from the parking lot at Simi High, and parents had been urged to 
car-pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Although lines of cars stretched for a few blocks, the scene remained fairly 
orderly as Simi Valley police officers directed traffic into and out of the 
school parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say it went pretty smoothly, given the fact that we just moved 2,000 
people out and moved 2,000 people in," McConahey said after the rush was over. 
</P>
<P>
 As Simi High's 12:15 p.m. start time approached, crowds of students gathered 
around the lists trying to figure out where their first-period classes would be 
held. Guidance counselor Jody Melanson stood in the thick of things, waving a 
map in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys all right? You know where you're going?" she asked students milling 
around the class lists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these kids have never set foot on this campus," counselor Harvey Webb 
explained. "They're a little lost right now, but they'll get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Brian McGrath said he was happy to be back at school so he could see 
friends. But he wasn't so sure about negotiating a new school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's completely insane," he said after waiting in line for directions to his 
first class. "They said my class is somewhere over there," he said pointing 
uncertainly toward the next building. "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Once students learn where they are going, they can start to get back into 
their routine with teachers and friends, officials said. Until then, they might 
be anxious. 
</P>
<P>
 By second period, Spanish teacher Merry Gunn acknowledged with her class that 
some tensions exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not on our territory," she told the students. "This is not our school. 
But it's a fantastic opportunity for you to realize you're not just two 
campuses. You're one community coming together."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FILLMORE MERCHANTS PLAN TO SET UP BUSINESSES IN 
PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fillmore City Council will allow merchants from Central Avenue knocked out 
of their shops by the earthquake to set up tents and trailers in Central Park 
to conduct their business. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking their cue from the cities of Watsonville and Santa Cruz, Fillmore city 
officials brought up the idea at a merchants meeting only a day after the 
earthquake. At a meeting Tuesday night, the City Council passed a measure to 
rent space in the park to shop owners for $1 a month, and businesses are 
already making preparations for the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has been pretty fast about doing everything," said David Erickson, a 
chiropractor whose office shares a wall with the condemned Fillmore Theater. 
Erickson, who is treating patients out of his living room, expects his trailer 
to be delivered soon. He is hoping to move the business out of his home within 
the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will have a meeting with merchants Friday to decide where to locate 
the trailer and tents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone will probably want to be near Central Avenue, so we will have to 
have a lottery to pick where the businesses go," said Fillmore City Manager Roy 
Payne. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest question for merchants at the meeting Tuesday night was how long 
they would have to stay in the temporary structures. In Watsonville and Santa 
Cruz, businesses were in the temporary sites for more than two years, Payne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members said that with Fillmore's quick response to the disaster, 
they might be able to shorten the time that businesses need to remain in the 
temporary shelters. While they did not think that rebuilding would be finished 
in six months, they say that businesses may be able to move back to their shops 
on Central within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always expected it would be a year," said Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 While some business owners seem eager to move to the sites in Central Park, 
others said that a trailer or a tent -- even if only temporary -- would not 
work for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a trailer, even if only temporary, would work for us," said 
Vijay Alim, who owns and manages Central Computer. Alim said he plans to move 
his business to Moorpark.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; KOREAN COMMUNITY DEBATES FOCUS OF ITS QUAKE 
RELIEF EFFORTS; DONATIONS: KOREAN-RUN CENTERS DECLINE TO AID TWO NON-KOREANS, 
CAUSING CONCERN AND CRITICISM. OTHERS SAY COMMUNITY NEEDS TO LOOK AFTER ITSELF.

 As soon as word got out that Hyun Sook Lee, an immigrant from Korea, had lost 
her husband, son and home in the Northridge earthquake, the Los Angeles 
community of Korean immigrants and their American-born descendants swung into 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, the 42-year-old Northridge resident had played host to a steady 
stream of visitors, including the Korean consul general and envoys from several 
charities. Community members donated thousands of dollars to Lee and her 
surviving son, Jason. 
</P>
<P>
 They came to Lee with the same commitment and dedication they showed in 
reaching out to the estimated 1,500 to 2,000 Koreans and Korean Americans hit 
by last week's devastating earthquake. Community activists and organizations 
set up three disaster relief centers in the San Fernando Valley, whose 25,000 
to 40,000 Korean residents are concentrated in Northridge, the quake's 
epicenter, and nearby Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But within the community, some have wondered if relief efforts are focused too 
narrowly on fellow Koreans. At a relief site set up by the Korea Times 
newspaper last Thursday, a Latino man was offered a hot meal but was refused 
the non-perishable food that was being given away. At another site, an Anglo 
man was ignored when he tried to ask fellow quake victims about food and he 
eventually left. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in grappling with the quake, the Korean community confronted a 
particularly troubling issue: whether to remain insular or to actively extend a 
hand to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, the Valley Korean United Methodist Church in Granada Hills held 
a barbecue for all quake victims -- not just Koreans. Last week, Radio Korea 
gave water and food to people living in a tent city set up by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency on Winnetka Avenue in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that this not be a time which creates more division, but that 
it be a time where we come together," said Bong Hwan Kim, executive director of 
the Korean Youth and Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning away non-Koreans, he said, was a matter of "deep concern." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that kind of behavior that perpetuates the stereotype out there already 
about Koreans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, after the Korea Times posted a sign saying that relief supplies 
would only be provided to subscribers, Kim complained to the publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korea Times, whose publisher ordered the sign removed, has said that the 
sign and the refusal of food to the Latino man was "a mistake." The newspaper's 
policy, said spokeswoman Kapson Yim Lee, has been to serve everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign, said newspaper spokesman Robert Ku, should never have been posted. 
"We were rather concerned about that too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the Korean community said that while it is wrong to turn away 
non-Koreans, it is important to recognize that the community -- many of whom do 
not speak English and do not know their way around the American system -- needs 
to take care of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "This earthquake severely hurt the Korean community," said Charles Kim, 
president of the Korean American Coalition. "After the riots, Koreans needed 
time to catch up, but this is another shake-up." 
</P>
<P>
 For Daniel K. Whang, the earthquake came as a stunning second blow to the 
damage he had already suffered in the 1992 Los Angeles riots. After Whang's 
South-Central Los Angeles business burned to the ground during the unrest, he 
started a new business in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake left his Northridge store, Continental Liquor, in shambles, 
wiping out nearly 90% of his inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 About 120 Korean American families moved to the Valley after the 1992 unrest. 
Of that number, about 70 families reported damage to businesses to the Assn. of 
Korean Victims of the Los Angeles riots, said Bong Oh, the organization's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, God, he didn't help me," said Jae Yul Kim of Encino. Kim, a 
five-year Valley resident whose business was destroyed in the unrest, said he 
lost furniture and a skylight in his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean Americans who were interviewed expressed relief the community had come 
forward with supplies. The three distribution sites provided food, clothing, 
water and blankets to about 1,500 people before they were consolidated into one 
center at the Valley Korean United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone was able to partake in the largess. On Thursday, a Latino man 
came to the door of the Korea Times center where non-perishable food items were 
being distributed and asked in Spanish for food. A volunteer sent him to the 
hot-meal station but did not give him water and non-perishable food, which were 
being handed out to Koreans nearby. A few minutes later, the man disappeared.  
</P>
<P>
 "This food was donated by Koreans," a volunteer said as the man was turned 
away. Earlier, a shabbily dressed Anglo man asked Korean victims at the center 
if sodas were being sold or given away. They ignored him, and he eventually 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the relief sites of Radio Korea and the Valley Korean United 
Methodist Church said they gave food and water to everyone who came to their 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Duncan Suh, a reporter for Radio Korea who compiled statistics of 
people served in the relief effort, said because the center had been advertised 
only on Korean radio and in the Korean language, few non-Koreans showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Eui Young Yu, a community leader and sociologist at Cal State Los Angeles, 
criticized the idea of concentrating relief on fellow Koreans. During the 
riots, he said, it made sense to focus relief efforts on Koreans because they 
were targets. But in the earthquake, everybody was a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Koreans should be organized to help everyone, not just Koreans," Yu said. "If 
white people organize to help white people and black people organize to help 
black people, then what is this? It's not a city."

NO HELP FROM CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have now had a little time to reflect on how our small community here in 
Moorpark dealt with the events of Monday, Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the citizens of the community were wonderful. We live on a cul-de-sac 
and everyone was on the street minutes after the quake, and everyone's first 
question was, "Are you OK, is your family OK?" One of our neighbors hung a 
lantern on the post to his mailbox. It brightened our morning in more ways than 
one, but it was one of the many bright spots in the neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, our police and fire departments were fabulous, as always. The Fire 
Department was still checking out neighborhoods well into the afternoon; it was 
so nice to see them. Our area did not get electricity back until almost 
midnight and during those hours of total darkness, there was a police car with 
a spotlight driving by our street at least every half hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, our local merchants were there for us. They managed to get open so that 
we could get supplies we needed, as well as help us restock what we lost when 
our pantries dumped their contents and refrigerators lost power. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the fourth and only negative aspect of the day: our city government, 
which was nowhere to be found. I was at City Hall several times during the day 
and didn't see anyone. At 11:30 a.m. I walked around and looked in windows 
because I couldn't believe they hadn't opened an information center and 
shelter. When our city needed its government, the sign said: "Closed for the 
Holiday."  
</P>
<P>
 We have surely learned from this experience. Our City Council is a useless 
waste of money and needs to be reconsidered at the next election. 
</P>
<P>
 And, even more important, we are blessed with a community that continues to 
function in the absence of any leadership at all.

 Re: Jan. 22 article concerning a woman's run-around through the FEMA maze.I 
find it incredulous that somebody who was getting something for free and 
getting emergency aid would complain about the paperwork and other requirements 
for filling stuff out. It appears that she wants something for nothing and is 
expecting everything to be given to her. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a closing statement on B-8 where she said, "This is quite a stress 
on me. I thought it was their duty to provide something faster than this." It's 
not their duty; she's getting federal aid for nothing.

UNDESERVED CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems there is no situation that Congressman Elton Gallegly will not 
exploit to make political hay. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent essay he states that Ventura County was declared an earthquake 
disaster zone "within minutes" after he appealed to President Clinton at the 
town hall meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 I watched that meeting on C-SPAN and I saw Vicky Howard, county supervisor 
from Simi Valley, make an appeal and I saw Sen. Barbara Boxer's visible 
increase in attention when she heard the words Ventura County. Having played a 
significant role in helping with her election, I know that Ventura County is a 
special place for Boxer.  
</P>
<P>
 Can one imagine that some credit be given the supervisor from Simi and the 
senator from California, who has consistently supported Clinton's programs, 
rather than be given entirely to Gallegly who has primarily played the part of 
a Clinton obstructionist?

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 77 FAMILIES GET LOANS IN 1ST WAVE OF FEDERAL 
AID; RELIEF: SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION IS PRAISED FOR SWIFT DISBURSEMENT OF 
$2.5 MILLION TO THOSE WHOSE HOMES WERE DAMAGED IN THE QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventy seven families whose homes were damaged by last week's massive 
earthquake received one the first infusions of federal cash Wednesday in Van 
Nuys when the Small Business Administration handed out $2.5 million in disaster 
relief loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The first check went to Eli Landaverde of Arleta, a 24-year-old stock clerk, 
who picked up the initial $10,000 installment of his $25,700 loan at the Mid 
San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took four days," said Landaverde, whose family applied for federal aid 
Saturday to fix wall cracks, repair a toppled fence and replace possessions 
destroyed in the Jan. 17 temblor. "It was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite widespread complaints that government aid agencies have been slow to 
respond to people in need, the 27 families who picked up their loan checks 
Wednesday praised SBA officials for working quickly to process their 
applications. Fifty other families will have their checks mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fast, fast, fast," said Betty Widener, 71, whose Granada Hills home 
was heavily damaged in the 6.6 quake. She and her husband, Carl, have been 
sleeping in their motor home parked in the driveway for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA disaster loans are available to anyone who suffered losses in the 
quake and are intended to pay for losses not covered by private insurance. 
Because the loans are administered by the government, repayment terms are 
generally longer and interest rates are lower than those offered by private 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, SBA officials had sent out 86,000 disaster relief loan 
applications to families and merchants whose homes or businesses were damaged 
in the quake. Of that number, about 2,200 had been returned and will be 
processed over the next several days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This represents the beginning of long-term assistance in Southern 
California," said Mike Howland, the SBA's acting regional administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA spokesman Tom MacKenzie said about 70% of loan applications are approved 
and about 90% of loan recipients qualify for a low-interest rate -- 3.625% -- 
because they would likely be unable to obtain private credit to cover their 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal loans, which can be repaid over 30 years, are capped at $200,000 for 
home improvements and $40,000 to replace possessions. Merchants whose 
businesses were affected by the quake can also apply for loans of up to $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Default rates vary from region to region, but MacKenzie said the national rate 
is 2% to 3%. "It's very low -- in the low single-digit range," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Belloni, area director of the SBA's disaster relief programs, said the 
loans disbursed Wednesday ranged from $2,700 to $215,000, but averaged between 
$45,000 and $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob and Pat Hopkins, whose Simi Valley home was declared uninhabitable by 
building inspectors, said demolition teams have already begun clearing their 
lot. Their loan will help rebuild their house and their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This helps a lot," said Pat Hopkins, 56, a retired police sergeant who 
applied for her loan the day after the quake. It was approved two days later. 
"You're so used to government being slow, but this was fast." 
</P>
<P>
 To protect against fraud, SBA officials said loan applicants must have their 
property inspected to ensure that it was indeed damaged by the quake. MacKenzie 
also said the loans are disbursed in installments so the SBA can monitor how 
the money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We urge people to keep their receipts," MacKenzie said. "This is designed not 
only to protect the taxpayers, but also to protect people from getting ripped 
off by contractors."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FREE RIDE ENDING FOR METER VIOLATORS; PARKING: 
COUNCILMAN HOLDEN INSTRUCTS OFFICERS TO RESUME ISSUING CITATIONS. QUAKE HAD 
HALTED ENFORCEMENT, COSTING L.A. $100,000 A DAY IN REVENUE.

 Start saving your quarters, dimes and nickels to feed the parking meters 
again. The suspension of some Los Angeles city parking laws that followed last 
week's earthquake is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, for a brief week and a half, frazzled and shaken Angelenos could at least 
rest easy in the knowledge that parking enforcement officers would not issue 
citations for cars parked at expired meters. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws were "suspended by Mother Nature," said Robert Yates, general manager 
of the city's Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Councilman Nate Holden has overruled Mother Nature by instructing 
parking officials Wednesday to go back to regular enforcement, except in areas 
around shelters, disaster application centers and collapsed parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do the crime, you should do the time," said Holden, chairman of the 
City Council's transportation committee. 
</P>
<P>
 After last week's shaker, parking enforcement officers halted most parking 
citation duties to focus on traffic control at those intersections where 
traffic signals had been knocked out of service, reducing the number of tickets 
issued by about 70%, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we suspended (parking enforcement); it's that we didn't have 
the people to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't roadway anarchy in the streets of Los Angeles. The most 
essential laws were still enforced, including rules against parking by fire 
hydrants and at curb spaces that are needed to make room for peak-hour traffic 
lanes on such roads as Olympic, Pico and Sunset boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The reprieve came to motorists who parked on metered spaces and at curbs that 
set parking limits to allow for street sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of parking tickets issued by the city dropped from about 10,000 on 
an average day to about 3,000 daily after the quake, Yates said. That amounts 
to a loss of about $100,000 in daily revenue for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the drop in revenue that prompted Holden to take action. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the revenue we need to balance the budget," he said. "If you put 
money in the meters, we get it. If you don't put money in the meters, we don't 
get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the next few days, Holden said the city will install signs to 
designate areas where parking enforcement has been lifted.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; HELPING HAND FROM TENANTS 1,983 MILES AWAY; 
CHARITY: MICHIGAN'S NORTHRIDGE MEADOW HOPES TO RAISE $10,000 FOR VICTIMS OF 
COLLAPSED VALLEY COMPLEX.

<P>
 One thousand nine-hundred eighty-three miles from the epicenter of last week's 
disaster, a special sort of empathy has launched a fund-raising effort for 
victims of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants of the Northridge Meadow apartments -- in Northville, Mich. -- 
have set up a collection for residents of the collapsed Northridge Meadows 
complex, where 16 died in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 It is pure coincidence, the tenants' group says, that their 112-unit, 
Colonial-style complex has almost the same name as the quake's best-known 
casualty. Until this week, resident manager Eva Pieper said, she had no idea 
that somewhere out there, another community of "1 and 2 br apts with a/c and 
w/w cpt" bore such a similar name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then a resident of ours called me at work and said, 'Do you have a TV?" 
Pieper said. "I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Well, turn it on -- Northridge Meadows 
just went down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned and intrigued -- she didn't hear the telltale "s" -- Pieper switched 
on the TV in her suburban Detroit beauty salon. And there it was, a scene of 
devastation that was occurring far away but suddenly seemed close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, clients here kept asking if we were the same company, and I would say 
no," Pieper said. "Then the owner of our complex called this weekend and said 
he wanted to do something because these people must need so much help." 
</P>
<P>
 Pieper too was touched. An immigrant from Poland, she recalled the sense of 
rootlessness she felt as a child when she and her parents came to the United 
States carrying one suitcase apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had nothing," the 26-year-old beautician said. "I know what it's like to 
have someone give you a helping hand." 
</P>
<P>
 So, at the behest of the owner and his daughter, property manager Beth Brooks, 
Pieper on Monday set up the Northridge Meadows Relief Fund, and began 
soliciting donations from Detroit-area merchants and the tenants in her 
complex. The goal, she said, is to raise $10,000 to disburse on the basis of 
need to the survivors and the families of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
 Assisting her, she said, has been the Northridge apartment manager, who has 
promised to help locate tenants so Pieper and Brooks can present checks to them 
personally when the goal is reached. Pieper said it took her most of a day to 
track down her counterpart, whom she finally located at the Northridge United 
Methodist Church.  
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge manager could not be reached for comment, but volunteers at the 
church confirmed that Pieper has conferred with them and the manager almost 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she felt like they were a sister city sort of, except in this case 
it was a sister apartment house," church volunteer Jean DeMint said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reaction has been, of course, grateful. But we can't tell her yet who 
will need the money the most because we just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Pieper said, the fund is building steadily, with donations large 
and small. Half of the $2,000 collected in the last week came from the 
apartment owner and his family, she said. The rest has come from customers at 
Pieper's Shear Impressions Salon, where she has offered free haircuts to $200 
contributors, and from the Northridge Meadow tenants in Northville, who have 
been adding $20 and $40 donations to their rent checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have promised the people here that we will give this money directly to the 
victims themselves, and not use it for anything else," Pieper said. "It'll 
probably take us about two weeks to meet our goal, but we plan to fly down and 
write checks to the actual people. We're going to pay for the plane tickets 
ourselves, unless an airline wants to sponsor us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pieper admitted 1,983 miles is a long stretch for a helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the point is this," she said: "These people were sleeping happily in 
their homes, and in the middle of the night, within 20 seconds, their world 
turned upside-down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lost everything. And something like that could just as easily happen to 
any of us, at any time."

TRUSTEES REFUSE TO BAR AUEL BOOKS FROM LIST; MOORPARK: IN STORMY SESSION, 
BOARD'S 4-1 VOTE KEEPS 'THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR' AND OTHER TITLES AVAILABLE 
TO 11TH-GRADE STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After an emotionally charged hearing spanning more than five hours, the 
Moorpark school board early Wednesday rejected an appeal by one of its members 
to strip "The Clan of the Cave Bear" and other works by popular novelist Jean 
Auel from a high school reading list. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Tom Baldwin had fought for more than a year to have four 
Auel novels removed from a recommended 11th-grade reading list because of 
concerns the books contain graphic sexual content inappropriate for students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because something finds its way into print and becomes a best seller 
does not automatically cloak that book under the mantle of literature," Baldwin 
said at the meeting. "In the case of these books, a big mistake has been made, 
and I hope we correct it." 
</P>
<P>
 But his colleagues on the board strongly disagreed, as did the majority of 
those who attended the Tuesday night meeting at the Moorpark Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our desire to shield children from the knowledge of sex is a doomed cause; 
our desire to keep them ignorant is futile," said Virginia Buckle, a Moorpark 
High English teacher for more than 30 years. "Knowledge will not pervert them." 
</P>
<P>
 In a concession to Baldwin's concerns, the board agreed to provide parents 
with a synopsis of every book on the reading list and include an advisory 
message alerting parents that some of the novels may include adult material. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the meeting, high school English teachers had altered the reading 
list so that students seeking to read any of Auel's novels, except for "The 
Clan of the Cave Bear," would need to obtain parental and teacher permission. 
</P>
<P>
 A vocal contingent of supporters praised Baldwin for his courage in bringing 
up the matter and risking being tagged a censor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who recommends this type of material to high school students should be 
ashamed," parent Patty Daniells said. "What has happened to our public 
schools?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet critics did not hesitate to call Baldwin a censor. They also accused him 
of manipulating the public process by personally filing a complaint to bring 
the issue to the board and then voting on the matter as a board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Baldwin made his complaint as a private citizen," Moorpark High School 
Principal Cary Dritz said. "I know of nowhere in a democratic society that a 
complainant or an accuser can sit as a judge." 
</P>
<P>
 Dritz's suggestion that Baldwin abstain from voting was echoed by Supt. Tom 
Duffy and fellow board members Gary Cabriales and Greg Barker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely disappointed in him, in his claim that he still has a voice in 
this process," Cabriales said. "He's had his voice, he's made his claim, and 
now it's up to the board to take it from here." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin's complaint had already failed to find favor with separate high school 
and district advisory committees, with Duffy and with Frank DePasquale, the 
district's assistant superintendent for instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Baldwin said he remained steadfastly opposed to the inclusion of 
the books on the 182-title list used by students to select materials for book 
reports and extra credit work. He also said he had no intention of giving up 
his right to vote on an issue stirred by such strong beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no intention, by complaining as a parent, to give up my right as a 
board member to vote on these matters," Baldwin said. "I have a constituency 
that voted for me and put me up here to make these decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The specific targets of Baldwin's complaint were "The Clan of the Cave Bear," 
"The Valley of the Horses," "The Mammoth Hunters" and "Plains of Passage." 
</P>
<P>
 High school teachers and language arts Chairwoman Peggy Blakelock reminded the 
board that state educational guidelines advocate use of "The Clan of the Cave 
Bear" with students as early as ninth grade. Educators also said the books 
contain valuable insights into prehistoric man, survival skills, and the 
evolution of language and society. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arguments did not sway Baldwin, who maintained that while some authors 
portray sex discreetly in their work, Auel vividly depicts "every grunt and 
groan." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin caused a brief stir when he announced his intention to read graphic 
passages from the books aloud for the benefit of those in the room and a live 
cable television audience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Pam Castro strongly cautioned Baldwin against exposing 
possibly young TV viewers to the material and, after Cabriales and Barker 
voiced the same concern, Baldwin agreed not to read aloud from Auel's novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are, arguing whether a book should be on our recommended reading list 
and yet we're afraid to let it go out over the air," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the stormy session that included more than 40 parents, teachers, 
administrators and community leaders squaring off on both sides of the issue, 
the board voted 4 to 1 to retain them on the reading list. 
</P>
<P>
 Also contained in the motion by board member Clint Harper was the provision 
that the district compile a database synopsizing all titles on the recommended 
list so that parents can easily review what their children may be reading at 
school. The list will also warn parents that some selections may contain 
graphic sex or violence inappropriate for younger readers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that any time you give parents and students more information, that's 
good," said DePasquale, who was asked to develop the database. "That is what I 
saw as the strong part of the decision, giving more information." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he could technically appeal the ruling to the Ventura County Board of 
Education, Baldwin said he would accept the judgment of his own board to end 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If nothing else, I raised the consciousness of parents to that list," Baldwin 
said, "so a lot more parents will be aware of what their children are reading."

<P>
 Elizabeth Benson Kemp, who was active in raising funds for artistic, political 
and social service organizations, died at home Sunday in Laguna Beach. She was 
63. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Kemp, the sister-in-law of Jack Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development during the Bush Administration, was a founding member of Angels of 
the Arts, a group that raises funds for the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also a trustee with Human Options, a South Laguna center that provides 
counseling services and temporary residence to battered women and their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a very important part of her life," said her husband, Thomas P. 
Kemp, co-chairman of the U.S. Committee to Assist Russian Reform and director 
of the Pepperdine University Russian Conversion Program. He is a retired chief 
executive officer of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles and a former 
president of Beatrice Hunt-Wesson Foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Kemp, known to family and friends as Betty, grew up in Los Angeles 
and moved to Laguna Beach in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband campaigned for Jack Kemp's bid for the Republican 
nomination for president in 1988, traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire to make 
speeches and appear at political events on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her husband, she is survived by four children, Anne Hummel of 
Northridge, Paula Donahue of Irvine, Nancy Kemp of Newport Beach and Thomas 
Kemp Jr. of Tustin; her mother, Thelma Fern Benson of Huntington Beach; a 
brother, Donald Benson of Sierra Madre, and five grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 A reception to celebrate her life will be held for friends and family on 
Sunday at the family home. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to 
Human Options, P.O. Box 9445, South Laguna Beach, Calif. 92677.

MARIE GUNTER, 69, MEMBER OF 2 HISTORIC COUNTY FAMILIES, DIES AFTER LONG ILLNESS 
</P>

<P>
 Marie Gunter, a member of two historic San Juan Capistrano families, died this 
week at South Coast Medical Center after a long illness. She was 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Gunter's paternal grandparents, William and Frederika Stroschein, moved 
from the German settlement in Anaheim to San Juan Capistrano in 1887 after 
purchasing farmland from the Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Her maternal grandparents, Jose and Francesca Nieblas, were longtime San Juan 
Capistrano residents who relocated to the city from Santa Ana in 1921 and spent 
most of their lives in the historic Olivares House on Los Rios Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Gunter was born in a cottage on River Street in the city's Los Rios 
Historic District on Feb. 17, 1924. She was a graduate of the class of 1941 at 
the former Capistrano Union High School, where she was the editor of The 
Chimes, a yearbook that won the school's first national award. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Gunter, a life member of the San Juan Capistrano Historical Society, was 
raised in another city landmark, the yellow house on El Camino Real across the 
street from the mission. Her family still owns the home, which is now part of 
the city's commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by her husband, Dave Gunter of San Juan Capistrano; her 
mother, Ruth Stroschein of San Juan Capistrano; two daughters and four 
grandchildren. One of her daughters, Pamela Hallan-Gibson of San Juan 
Capistrano, is a local historian, writer and currently the city manager of La 
Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 No funeral services will be held.

TRUCK HAULING VCRS HIJACKED, DRIVER BOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies Wednesday found a truck driver tied up 
inside the cab of his vehicle in Newbury Park, a few hours after robbers 
hijacked the truck and stole its trailer full of videocassette recorders, 
deputies reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Cardova of Long Beach had picked up a container of VCRs at the Port of 
Long Beach early Wednesday and was driving north on the Long Beach Freeway, 
when three men in a black Oldsmobile signaled that he had a problem with his 
truck, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cardova pulled over to the side of the road, sheriff's deputies said one 
of the men in the Oldsmobile forced his way into the cab of the truck by 
pointing a gun at Cardova. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardova was tied up and his face was covered by the gunman, the spokesman 
said. The gunman then drove the truck to an unknown location where the trailer 
with the container filled with VCRs was unhooked from the truck, the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suspects then drove the truck to Newbury Park and left it near the 
intersection of Anchor Court and Rancho Conejo Boulevard, where Cardova was 
eventually found, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is being referred to the Long Beach Police Department for 
investigation.

METRO FOCUS: DOWNTOWN; ELDERLY MAN SHOT TO DEATH, WIFE WOUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An elderly man was shot to death and his wife was seriously wounded Wednesday 
in an apparent burglary at their home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found Rupert Thompson, 73, lying in the front lawn of his home in the 
11100 block of Aqua Vista Street about 1:10 a.m., dead of a single gunshot 
wound to the head, said Los Angeles Police Officer Ron Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Thompson also was beaten, possibly with the handgun used in his 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Thompson, 70, suffered a gunshot wound to the shoulder and was taken 
to a local hospital where she was admitted to the intensive care unit and 
listed in stable condition, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Thompson told police that she thought the gunshots she heard were the 
sound of another aftershock or something connected with earthquake relief 
activities, Russell said.

COUNTY / IN BRIEF; LOS ANGELES; POST-QUAKE PARKING REPRIEVE IS ENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Start saving your quarters, dimes and nickels to feed the parking meters. 
Authorities will begin citing parking violators again, now that a week and a 
half has passed since the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, frazzled Angelenos could at least rest easy in the knowledge 
that parking enforcement officers were not issuing citations for cars parked at 
expired meters. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws were "suspended by Mother Nature," said Robert Yates, general manager 
of the city's Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Councilman Nate Holden instructed parking officials Wednesday to go 
back to regular enforcement, except in areas around shelters, disaster 
application centers and collapsed parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do the crime, you should do the time," said Holden, chairman of the 
council's Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 After last week's temblor, parking enforcement officers halted most citation 
duties to focus on traffic control at intersections where traffic signals had 
been knocked out of service, Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we suspended (parking enforcement); it's that we didn't have 
the people to do it," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 But they didn't sanction parking anarchy. The most essential laws were still 
enforced, including rules against parking by fire hydrants and at curb spaces 
needed to make room for peak-hour traffic lanes on such roads as Olympic, Pico 
and Sunset boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The reprieve came to motorists who parked at metered spaces and at curbs that 
set parking limits to allow for street sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of parking tickets issued by the city dropped from about 10,000 on 
an average day to about 3,000 daily after the quake, Yates said. That amounts 
to a loss of about $100,000 in fines daily. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the drop in revenue that prompted Holden to take action. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the revenue we need to balance the budget," he said. "If you put 
money in the meters, we get it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few days, Holden said, the city will put up signs in areas where 
parking regulations are not being enforced.

STATE PLANS TO OPEN ANOTHER DISASTER APPLICATION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A second disaster application center for earthquake victims will open Friday 
or Saturday in the Santa Clarita Valley, state Office of Emergency Services 
Director Richard Andrews announced Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The facility probably will be in Newhall, and William S. Hart High School has 
been suggested as a possible site, Andrews said during a tour of the existing 
center in Canyon Country.A final decision on the location will be made today. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal officials said they hope to relieve pressure on the current 
facility at Canyon Country Park -- the only disaster application center north 
of the bottlenecked Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways. There are 17 
other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of quake victims from Santa Clarita and other communities such as 
Northridge and Santa Monica have come to the center daily since it opened last 
week, said George Warner, the center's director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still trying to see what the aggregate level of this is," Andrews said. 
"We're not seeing a decrease of people coming through." 
</P>
<P>
 The new site will allow applicants to avoid a daily traffic snarl, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has only one major east-west thoroughfare, Soledad Canyon Road, 
which has been packed with traffic as additional cars attempt to reach San 
Fernando Road to commute south of the city.

SANTA CLARITA DESTROYS QUAKE-DAMAGED HOME; AFTERMATH: THE OWNERS ASKED THE CITY 
TO TEAR DOWN THEIR HOUSE. DAMAGE TO NEARBY PROPERTIES WAS FEARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when many Southern California residents are struggling to piece 
together the earthquake-shattered remains of their homes, Stuart and Patty 
Cronan have been waging a battle to have theirs torn down. On Wednesday, they 
finally prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 After pleading with the Santa Clarita City Council and gaining attention from 
Channel 7 news reports, the couple Wednesday persuaded reluctant city officials 
to order the removal of their precariously leaning hillside home -- the city's 
first such demolition stemming from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully we've blazed a trail for other people to follow in disaster 
situations," said Stuart Cronan, a 44-year-old Woodland Hills communications 
consultant. The couple wanted the house demolished by the city as a public 
hazard, fearing that it might collapse and damage nearby properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, city officials told the couple that the city would cooperate. But 
then earlier this week, city officials balked, apparently concerned that the 
action might set a precedent committing the city to tackle many other damaged 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 However, after the television publicity, the city relented. 
</P>
<P>
 It took two Los Angeles County Fire Department bulldozers about 2 1/2 hours 
Wednesday afternoon to reduce the Cronan's house on Via Onda in Valencia to a 
large pile of rubble that was to be hauled away to a landfill. The family 
bought the four-bedroom, one-story house in mid-1991 for about $290,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of about 50 people -- neighbors, city and fire officials, 
photographers and others -- gathered on the street to watch the destruction 
with the couple and four of their five sons. Stuart Cronan said he and his wife 
had little equity and expect to get little or nothing from insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the toughest things we've done," said Don Pierpont, the county 
fire captain who supervised the demolition and who has been on earthquake duty 
in Santa Clarita since the 6.6-magnitude quake hit Jan. 17. "It's like 
performing an autopsy with the family watching." 
</P>
<P>
 "When they first hit it, it was really emotional. But now it's just 
mechanical," said Patty Cronan, 45. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the house had already been declared unsafe by the city and believing 
it was a hazard that could not be saved, the couple maintained that the city 
should handle the demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Ken Pulskamp said property owners normally must 
demolish their own unsafe buildings and he maintained that the city is sticking 
to that policy. But, calling the Cronans' damage "in a category by itself," 
Pulskamp said, "this is unusual solutions for unusual circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement between the couple and the city, the city handled the 
demolition but the couple agreed to indemnify the city and pay for the debris 
hauling and landfill costs. Stuart Cronan said he expects the city to bill him, 
but said he does not know the likely amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake had left the couple with a several-inch-wide fissure running 
the width of their house's foundation and extensive other damage. The couple 
credited Channel 7's reports with helping them win over the city. They said 
they first contacted sportscaster Todd Donoho because he lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Houses all along the couple's cul-de-sac appeared to have suffered much 
earthquake damage and several others also were declared unsafe. The Cronans 
said their house and others were built partly on native earth and partly on 
fill dirt, saying the earthquake caused wide street fissures along those 
borderlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Last night, the couple and their sons planned to stay in a neighbor's house 
and in a camper where they had stayed ever since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubtful of trying to rebuild on their current lot, the couple said they 
aren't sure what they will do now. Stuart Cronan said of the earthquake, "It's 
amazing this all happened in 44 seconds."

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; NUMBER, BUT NOT A NAME; 
PRO FOOTBALL: THEY ALSO SERVE WHO SIT AND WAIT FOR SPECIAL SITUATIONS THAT WILL 
PUT THEM IN THE SUPER BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Reporters were lined up three deep around Kelly, Aikman, Smith and Thomas, but 
Lingner, Crafts, Johnston and Barnett have roles to play in Super Bowl XXVIII. 
They have stories to tell, and like the game's best-known stars, they will earn 
$38,000 each for a victory, $23,500 for a loss. In most cases, beyond the 
numbers on their back, the supporting cast goes unnoticed, unless touched by 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider linebacker Jack Squirek was left to himself during three media sessions 
before Super Bowl XVIII, but he was mobbed by reporters after intercepting a 
pass by Washington's Joe Theismann and returning it five yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith or Thurman Thomas might run off with MVP honors this time. Jim 
Kelly or Troy Aikman will probably enhance their opportunities for 
endorsements. Oliver Barnett and Daryl Johnston might remain in the background 
Sunday, but they can't say they were ignored. BUFFALO'S NO. 77 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Barnett, defensive end: If he were a starter, every columnist in the 
country would be parked at his table on media day. His mother kept him from 
playing high school football because of a head injury; he plays chess, can 
squat 850 pounds and has a Spiderman comic book worth more than $1,000. "I 
collect Spiderman and The Incredible Hulk comic books because I kind of see 
myself in both of them," he said. "If no one ever pushes the Hulk, he's an 
all-right human. But if he gets upset, he has the power to deal with anything 
that comes his way. The Spiderman is the everyday Joe who pulls little pranks 
almost as a challenge." Players such as Jim Kelly and Thomas go to bed dreaming 
of touchdowns; what does a reserve defensive end dream of before a Super Bowl? 
"Dallas has the ball, they are driving, our guys are dog tired and they need a 
play. It's a crucial point of the game. It's third and long and I make the 
quarterback fumble. I hit the ball and it rolls out from a crowd of people. I 
pick it up and run it in for a touchdown," he said. "Of course, my teachers 
thought I had a really vivid imagination as a youngster." DALLAS' NO. 48 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl Johnston, fullback: True story -- he bit the head off a frog once. "I'm 
not proud of it," he said. "I did it in high school, but I wish it hadn't 
happened." He was nicknamed "Moose" by former Cowboy quarterback Babe 
Laufenberg. "After eight years of playing football, the accomplishment I'm 
remembered for is naming a fullback Moose," Laufenberg said. Former CBS 
announcer John Madden picked up the nickname and made Johnston an overnight 
star. Johnston ran 24 times for 74 yards this season and made it to the Pro 
Bowl as a blocking fullback. "The nickname doesn't create a very flattering 
image if you're a running back," Johnston said. "But every bar owner in the 
country with 'Moose' in their name has sent me stuff. I've had lodges in Maine 
and Alaska ask me to come up, and I've probably gotten 20 stuffed mooses from 
fans." BUFFALO'S NO. 89 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Tasker, special teams: Voted MVP of last season's Pro Bowl. "That says a 
lot about the attitude of the players when they play in the Pro Bowl," said 
Tasker. "You got guys making $1.2, $1.5 and $2.3 million playing for 
room-service tip money. For me, besides the kicker and punter, I'm the only guy 
out there on special teams who knows what he's doing. There should never be a 
Pro Bowl where the special teams player doesn't win the MVP." He looks out of 
place in a football uniform. "I'll have a father come up and say, 'See son, you 
don't have to be big and strong and fast to be in the NFL.' I don't know 
whether to say thanks or get mad. We were out to dinner here and I'm with 6-7 
tight end Pete Metzelaars, but I'm just another guy looking for Super Bowl 
tickets as far as the people in the restaurant are concerned." He's a son of a 
Methodist minister and grew up in Leoti, Kan. "They have a sign up that says, 
'Home of Steve Tasker 1993 Pro Bowl MVP,' " he said. "I'm big medicine back 
there." Weighed 135 pounds when he began playing college ball for Dodge City 
Community College. Took a scholarship to play at Northwestern and his 24.3-yard 
kickoff return average remains a school record. "I had three older brothers who 
toughened me up. There's an old joke: The worst kids in town are the preachers' 
kids. That was pretty much the case with us. We fought with each other, and we 
must have broken 25 windows in the parsonage: rocks; bats; someone's head." He 
has played in 135 NFL games, is listed as wide receiver, but has never started 
and has 10 receptions, three for touchdowns. DALLAS' NO. 43 
</P>
<P>
 Elvis Patterson, special teams: The New York Giants cut him after he went on a 
drinking binge, the San Diego Chargers let him loose a short time after he 
placed a garbage bag over the head of a reporter and the Raiders traded him to 
Dallas earlier this season after he mouthed off to Coach Art Shell. "The 
Cowboys traded for me to keep this franchise in a winning position," Patterson 
said. "I left the Raiders after being one of the best, if not the best, special 
teams player in their history." He played for the Giants when they won Super 
Bowl XXI. "Had the only interception and was in the running to be MVP," he said 
with exaggeration. Nicknamed "Toast" in New York for his penchant for getting 
burned at cornerback, he now wears a diamond-studded necklace of a ghost. "I 
have the ability to be in places that nobody would expect me, thereby giving me 
the ability to make big plays." OK. BUFFALO'S NO. 63 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Lingner, deep snapper: He has played 11 years in the NFL and has started 
one game. With lots of spare time he has worked as a model for Sears and now is 
trying to become spokesman for "Snapper" mowers and snow-blowers. Will be 
playing in his fourth Super Bowl, and the outcome might hinge on his 
performance. "It's a dream come true," admitted Lingner, who earns more than 
$300,000 to snap the ball on all punts, extra-point and field-goal attempts. "I 
was the guy who snapped the ball for Scott Norwood in Super Bowl XXV." 
Norwood's wide-right effort from 47 yards with four seconds remaining began the 
Bills' Super Bowl nose-dive. "After that game I went to Scott and said, 'Sorry 
about that, kid, but the snap was perfect. . . .' I thought I was going to be 
involved on the play that won the Super Bowl." He had his own radio show in 
Buffalo with Addams Family music and personalized lyrics: "He's friendly and 
he's dapper, he is the Bills' long snapper, he's really quite a rapper, the 
Adam Lingner Show." DALLAS' NO. 40 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bates, special teams: He started 42 of 43 games before Jimmy Johnson's 
arrival in 1989 and hasn't started since. "It was very tough to see one of the 
greatest coaches in history, like Tom Landry, get cut like every player. He was 
a friend and a great man, and then Jimmy Johnson came in, and I knew right away 
they didn't want me at safety." Bates survived, however, by making himself 
valuable on special teams. "I lead the league in leaving blood on the field," 
said Bates, who showed reporters hands that have been shredded by cleats and 
helmet collisions. Missed last year's Super Bowl because of a knee injury. "I 
spend all week visualizing what I am going to do in the game. I've done it 
throughout my career," said Bates, who owns a 380-acre dude ranch outside 
Dallas. "I see myself forcing a fumble on special teams." BUFFALO'S NO. 66 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Crafts, tackle: He played in every regular-season game, and both playoff 
contests, as backup to John Fina and Howard Ballard, but the Super Bowl, better 
known as "down time" to this 351-pound entrepreneur, is just going to kill 
business. Folks in Buffalo will be watching the game, and so Crafts said his 
business, "66 Limousine Incorporated" will have to lower prices Sunday to draw 
interest. "Got the biggest limo in western New York," he said proudly, "31 1/2 
feet." He has rented the tux, too, to drive on occasion, but football fame has 
ruined the experience. "They get as good a service as anybody else, but once 
they find out one of the Bills is driving, they don't tip as much." DALLAS' NO. 
77 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Jeffcoat, defensive end: The Cowboys' improvement from a 1-15 season in 
1989 to a present-day powerhouse is best evidenced by fact the team can hold 
Jeffcoat in reserve. Jeffcoat is team's all-time sack leader with 86 1/2, and 
yet he shares time with Tony Tolbert. "He has been around the league, what, 20 
years?" teammate Russell Maryland asked. Jeffcoat, 32, is completing year No. 
11. "The NFC East Division was a smash-mouth division, but Jimmy Johnson 
changed the whole division and went to a speed concept. The trend had been to 
go to the power game, but Johnson was courageous enough to struggle through a 
1-15 season and develop this group," Jeffcoat said. His six sacks this season 
were second to Tolbert's 7 1/2. "Randy White said it best one time: Fear 
motivates you. The fear of getting beat. The fear of failure." BUFFALO'S NO. 94 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Pike, special teams: Has played in 114 NFL games, has never started, but 
is on a first-name basis with Downtown Julie Brown. "One of my buddies picked 
her up and lifted her over his head at Super Bowl XXV," he said. "I don't think 
she's ever forgotten that." While reporters interviewed his more well-known 
teammates, Pike was left alone to videotape the proceedings. "I will never be a 
starter with the Bills, and they don't expect me to be," Pike said. "If they 
expected me to be, I would have been out of here a long time ago." He plays 
behind defensive end Bruce Smith and in the special teams shadow of Steve 
Tasker. He has led the Bills in special teams tackles four of the last six 
years. "It's a little unusual to have a defensive lineman specializing in 
special teams," he said. "It's a little difficult when you think you're doing 
just as good a job as someone else (Tasker) and they get more attention."

MIKE PENNER: HE KNOWS AGONY OF THE FEET

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dallas kicker Eddie Murray, whose own Super Bowl moment could be coming this 
Sunday, cuts to the quick when asked about the memory of Scott Norwood and wide 
right on that fateful evening three years ago in Tampa Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to use this as an analogy," Murray says, "but every kicker felt 
all the emotions he was going through as much as every guy felt the emotions 
Bobbitt went through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't happen to us, but we had an idea of what might have been going 
through his head at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 There is one significant difference, however. John Wayne Bobbitt once was 
lost, then he was found. Norwood never made it back, never all the way, and now 
he is gone, a cautionary tale for every poor soul who ever had to split the 
uprights for his daily bread. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that ball went sailing to the right, I felt it, too," Murray says. "I 
have kicked it to the right when it meant something. But never when it meant a 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, that made it more magnified." 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, Murray could be stepping under that magnifying glass 
next. If Murray's lucky, this Dallas-Buffalo Super Bowl will proceed along the 
same lines as the last one, when his predecessor, Lin Elliott, wore himself out 
kicking off and tacking on extra points. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, Murray insists he will be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thinking about it for 14 years," he says. "I'm the kicking version 
of Chris Farley. You know those basketball commercials? I've been going over 
all these scenarios in practice for years and years and years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my opportunity. Maybe, I might get a shot at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen of those years were spent in Detroit, Kansas City and Tampa Bay, 
where daydreaming is usually the extent of the Super Bowl experience. For 
Murray to finally get his ticket punched, another comrade had to fall wide of 
the goal post with another monumental game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 That would have been Dallas' second game of the 1993 regular season -- early 
September for the rest of the world, but in Dallas, nervous time. When Elliott 
missed two field goals in a 13-10 loss to Buffalo, the Cowboys dropped to 0-2 
and Texas was in a state of hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Off with his head!" all of Dallas cried. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson, in a benevolent mood, settled for Elliott's job. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Murray's phone was ringing and a tryout was arranged. Murray was 
unemployed at the time, having been cut at the end of Tampa Bay's training 
camp. He was instructed to fly down for the day and engage in an eight-man 
kickoff. To the winner would go a paycheck -- and maybe another if he didn't 
shank one against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson goes through kickers like cans of hair varnish. In four-plus seasons, 
Roger Ruzek, Luis Zendejas, Ken Willis and Elliott had come and left. By the 
time Murray's plane touched down in Dallas, he had a firm idea of what he was 
stepping into. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen every press conference (Johnson) has had just after one of his 
kickers has done poorly," Murray says. "I remember watching ESPN after the 
Buffalo game and hearing him make comments that he was going to bring kickers 
in to replace Lin Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember his comments after Ken Willis left the Cowboys on Plan B to go to 
Tampa Bay after he said he wouldn't leave. You can make up any adjective you 
want, because Jimmy used all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "So Jimmy's relationship with kickers is something I was conscious of." 
</P>
<P>
 Was Murray bothered? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," he says, "because he never had me as a kicker. That may sound 
like an arrogant statement, but that's how I looked at it. He never knew what 
it was like to work with me." 
</P>
<P>
 If there's one thing Johnson can appreciate, it's arrogance. The man breathes 
it instead of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's another thing he can appreciate, it's hitting 10 of 10 field-goal 
attempts into rain and 25-m.p.h wind. Murray walked the walk and kicked the 
kick. Doubly impressed, Johnson told Murray to get a physical and show up at 
practice the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray and Johnson have hardly spoken since. This means Murray is doing 
splendid work. 
</P>
<P>
 In 14 regular-season games with Dallas, Murray converted 85% of his field goal 
tries, 100% of his extra points and finished third in the conference with 122 
points. He averaged 8.7 points per game with the Cowboys, roughly the same as 
the Ram offense under T.J. Rubley. He set a club record with 28 field goals and 
received a game ball after kicking Dallas into the playoffs with three field 
goals in a 16-13 victory over the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's this business about Emmitt Smith as league MVP? 
</P>
<P>
 Weren't the Cowboys also 0-2 without Murray? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of my family members might think that," Murray says with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't try convincing Murray the game is worse off today because men of his 
ilk -- short of stature and strong of quadriceps -- have turned the NFL into a 
weekly procession of 9-6 sleeping pills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think," Murray says, "it's just a situation where kickers have adapted to 
rule changes a lot quicker than the other players . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "What really changed it was when the college ranks took the kicking blocks 
(tees) away. It made college field-goal kickers more proficient by the time 
they came into the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if that's good or bad. You're splitting hairs, really. The 
owners and the competition committee say they want to make a change. But talk 
to me and I'll tell you that I'm proud of those kickers who come in and do what 
they're asked to do -- and that's kick field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it is called foot ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Or talk to the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 What the game needs now, they will tell you, is more field goals, not less. 
</P>
<P>
 One more, properly placed three years ago, would have done just fine.

JIM MURRAY: ATTRACTIONS ARE OPPOSITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Super Bowl is 50 men against 50 men. At least, that's what it says here. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you want to believe that, just check in with the press entourage 
arriving at the hotel where the players are sequestered this week. They come in 
hordes into the room where the players will gather for the morning briefings. 
</P>
<P>
 They surge right past the tables with the signs on them noting Howard Ballard 
will be sitting there, or Richard Harvey, Carwell Gardner, Jerry Crafts, Corbin 
Lacina or other household names. And they go straight to the platform labeled 
"Jim Kelly," where they break out microphones, camcorders, notebooks, cassettes 
and they jockey for position, elbowing and clamoring, awaiting the arrival of 
the real key man, the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 A Super Bowl is a little like a heavyweight championship fight. It's Dempsey 
vs. Tunney, Louis vs. Walcott, Ali-Frazier. It's not really Bills vs. Cowboys, 
it's Kelly vs. Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 This game belongs to the quarterback. As he goes, so will go his team. And the 
press knows this. That's why they storm to the podium Jim Kelly or Troy Aikman 
occupies. Sometimes, they say "excuse me" as they climb onto a chair -- or a 
table -- where an interior lineman sits, usually undisturbed, reading a morning 
paper. No one wants to know what he thinks of the game. He's merely there to 
block for Kelly -- and then get in his pickup truck and go home. Quarterbacks 
go home in stretch limousines. 
</P>
<P>
 The two quarterbacks are as dissimilar as their teams. Aikman is quiet, 
poker-faced, his gaze is steady, there's no way to tell what he's thinking. 
It's easy to think of him sitting on a horse on a mesa scanning the horizon for 
smoke signals or cattle rustlers. He never smiles. You get the feeling he'd be 
happiest alone. He's tolerant of the nonsense but reserved about it. Gary 
Cooper would get the part. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kelly, on the other hand, is the city kid. He always has this half-smile 
on his mug; he's almost music-hall Irish. He has miles of Gaelic charm. It's 
not hard to picture him singing Mother Machree in a pub. He looks as if he's 
having the time of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kelly makes a lousy underdog. His team lost three straight Super Bowls. 
You expect him to be biting his nails, fighting off a nervous breakdown, hiding 
in the closet, wearing a disguise, holding his calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Kay-ee-double-ell-why. He acts as if he has won three Super Bowls. He's as 
cheerful as a summer morn, uncomplicated, about to break out into a soft-shoe 
dance or tell a Pat-and-Mike joke. Cagney gets this part. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on the field, when he gets sacked, he gets up laughing about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman looks unhappy even after a touchdown. And he could stare down a 
prowling mountain lion. 
</P>
<P>
 One guy is Wyatt Earp, the other one is a stagecoach robber. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly calls his own signals. Aikman gets his from the bench. The coach 
probably figures Kelly would only change them at the line of scrimmage anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly was brought up in the streets of Pittsburgh, one of six boys in a family 
where Mom was the only girl, not far from the belching smoke of the steel and 
iron foundries. Aikman was brought up in Henryetta, Okla., wherever that is. 
Just saying it, you can almost hear the coyotes howling. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's team is like him -- flamboyant, daring, gambling, reckless. It's like 
an elk on a picnic. Aikman's team is like a posse. It's grim, relentless, 
error-free. It shoots straight. It marches down Main Street right at you, 
daring you to draw. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the scenario for this week's Super shootout. Will the laughing man from 
the Monongahela be able to outwit the grim, dour lawman from the lone prairie? 
Or will he die with his boots on as usual and be hauled off to football's Boot 
Hill? 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's taking the points. Kelly likes his chances. Kelly always likes his 
chances. Kelly would like his chances on the Titanic. Kelly would like his 
chances playing poker with Nick the Greek. With only a trey showing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I'm always relaxed," he says sunnily. "I'm basically a very confident 
person, very confident quarterback. They say sometimes I 'force' the ball, 
trying to make something happen. Well, what's wrong with making something 
happen? I like taking chances. If you don't 'force' the ball, you're not going 
to make anything happen but a 10-yard loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman, for his part, says: "I think the reason we've been successful for the 
past three seasons is, I was able to realize I had to be patient out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly is about as patient as a guy waiting for a bus two hours late for work. 
If they were playing blackjack, Kelly would say, "Hit me!" Aikman would say, 
"I'll play these." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman looks at you as if you were a dish he hadn't ordered. Kelly looks as if 
he's about to sell you a used car. "I've always had a way of warming up to 
people," Kelly says. Aikman acts as if he has all the friends he'll ever need. 
Aikman could be the loan officer in a bank. Kelly would be the guy looking for 
the loan. Kelly's favorite expression is "There's no doubt." Aikman says "I 
think. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 So these two are ready to duke it out at the Georgia Dome on Sunday. It isn't 
fair to say the others are extras. But neither are they exactly co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson put it in perspective in his press interview. 
"You've got to have the quarterback in this game or to get to this game. He's 
got to be the guy who can walk in the pool hall, put down the money, take down 
the stick and put the eight-ball in the corner pocket. He's got to be the guy 
who can line up the putt to win the tournament and sink it." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why the doughty knights of the press rushed right past the tables of 
linebackers, tight ends, cornerbacks and right guards and camped by the 
platforms of the quarterbacks. It's the shootout of the ages, the fight mob 
would say. The puncher vs. the boxer. The dealer vs. the roller. The marshal 
vs. Dodge City. Never mind watching the guards. Watch the guys with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The press is right. What happens Sunday will ultimately be up to them. The 
odds, of course, are all in Aikman's favor. It so happens that's the way both 
of them like it. Aikman likes the odds in his favor. He knows what to do with 
them. Kelly likes the odds to be against. I mean, anyone can win with four aces 
showing. Kelly wants to do it with a trey in the hole. Either way, he'll have 
this big smile on his face. Either way, Troy Aikman will look as if his feet 
hurt.

WORLD CUP TICKET BILLING BACKLOG CONCERNS MANY; SOCCER: SELLERS NOT GETTING 
COMMISSIONS, BUYERS NOT GETTING TICKETS, ORGANIZERS NOT GETTING $40 MILLION OR 
MORE IN REVENUE. 
</P>

<P>
 Delays in processing World Cup ticket requests for the expensive Premier 
program have caused a billing backlog of at least $40 million, according to 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The slowness in processing orders and the apparent confusion about the ticket 
inventory raise questions about the number of tickets, if any, that might be 
available for individual games. All World Cup tickets for the early rounds have 
been sold in strips or as part of a package. The chance for the public to buy a 
single-game ticket is remote. 
</P>
<P>
 For those involved in the Premier ticket program, a high-end offering of the 
best seats, a waiting game is leaving soccer fans with frayed nerves and World 
Cup coffers without millions in income. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott LeTellier, managing director and chief operating officer of the World 
Cup Organizing Committee (WCOC), did not have exact figures of orders that have 
gone unbilled but said he would be surprised if the backlog was as high as $40 
million. Still, some World Cup sources place the figure at closer to $70 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Premier program has gone especially well, and it has provided significant 
revenues for our committee," LeTellier said. "If I'm looking for a problem on 
the operational side, this would not be a big area of concern." 
</P>
<P>
 The Premier ticket program is an exclusive offering of tickets in platinum, 
gold and silver packages. Because the tickets are sold along with a package of 
amenities, the price of the ticket is hidden. The average price for a World Cup 
ticket is $58, with the most expensive -- a Category 1 ticket for the final -- 
having a face value of $475. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the demand for tickets has far outstripped the supply, the Premier 
program is considered a good value for those desperate for World Cup tickets. 
The cheapest ticket for the July 17 final at the Rose Bowl -- a Category 3 
ticket with a face value of $180 -- is fetching $2,000 at Southern California 
ticket brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 As it becomes evident to fans that World Cup tickets will continue to be 
scarce, that 1,100% markup might become a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 The platinum package costs $10,000 for a ticket to 10 games, "VVIP seats," 
preferred parking and, among other amenities, access to U.S. team practices. 
Premier tickets are marketed to companies and well-to-do individuals. Despite 
the cost, the Premier program has sold well. Premier packages have sold out at 
Washington, East Rutherford, N.J.; Chicago and Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Every offering of World Cup tickets to date has sold out. The first sale of 
first round and round-of-16 tickets was to the "soccer family" last March. When 
that became grossly oversubscribed, World Cup officials added 200,000 tickets 
that had been set aside for the public sale. The public sale was conducted by 
telephone and sold out quickly, in some venues in a matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket demand has never diminished. After the final draw in Las Vegas last 
month, requests for tickets increased fivefold, according to World Cup 
officials. As these programs sell out, it decreases the likelihood that any 
individual game tickets will be available to the public on the day of the game. 
World Cup officials have always warned that this might happen. 
</P>
<P>
 All that makes the delays in processing the Premier ticket requests puzzling, 
because demand for tickets is well known. Additionally, it is unknown why the 
WCOC would not move as quickly as possible to claim millions of dollars in 
income and promptly bill those who have filled out ticket request forms. 
</P>
<P>
 LeTellier conceded that most WCOC staff spent December working on the final 
draw and that personnel was stretched thin. He said four World Cup employees 
work on the Premier ticket processing: two to process the orders and two to 
handle the billing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to interviews with Premier ticket sales people and those who 
requested tickets, some customers have been waiting months to receive bills 
and, in at least one case, a client was billed, paid the bill and received his 
canceled check, but still received a letter from the WCOC that demanded payment 
within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays mean salespeople aren't getting commission checks. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews, LeTellier and Mike Riley, president of Cup Tickets, a 
Los Angeles-based World Cup ticket agent authorized to sell Premier tickets, 
said they did not consider there to be any problems processing orders for the 
Premier ticket program. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a Dec. 28 memo to his sales staff, after weeks of their complaints 
about late commission checks, Riley apologizes and blames "procedural delays at 
the World Cup."  
</P>
<P>
 The memo reads, in part: "This report reflects less than 10% of the orders we 
had submitted by the time the report was produced. Obviously, WCOC's backlog in 
filing, billing and pursuing receivables is causing severe delays to develop." 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of an earlier memo from Riley to his staff: "The good news is that 
we got our first check. The bad news: It apparently takes even longer than I 
feared for the WCOC to process our orders." Before Nov. 8, according to the 
memo, Cup Tickets had been paid $370 in commissions after more than three 
months work. 
</P>
<P>
 One client who has experienced a delay is Bruce Laker of American Challenge 
Enterprises, a soccer supply distributor in Farmingdale, N.Y. Laker applied 
through Cup Tickets for five silver-ticket packages for the Meadowlands on Oct. 
21 and has yet to receive an invoice.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got my order in within two days of being sold," Laker said. "I haven't 
heard from anyone, and the Cup Tickets people seem to be getting stonewalled. I 
don't know what it is. I don't know if it's because the World Cup people are 
totally inefficient." 
</P>
<P>
 LeTellier said that because the Premier ticket program is for premium seats -- 
mostly in Category 1 -- the processing was slower because the WCOC was mindful 
of ambush marketing: corporations that had not gotten in the World Cup sponsor 
program attempting to buy blocks of tickets and undermine official sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 LeTellier said a four-member executive committee reviewed Premier requests 
weekly, and if there has been a delay it would have come because some requests 
have been set aside for closer scrutiny for conflicts. He said about 4%-5% of 
the Premier orders have been rejected because of conflicts with sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there have been delays, I'm unaware of them," LeTellier said. 
</P>
<P>
 That statement notwithstanding, LeTellier recently streamlined the review 
process so that he alone will review ticket orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Premier ticket salespeople have been surprised by what they say is a 
laissez faire attitude from World Cup regarding monitoring and controlling the 
volume of tickets sold.  
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen groups have been selling tickets for all nine venues for 
more than six months, but each group has little information about what others 
have sold or what seats were available at each venue. LeTellier said everyone 
knew the quota, but no salesperson interviewed could say how many tickets were 
available in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just said, 'sell tickets,' they didn't say how many. We sold as much as 
we could and asked questions later," one Premier ticket salesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 LeTellier would not say how many of the World Cup's 3.6 million tickets had 
been earmarked for the Premier ticket program, but a Cup Tickets memo indicated 
that a sellout of Premier tickets would yield $180 million to the WCOC. 
</P>
<P>
 LeTellier said sales in the Premier program would continue through March, and 
that all salespeople were continuing to sell tickets, even though the program 
is near the saturation point. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sales department has been told to bring in any orders they can bring in," 
LeTellier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is for salespeople to generate as many orders as possible, even if 
they become oversubscribed. The two World Cup employees then forward the 
requests to the approval committee. When approved, the order is sent to two 
other workers for invoicing. 
</P>
<P>
 Salespeople are instructed to inform customers that an order for tickets is 
simply a request and doesn't become an official order until it has gone through 
the approval process. LeTellier said because of this disclosure, there should 
be no disgruntled customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I expected it to work was I'd go into a client and I'd be able to 
show him a computer generated map of each stadium, showing the seating area and 
those seats that had been sold would be X'd out," Paul Hinkley of Cup Tickets 
said. "You'd think the whole thing would be on a computer, so that I don't sell 
tickets for a venue that don't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Salespeople are not able to sell tickets for specific seats, only for a 
general category of premium tickets. As with all World Cup ticket programs, 
Premier tickets will not be sent to customers until May to try to stave off 
counterfeiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one Cup Tickets employee: "From the way it sounds, their system seems a 
little primitive. You can go out and sell, but if you don't know what you're 
inventory is, you're going to be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the processing of Premier ticket orders became a priority at the 
WCOC. The attention also might resolve the problem with salespeople getting 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem delaying some commission payments to Cup Tickets: two Cup Tickets 
salespeople had personal relationships with World Cup officials directly 
responsible for the Premier ticket program. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent conflict of interest involving the wife of one World Cup 
ticketing employee and the girlfriend of another was investigated by the WCOC's 
legal department. According to LeTellier, the investigation determined that the 
Cup Tickets employees had not received any special considerations as a result 
of their personal relationships.

CSUN VOLLEYBALL PLAYERS EARN ELIGIBILITY WAIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Four Cal State Northridge volleyball players received passing grades on 
Wednesday, while the campus remained closed and classes were not in session. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hughes, Ed Bond, Cameron Green and Eric Klootwyk were granted waivers 
giving them immediate academic eligibility, associate athletic director Judith 
Brame said. 
</P>
<P>
 The players were taking classes between semesters in an attempt raise their 
grade-point averages above 2.0, thereby satisfying Northridge's academic 
requirement for eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Northridge campus has been closed since last Monday and 
intersession classes have been postponed indefinitely, leaving the athletes in 
limbo until Wednesday when Lou Ann Kennedy, the school's vice president for 
academic affairs, granted the waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "There obviously was a good-faith effort on their part," Brame said of the 
athletes.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have other student-athletes who did not go to intersession and they will 
not be cleared. It's the nature of these circumstances. The classrooms aren't 
operational." 
</P>
<P>
 The athletes all are eligible under NCAA standards because their grade-point 
averages were better than 1.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Price, who guided the Matadors to the NCAA championship match last 
season, said the addition of the four players should help lift Northridge into 
contention in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they weren't eligible it would have been a nightmare for us," Price said. 
"Our lineup without those guys would have been OK, but we would have been thin. 
Now a guy can have an off night and we can put a guy in his place who's just as 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, a 6-foot-7 freshman from Royal High, is considered one of the top 
recruits in the nation. He is expected to start at opposite hitter. Bond, a 6-6 
sophomore, is potentially a starter at middle blocker, playing opposite Craig 
Hewitt, a returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, a 6-4 sophomore, is a top backup at left-side hitter. Klootwyk, a 
freshman, is a reserve middle blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the four players, Northridge placed ninth in the recent 16-team UC 
Santa Barbara tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors' matches Jan. 22 at home against UC San Diego and Jan. 26 at UC 
Irvine, were postponed to allow Northridge players and coaches time to regroup 
after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's next match is Feb. 4 at USC.

L.A. SCHOOLS GAIN APPROVAL TO RESUME WINTER SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District received a green light Wednesday to 
continue its winter sports season, although several schools will play shortened 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 All district athletic events have been postponed since the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
even though classes resumed at most schools Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' and girls' basketball, boys' and girls' soccer and wrestling will resume 
their regular-season schedules beginning Monday, and five of the district's six 
conferences will try to play postponed basketball and soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think on the list of priorities right now, sports is not at the top," said 
Dick Browning, district senior high superintendent. "But I'm also not in favor 
of not having sports for no reason. I think we've come up with good plans to 
make a go of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting of coaches and athletic directors Tuesday at Grant High in Van 
Nuys, there was unanimous support to continue the season, even though many 
schools in the San Fernando Valley had damaged gymnasiums or were being used as 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northwest Valley Conference is the most affected and will play an 
abbreviated schedule. Seven of the conference's eight teams have lost use of 
their gymnasiums, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the conference's basketball teams will not play postponed games and 
will resume their schedules Feb. 4. The other half will scrap their schedules 
and hold a three-day round-robin tournament at El Camino High in Woodland 
Hills. The boys' tournament will be Feb. 9-11 and the girls' Feb. 16-18. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference's soccer teams will not play postponed games and will play 
abbreviated schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our seasons will last a week longer now because of makeup dates," said 
Barbara Fiege, district athletic commissioner. "But our basketball teams will 
still get done in time to try and qualify for the state tournament."

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / DAILY REPORT; LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS

 Jerry Jones and Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates and roommates at the University of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner and coach, respectively, of the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it was assumed they were close, on and off the field. Then, stories 
surfaced that it was just opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 So where does it stand now? 
</P>
<P>
 "The relationship has gone through periods of time almost like a roller 
coaster," Johnson said. "There has been a misconception of how positive it has 
been, and a misconception of how negative it has been. . . . I think Jerry 
respected me as a coach. I respected him as one of the finest businessmen I've 
ever known." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's where it ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lifestyles are completely different," Johnson said. "I'm up at five 
o'clock in the morning, but, by 10 at night, my head is on the pillow. So that 
leaves only about eight hours where we lap over. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been some tension in our relationship, but, I think that, now, we 
understand each other better than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 One misconception, Johnson said, is that he and Jones constantly huddle 
together over the state of the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a typical week," Johnson said, "we meet for maybe five to 10 minutes, and 
then for five to 10 minutes before the game." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There is always, it seems, some meaningless controversy at the Super Bowl, and 
this year's revolves around whether the Buffalo Bills ought to have a curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have one, it's fine with me," quarterback Jim Kelly said. "(Tuesday) 
night was my last night to go out and have a good dinner and a little fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly was asked if perhaps the Bills had had too much fun in past Super Bowl 
weeks, thereby causing their three Super Bowl losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "That," Kelly said, "is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting tonight, the Bills must be in their rooms at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might call this the "Darryl Talley Rule," after Talley engaged in a 
highly publicized argument with Magic Johnson's bodyguard late one night during 
last year's Super Bowl week in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm keeping a bubble around me this year," Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys imposed a 1 a.m. curfew Wednesday. STEVE SPRINGER

 Buffalo cornerback J.D. Williams, who had two interceptions and two fumble 
recoveries, has been listed as questionable for the Super Bowl because of a 
strained calf muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams did not participate in the Bills' first workout. Neither did wide 
receiver Bill Brooks, who was suffering from a stomach ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Kosar took a few snaps for Troy Aikman in the Cowboys' first practice, 
although Aikman, recovering from a concussion, continues to insist he will be 
fine on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last week, when Johnson said his team had good practices every day, he 
was not pleased with Wednesday's workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our practice was a little ragged. The effects of not working the past two 
days and seeing Atlanta probably took its toll," Johnson said. "I fully expect 
a much better workout (today)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is apparent that Kosar has become the Cowboys' secret weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the only player who carries not one, but two playbooks. One contains 
offensive coordinator Norv Turner's plays. The other contains Kosar's notes 
about Turner's plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Kosar is also the only player who hands Turner a list of his eight or 10 
favorite plays before every game. 
</P>
<P>
 "And he gets mad when I don't run all of them," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not just plays," Kosar said, smiling. "They're also my feelings about 
the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take his touchdown pass in the NFC championship game to sell his 
teammates on Kosar's value. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I get off the field, Bernie is standing there saying, 'What did 
you see?' " receiver Michael Irvin said. "The man is always thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 About the midseason acquisition of Kosar after he was released from the 
Cleveland Browns, Irvin said: "It was a steal. I still can't believe they let 
him go." 
</P>
<P>
 Kosar was asked if he was tired of turning the other cheek in regards to 
criticism from former coach Bill Belichick, who had Kosar released from the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten the other side slapped, too," Kosar said. "I'm running out of 
cheeks." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Bills took the lead in the paranoia sweepstakes by chasing students away 
from a fence during practice at Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, security personnel investigated a red light on the press box 
level of the stadium, suspecting it was a camera. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first investigation of an "Exit" sign in Super Bowl history. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo Coach Marv Levy, who used to work for George Allen, explained: 
"(Allen) would check light bulbs for bugs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who was the last rookie to start regularly for the Bills? 
</P>
<P>
 Would you believe Thurman Thomas in 1988? 
</P>
<P>
 That contrasts with the Cowboys, who started rookie Darrin Smith at linebacker 
this year and Robert Jones at linebacker position in last year's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy made it clear that his organization is not interested in youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your philosophy is build for the future, then you are building for the 
future 10 years from now and 25 years from now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Levy offered a rare look into management's feeling about the players' union 
when he admitted that the largest fine he ever imposed was on a guard who held 
a union meeting one night after curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 The player? Current agent Tom Condon. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Miller Brewing Co. pulled the bonehead move of the week so far by 
scheduling a news conference with six top NFL players and then not allowing 
five to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 After announcing that Emmitt Smith was Miller's player of the year, a company 
employee ordered reporters held back while Sterling Sharpe, Jerry Rice, Steve 
Young, John Elway and Rod Woodson exited through a side door. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former CBS announcer Terry Bradshaw said he ranks the Cowboys alongside the 
great Pittsburgh Steeler teams of his past. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cowboys are right there defensively . . . and offensively, they have more 
weapons," Bradshaw said. "And they aren't afraid of anything. They are 
arrogant, cocky, they make you mad and angry and get you off your head. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they make guys like Jerry Rice do things he doesn't normally do before 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw said he thinks the Cowboys can win at least two consecutive Super 
Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even more," he said. "They can win a bunch." BILL PLASCHKE

DENEKE TO COACH FOOTBALL AT DANA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trace Deneke, who coached two years at Encinitas San Dieguito, has been named 
football coach at Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 He replaces Jack Murry, who resigned for health reasons after one season.The 
Dolphins were 1-9 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Deneke's teams were 3-7 both years at San Dieguito. After their offensive line 
was decimated by injuries, the Mustangs turned from the run to the pass and led 
the county in that area in 1993. He left a program that will have 14 returning 
starters this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity to coach in the Southern Section, and in Orange County, you 
have to take advantage of those opportunities," Deneke said. "North (San Diego) 
County is a tremendous proving ground and I hope it will provide a foundation 
for coaching in the Southern Section." MARTIN HENDERSON

FORMER EDISON RUNNER TAYLOR MOVING TO UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shelley Taylor, a former Edison High runner and an All-American in 
cross-country and track and field, said she has left Arkansas and will enroll 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said she transferred to be closer to family and friends.She will enter 
UCLA at the start of the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoyed Arkansas and I'm glad I went there, but I decided during 
Christmas break that (Southern California) was a pretty nice place," Taylor 
said. "I'm going to be a junior next year and I realized that it's going by 
pretty fast. I wanted to enjoy the rest of my college career closer to home." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's homesickness is a benefit to the Bruins. She was twice named 
All-American in cross-country and once in track. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor finished ninth in the NCAA cross-country championships last fall. She 
finished 13th in 1992, the top placing by a freshman. In track, she finished 
seventh in the 5,000 meters in the spring of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of great experiences at Arkansas," Taylor said. "Nothing happened 
that made me want to leave. It was just really difficult to be away from my 
family and friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor set numerous records while at Edison. She was a State champion in 
cross-country and in the 1,600 meters. Her time of 4 minutes 48.52 seconds in 
the 1,600 is still a school record and the fifth-fastest time in county 
history.

SIMI VALLEY HIGH OFFICIALS UNCERTAIN WHO WILL COACH IN BRADSHAW'S ABSENCE 
</P>

<P>
 With basketball Coach Dean Bradshaw's status unclear for Friday night's game 
against Camarillo because of an altercation with a player, Simi Valley High 
officials are uncertain who will coach the team when it returns to play for the 
first time in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw is suspended while the Simi Valley Unified School District conducts 
its investigation of the incident, in which Bradshaw shoved senior guard Sam 
Rodriguez during a 51-44 league victory over Westlake on Jan. 14.The game 
marked the last time Simi Valley has played because of problems related to the 
Jan. 17 earthquake and Bradshaw's situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's doubtful the situation will be resolved by Friday," Athletic Director 
George Ragsdale said. "We're not sure who will coach the team. Chances are I 
might coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer junior varsity Coach Steve Johnson and sophomore team Coach Christian 
Aurand are also candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley is scheduled to play host to the Marmonte League game at 7:30 at 
the Apollo Continuation School in Simi Valley. JASON H. REID

CHILLING PROMOTION; PAT YERINA, CRESPI'S COACH OF THE FUTURE, TAKES REINS AFTER 
MUFF'S SUDDEN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat Yerina wasn't supposed to be the Crespi High basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Not now, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Yerina took the job as Crespi's top assistant before this season, with the 
understanding that when Paul Muff retired -- in three or four years -- Yerina 
could take over if he chose. 
</P>
<P>
 The timetable was unexpectedly moved up last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Yerina's final task as an assistant was to call the Crespi players last 
Thursday morning to tell them their coach was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Muff, who coached the Celts for 14 of the past 18 seasons, died at age 46 
because of an infection that, in a matter of days, spread through his body and 
caused his kidneys to shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just shocked over the whole ordeal," said Yerina, 29. "I had talked to 
him basically every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Yerina is now charged with resuscitating a team shattered not only by a lost 
coach, but an earthquake in the same week. He runs practices coolly, with the 
minute-by-minute organization he learned from Muff. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks in even tones about missed layups, passing patterns and jump balls. 
Not the past. No time for that. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game of the post-Muff era is tonight against Harvard-Westlake, which 
brings a 16-1 record to Crespi's gym and isn't likely to go easy on the Celts 
(7-9, 3-3 in the Mission League) because of their misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Yerina said he is keeping the focus on basketball because, "That's the way 
Paul would have wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
 Muff, who won four league titles and more than 200 games with the Celts, was a 
mainstay around the basketball court since 1976, as athletic director and 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 His glory years were the early 1980s, when he won four league championships in 
five seasons. Joe Carrabino, whose freshman year was Muff's first at Crespi, 
starred three seasons for the Celts, then went on to play at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Muff) had dedicated himself to coaching kids," said Carrabino, now an 
investment banker in New York. "He had opportunities to move on to to other 
things, but he just felt his best impact could be coaching kids at Crespi. That 
was his true calling in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Muff lasted four years away from the basketball court before his drive to 
coach prompted the athletic director in him to reappoint the basketball coach 
in him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really excited about getting back to coaching," Yerina said. 
</P>
<P>
 This season also was a homecoming for Yerina, who played for Muff from 1980 to 
1982, then moved on to Fairfield University in Connecticut.  
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, he was a high school assistant for back-to-back Connecticut 
champions at St. Joseph's High in Trumbull. He then spent five seasons as head 
coach at Barlow High in Easton, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 But his wife, a teacher, was laid off last summer. Soon after, Yerina was in 
Los Angeles to visit his parents when he heard about a job as a salesman for a 
cable company in Westlake. It was the ticket he needed back to California, and 
Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 His task was to help Muff restore the Crespi basketball tradition that had 
slipped under three coaches in the four seasons Muff served only as athletic 
director.  
</P>
<P>
 But it might have been too much for Muff, who was also undergoing treatments 
for skin cancer, said Fr. Fred Tillotson, Crespi's principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was getting tired," Tillotson said. "He was wondering if he had taken on 
too much trying to build a new basketball program as well as being athletic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one who never said no and he felt as if he had overloaded himself. 
Paul told me a few weeks ago he was feeling ill and he said, 'If I have bitten 
off more than I can chew, Pat Yerina would do a great job.' I know he would 
definitely be Paul Muff's choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Muff coached his last game on Jan. 12, a 50-41 overtime victory over Alemany. 
After the game, Muff told the players he was sick and he probably wouldn't be 
there two days later when they played at Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The following Monday, Muff was taken to the emergency room at Little Company 
of Mary Hospital in Torrance. Yerina tried to reach players to let them know, 
but the earthquake that morning had rendered the phone lines practically 
useless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew about him getting sick, but we didn't know it was that bad," said 
senior forward Brett Nordyke, who had known Muff for years because his two 
brothers played at Crespi. "(Yerina) updated us . . . every day, but we thought 
it was just the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we knew he was in the hospital, we knew it was serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Gianandrea Marcaccini, who transferred from Notre Dame in November, said he 
was shocked when Yerina called him early Thursday morning with the news of 
Muff's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like (a week earlier), he was full of energy and with us and now 
he's gone," Marcaccini said. "He had a sore throat. That's all he told us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I only knew him for two months, he's the kind of guy I will 
remember my whole life. I just feel lucky I got to know him."

BLUE CROSS TO OFFER COVERAGE TO ALL APPLICANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN and JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the private health care industry's most significant step toward universal 
health coverage in the state, Blue Cross of California said it has begun 
offering guaranteed coverage to all individuals regardless of their medical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, rival Kaiser Permanente announced a venture with Pacific 
Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Newport Beach to give Kaiser's 4.6 million 
California patients the option of using doctors and medical facilities outside 
the vast Kaiser network. 
</P>
<P>
 It marks the first time that Kaiser has allowed all members of its two 
California health maintenance organizations to seek medical help from 
non-Kaiser doctors. A pilot program in Bakersfield has existed since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves by the state's two largest health carriers reflect both the 
wrenching competition in the California health care market and the impetus that 
federal and state health reformers have given the private sector to propose 
solutions to the health care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program announced Wednesday, Blue Cross -- which insures 5.7 million 
Californians -- will no longer reject any individual applicants because of 
disease or illness. Instead it will separate them into three different 
categories based on their medical condition, setting fees and co-payments 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an excellent move in the direction of reducing and finally eliminating 
prior conditions and other barriers to health care access," said Albert 
Lowey-Ball, a Sacramento-based managed-care consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law that took effect Jan. 1 limited the kinds of waiting periods and 
other restrictions that health insurers may place on individuals seeking 
coverage. Broader reforms were enacted a year earlier for health plans covering 
small businesses, but they did not affect individuals or firms with fewer than 
five employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the new law took effect, insurers were scrambling to go the 
reformers one better. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield of California, for example, announced that it was dropping all 
waiting periods and waivers that exclude benefits for specified medical 
conditions. However, Blue Shield said that it would still refuse coverage to 
some applicants with health problems and in fact would probably increase the 
percentage of applicants it rejects. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross, California's largest insurer of individuals with 750,000 such 
enrollees, decided to take all comers but retain six-month waiting periods for 
certain applicants' pre-existing medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Mark Weinberg, Blue Cross executive vice president, said the company's goal 
for years has been to accept all applicants, but it did not become practical 
until government reforms pushed the industry in that direction, forcing all 
carriers to take some of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any government health reform plan that has been suggested, healthier 
people will subsidize sicker ones, Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Cross program is divided into three categories. Level I, which the 
company said would include about 75% of all applicants, offers a choice of a 
health maintenance organization with a $10 fee per office visit or a 
preferred-provider network, with the enrollee paying a 20% co-payment (up to 
$2,000) for services. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy individuals would qualify for Level I, as would most people with 
ailments such as asthma, epilepsy, skin cancer and ulcers. The average premium 
for Level I coverage would be $96 a month, Blue Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Level II, for those with more serious conditions such as diabetes, Hodgkin's 
disease and hypertension -- about 20% of applicants -- offers only a 
preferred-provider network plan, with a 20% co-payment of up to $10,000. The 
monthly premium averages $143 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Level III, with average monthly premiums of $214, is offered to people with 
such life-threatening conditions as AIDS, cancer and heart disease. There is a 
$50,000 annual limit on benefits, plus a 20% co-payment, up to $2,000. Also, 
applicants must be on the waiting list for the state's Major Risk Medical 
Insurance Program, the state-subsidized insurer of last resort for those with 
severe illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser's venture with Pacific Mutual, the largest state-based life insurance 
company, will make it California's largest provider of so-called 
point-of-service plans.

72 O.C. BUILDINGS STILL AT RISK IN EARTHQUAKE; SAFETY: CITIES AND COUNTY 
HAVEN'T COMPLIED WITH A 1986 STATE LAW REQUIRING RETROFITTING PLANS FOR OLD 
STRUCTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County and three of its cities have missed a state deadline requiring 
them to come up with plans for reducing the risk of unreinforced buildings in 
an earthquake, according to the state Seismic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The state panel says that 57 structures in Garden Grove, San Juan Capistrano, 
San Clemente and unincorporated areas are involved. In addition, 15 
county-owned buildings in a variety of locations are considered at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the structures are old fire stations, but some serve as restaurants, 
antique shops or storage facilities. One houses a branch of the county's 
General Services Administration, the agency responsible for managing all 
county-owned facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four years after the 1990 state deadline, risk-reduction plans for 
these buildings have not yet been filed as required by state lawmakers in 1986, 
said Fred Turner, an engineer with the state commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the county's Environmental Management Agency, as well as San Juan 
Capistrano's building and engineering department, disputed Turner, saying they 
had sent letters to the state commission in 1989 that technically comply with 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Turner said those letters "only satisfied an initial requirement of 
the law." Neither the county nor the city followed up, as required, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state law in 1986 required them to, by 1990, inventory old masonry 
buildings that were unreinforced -- any buildings in the city, including city 
owned, to establish a risk reduction program," Turner said. Details were left 
up to local governments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities that did not comply with the law were given three opportunities to 
respond, Turner said. None did, he added. Those cities were mentioned in a 1992 
report to the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's correspondence to the state referred to planning that was never 
completed. San Juan Capistrano's foretold a proposed retrofit ordinance that 
was later abandoned in favor of a voluntary effort. Garden Grove officials 
acknowledged that they never filed the required report. And San Clemente 
officials couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday, although one of the two 
structures listed as being at risk there was retrofitted recently. 
</P>
<P>
 People who have to work in the suspect structures seemed blase in interviews 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it ever shakes around here, I'm getting out from under these (fluorescent) 
lights I'm sitting under," said Julie Earl, an office assistant in one of the 
county-owned buildings that has been listed as potentially unsafe. "Nobody's 
ever told me about the risk here, but I'm an extra-help employee. Can we get 
some money out of this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Earl added: "I really don't have a fear of earthquakes. . . . I'd just go 
under the desk." 
</P>
<P>
 Several workers echoed Earl's statements, saying they're not much concerned 
because, as secretary Sandy Blansett said, "we know that a lot of older 
buildings can be a problem in an earthquake. . . . I'm so used to earthquakes 
that it doesn't really bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Juan Capistrano, where 36 structures are listed as at risk, the city's 
building and engineering chief, Dan McFarland, said, "We've never been put on 
notice that we were in violation." 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland cited a December, 1989, letter to the state commission as proof of 
compliance. The letter contains plans for a retrofitting ordinance, but the 
City Council subsequently decided to simply encourage voluntary fixes -- a 
strategy that McFarland said was severely criticized in a state report as being 
ineffective in meeting the intent of the 1986 state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the structures in his city have been reinforced, McFarland said, or 
are vacant. Some owned by the city are being sold. One is being removed to make 
way for the widening of Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland likened the situation to restaurants that continue to allow smoking 
even though cigarettes were proven to cause cancer 20 years ago, or how 
governments allow people to live and work under airport flight paths. "You 
could put signs up saying enter at your own risk, but you're likely to get sued 
anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Cumia, who works in the Cat's Meow shop near San Juan Capistrano's 
historic mission district, said she's not concerned that her building is on the 
at-risk list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been told that it was, but I've been a resident of this city for 
22 years, so I'm well aware of the risk involving older buildings like this 
one," Cumia said. "Besides, my husband is a structural steel contractor, so I 
know. . . . You get out of this building as fast as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials also said they had complied with the state's 1990 deadline, 
but acknowledged that a 1989 letter to the state promised updates that were 
never delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 law required inventories of unreinforced brick buildings and plans 
for dealing with them, but required no actual retrofitting, said Robert 
Wingard, the county Environmental Management Agency's director of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The law did not specify sanctions for those failing to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent a letter to the state dated Sept. 25, 1989, that we believe complied 
with the statute," said Wingard. But he acknowledged that the letter refers to 
a plan that never went before the Board of Supervisors and was ultimately 
scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is concern about it," said Wingard, referring to county employees who 
work in the affected buildings. "But there's also the realistic world of 
budgeting and priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those buildings identified in unincorporated areas of the county are 
fire stations, according to County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1989 study commissioned by the Board of Supervisors, EQE Engineering of 
Costa Mesa identified 14 firehouses at "high" or "very high" risk of earthquake 
damage. These include stations in Cypress, Orange, Sunset Beach, Lake Forest, 
Seal Beach, Villa Park and Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 The station in Cypress is expected to be relocated, and stations in Lake 
Forest and the Tustin area will probably be remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said she was "shocked and 
embarrassed" that deadlines had not been set for the renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Garden Grove, where 12 structures are considered at risk, David 
Kennon, director of development services, said the city has delayed filing 
anything with the state until it has a plan to reduce retrofitting's financial 
impact on business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, he said, is exploring use of low-interest loans or grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is create a timeline when it has to be implemented," 
Kennon said. "Our problem is not severe. It's not life-threatening. . . . It's 
incorrect to assume that all unreinforced masonry buildings are unfit and are 
ready to fall down. They just don't have the integrity of modern buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennon said most of the locations are small retail establishments, including 
some antique dealers, on Main Street north of Garden Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, inventories conducted under the 1986 law have revealed 25,000 such 
structures throughout the state, 92% in cities that have complied with the law, 
according to the Seismic Safety Commission.

MILLIONS IN QUAKE-SAFETY FUNDS GO UNSPENT BY L.A.; PREPAREDNESS: ONLY ABOUT $30 
MILLION OF THE $376 MILLION AUTHORIZED HAS BEEN USED. STAFF SHORTAGE BLAMED.

<P>
 While Los Angeles police headquarters was flooded by leaking pipes and a 
pedestrian bridge in Tarzana nearly crashed to the ground in last week's 
earthquake, the money that might have prevented the damage sat unspent in the 
city treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs for dozens of city buildings and bridges have been mired in the 
bureaucracy for more than 3 1/2 years, since voters agreed to raise their 
property taxes to make seismic improvements, a review by The Times has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $376-million bond sale authorized by Los Angeles voters in 1990, less 
than $30 million has been spent or pledged for specific projects. Just 
one-quarter of the 160 bridges and eight of the 34 buildings slated for 
earthquake safety improvement have been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar program for all of California, using a 1990 state bond issue, has 
also been mired in red tape. State officials have appropriated just $60 million 
of $300 million and are still trying to decide which of thousands of structures 
are most in need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake punctuates with an exclamation mark the need to move this work 
forward," City Controller Rick Tuttle said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives in the city's Bureau of Engineering defended the pace of the 
seismic retrofitting program, saying that until recently they did not have 
enough employees to oversee the huge volume of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they were relieved that no city-maintained buildings or bridges 
collapsed in the earthquake. "It's a feeling of 'there but for the grace of 
God. . . ,' " Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a partial inspection has found 186 city buildings damaged, 46 of them 
substantially. Seven buildings remain uninhabitable -- three San Fernando 
Valley libraries, a fire station near the quake's Northridge epicenter, a 
former fire station in Hollywood that is now a museum, an East Valley refuse 
collection building and a North Hollywood building used by parking enforcement 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall suffered enough cracked plaster and damaged exterior tiles that 
workers had to sheath the upper observation deck in nylon netting to prevent 
debris from falling 26 floors. Broken pipes forced temporary closure of some 
offices at Parker Center police headquarters and a battered generator beneath 
City Hall shut down the city's automated 911 dispatch system until afternoon on 
the day of the quake. City Hall is slated for a $112-million earthquake 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tarzana, the city pedestrian bridge serving Wilbur Avenue Elementary School 
is closed and has been temporarily propped up to prevent it from collapsing 
onto the street below. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those structures were supposed to be strengthened by the seismic 
safety bond measure. Proposition G -- which increased the average property tax 
bill by $28.50 a year -- was the city's primary response to the destructive 
Loma Prieta earthquake that hit Northern California in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Loma Prieta quake, in April, 1989, Angelenos approved two 
other bond measures that included earthquake improvements in comprehensive 
remodeling programs for city libraries and police stations. Much of that money 
has also languished in the city treasury, with just $53 million of $229 million 
spent so far. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Robert Horii said the initial delays in all the programs 
resulted from a shortage of city employees to issue and monitor contracts. He 
said more workers were needed to draw plans, write detailed bid specifications, 
award contracts and oversee construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Horii said that his initial attempts to get more employees to expedite the 
work were thwarted by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as last March, City Council members Zev Yaroslavsky and Joel Wachs 
said they were reluctant to hire more city workers. Yaroslavsky argued that the 
construction programs were stalled by "lack of administration and leadership" 
and that money should be preserved for actual construction and not enlarging 
the city staff. Wachs said supervisors should "crack the whip" to get the jobs 
done, rather than hire more workers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the instigation of Controller Tuttle and then-Mayor Tom Bradley, the City 
Council eventually put aside those concerns, and 50 people were hired or 
transferred from other work to speed construction. The so-called "bond 
acceleration program" is supposed to expedite all of the city's bond 
construction programs, and spur the local economy in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Horii said the program has gotten the construction projects moving in recent 
months. "I don't want to dwell on the past," he said. "I think we are on a 
positive track right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark Robins, head of the city's Structural Engineering Division, said the 
seven-year goal for completion of seismic retrofitting will be met. "It takes a 
long time to do these things; six months to hire consultants, six months to do 
the design and then a year or two to complete construction," Robins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can say it's slow if you want, but that is just typically the way you do 
things," Robins said. "It's hard to spend tax money quickly because there are 
lots of checks and balances and City Council approvals required." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also defended their decision not to apply for yet another pot 
of earthquake improvement money. California cities were eligible for $50 
million from the state's own 1990 seismic bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Horii said the city learned that the state funds were for buildings in 
imminent danger and that a bid from Los Angeles would have also been hampered 
by the existence of the city's own program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at the priority that would have been assigned to us and decided it 
would have been so darned low that we decided not to do it," Horii said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the state architect's office said the city was eligible to apply 
for the money but that it's unclear whether it would have been awarded any.

ROBERTI PASSES SENATE LEADER POST TO LOCKYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic Sen. David A. Roberti resigned Wednesday from the state Senate's 
most powerful leadership position after a record 13 years and handed the job to 
Sen. Bill Lockyer of Hayward, a liberal-to-moderate veteran Democrat once known 
for a raging temper. 
</P>
<P>
 The orderly transfer of power to Lockyer, a career politician who has served 
in both houses, has been under way for the last year as Roberti, the first 
victim of term limits, planned a run for statewide office and was confronted 
with a recall election in his San Fernando Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
 The full Senate is expected to approve Lockyer's succession as president pro 
tem Monday. Lockyer, 52, who describes himself as a political moderate, has 
been lining up votes for months to take the job, which is regarded as the most 
powerful legislative position in Sacramento after the Assembly Speaker. The 
Senate leader is No. 3 in the line of succession to become governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, a master consensus-maker in fashioning political compromise with 
Republicans, announced his resignation at a news conference with Lockyer. At 
times, Roberti's voice broke with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Both said agreement had been reached for Roberti to take Lockyer's post as 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, potentially a high-profile 
assignment as the Legislature enacts new anti-crime laws. 
</P>
<P>
 During his remaining 10 months in the Senate, Roberti said, he will 
concentrate on helping rebuild his district from the devastation of the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, who ousted fellow Democrat James R. Mills of San Diego in a 1980 
coup, said he had no regrets about his tenure, but told reporters he was deeply 
troubled by the Capitol corruption scandal that led to convictions of two of 
his colleagues and a guilty plea from a third. Each held a leadership post 
under Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conviction of three colleagues is a very sad circumstance," he said, 
saying he had known nothing of their illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a display of humor, Roberti turned to Lockyer and offered this advice: 
"Hang in there. Exhibit all the intestinal fortitude and courage that you can 
and get a good book on child psychology." 
</P>
<P>
 During his two decades in the Legislature, Lockyer, an attorney, acquired the 
reputation of a skilled and sometimes ruthless Democratic tactician dedicated 
to ousting Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he intends to deal with Republicans in the traditionally clubby 
Senate, he said: "When you are responsible for the whole house, not just a part 
of it, you have a different approach and attitude and burden. . . . It is my 
intention to work with all members and I hope they'll respond similarly." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, the president pro tem is automatically chairman of the powerful 
Rules Committee, which helps determine the fate of legislation by selecting the 
chairs and members of committees and assigning bills to those committees. 
Traditionally, three of the five members of the panel are members of the pro 
tem's party. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Gov. Pete Wilson said he and Roberti enjoyed a "friendly and 
productive relationship" and he hoped for a similarly fruitful relationship 
with Lockyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority Leader Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), a pragmatist who worked closely with 
Roberti to reach compromise on major issues such as the state budget, said 
Republicans want Lockyer to include them as participants in resolving issues, 
but whether this occurs "depends on Bill Lockyer. He's plagued at this moment 
with his reputations of the past. He's plagued with his reputation for temper 
and his reputation for needing to be a participant in the resolution of every 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer concedes that his temper has been explosive. But he has said he came 
to the realization a few years ago that his goal to become leader of the Senate 
would be doomed unless he learned to control his anger. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last fall, Lockyer said he believes he has learned to 
discipline himself and, as a result, has not had what he called "an incident" 
for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1970s and early 1980s, his outbreaks were the stuff of legend. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many of Lockyer's colleagues believe that he has matured and 
developed fine skills as a consensus-builder. 
</P>
<P>
 On controversial legislation that potentially could draw partisan fire from 
Republicans, Lockyer often sought the counsel of then-Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa 
Clarita), a respected former chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 If Davis objected to certain provisions, he and Lockyer typically compromised 
and Davis would become an advocate for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected to the Assembly in 1973 and to the Senate in 1982, he was a 
traditional liberal by most measures, although he supported the death penalty. 
Representing a largely blue-collar district in the East Bay Area, he is closely 
aligned with organized labor and personal injury lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti scheduled the formal announcement of his resignation as Senate leader 
to coincide with the setting of his recall election for April 12 by Gov. Pete 
Wilson, the first such recall election of a state officeholder since 1914. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Roberti's term will expire Dec. 5, anti-gun control activists and 
other critics collected enough signatures to force a recall election expected 
to cost as much as $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti was the Senate author of a landmark 1989 law that outlawed civilian 
possession and use of about 60 military-style semiautomatic firearms. Supported 
by law enforcement officials, enactment of the legislation dealt a blow to the 
National Rifle Assn. and other gun owner organizations, their first national 
political setback in years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, Roberti conceded it would be difficult to chair the 
busy Judiciary Committee while fighting to defeat the recall and run for state 
treasurer. He denounced the recall activists as "gun fanatics." Profile: Bill 
Lockyer 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer succeeds David A. Roberti as president pro tem of the state Senate, 
the most powerful position in the upper house for influencing the outcome of 
legislation and determining the committee assignments of other members.

POLICE SHOW IT'S A BAD TIME TO TRY CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's earthquake has brought out the best in many Southern Californians, 
thousands of whom have rallied to help friends and neighbors in need. It has 
also, according to police, drawn out some of the region's dumbest criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, police say, a pair of 18-year-old wanna-be bank robbers, with ski 
masks and an automatic pistol, spotted a financial institution that must have 
looked ripe for robbing. According to police officers and FBI agents, the 
youths burst into the bank, near Ventura and Reseda boulevards, and threatened 
to kill anyone who stood between them and the money. 
</P>
<P>
 But they must have overlooked the roving anti-looter patrols outside the bank 
because when they came storming out, police say, the two suspects ran smack 
into one of the largest police deployments in the modern history of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, the money was recovered and both suspects were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, three less-than-brilliant burglars were busy stealing a stereo from 
a parked car. As a witness called police, the suspects fled to a nearby parking 
lot at Birmingham High School -- a local command post for the LAPD and the 
National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes later, all three were in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's always been on our side when you're dealing with criminals is that I 
don't think they're dealing with a full deck," said LAPD Sgt. Dan Mastro. 
"Anybody who would do this with all these people deployed out here is 
definitely very stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD officials say the quick arrests are testament not only to the stupidity 
of some criminals but to the effectiveness of flooding an area with police. 
That argument, of course, serves the department's political interests, as Chief 
Willie L. Williams and Mayor Richard Riordan stump for a plan to increase the 
size of the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 More officers not only make quicker arrests, department leaders say, but also 
deter crime. Arrests since the earthquake have dropped dramatically, suggesting 
to department analysts that the abundance of police officers has helped 
persuade some would-be criminals that they are better off cooling their heels 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD arrested 73 people in the 24 hours after the quake struck Monday 
morning, a fraction of the number of arrests the department makes during an 
average 24-hour period. In 1993, the LAPD arrested more than 190,000 people for 
various crimes -- an average of 534 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials credited public cooperation and the large deployment of 
police officers for the one-day drop after the quake, and their enthusiasm grew 
when the numbers stayed low all week. As of Tuesday, the LAPD had arrested 405 
people since the quake -- fewer people in a week than it normally corrals in a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think that in a way the earthquake is proving to be the antidote to 
the riots," said Police Commission President Gary Greenebaum, who is both a 
rabbi and a police commissioner. "During the riots, there was a tendency to 
deny or ignore each other's humanity. . . . A natural disaster like this is a 
humbling process, and people are beginning to recognize each other's humanity 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Greenebaum the rabbi credits an outpouring of community good will 
for the low number of arrests, Greenebaum the police commissioner adds that 
more police officers have almost certainly helped that good will along. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really have been able to show that more officers on the beat does lower 
the crime rate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members and residents also have praised the beefed-up police 
patrols, particularly in the hard-hit areas of the San Fernando Valley. Many 
attribute the absence of looting in the wake of the earthquake -- in contrast 
to the rash of crime that overwhelmed the city during the 1992 riots -- to the 
presence of the extra police. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers derided during the riots have been welcomed in community after 
community this time, greeted by residents anxious for help in protecting their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The citizens out here love this deployment," said Mastro. "At least for the 
moment, this is an extremely safe place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD has begun to scale back its mobilization, and some officers have 
returned from working 12-hour shifts to their regular eight hours a day. At 
least for the immediate future, the Valley will remain staffed with extra 
officers as specialized units are tapped to bolster the department's presence 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how long the mobilization continues or how many police patrol 
the streets of Los Angeles, officers admit their jobs will always be made 
easier by suspects who go about their business so ham-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what they say," Mastro said Wednesday. "If they were smart, they 
wouldn't be criminals."

BLUE CROSS TO OFFER COVERAGE TO ALL APPLICANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN and JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the private health care industry's most significant step toward universal 
health coverage in the state, Blue Cross of California said it has begun 
offering guaranteed coverage to all individuals regardless of their medical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, rival Kaiser Permanente announced a venture with Pacific 
Mutual Life Insurance Co. to give Kaiser's 4.6 million California patients the 
option of using doctors and medical facilities outside the vast Kaiser network. 
</P>
<P>
 It marks the first time that Kaiser has allowed all members of its two 
California health maintenance organizations to seek medical help from 
non-Kaiser doctors. A pilot program in Bakersfield has existed since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves by the state's two largest health carriers reflect both the 
wrenching competition in the California health care market and the impetus that 
federal and state health reformers have given the private sector to propose 
solutions to the health care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program announced Wednesday, Blue Cross -- which insures 5.7 million 
Californians -- will no longer reject any individual applicants because of 
disease or illness. Instead it will separate them into three different 
categories based on their medical condition, setting fees and co-payments 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an excellent move in the direction of reducing and finally eliminating 
prior conditions and other barriers to health care access," said Albert 
Lowey-Ball, a Sacramento-based managed-care consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law that took effect Jan. 1 limited the kinds of waiting periods and 
other restrictions that health insurers may place on individuals seeking 
coverage. Broader reforms were enacted a year earlier for health plans covering 
small businesses, but they did not affect individuals or firms with fewer than 
five employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the new law took effect, insurers were scrambling to go the 
reformers one better. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield of California, for example, announced that it was dropping all 
waiting periods and waivers that exclude benefits for specified medical 
conditions. However, Blue Shield said that it would still refuse coverage to 
some applicants with health problems and in fact would probably increase the 
percentage of applicants it rejects. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross, California's largest insurer of individuals with 750,000 such 
enrollees, decided to take all comers but retain six-month waiting periods for 
certain applicants' pre-existing medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Mark Weinberg, Blue Cross executive vice president, said the company's goal 
for years has been to accept all applicants, but it did not become practical 
until government reforms pushed the industry in that direction, forcing all 
carriers to take some of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any government health reform plan that has been suggested, healthier 
people will subsidize sicker ones, Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We acknowledge this as a positive step," Maria Ferrer, executive director of 
the public interest group Health Access, said of the Blue Cross initiative, 
"but it's a long way from universal access at affordable rates." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Cross program is divided into three categories. Level I, which the 
company said would include about 75% of all applicants, offers a choice of a 
health maintenance organization with a $10 fee per office visit or a 
preferred-provider network, with the enrollee paying a 20% co-payment (up to 
$2,000) for services. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy individuals would qualify for Level I, as would most people with 
ailments such as asthma, epilepsy, skin cancer and ulcers. The average premium 
for Level I coverage would be $96 a month, Blue Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Level II, for those with more serious conditions such as diabetes, Hodgkin's 
disease and hypertension -- about 20% of applicants -- offers only a 
preferred-provider network plan, with a 20% co-payment of up to $10,000. The 
monthly premium is 50% higher, averaging $143 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Level III, with average monthly premiums of $214, is offered to people with 
such life-threatening conditions as AIDS, cancer and heart disease. There is a 
$50,000 annual limit on benefits, plus a 20% co-payment, up to $2,000. Also, 
applicants must be on the waiting list for the state's Major Risk Medical 
Insurance Program, the state-subsidized insurer of last resort for those with 
severe illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "If President Clinton's (health reform) activity has had any effect, it has 
been to challenge the industry to fix the health care system's problems 
ourselves," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser's venture with Pacific Mutual, the largest California-based life 
insurance company, is a response to increasing demands for greater choice for 
employees and simplified billing and administration for employers, as well as 
to Clinton's health care reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Kaiser and Pacific Mutual face an increasing need for providing 
choices," said Michael Berumen, a senior vice president at Pacific Mutual's 
group health and life insurance subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser members in Southern California may see a doctor of their choice for any 
illness or treatment and be covered by a Pacific Mutual indemnity plan, a group 
health plan covering most medical needs, Berumen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members, for instance, could use the HMO for minor injuries or ailments such 
as the flu and pay a little more to go through Pacific Mutual for, say, a heart 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northern California, employees will have the option of joining the HMO or 
the Pacific Mutual plan. During a specified subscription period each year, 
employees can switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Mutual and Kaiser hope to offer their plan to employers this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser, which has 6.5 million members nationwide, will roll out similar 
programs later for plans in Colorado and on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 While the alliance is perhaps the biggest venture of its type, as well as one 
that does not involve a merger, point-of-service plans have been proliferating 
among Kaiser's competitors.

 "Kaiser had no choice if they wanted to catch up with the rest of the 
marketplace," said Bert B. Wagener, president of CIGNA Health Care of 
California, which has run such a program since 1988.

L.A. TAKES PAGE FROM FLORIDA'S HARSH LESSONS

 Tent City, Lanark Park. Hundreds of the newly homeless wait in the afternoon 
sun as relief workers hand out milk, shampoo, oranges and canned food. 
Camouflage-clad soldiers play catch with little children. Fraternity brothers 
from Pepperdine flip burgers on a grill. Older folks retreat to their tents to 
steal some much-needed sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy McCain, head of a team of volunteer physicians from Phoenix surveyed 
this organized chaos and felt a twinge of deja vu. On back of her red T-shirt 
was: "Hurricane Andrew, 1992." 
</P>
<P>
 With long food lines, makeshift disaster assistance centers and olive drab 
military encampments dotting the landscape, parts of Los Angeles are beginning 
to resemble South Florida in the wake of the hurricane, which until last week's 
quake was the country's costliest natural disaster. Sensing the parallels, 
Southland authorities -- from school officials to the mayor to relief workers 
such as McCain -- are tearing a page from Andrew's lesson book. 
</P>
<P>
 They are learning as much about what not to do as what to do. In the wake of 
the hurricane, Florida's tent cities remained up for more than two months, and 
one was reopened six months later when authorities discovered that 5,000 people 
were still homeless. Mayor Richard Riordan has vowed that will not happen in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at the dark side of what happened in Florida and that is the 
inability, in the short term, to put people in permanent housing," said 
Geoffrey Garfield, the assistant deputy mayor who is overseeing the city's 
earthquake emergency operations center. "We are making our moves very 
aggressively to not have that happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 Relief agencies, remembering how quickly food rotted in the hot Florida sun, 
have urged donors to deliver non-perishable goods -- or better yet, to send 
cash. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, sorely criticized for its slow 
response to the hurricane, arrived in Los Angeles within hours of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from United Teachers-Los Angeles, meanwhile, have been working the 
phones, calling their South Florida counterparts for advice. They say they have 
received several crucial tips: To get mental health counselors into the schools 
immediately, to reshuffle teaching assignments so that commutes are shortened, 
and to request emergency help from the Seabees -- a Navy construction battalion 
-- who could rebuild damaged schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made us think that maybe it wasn't just a dark tunnel," said union Vice 
President Denise Rockwell-Woods, "and that maybe we wouldn't be in bad shape 
for years and years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Florida history is any guide, Los Angeles may take longer to recover -- 
physically, and especially, psychologically -- than many people think. The 
people of South Florida have learned that nature leaves a heavy footprint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are going to be some problems here stretching out for the rest 
of this century," said Charles Blowers, chief of the research division for the 
Dade County planning department. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, nearly 18 months after the hurricane, 18,000 housing units -- more 
than-one third of those rendered uninhabitable by the storm -- have still not 
been repaired. A major shopping mall has not reopened. Four schools were 
leveled by the hurricane and have not been rebuilt; students attend classed in 
mobile trailers. At other schools, there have been only patchwork repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses that shut down will probably never come back. Many people 
moved out of the region and will not return; county planners estimate that by 
2000, the population will be 20,000 fewer than if the hurricane had not hit. 
And FEMA still has not come forth with some low-interest loan money it 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
 "FEMA is very cooperative at first," said Cynthia Curry, Dade County's 
hurricane recovery coordinator. "But once time passes, when the threat to lives 
is not so apparent, then different people take a look at previous decisions and 
the likelihood of reimbursement decreases." 
</P>
<P>
 Some damaged apartment complexes were never rebuilt, creating a patchwork of 
empty lots. Alex Muxo, city manager of Homestead, the area hardest hit by the 
storm, says the owners of more than 800 apartments simply took the insurance 
money, paid off their mortgages, cleared their property and left it vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm wiped out 43% of Homestead's tax base, and drove at least 8,000 of 
the city's 28,000 residents out of the area for good. Meanwhile, FEMA still 
keeps 1,000 trailers in the area to house an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 people 
left homeless by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Reale, his wife, Jackie, and their two young children are living in one of 
those trailers. Tom, 47, is a plumber whose business has gone to seed while he 
works on repairing his house. The family is living on the money saved for the 
children's college tuition, and Jackie is receiving unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you've been through this, you can't imagine what it's like," Tom Reale 
said. "What has it been? Eighteen months now, and we're still not back in. 
That's a hell of a long time to have your life totally upturned." 
</P>
<P>
 Reale's neighborhood is crisscrossed with Andrew's scars -- abandoned homes, 
boarded-up businesses and vacant lots where stores once stood. The wind-swept 
landscape is dotted with more trailers than trees, and the trees that were not 
uprooted are stumpy and short. Watching the news from Los Angeles brings back 
painful memories of long lines at FEMA centers and Red Cross stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once is enough for anybody," Reale said. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional trauma of the hurricane has run far deeper than many in South 
Florida initially anticipated. In the school system, the number of referrals to 
a counseling program for teachers quadrupled last year. Crisis counselors are 
still stationed in schools to cope with the fallout among students. 
</P>
<P>
 A University of Miami psychologist who followed 560 third- and fifth-graders 
after the quake said that one year later a third were still experiencing 
moderate to severe signs of stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the children in our sample reported feeling more alone," said the 
psychologist, Annette La Grega. She added that many youngsters refused to visit 
neighborhoods that were severely damaged by the storm, and some reported that 
they were unable to concentrate as well at school because memories of the 
hurricane interfered. 
</P>
<P>
 Already in Los Angeles, evidence is pointing to a similar psychological toll. 
Now that the immediate injuries caused by the quake have been tended to, said 
Pamela Spencer, a spokeswoman for Kaiser Permanente in Woodland Hills, "the 
biggest medical issue that we're seeing is mental trauma -- post-traumatic 
stress." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no two disasters are alike, and the fallout from the Northridge 
quake -- which federal officials say is the costliest disaster in U.S. history, 
surpassing Andrew's $30-billion toll -- will not precisely mirror that of the 
hurricane. In South Florida, the destruction was concentrated in one area. In 
Southern California, it is scattered across the urban sprawl of Los Angeles 
County and the suburbs of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Although transportation was difficult in the immediate aftermath of Andrew, 
there was nothing on the order of the collapsed freeways that are creating 
nightmarish traffic in Los Angeles. The hurricane, meanwhile, created huge 
amounts of debris -- more than enough to fill a chain of 18-wheel big-rigs 
parked bumper-to-bumper from the Empire State Building to the Golden Gate 
Bridge and back again. Los Angeles' debris problem is not likely to be that 
severe. 
</P>
<P>
 What the two disasters have in common are the huge numbers of people they 
displaced. On this score, residents of South Florida took a harder hit. Andrew 
destroyed 48,000 housing units, leaving an estimated 100,000 homeless. Thus 
far, inspectors in Los Angeles have declared at least 14,500 housing units 
uninhabitable, a figure that does not include damage outside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many people pushed out of their homes, Mayor Riordan was forced, 
reluctantly, to do what officials in South Florida had done: permit the 
military to set up makeshift tent cities. As of Monday, an estimated 3,500 
weary earthquake refugees were living in the four National Guard encampments in 
San Fernando Valley parks, including the one at the Lanark Recreation Center in 
Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida tent city experience was not a positive one. "Tents are not a 
long-term solution," said Andy Menendez, director of homeless programs for Dade 
County. "They are a long-term headache." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who moved into the Florida tent cities brought with them many of the 
problems that plague society: dysfunctional families, substance abuse and 
unemployment. Also, the so-called chronic homeless -- people who lacked housing 
before the storm -- moved in, attracted by free shelter and the promise of 
three meals a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in close quarters, people already traumatized by the storm and the loss 
of their homes were prone to squabbles. Sexual liaisons formed, and that led to 
problems. Sometimes, violence erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 There were three tent cities in South Florida, erected by the military and run 
by FEMA, sheltering 3,000 people. (The Los Angeles tents, although put up by 
the National Guard, are being run by civilians -- the Salvation Army.) The 
South Florida encampments were taken down in November, 1992, more than two 
months after the storm -- too quickly, in Menendez's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, after his office took a survey and found 5,000 people still 
homeless, Dade County got into the tent city business. With borrowed FEMA 
tents, the county re-erected a tent city for 500. But without federal funds or 
military help, the county had to buy ready-to-eat food, provide private 
security, rent portable toilets and pay for day-care services. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the problems with tent cities, Menendez said Dade County would 
have been better off leaving them in place until everyone found permanent 
housing. "The first lesson," Menendez said, "is that regardless of what FEMA or 
anyone else says, those tents should not be dismantled until everyone is 
convinced there is no need." 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of that experience, Riordan staffers say the mayor is determined to 
relocate the displaced and take down the tent cities -- which they call 
"short-term transitional centers" -- as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 With 830 building inspectors fanning out across the quake-devastated region, 
plus "reassurance teams" designed to coax people into going back to apartment 
buildings that have been declared safe, Riordan's office predicts that the 
encampments may come down as soon as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's office says the comparison to South Florida is not apt, because 
there are enough vacant apartments in Los Angeles to house the displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are moving aggressively to put people in these vacant apartments," said 
Garfield, the assistant deputy mayor for public safety. "Our thing is to get 
people back into their own homes. The tents are not permanent."

TEMPERS FLARE ON LINES FOR FOOD VOUCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Frustrated and hungry earthquake victims converged by the thousands on county 
welfare offices Wednesday, growing unruly at times as they waited hours for 
emergency food stamp vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police went on temporary alert after receiving several reports of 
pushing and fighting, but no one was arrested or injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people in line patiently accepted long waits as their best chance of 
getting food for their families, who have been suffering since the Jan. 17 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona Barajas, 27, of Pacoima, had been waiting in line since 2 a.m., hoping 
to get food stamps so she could feed her two children a substantial dinner. Her 
family had been living on soup and milk for days, she said as she stood outside 
the Panorama City office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to buy some chicken and meat with this," she said. "My children need 
to eat better than they have been." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Panorama City office, more than 2,000 people began showing up before 
dawn Wednesday, some as early as 1 a.m., hoping to get vouchers before the 
office closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly that many lined up at another office on South Vermont Avenue. And at 
least 1,000 lined up before noon at the office on Beverly Boulevard near 
Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds initially overwhelmed staffers at several county Department of 
Public Social Services offices where emergency food stamps are being 
distributed to earthquake victims through Feb 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated applicants at the Panorama City office, many without food or a 
place to live, waited in a line three blocks long Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Working out of a large tent in the parking lot, county social service 
officials had already processed 600 applications by noon -- as many as on the 
entire day Tuesday -- and there were still about 1,500 people pushing and 
shoving in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority are current welfare recipients whose situation has been 
exacerbated by the earthquake," said Bryce Yokomizo, the social services 
department's East Valley district director. 
</P>
<P>
 Scuffles broke out in lines at some offices on Tuesday when some applicants 
mistakenly believed that the emergency program, which began Monday, was about 
to end. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-time-only program is designed to give a one-month food allowance to 
quake victims as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether a person comes in today or on Feb. 7, they would get the same amount 
of food stamps, based on their household circumstances," said Mary Robertson of 
the social services department's food stamp program. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that applicants wait a day or two before applying if they 
already have food. "They would have a shorter wait, the closer we get to Feb. 
7," she said. "The lines may be several hours wait now, but they may begin to 
go down before next week." 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency program goes into effect only when there is a major disaster, 
Robertson said. "The rules are set by the United States Department of 
Agriculture, and the intent is to rapidly process requests," she said. "We are 
to issue food stamps on the days they apply." 
</P>
<P>
 Stringent eligibility and verification requirements used in the regular food 
stamp program are not imposed, Robertson said. For the emergency program, "the 
USDA only requires verification of identity and residence," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Beverly Boulevard office west of Downtown, applicants had to show a 
valid California driver's license or identification card and make an oral 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the declaration, applicants must report their income and cash under penalty 
of perjury, Robertson said. Eligibility is based on income and cash available, 
minus earthquake-related expenses such as the cost of spoiled food, home 
repairs, temporary shelter and medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 A single person is eligible for $112 in food stamps, and a family of four can 
get $375. The allotment increases about $85 for each additional person, 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Panorama City center was scheduled to open at 7 a.m., but 
did not open until about 9 a.m., raising the ire of those waiting in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stood here until 10 before something started moving," said Susan Bradford, 
28, an unemployed mother of six who lives in Van Nuys. She was making her first 
application for food stamps. Her fiance, Jason Delman, worked at a 
Robinsons-May department store in Sherman Oaks, which will be closed for six 
months because of last week's temblor. The couple has had no income and a 
dwindling supply of food. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been real rough on the kids," she said. "We don't have a 
refrigerator anymore, our food is going bad, and any help we can get at this 
point would be good because we're desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the people complained that rampant line-cutting left them at a 
standstill for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are constantly cutting in line and the police aren't doing 
anything about it," said Susan Stawinski of Sun Valley, pointing to a group of 
men in front of her. Stawinski had been waiting for food stamps since 4:30 a.m. 
along with her friend, Mary Junco, and Junco's two children, Kristin, 2, and 
Christopher, 6 months. "In six hours we moved about 20 feet," Stawinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police tried to keep tempers down, stepping in to break up 
arguments, many involving people who couldn't understand each other because of 
language differences. But officers said they could not handle the mass 
line-jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to let the crowd handle them (line-cutters) because we just don't have 
enough manpower for that," said Sgt. Nicholas Wade. 
</P>
<P>
 Charo Castaneda, 22, of Panorama City, has been living in her car with her two 
young daughters since the earthquake. All three have been living on beans and 
cheese, she said, adding that she has no husband and no job and is desperate 
for food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally dependent on welfare," she said. "Whatever my friends can give me 
is all we have had up to now, and we can't go on like this much longer. A 
family can't survive like this." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Beverly Boulevard office, some jostling and line-cutting were reported 
Wednesday, but by late morning, Los Angeles police and county public safety 
officers had the crowd under control and moving along in a line that stretched 
more than a block. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been with the department for 30 years, and I've never seen an operation 
like this before," said James E. Kemeny, deputy director of the office, in the 
2900 block of Beverly Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, LAPD officers went back to normal shifts for the first time since 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. Some were quickly summoned to stay on longer shifts 
after trouble was reported at welfare offices Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mainly crowd control at this point, but we want to be safe," said 
Officer Don Cox, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, extra officers were outside the Beverly Boulevard offices, where 
near-chaos had caught officials by surprise the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't prepared for it on Tuesday," said a county safety officer who 
asked not to be identified. "Nobody expected this kind of reaction. There was 
no traffic control Tuesday, only two safety police officers."

KEY HEALTH PLAN REVISION HINTED; INSURANCE: BENTSEN SAYS ADMINISTRATION IS 
WILLING TO REVIEW 5,000-EMPLOYEE THRESHOLD FOR BUSINESS. LOWERING IT WOULD LET 
MORE SMALL FIRMS OPT OUT OF ALLIANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The morning after President Clinton promised to be flexible on health care 
reform, the Administration signaled compromise was possible on one central 
component -- the government-organized health alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech Wednesday -- one day after Clinton's State of the Union Address -- 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said that the Administration might allow more 
businesses to opt out of the mandatory alliances. That compromise would enable 
more companies to negotiate for health insurance on their own, rather than 
being forced to choose from among a limited number of plans negotiated by the 
regional health alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's remarks were made to the National Assn. of Manufacturers and the 
Assn. of Private Pension and Welfare Plans -- organizations that represent big 
business, a constituency the Administration had hoped would be one of its most 
powerful allies. 
</P>
<P>
 To the dismay of White House officials, that support has not materialized. And 
while Bentsen's remarks were well-received, there were no indications of 
compromise on the leading objection many businesses have to the Clinton plan: 
the requirement that all employers provide health insurance for their workers. 
That coverage would be through the alliances or, in the case of the largest 
businesses, through policies they negotiate independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen suggested Wednesday that the White House would be willing to allow 
smaller businesses to negotiate their own insurance coverage. Currently, only 
those with 5,000 or more employees would be exempt from the requirement that 
they participate in an alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think that the 5,000-employee threshold for joining regional alliances is 
too high," Bentsen said. "I understand you want it reduced to 500. We hear you. 
We're willing to discuss this one and the other details of our plan." 
</P>
<P>
 The formation of health purchasing alliances is a central premise of the 
Clinton plan. By banding together into alliances, consumers can gain enough 
strength to negotiate lower prices from health providers, backers of the 
Administration plan argue. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton proposal, an estimated 70% or more of Americans would have 
to join the government-established alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the largest corporations would be allowed to form their own groups, in 
exchange for paying a 1% payroll tax to help finance medical research. Smaller 
firms have complained that they, too, should be allowed to opt out of the 
alliances, saying they could better control their costs on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen did not specify how low the Administration would be willing to go in 
reducing the size of exempt businesses. He cautioned that if firms that are too 
small are allowed to create their own purchasing groups, it would be impossible 
to control health industry costs. 
</P>
<P>
 If more businesses are allowed to strike their own deals, alliances would lose 
clout in the marketplace, diluting the pressure they exert in holding down 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen also noted that employees are important members of alliances because 
they tend to be younger and healthier, which means they have lower health 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses, especially manufacturers, do not go out of their way to hire the 
sick and elderly," he said. "To hold down premium costs, it's critical that the 
alliances be large enough that the risk can spread." 
</P>
<P>
 But business community analysts argue that even if the threshold size were 
reduced to 100 employees, roughly half of Americans would still receive 
coverage through alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury secretary also told the group that the Administration is 
sympathetic to complaints by multi-state employers that Clinton's proposal 
would subject them to a dizzying array of federal and state regulations and 
requirements. The manufacturers group has insisted that companies doing 
business across state lines should continue to operate under uniform federal 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry J. Jasinowski, the National Assn. of Manufacturers president, said that 
Bentsen's specification of areas where the Administration is willing to 
compromise was a significant step toward bringing business on board the Clinton 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration had hoped that big business would support its plan because 
most large firms already provide health coverage and have the most at stake in 
bringing costs under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all are paying their full freight," said Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller 
IV (D-W. Va.), a key Administration ally on Capitol Hill. "They all are 
carrying everybody else. They all have to gain by this." 
</P>
<P>
 While the firms generally do provide health insurance for their employees, 
their single biggest objection to the plan is that it would make such coverage 
mandatory. "The mandate thing is like a religion with them. It's ideology," one 
congressional aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials argue that there is no other politically feasible way to 
reach the Administration's overarching goal of coverage for every American -- 
which leaves it far from certain whether the two sides can find common ground 
on the employer mandate issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Another leading feature of Clinton's plan that is likely to be scaled back, if 
not scrapped, is one that would have the federal government pay 80% of the 
health insurance premiums of early retirees until they reach age 65 and become 
eligible for Medicare. The premiums now are being paid by the retirees' former 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business leaders and health care analysts believe the government should 
not encourage workers to retire early at a time when Americans are living 
longer and healthier -- and the bulging population of baby boomers is 
approaching age 55. 
</P>
<P>
 The early retiree proposal came under criticism Tuesday from the lone 
Republican senator who has endorsed Clinton's plan, James M. Jeffords of 
Vermont. Also speaking at the meeting, he said it is "not right (to create 
such) a new entitlement program." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen was asked about the issue Wednesday but declined comment, saying he 
was not well-versed on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would be especially beneficial to large and older manufacturing 
firms that have huge rosters of early retirees, such as the auto companies. 
Indeed the Big Three auto makers are so concerned the proposal will be 
abandoned that they are forming a coalition to fight for its retention, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), speaking at the same conference, made a strong 
pitch for his own plan, which has bipartisan support in the House and Senate 
and resembles the President's proposals in many ways. But there are a few 
important differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's plan does not require employers to provide health coverage, and would 
allow firms with as few as 100 workers to set up their own health insurance 
purchasing alliances.

RUSSIAN PROSECUTOR CHARGES ZHIRINOVSKY AS WARMONGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia's top prosecutor brought criminal charges of warmongering Wednesday 
against ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who advocates Russian 
military expansion and has made menacing statements against Japan and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The case opened by Russia's prosecutor general is the most serious legal 
challenge yet to Zhirinovsky, whose unlimited promises and jingoist Great 
Russia stance made his party the biggest vote-getter in December parliamentary 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky denied that he knew of the charges and attributed claims that he 
preached war to the "sick imagination" of his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 He told reporters at a joint news conference with visiting German right-winger 
Gerhard Frey that the book on which the charges are partly based, a combination 
autobiography and political treatise, "will soon be on the curriculum of all 
Russian universities." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky, in such an ebullient mood that he repeatedly hugged and kissed 
Frey for the cameras, did not back down from former statements about creating a 
new Hiroshima in Japan and a new Chernobyl in Germany. He said he wanted to 
warn the world that it will indeed face World War III if "the humiliation of 
Russia doesn't cease." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor's charges are based on an article in the Russian Criminal Code 
that forbids the propagation of war. Those convicted under Article 71 face 
three to eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 As a deputy in the Russian Parliament, Zhirinovsky is immune to arrest, but 
Prosecutor General Alexei Kazannik still has the right to open a case against 
him, according to the Itar-Tass news agency, which reported the charges. 
Eventually, however, prosecutors will have to ask lawmakers to remove 
Zhirinovsky's immunity if they want to send him to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges pending against Zhirinovsky raise the question of whether 
authorities will allow him to leave the country on an impending trip planned to 
include the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, and Warsaw. In the long term, they 
could also conceivably block his run for the presidency in 1996, if he is in 
prison at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky allows that his book, "The Last Dash South," envisions Russian 
troops marching across Asia to the Indian Ocean. But he contends that in the 
scenario, the troubled countries of the south would have pleaded for the troops 
to intervene and bring order. 
</P>
<P>
 In another scenario Zhirinovsky described Wednesday, Russian President Boris 
N. Yeltsin would give up on the new Cabinet he has now put together and come to 
Zhirinovsky by next autumn to ask him to form a new government. Zhirinovsky 
said he would be prepared to serve as prime minister or head of the Foreign, 
Interior, Security or Defense ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the post-election Cabinet appeared to be nearly complete. After 
extended vacillation over Boris G. Fyodorov, the reformist finance minister who 
fought to keep a cap on inflation, Yeltsin appeared to give up on him 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fyodorov had insisted that if Yeltsin wanted him to stay, the president would 
have to dump the head of the Russian Central Bank and the Communist agriculture 
minister. Instead, the Interfax news agency reported, Yeltsin let Fyodorov go 
and appointed the deputy finance minister to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy, Sergei Dubinin, appeared to be a compromise candidate. Fyodorov 
told Interfax that Dubinin best fits the post now because he "won't allow the 
collapse of the ministry's apparatus and will continue the former course." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Yegor T. Gaidar, the main designer of Russia's last two years of 
economic reform, quit Jan. 16, concern has mounted among Russian reformers and 
Western governments that the Kremlin will revert to its old ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boris Nikolayevich, the country has had an economic coup, a turn back," 
Fyodorov told Yeltsin in a letter carried by Itar-Tass. "Our only hope is you!" 
</P>
<P>
 He called the new Cabinet "red managers," meaning that they want to run the 
economy by issuing commands, fixing prices and mandating supplies in the old 
Communist style. 
</P>
<P>
 Fyodorov and Gaidar have warned that conservative Prime Minister Viktor S. 
Chernomyrdin will send inflation rocketing by increasing subsidies to failing 
industries and farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin, in his defense, has maintained that the Russian government will 
not deviate from its basic reform program, but he has said that the time has 
come to concentrate more on halting the sharp drop in Russia's production. His 
views appeared to gain more weight with Yeltsin in the wake of the Dec. 12 
elections, in which the strong support for Zhirinovsky came across as a protest 
vote by a population feeling the pain of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Gaidar camp warns that if the government tries to cushion the impact 
of reform through heavy spending, Russia will end up like Ukraine, so deep in 
crisis the economy appears barely functional.

QUAKE VICTIMS GROW UNRULY WHILE WAITING HOURS FOR AID; RELIEF: POLICE ARE PUT 
ON ALERT AFTER REPORTS OF FIGHTING AT WELFARE OFFICES. CITY ESTIMATE FOR VALLEY 
BUILDING REPAIRS TOPS $735 MILLION. 
</P>

<P>
 In the second week after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, frustrated and 
hungry victims converged by the thousands on county welfare offices Wednesday, 
and crowds grew unruly at times as they waited hours for emergency food stamp 
vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police went on temporary alert after receiving several reports of 
pushing and fighting in the lines, but no one was arrested or injured. 
</P>
<P>
 While some incidents were reported, most people in line patiently accepted 
their long waits as their best chance to get food for families suffering since 
the 6.6 magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona Barajas, 27, of Pacoima had been waiting in line since 2 a.m., hoping 
to get food stamps so she could feed her two children a substantial dinner 
soon. She and her children had been living on soup and milk for days, she said 
as she stood outside the Panorama City office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to buy some chicken and meat with this," she said. "My children need 
to eat better than they have been." 
</P>
<P>
 * Elsewhere, the Los Angeles city Building and Safety Department on Wednesday 
released new figures indicating that the total cost of repairing damaged 
buildings in the four City Council districts in the San Fernando Valley will 
add up to more than $735 million. The total included $427.9 million in repair 
bills alone in Hal Bernson's 12th District, in the Northridge area. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Department of Water and Power announced that parts of the West Valley no 
longer have to boil water for drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Attendance remained sporadic across the Los Angeles Unified School District 
on Wednesday with about 75% of the students in the hardest-hit San Fernando 
Valley attending school. Of the 1,655 students at Canoga Park High, about 600 
were absent. And of the 1,150 students at Parkman Middle School in Woodland 
Hills, about 300 didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of people abandoning their houses and apartments in favor of 
shelters and tent cities continued to decline, from 14,826 on Monday to an 
estimated 10,029 Wednesday, showing that people were slowly returning home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aftershocks continued to roll through the Valley, further straining nerves 
frayed after more than a week of shaking, prompting new efforts to confront the 
psychological problems associated with the quake as well as the structural 
ones. Shocks with magnitudes of 3.8, 3.6 and 3.6 respectively rumbled through 
the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys at 4:28 a.m., at 9:09 a.m., and then 
again at 8:43 p.m., the Caltech seismology lab in Pasadena reported. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Panorama City welfare office alone, more than 2,000 people began 
showing up before dawn Wednesday, hoping to get a voucher for emergency food 
stamps before the office closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly that many more lined up at another office on South Vermont Avenue. And 
at least 1,000 lined up before noon at the welfare office on Beverly Boulevard 
near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds initially overwhelmed staffers at several county Department of 
Public Social Services offices where emergency food stamps are being 
distributed to earthquake victims through Feb 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated applicants at the Panorama City office, many without food or a 
place to live, waited in a line three blocks long Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Working out of a large tent in the parking lot, county social service 
officials had already processed 600 applications by noon -- as many as the 
entire day Tuesday -- and there were still about 1,500 people pushing and 
shoving in line. Some of the people, desperate for food, had been waiting since 
1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority are current welfare recipients whose situation has been 
exacerbated by the earthquake," said Bryce Yokomizo, the social services 
department's East Valley District director. 
</P>
<P>
 Scuffles broke out in lines at some offices Tuesday, when some applicants 
mistakenly believed that the emergency program, which began Monday, was about 
to end. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-time-only program is designed to give a one-month food allowance to 
quake victims as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether a person comes in today or on Feb. 7, they would get the same amount 
of food stamps, based on their household circumstances," said Mary Robertson, 
an official in the social services department's food stamp program. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that applicants wait a day or two before applying if they 
already have food. "They would have a shorter wait, the closer we get to Feb. 
7," she said. "The lines may be several hours wait now, but they may begin to 
go down before next week." 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency food stamp program goes into effect only when there is a major 
disaster, Robertson said. "The rules are set by the United States Department of 
Agriculture, and the intent is to rapidly process requests," she said. "We are 
to issue food stamps on the days they apply." 
</P>
<P>
 Stringent eligibility and verification requirements used in the regular food 
stamp program are not imposed, Robertson said. For the emergency program, "the 
USDA only requires verification of identity and residence," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Beverly Boulevard office west of Downtown, eligibility was largely a 
matter of showing a valid California driver's license or identification card 
and making an oral declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must report their income and cash under penalty of perjury, 
Robertson said. Eligibility is based on income and cash available, minus 
earthquake-related expenses such as the cost of spoiled food, home repairs, 
temporary shelter and medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 A single person is eligible for $112 in food stamps, and a family of four 
would get $375. The allotment increases about $85 for each additional person, 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Panorama City center was scheduled to open at 7 a.m., but 
did not actually open until about 9 a.m., raising the ire of those waiting in 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stood here until 10 before something started moving," said Susan Bradford, 
28, an unemployed mother of six who lives in Van Nuys. She was making her first 
application for food stamps. Her fiance, Jason Delman, worked at a 
Robinsons-May department store in Sherman Oaks, which was closed for six months 
due to last week's temblor. The couple has had no income and a dwindling supply 
of food. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been real rough on the kids," she said. "We don't have a 
refrigerator anymore, our food is going bad, and any help we can get at this 
point would be good because we're desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the people in line complained that rampant line-cutting left them at a 
standstill for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are constantly cutting in line and the police aren't doing 
anything about it," said Susan Stawinski of Sun Valley, pointing to a group of 
men in front of her. Stawinski had been waiting for food stamps since 4:30 a.m. 
along with her friend, Mary Junco, and Junco's two children, Kristin, 2, and 
Christopher, 6 months. "In six hours we moved about 20 feet," Stawinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police tried to keep tempers down, stepping in to break up 
arguments -- many involving people who couldn't understand each other because 
of language differences. But officers said they could not handle the mass line 
jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to let the crowd handle them (line-cutters) because we just don't have 
enough manpower for that," said Sgt. Nicholas Wade. 
</P>
<P>
 Charo Castaneda, 22, of Panorama City had been living in her car with her two 
young daughters since the earthquake. All three were living on beans and 
cheese, she said. She had no husband, no job, and was desperate for food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally dependent on welfare," she said. "Whatever my friends can give me 
is all we have had up to now, and we can't go on like this much longer. A 
family can't survive like this." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, LAPD officers went back to normal shifts for the first time since 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. Some were quickly summoned to stay on longer shifts 
after trouble was reported at welfare offices Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mainly crowd control at this point, but we want to be safe," said 
Officer Don Cox, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 As the city's attention gradually shifted from disaster aid to the slow 
process of cleaning up, the Building and Safety Department released figures 
showing the total citywide repair cost would be at least $1.34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said that as of Tuesday, 6,600 buildings in the four Valley-based 
City Council districts had been inspected, with 1,731 being listed as "limited 
entry," while another 563 buildings were red-tagged and declared unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining areas where water should be boiled before drinking also were 
restructured Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new area is bordered by Roscoe Boulevard on the south; Winnetka and De 
Soto avenues on the west; the Simi Valley Freeway and the Los Angeles city 
borders on the north, and the Golden State and San Diego freeways and Woodley 
Avenue on the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Also asked to boil water are residents of the city of San Fernando and the 
Santa Monica Mountains bordered by Coldwater Canyon on the east, Ventura 
Boulevard on the north, the city boundary on the west and Sunset Boulevard to 
the south, excluding the city of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP officials warn that even after the order to boil water is lifted, 
residents should flush their home plumbing system by running water in the 
bathtub or shower for five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Each faucet inside and outside the house should be run for at least one 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 At some schools that reopened Wednesday, even though attendance slowly 
recovered, signs of the quake were all too apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park High held physical education classes in the auditorium because the 
gym area is being used as a Salvation Army emergency site; Parkman students 
were told to wear warm clothes because about a dozen classrooms still are 
without heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools in the West Valley provided bottled water or told students to 
bring their own because water remains unsafe to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the schools knocked out of service, it might be expected that 
child-care centers would be flooded with new enrollees. 
</P>
<P>
 But several report the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost some children due to the earthquake," said Mary Lubran, the owner 
of the Toddler Learning Center in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 She estimated her student population was down 30%. "Normally, we have 12 in 
each room, but this week we have seven to nine." 
</P>
<P>
 Reliable figures for the number of people seeking shelter after the quake have 
been difficult to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing certain Wednesday was that the trend is downward. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army, which is providing meals and shelter at many tent cities 
and shelters throughout the Valley, said the total number of people they were 
caring for had declined from 3,100 on Tuesday to about 2,900 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross reported that the numbers at its 32 shelters had declined from 
8,088 on Tuesday to 7,142 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As recovery efforts intensified, increasing attention was being paid to the 
psychological needs of quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members of the Mountains Education Program were at Reseda Park to direct 
recreation activities for children still living there. 
</P>
<P>
 There were blindfold games and other nature activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a 'recreation response team' in these situations," said Amy 
Lethbridge, executive director of the program. "It gives the parents and 
children a break." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Torres brought his daughter Emily, 1, to the play area in hopes of 
calming the tiny girl's nerves. "She is scared. When she is sleeping and hears 
a sound, she starts shaking," Torres said. "I hope she plays with kids and 
forgets."

CALTRANS RULES OUT QUICK-FIX FREEWAY BRIDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW and TERESA ANN WILLIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans officials on Wednesday decided against quick-fix bridges that might 
have eased traffic congestion temporarily and will concentrate instead on 
full-fledged reconstruction, which they say will hasten the return of normal 
conditions on the Simi Valley and Santa Monica freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Simi Valley Freeway in Granada Hills, where Caltrans originally had 
planned to spend time and money on a temporary bridge, the agency instead will 
shore up a two-foot sag in the westbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can shore up that bridge deck in three or four days," Caltrans District 
Director Jerry Baxter said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a month, the shored-up lanes will be ready to serve as an interim 
bridge, carrying traffic in both directions until reconstruction of the 
eastbound lanes is completed, Baxter said. The eastbound lanes will then carry 
traffic in both directions until the westbound lanes are rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said reconstruction of the downed bridge on the Golden State Freeway in 
Gavin Canyon near Newhall will begin immediately, and it is hoped that a 
permanent replacement can be completed within six months. Meantime, he said, 
work is largely completed on a detour road around the Gavin Canyon bridge. 
Caltrans expects to open the detour by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles to the south, where portions of the interchange between the Golden 
State Freeway and the Antelope Valley Freeway collapsed, restriping work to add 
a lane to the two northbound truck lanes from the Golden State Freeway to the 
Antelope Valley Freeway was completed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to get the southbound companion lanes done by the weekend," 
Baxter said. "But it's going to be a choke point for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on the overall freeway system was down to about 75% of normal 
Wednesday, apparently because people are using alternative routes. But traffic 
still crawled through the rush hours, and there were other problems. One bright 
spot took place in Sylmar, where a Metrolink station was opened Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Full reconstruction of the earthquake-damaged Santa Monica Freeway in the 
Wilshire District could be completed in less than six months, Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to push for six months because we think it can be done," Baxter 
said. "If I was looking at one year to replace the bridges, I would look hard 
at a temporary bridge. But if we can replace this in six months, a temporary 
bridge doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Although temporary bridges would have handled many of the thousands of cars 
now detoured along city streets, they would have prevented the simultaneous 
reconstruction of the eastbound and westbound lanes -- thus prolonging the 
entire project by at least three months, Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Accidents in the detour areas claimed the life of a truck driver near Santa 
Clarita and hospitalized a woman whose speeding car hurtled off a ruptured 
segment of the Santa Monica Freeway and plunged into a ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol said the unidentified truck driver died about 11 
a.m. Wednesday when his truck overturned on the transition road from Placerita 
Canyon Road to Sierra Highway, one of the detours around the shattered junction 
of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers said the woman, Marciela Gutierrez, 30, of Los Angeles, apparently 
did not realize that several bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway had crumbled 
in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "She mistakenly thought the temporary openings used by freeway construction 
crews were available to all motorists to enter the freeway at Venice 
Boulevard," CHP Officer Rhett Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the woman got on the eastbound lanes of the freeway about 2:20 a.m. 
and accelerated rapidly, reaching a speed of about 60 m.p.h. before her small 
sedan vaulted into space, plunged 40 feet and overturned in a 10-foot-ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said Gutierrez, who suffered a broken thigh, ankle and wrist in the 
crash, was trapped in the wreckage until shortly before 5 a.m., when a passing 
CHP unit spotted her car. She was later listed in stable condition at Kaiser 
Foundation Hospital in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated $1.9 billion in federal assistance is needed over the next year 
to pay for freeway reconstruction and additional transit services, Linda 
Bohlinger, Metropolitan Transportation Authority financial coordinator, told 
the MTA board of directors on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question is when do the feds declare the emergency over," she said. 
"What happened in the Bay Area (after the Loma Prieta quake) is that emergency 
was tied only to the Bay Bridge. That was up and operating in two months, and 
their funding was cut off. So we have concerns that we really need to be on top 
of it. We need detailed documentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hidalgo, a public information officer for Metrolink, said the rail line 
between Santa Clarita and Downtown Los Angeles, which was carrying 950 
passengers a day before the quake, is now carrying about 22,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the system's capacity will be expanded soon with the acquisition of 
additional passenger cars. Eight are being leased from the Caltrans system in 
San Francisco, and the commuter rail system in Toronto, Canada, has been asked 
for 25 more. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opening ceremony for the Sylmar/San Fernando Metrolink station, Los 
Angeles City Councilmen Hal Bernson and Richard Alarcon were joined by 
officials from Metrolink, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation and the 
city of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a disaster and a tragedy to get us here early, unfortunately," said 
Bernson, who had petitioned Metrolink officials to open the station ahead of 
its scheduled opening next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers commuting from Santa Clarita have been using the 
station quietly for the past three days, and 150 disembarked from the 5:43 a.m. 
train Wednesday. Riding on later trains were several San Fernando city workers, 
employees of Olive View-UCLA Medical Center and a handful of Valley commuters, 
who, despite limited publicity, heard about the station's opening, said an MTA 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 Few riders boarded the Sylmar/San Fernando train, located at 1st and Hubbard 
streets, but by midmorning, about 340 people had arrived at the station to make 
connections to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies provided shuttle service from the station for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters such as Sherri Princell and Linda Cook, both medical assistants, had 
no shuttle buses waiting for them. Until the Sylmar station opening, the Santa 
Clarita residents took Metrolink to the Burbank station and rode MTA buses back 
to their Sherman Oaks office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that this opened today is great," said Princell, whose round-trip 
commute Tuesday had taken eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The yet-to-be-completed station lacked some amenities. Commuters leaving the 
train walked onto a platform poured just 13 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 They walked amid a throng of construction workers pouring still more concrete, 
drilling holes and clearing space to finish the station by Feb. 21, the 
official opening date. 
</P>
<P>
 Still under construction is the parking lot, benches for commuters and the 
ticket booth. A table cluttered with schedules and brochures served as the 
ticket counter. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials handed commuters bus schedules and gave instructions on making 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, angered by the station's many delays, said that even though the 
station was nearing completion, he was dissatisfied with what he called the 
MTA's unfair treatment of northeast San Fernando Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the only station that's not open," Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Van Nuys, Small Business Administration officials handed out the 
first $2.5 million in disaster relief loans to 77 families whose homes were 
damaged in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The first check went to Eli Landaverde of Arleta, a 24-year-old stock clerk 
who picked up the initial $10,000 installment of his $25,700 loan at the Mid 
San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday afternoon.

 After 22 years of teaching, the promotion of Nasr Hamid abu Zaid, a professor 
of Arabic literature and one of Egypt's best-known intellectuals, seemed a sure 
bet. Two fellow professors evaluated him and complimented his many papers and 
books on Islamic discourse. They recommended him for a full professorship at 
prestigious Cairo University. 
</P>
<P>
 But a third scholar was troubled by Abu Zaid's assertions that the texts of 
the Koran, the holy book of Islam, should be studied in light of the men who 
had interpreted them. Such talk is "similar to atheism," this evaluator warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Zaid was denied his professorship. Denouncing him as a heretic became a 
cause celebre at mosques throughout Egypt. Then, last fall, he found himself 
served with divorce papers. They were not filed by his wife, a fellow Cairo 
University professor and one of his greatest admirers, but by a lawyer who 
argued that a Muslim woman protected under Egyptian law should not remain 
married to an apostate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the court case, I thought we were living in a modern civil society," 
said Abu Zaid, whose divorce will be decided in a Cairo courtroom today. "When 
we heard about the case, my wife and I were shocked. We thought it was some 
sort of black joke. We were amazed to learn something like this is permitted 
under the Egyptian legal code. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we realize the whole issue is intended to make me stop writing and 
teaching," he continued. "To make me silent -- whether by this deprivation of 
promotion, or by the loss of my wife, or by death. The intention is to stop the 
critical mind -- a battle intellectuals thought was won 100 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arab world, which brought civilization the beginnings of mathematics and 
astronomy and the greatest library of all time, is in a state of ideological 
peril. It has become the victim of dwindling educational resources, religious 
fundamentalism and a general intellectual confusion that has left much of the 
developing world searching for its place in the new world order, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Egypt -- historically the Arab cultural heart and a teeming center for 
entertainment and media -- intellectuals and artists are locked in a war with 
religious conservatives who are seeking to hold all books, magazines, plays and 
paintings to a strict religious standard. Financing from conservative Arab Gulf 
states has hamstrung Egypt's famed film and publishing industries. 
</P>
<P>
 In Algeria, long considered a land of deep, often avant-garde thinkers, 
writers and intellectuals have been the target of a massive assassination 
campaign by Islamic fundamentalists. Most have been forced into exile or 
hiding. A noted sociologist and think tank director had his throat slit in 
front of his family. Many of Algiers' remaining intellectuals have left their 
homes and are living under army guard in a compound outside the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the region's most important media outlets -- including the respected 
Al Hyat and Al Shark el Awsat newspapers and the influential Middle East 
Broadcasting Center satellite television station -- are now owned by powerful 
Saudis close to Saudi Arabia's royal family. The takeover of these media is 
part of a wave of such acquisitions by wealthy Saudis in recent years; the 
trend is spreading the ultraconservative Gulf's influence throughout the 
important media centers of the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over religious fundamentalism, raging in cultural centers from 
Kuwait to Morocco, emerges against a backdrop of unease that has beset the Arab 
intelligentsia since the Arabs' crushing defeat by Israel in 1967. It worsened 
with the Persian Gulf War in 1991 -- a military setback that spelled an even 
more important loss in the ideological underpinnings of pan-Arabism and Arab 
nationalism upon which the Arab world had comfortably rested for most of this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying my utmost to understand the scope of the crisis that has 
afflicted Arab thought since the defeat in the 1967 war," said Mohamed 
Hassanein Heikal, one of Egypt's best-known writers and a confidant of former 
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare interview in his sunny office overlooking the Nile, Heikal predicted 
that the ideological vacuum in the Arab world will open the door to a new era 
of Israeli domination -- in a new Middle Eastern market, in a new period of 
"peace without justice" negotiated by Arabs out of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the intellectual crises in the Arab world is that we are dealing now 
in fluids and gases," Heikal observed. "We are still unable to find either an 
inspiration for our hopes or a target for our anger. When President Bush talked 
about a new world order, we accepted it as a final solution, not realizing it 
was only an experiment, an idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israeli era that is coming will be brief," he predicted. "But it will 
last until the Arab nation finds itself and returns back to a new world, not a 
world based on the end of history, nor an Islamic paradise -- something 
different. But we haven't found that something different yet, and that is the 
crisis of the Arab intelligentsia." 
</P>
<P>
 Arab intellectuals in recent times have struggled to find a way of 
understanding themselves and their place in the world. They have been hit by a 
triple whammy: 
</P>
<P>
 * The collapse of the Soviet Union, which had backed radical regimes in Iraq, 
Libya, Syria and Egypt off and on through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 * An Arab world turned against itself and the West with Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 * And a new peace between Palestinians and Israel that many still regard as 
suspect and ill advised. 
</P>
<P>
 These developments have plunged Arab thinkers into turmoil: Many erstwhile 
Marxist intellectuals are now card-carrying Islamic fundamentalists; they find 
in political Islam a way of asserting a nationalist identity without having to 
align themselves with the world's new emerging powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Arab nationalist movement and the Islamic reform movement have been 
intertwined for at least 100 years -- but now they are part of a more general 
and ambitious process of intellectual and political self-questioning," Edward 
Said, a leading Palestinian intellectual, wrote recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is modernity for a Muslim? What is our heritage? Who has and ought to 
have authority? These are major epistemological problems that now occupy a lot 
of attention among intellectuals and scholars." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cairo, Mahgoub Omer, one of Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman 
Yasser Arafat's most steadfast advisers and a longtime leftist, now writes a 
weekly column for the Islamic biweekly Al Shaab. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who are trying to differentiate among the intellectuals in our nation, 
I think, make a big mistake, if they forget that all the people here are 
Muslims," he said in an interview. "Even the (Christian) Copts are Muslim in 
tradition and culture. We have a reference ideology, which is Islam. We see 
that Islam gives us our morals, our ethics, our red lines not to cross, our 
dreams, our life." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the dilemma for many Arab intellectuals is that Islamic philosophies have 
the past as their point of reference; this is a difficult matter at a time when 
the Arabs' future is very much in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intellectuals are placed in a very difficult situation," said Egyptian 
leftist Mohammed Sid Ahmed. "Either they espouse Enlightenment philosophies and 
then feel they're not on the wavelength of the people -- who are caught up in 
the problems of joblessness, economic problems, deep frustration, the feeling 
of being manipulated rather than being master of your fate -- or else they try 
to rationalize the Islamic movement . . . which is not an intellectual movement 
at all. It is a religious movement that has become a source of ideology, faute 
de mieux (for want of something better). Enlightened intellectuals, if they are 
honest, they are torn apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Against a backdrop of Islamic and nationalist values, Arab intellectuals are 
trying to make sense of the Gulf War. Was it a defeat for pan-Arab pride, 
because it called in the West to crush the Arabs' only remaining military 
power? A victory for a new world order that protects democracy and shuns 
aggression? And if the latter, among the oppressive sheikdoms and 
military-backed regimes that populate the Arab world from east to west, where 
is there a democratic Arab regime that is part of this new world order? 
</P>
<P>
 In his "Cruelty and Silence," a book that has created a firestorm in Arab 
coffee shops, Kanan Makiya, an exiled Iraqi writer, bitterly indicts Arab 
intellectuals for defending Saddam Hussein's tyrannical Iraqi regime in the 
name of tired nationalist slogans while remaining silent about the Arab Baath 
Socialist Party regime's slaughter of Kurds and Shiites in uprisings in Iraq 
after the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the wake of the mountain of bodies created by the Lebanese civil war, the 
Iranian revolution, the Iraq-Iran War and the Gulf War, there can be no more 
romance and no more false heroics in the Arab world," Makiya said. "There is 
only a legacy of pain which must be grappled with by a new language and a new 
style." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Arab artists and writers say they have often found themselves powerless to 
speak out against the oppression around them because they are caught in a 
dragnet, not only of religious conservatism but of state censorship; in the 
name of religious values, interference by the state often stifles critical 
political discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar Belhouchet, publisher of Algeria's lively Al Watan newspaper, was shot at 
by suspected Islamic militants last year and escaped only by ducking in his car 
and gunning the accelerator. But the government arrested him and held him for 
several days, and it has detained several other journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 In Egypt, intellectuals have been reeling for weeks from a parliamentary 
debate that began when a national assembly member condemned the minister of 
culture for several publications, one of which included a famous painting by 
Gustav Klimt of Adam and Eve and another an erotic Indian poem in which a woman 
entreats her lover to stand naked in front of the mirror with her to see that 
he is stronger. (Female deputies were asked to leave the room before the debate 
began.) 
</P>
<P>
 The minister responded, to the horror of some media commentators, by defending 
the works in question but assuring the floor that all publications of the 
government are cleared first by Azhar University, the conservative seat of 
Islamic learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cairo intellectuals debated calling a protest march but decided it would 
probably be quashed by security-conscious authorities. They settled for a 
statement of protest. But many have complained that, as in Algeria, Arab 
governments, and not just religious conservatives, are often part of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Adel Hussein, editor of Al Shaab, has been called in for questioning in Egypt 
recently. Islamic fundamentalists in Saudi Arabia were arrested last year when 
they attempted to launch a human rights group critical of the government. The 
dispute went uncovered in the widely circulated Al Hyat or Al Shark el Awsat, 
owned by wealthy Saudis and published in London. It also attracted no attention 
from the Egyptian media, which when it is government-controlled responds 
slavishly to Egyptian officials' restrictions and when it is privately owned 
follows the dictates of the lucrative Saudi market. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose el Youssef, an upstart Egyptian weekly magazine, was recently banned in 
Saudi Arabia, a move that must have been a severe financial blow. But it was 
the same magazine that, in a recent controversy in Egypt over cultural and 
artistic restrictions, last week published several banned works that had never 
appeared in print in the Arab world. These included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Excerpts from Salman Rushdie's "Satanic Verses," which earned their author a 
death sentence from Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Thousand and One Arabian Nights," portions of which, believe it or not, 
have long been banned as risque. 
</P>
<P>
 * An Egyptian novel by Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz that contains allegorical 
passages deemed irreverent about the Prophet Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
 * A forbidden poem from the Arab world's most popular poet, Syrian writer 
Nizzar Kabbany. The poem, "Father of Ignorance Buys Fleet Street," talks about 
the Saudis' feverish purchase of media -- publishing houses, magazines, 
newspapers and television stations; this has been one of the biggest irritants 
to writers and filmmakers in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and North Africa. The 
cultural elite in the heart of the Arab world sees its artistic heritage being 
sold to oil barons whose cultural interests, in the main, are to protect the 
wealthy ruling families of the Gulf and maintain strict Islamic values. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the middle of the process of buying up our culture," said Mursi 
Saad Din, former undersecretary of culture and cultural editor of the Cairo 
newspaper Ahram Weekly. "At the last Cairo film festival, not a single Egyptian 
film won a prize. The two prizes went to films that were co-productions, 
Palestinian and Syrian, but co-produced from outside, which means they cannot 
in a true sense be considered Arab films. . . . In my view, it is an 
orchestrated campaign against culture in Egypt." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Kabbany: 
</P>
<P>
 Long life for you,  
</P>
<P>
 You that buy women by the pound  
</P>
<P>
 And buy pens by the pound.  
</P>
<P>
 We don't want anything from you.  
</P>
<P>
 Sleep with your slave women as you please.  
</P>
<P>
 Slaughter your dependents as you please.  
</P>
<P>
 Blockade the nation with fire and steel.  
</P>
<P>
 No one wants to take away your happy monarch.  
</P>
<P>
 No one wants to steal your khalifa's headband.  
</P>
<P>
 So drink the oil wine to its end,  
</P>
<P>
 And leave culture to us.

PART OF MALL COULD REOPEN IN 6 MONTHS; RETAIL: SOME NORTHRIDGE FASHION CENTER 
STORES COULD STAY SHUT LONGER. ASBESTOS IS THE OBSTACLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The quake-ravaged Northridge Fashion Center will partially reopen within about 
six months, the shopping mall's new owners told tenants Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the mall's six big department stores could remain closed for a 
year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest obstacle to the reopening now is not the condemned Bullock's 
department store and two collapsed parking structures, or the cartloads of 
broken glass, fallen ceiling tiles, cracked drywall and mangled aluminum wall 
studs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the asbestos that was dislodged by last week's massive earthquake. The 
mall is only about one mile from the quake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shopping center was built in 1971 the structural steel in the 
ceilings was sprayed with asbestos for insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75% of the cancer-causing substance was removed over the years, but 
asbestos remains in 40 to 50 stores and parts of the common areas of the mall, 
said John Graham, vice president of property management at MEPC America 
Properties Inc. MEPC just bought the Northridge mall in December. 
</P>
<P>
 MEPC had planned to renovate the shopping center within two years and would 
have removed any asbestos disturbed by the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nature has sped up the timetable," Graham said. "Because of the damage, our 
intention now is to clean all the asbestos out instead of doing it piecemeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos is thought to be safe in buildings if it remains undisturbed, but it 
can pose a health hazard if it is released into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 MEPC, based in Dallas, is a subsidiary of MEPC PLC, a British real estate 
concern with $5 billion in properties worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month the company acquired American Properties Trust, the owner of 
Northridge Fashion Center and other commercial properties, for $302 million 
from a group of British pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Fashion Center, with $350 million in total annual sales, is one 
of Southern California's largest shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Its sales per square foot -- a common retail industry benchmark -- were a 
relatively high $310. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said MEPC has earthquake insurance, but declined to say what damages 
might be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Peller, senior vice president at Associated International Insurance 
Co. in Woodland Hills, said his company insured part of the Northridge mall and 
it could cost $35 million just to rebuild the two caved-in parking garages. 
</P>
<P>
 MEPC also has business interruption insurance that will cover it for the loss 
of rent while the mall is closed, Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 But tenants are responsible for fixing any damages inside their shops, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, in a packed ballroom at the Airtel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys, 
tenants were told by MEPC officials that there was minimal structural damage to 
the central part of the Northridge mall, apart from the department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been decided yet how many stores it will take to justify reopening 
part of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,500 workers were employed at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 After the tenants' meeting, about 20 merchants were allowed into the 
Northridge mall for the first time since the quake in areas that were found to 
be free of asbestos. They were allowed half-hour visits to inspect their stores 
and remove cash and certain items. Another 40 shop owners or managers were to 
be allowed in today, but mall officials said they didn't know when the 
retailers would be able to begin their cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham also said he didn't know how long it would take to rebuild the caved-in 
parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other parking decks also sustained structural damage, but engineers had 
not yet reported to him the severity of those damages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the department stores were hard hit by earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Crogh, a Bullock's spokeswoman, said it hasn't been decided if the 
collapsed Northridge store will be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 A new Bullock's would take up to 18 months to build, Crogh said. Bullock's and 
its parent, R. H. Macy & Co. Inc., is "in discussions" with MEPC, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the J. C. Penney store may not reopen for more than a year, store 
officials said. Although part of the fourth floor collapsed and there is 
extensive water damage, the store does not need to be entirely rebuilt, said 
company spokeswoman Nancy Dickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears is aiming for a late-fall reopening, said company spokesman Gordon 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Robinsons-May, which has two stores at Northridge Fashion Center, 
and officials at the Broadway said they were still assessing damage and didn't 
know how long their stores would be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The department stores said they were trying to find jobs for their employees 
at other stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the mall, the main passageways and common areas have been swept clean 
of the broken glass, fallen ceiling tiles and merchandise that had crashed 
through the storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastic sheets covered the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights were on and Muzak continued to play in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside in the parking lot, the mall staff worked out of trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 As they left the tenants meeting, shopkeepers worried about what they might 
find behind the plastic sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those likely to be hardest hit are the small proprietors that are not part of 
a large chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Duhanci, owner of the Caprice collectibles shop, said he has no 
earthquake insurance. After looking into it three years ago, he found that such 
coverage would have tripled his insurance payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the loss of his business, even temporarily, is "like a second earthquake," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duhanci hopes that his will be one of the first stores to reopen because it is 
already free of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 But even without having seen the damage at the store, he figures that all his 
merchandise -- including a collection of expensive figurines -- was "totaled." 
</P>
<P>
 Mall workers also worried about their future. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Mather, an employee at Country Works, a collectibles shop in the 
Northridge mall, said she has already filed for unemployment and will start 
looking for another job. "Everyone is in the same boat. With so many other 
people looking, I don't know what my options are." 
</P>
<P>
 Zach Rouse, a Chatsworth High School senior who works at Waldenbooks, said he 
is hoping to find work at another bookstore in the chain. "I need the cash," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's traumatic," said Nicole Yaro, a Moorpark College junior who worked at 
one of the Northridge Robinsons-May stores. Yaro was asked by store management 
to remain "on-call," but she said she wasn't optimistic about her chances of 
being placed at another store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have bills to pay from Christmas. I don't want to go on unemployment. I 
want a job," Yaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, earlier this week some of the businesses on the outskirts of the 
shopping center property did reopen, including a Cocos restaurant, Great 
Western Bank and Bank of America branches, and the Broadway Goodyear Automotive 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other local malls continued with their earthquake recovery efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park plans to reopen Friday, although its four 
department stores will remain closed anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Saks Fifth Avenue on Wednesday said it would not reopen its earthquake-damaged 
store at the Promenade shopping center in Woodland Hills, a decision that will 
idle 131 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor tore Saks' roof, separated walls and created faults in the 
building, which was opened in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 The retailer had no precise estimate of reconstruction costs, but said the 
damage was substantial. "The repair costs would have been prohibitive," said 
Saks Vice Chairman Gary Witkin, who visited the store Wednesday to survey the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Saks will offer severance pay, extended benefits and job placement assistance 
to the store's employees, Witkin said. Store employees who want to remain with 
the company will be given preference for jobs at other Saks locations when 
openings occur, Witkin said.

UP A TREE; NEIGHBORS SAY BOY'S $3,200 AERIE BLOCKS VIEW AND MUST COME DOWN; 
CITY TO DECIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It may have a balcony, a skylight and an ocean view, but the $3,200 structure 
perched upon two eucalyptus trees behind their home is still just a treehouse, 
say Lewis and Linda Castillo, a birthday present for their little boy, Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrew's treehouse is anything but a cute play home to the Castillos' 
neighbor, Geo Moskios, who filed a complaint with the city, saying it obscured 
his view and infringed on his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the city told the Castillos to get Design Review Board approval 
for the structure or dismantle it. The Castillos dragged their feet, they now 
admit, and the city attorney took them to court, where they were ordered to 
seek a city permit. 
</P>
<P>
 So judgment day approaches for 10-year-old Andrew's al fresco luxury home. 
Next week, the Castillos will appear before the review board, a panel that will 
chart new regulatory territory as it considers, for the first time, the fate of 
a wooden fort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole thing is pretty silly," Linda Castillo said. "I mean, a 
child's treehouse?" 
</P>
<P>
 But such matters are serious business in this eccentric coastal community that 
is almost as legendary for its zoning squabbles as for its artist's colony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the city attorney take them into court because they were not 
complying," said Dee Dillon, the city's code enforcement officer. "They were 
not coming into design review or removing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are also high for some neighbors, such as Moskios, a yoga 
instructor who filed the complaint two years ago. He said the ocean view young 
Andrew now enjoys once belonged to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I used to be able to sit here at our dining room table and have 
our breakfast in the morning and look out through those trees and see that 
view," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look in that treehouse, you can look right in my house," he added. 
"There's a major privacy issue here." 
</P>
<P>
 Design review controversies are nothing new for Laguna Beach, a city that in 
1991 temporarily barred a couple from moving into their new home because it was 
painted a whiter shade than had been agreed upon by the couple and the review 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 After that highly publicized incident, the board refused to grant another 
couple approval to build a new home, in part because it would have cast a 
shadow on an existing residence. 
</P>
<P>
 And another time, the city's review board refused to let a woman keep a picket 
fence that was six inches too high. In that case, however, the City Council 
overruled the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest controversy centers on the upscale playhouse the Castillos had 
built for Andrew's sixth birthday. Ten feet long and five feet wide, the 
structure is about eight feet tall at the tip of its pitched roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The fort is secured between two towering eucalyptus trees with ropes, so the 
trees would not have to be speared with nails. The Castillos maintain that the 
structure will not fit properly into any other tree in their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has at least one defender, Michael Beanan, the craftsman who built 
the treehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the city, Beanan said the claim that the treehouse blocks 
anybody's view is "unfair and unwarranted" because it is nestled in mature 
trees that already obscure the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mention view in this town and everything stops," said Linda Castillo. She 
said Andrew would have to be a contortionist to lean around the treehouse 
balcony and peer into the neighbor's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say the complaints cannot be dismissed, partly because the 
treehouse is an "accessory structure" that must win design review approval to 
stay, according to Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any separate structure has to have design review approval," she said, noting 
that this is the first time somebody has complained to the city about a 
treehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon said she does not expect the structure to receive any special 
consideration from the board simply because it is located in a tree. And, since 
it is in a set-back area at the rear of the back yard, it also will require a 
variance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Castillos say they met with Moskios but that a tentative agreement between 
the parties dissolved when another neighbor also complained about the fort, 
saying it also infringed upon his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Andrew is still playing in his treehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as he's concerned, the cool thing about the fort is that he can go 
there with his pals to watch birds, eat pizza, lob rocks at trees and talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like bird watching and stuff because there's a hawk's nest right above 
it," he said. "I really like it up there. . . . I just wouldn't want it to come 
down."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: A SHAKE-UP IN THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In reality, all three candidates have been running for a year. But if you were 
forced to designate an official kickoff for the 1994 California gubernatorial 
campaign, it would be this week. And you'd have to say that the Democratic 
nomination is Treasurer Kathleen Brown's to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the earthquake, you'd have said the same about the general election in 
November. But nature suddenly has given Gov. Pete Wilson an opportunity to win 
reelection by shining as an administrator and a leader in the rebuilding. He'll 
need to make that his top priority. And he'll also need President Clinton's 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would the Democratic President help a Republican governor? Because their 
job ratings on the quake will be linked. Voters will bestow their appreciation 
or anger on the executives in charge of governmental efforts and likely won't 
distinguish much between the feds and the state. Clinton will need California 
politically in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, of course, could lose the nomination in June. And even if she won it, 
she could lose the general election regardless of whether Wilson shines in the 
quake zone. 
</P>
<P>
 If she comes across as too soft -- on the tough issues or in demeanor -- that 
could play into lingering stereotypes about women and worry some voters. She 
could say some dumb things, such as when she told reporters last month that her 
personal views on capital punishment were "irrelevant" because she intends to 
enforce the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Both her Democratic primary opponent, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, 
and the incumbent governor are tenacious, energetic, experienced street 
fighters with more detailed knowledge of the issues than Brown. The race has 
yet to be run. 
</P>
<P>
 But the point is, the candidates have been running and the insiders -- 
politicians and partisans -- today see it pretty much as they did several 
months ago, especially in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks like this: Garamendi is a tough campaigner and should not be 
underestimated, but Brown has the money and the women. And that is a powerful 
combination in a Democratic primary, where 53% to 56% of the voters are women. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also has something else: star quality, which no amount of campaign money 
can buy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brown next week will report a campaign bank balance of $5 million-plus. By 
contrast, Garamendi and Wilson will report roughly $1 million each. Neither 
Wilson nor Brown will have difficulty raising many millions more, but 
Garamendi's campaign probably will continue to hurt financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling shows the gender advantage for Brown: The most recent Field poll found 
Brown leading Garamendi by 15 points. Among women, she led by a whopping 21 
points; among men, by nine. Against Wilson, she led overall by eight points. 
But she had a 12-point lead among women and only four among men. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had cut substantially into Brown's lead since an October Field poll, 
when she led by 17 points. It seems many Republican women moved back to Wilson, 
putting party above gender. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi led Wilson by 11 points, indicating he might be a stronger 
Democratic nominee than Brown -- if only he could get past the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two big raps on Brown by her adversaries are that she is not specific and 
she's not experienced, either in government or politics. Their thinking is that 
she may buckle in a tough race. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Brown does not seem to have voters loudly clamoring for her election, 
as some had thought she might. But neither does she show signs of being a 
buckler. She's clearly a fighter and bent on following her father and brother 
into the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is about to substantially strengthen her campaign team by, among other 
things, bringing in a new chief strategist: Bill Carrick, who was Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein's top adviser when Feinstein narrowly lost to Wilson in the 1990 
gubernatorial race. Carrick reportedly is eager for another crack at Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has blunted the specificity charge with speeches outlining proposals on 
immigration, education, crime and -- on Wednesday -- the economy. At the same 
time Wednesday, Garamendi was outlining an earthquake recovery plan. Both 
speeches had one thing in common: strong attacks on Wilson's leadership. 
Garamendi's also contained something Brown's didn't: A bold call for tax 
increases to finance earthquake recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The three candidates were on the same platform for the first time last weekend 
at a conference of the California Teachers Assn. and all performed well. But 
don't look for many more such triads. Wilson hopes to stand aside while Brown 
and Garamendi pummel each other. And Brown will try to ignore Garamendi.

ASSEMBLY PANEL OKS FIVE '3 STRIKES' BILLS; GOVERNMENT: THE FINANCE COMMITTEE 
SENDS MEASURES TO THE FLOOR THAT WOULD CRACK DOWN ON REPEAT FELONS. BUT THEIR 
COSTS ARE UNKNOWN AND COULD AMOUNT TO $2 BILLION A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Continuing the rush to pass tough anti-crime legislation, the Assembly's main 
finance committee approved five separate "three strikes, you're out" bills 
Wednesday without knowing the total costs of any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing testimony that the measures may cost billions, the Assembly Ways 
and Means Committee approved the measures by wide margins, and sent them to the 
Assembly floor for a vote that could be taken as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came as a new Field Poll showed that 84% of the California 
electorate supports the three strikes initiative heading for the November 
ballot, which would impose life imprisonment for three-time repeat offenders 
convicted of violent or serious crimes. President Clinton endorsed the concept 
in his State of Union address Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's show that the Legislature can deal with this," said Assemblyman Bill 
Jones (R-Fresno) who, with Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Hanford), authored the 
toughest of the five measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said he was not suggesting that legislators cast their votes based 
on public opinion polls, Jones cited the Field Poll, saying: "This issue is 
paramount in people's minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) had hoped to place the three 
strikes measure on the June ballot, allowing voters to exorcise their anger 
over crime before the November general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But Atty. Gen. Daniel Lungren issued an opinion earlier this week saying that 
the Legislature may not have the authority to pass the three strikes statute by 
placing it before the voters. The Legislature can seek voters' approval only 
for constitutional amendments or bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative analyst placed the cost of incarcerating three-time losers for 
life at more than $2 billion per year. The California Department of Corrections 
is working on a more detailed analysis, but corrections chief James Gomez said 
the calculation will not be finished for weeks. The Department of Corrections 
current annual budget is $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the additional costs may be high, but the Legislature and the 
Department of Corrections can find ways of lowering the cost of incarceration 
once habitual felons are off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ways and Means Committee Chairman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) said 
that based on his 28 years in the Assembly, he doubts the Legislature can or 
will solve such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no confidence in us being able to deal with anything in the long 
term," Vasconcellos said. Vasconcellos abstained from voting on the three 
strikes measures, explaining later, "I don't believe in voting for things we 
can't pay for." 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-member Ways and Means Committee approved the Jones-Costa bill by a 17-1 
vote. The measure is an exact replica of the proposed initiative, and is 
endorsed by Mike Reynolds, the proponent of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, a photographer from Fresno, urged the committee to vote for the 
bill, asking members to consider the untold cost of violent crime committed by 
habitual criminals. His 18-year-old daughter was shot to death by a repeat 
felon outside a Fresno restaurant in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the legislators that unless they support the measure, "you need to 
understand that you are sharing a little bit of the responsibility" every time 
a repeat felon commits another murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds began pushing the initiative after the Assembly Committee on Public 
Safety refused to approve the Jones-Costa bill last year. Now, faced with 
Reynold's initiative and rising public outrage about crime, the Legislature has 
made an about-face. But Reynolds said he will drop the initiative only after 
the Legislature approves and the governor signs the Jones-Costa bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative and the Jones-Costa bill seek to double the sentences of people 
who commit a second serious or violent felony. A criminal who commits a third 
felony, after having committed two prior serious or violent felonies, would 
face a sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent and serious felonies are defined in the penal code and include crimes 
such as murder, rape, arson, armed robbery, residential burglary and furnishing 
drugs to a minor. In both the initiative and the Jones-Costa bill, the third 
"strike" could be any felony, including some types of theft, many drug offenses 
or a fourth drunk driving conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee approved other three strikes measures by Assemblymen Richard K. 
Rainey (R-Walnut Creek), Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) and Ross Johnson 
(R-Placentia), who has two identical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainey's measure has the support of the California District Attorneys Assn. 
Unlike the initiative, Rainey's bill would impose a sentence of life in prison 
without parole on three-time losers, and it would require that the third felony 
be violent or serious.

BROWN, GARAMENDI OUTLINE ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLANS; POLITICS: DEMOCRATIC 
GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES ACCUSE WILSON OF ALLOWING STATE TO REMAIN MIRED IN 
RECESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrats Kathleen Brown and John Garamendi, accusing Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson of allowing California to languish in recession, outlined activist 
economic programs Wednesday that are expected to keynote their campaigns to 
unseat Wilson in the fall election. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate luncheon speeches -- Brown in San Francisco and Garamendi in 
Hollywood -- both recalled their deep California family roots and called on 
Californians to rekindle the state's community spirit and optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Both offered revitalization programs that they said would give California the 
trained, skilled and broad-based economy the state will need to compete in the 
global business environment of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, the first-term state insurance commissioner, focused on the 
reconstruction of the Los Angeles area's infrastructure after the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to fix things now," he declared in a luncheon address to the 
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. "The very spirit of California is at stake. The 
very future of the economy depends on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said California under Wilson lacks the entrepreneurial spirit and 
intensity that has enabled Californians to become "a dynamic and successful 
breed." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the first-term state treasurer, offered a broader, "business-friendly" 
economic plan in her noon speech to the Commonwealth Club, a prestigious 
collection of San Francisco business and professional leaders. Her plan 
includes a tax moratorium for start-up businesses and tax credits for firms 
that create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that Californians looking to Sacramento for leadership, confidence 
and action during a period of difficult economic transition have encountered a 
governor whose actions told them: "You get what you deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I don't believe it is enough to be optimistic, to be bullish," Brown 
added. "But we have a governor who apparently does not believe California is a 
special place or that Californians are a special people." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Brown and Garamendi proposed setting up funds that would provide 
investment capital for California entrepreneurs -- Brown's by using state funds 
to leverage private contributions, and Garamendi's from savings provided by 
reform of health, auto and workers' compensation insurance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply cannot afford four more years of inaction and indecision," Brown 
said, referring specifically to the governor's office. "To create new jobs, to 
move the economy into high gear and to put California first, we need a strategy 
and a plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates, who will compete against each other in the June 7 Democratic 
primary, were sharply critical of Wilson, who became governor in January, 1991, 
just as the state was sinking into the depths of its worst recession in 
decades, with unemployment rising to the 10% range and the state budget 
plunging into deficits of unprecedented magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats said their approach to the California economy would differ 
markedly from Wilson's. They proposed a more vigorous role for the governor and 
state government, with emphasis on investment in programs, such as education, 
that would help invigorate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has insisted that California cannot afford major new spending programs 
until the economy recovers. Only then, he says, will the state have the new 
revenues -- from job growth and not from new taxes -- that will enable it to 
expand programs or restore cuts made during the lean years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also has refused so far to endorse any tax increase or bond issue to 
finance California's share of earthquake reconstruction until it is clear just 
what the repairs will cost and how much the federal government will pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Brown and Garamendi have proposed programs in the past several days that 
would put up some California money now. Brown called for the use of $1.3 
billion in unsold bond funds and loans from existing state programs to help 
schools and public agencies rebuild. Garamendi said Wednesday that the state 
must be prepared to raise sales and gasoline taxes for a maximum of one year to 
finance specific freeway reconstruction projects and other repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, Brown said it is ironic that a Democrat must offer to make 
California government more friendly to business, but she commented: "Let's face 
it, the executive branch of California government is out of touch with business 
and its needs. . . . This has to become a state with a reputation for being 
business-friendly. Ironically, that has not happened under 11 consecutive years 
of Republican governors." 
</P>
<P>
 And she chastised Wilson for waiting until late 1993 and January of 1994 to 
travel out of the state or the country to promote California's business climate 
and attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlights of Brown's program: 
</P>
<P>
 * A tax moratorium for new businesses, exempting them from paying business 
income taxes in the first year, 50% of the tax bill in the second year and 25% 
in the third year. The full tax rate would kick in the fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
 * A job-creation tax credit that would pay up to 25% of the first-year salary 
of each new job. Full-time jobs paying salaries of between $17,600 and $60,000 
would be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of a California Performance Review to cull waste from state 
government. Such a review in Texas has saved state government more than $5 
billion, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of a Golden State Growth Fund "to promote grass-roots capitalism by 
leveraging existing state funds to expand access to capital." One feature of 
this concept is to give California companies an advantage in bidding for major 
public project contracts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the candidates have talked about simplifying the regulatory process, 
particularly by streamlining the maze that new businesses must negotiate to 
obtain necessary governmental permits. Brown pledged to do so Wednesday; Wilson 
already has announced the opening of two centers for that purpose, with four 
more being established. 
</P>
<P>
 In her speech, Brown talked more about her approach to the economy than 
details of her proposals, which in some cases resembled those already made by 
Wilson. In his 1994 State of the State address, Wilson proposed a $1,000 job 
creation tax credit similar to the one Brown outlined Wednesday. Brown's tax 
break could go up to $10,000 per job. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur said Brown's tax moratorium would provide little 
help for new businesses because they usually lose money in the first year or 
so. Any such losses could be deducted from future tax bills under one of the 
1993 tax changes, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look closely at both of their speeches, neither John Garamendi nor 
Kathleen Brown offered any constructive alternative in terms of a course Pete 
Wilson should have taken," Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has been fighting for three years to bring jobs back to 
California and the effort is finally paying off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi focused on the need of the state to respond quickly in rebuilding 
earthquake damage. Otherwise, he said, California will not have the public 
works facilities essential to future economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said that both sales taxes and gasoline taxes probably will have to 
be increased to finance the state's share of earthquake damage, even though the 
Clinton Administration has pledged to send California more than $7 billion in 
disaster assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi also said the federal government should create a national disaster 
insurance program to cover all sorts of calamities, including earthquakes. 
Otherwise, California should create an earthquake reconstruction fund to aid 
future earthquake victims, he said.

WILSON CLEARED OF WRONGDOING FOR TRADE MISSION DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's political watchdog agency has ruled that Gov. Pete Wilson did not 
intend to violate the law when he solicited donations from California companies 
to help pay for a 17-day trade mission to Asia last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The opinion by the Fair Political Practices Commission clears the way for the 
Wilson Administration to spend $114,000 it collected to offset expenses from 
the trip, said Trade and Commerce Undersecretary Loren Kaye. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to reimburse ourselves," Kaye said. "We're delighted that it's 
over and we can finally do what we intended to do all along." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue was whether the 21 donations ranging from $2,500 to $10,000 each were 
illegal gifts to a state official in violation of the $250 limit in the 
Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 California Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press raised the issue in a 
complaint to the FPPC after Wilson aides disclosed that they had solicited the 
money to fund his trip to Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and China. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who pledged to contribute to the trip were invited to accompany the 
governor and his delegation on the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FPPC's enforcement division, in a decision dated Monday, ruled that 
Wilson may have committed technical violations but did not intend to break the 
law. It said no action would be taken in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling said Wilson aides probably erred in having the donors earmark their 
contributions specifically for the governor's trade mission. Instead, they 
should have made no-strings-attached contributions to the Trade and Commerce 
Agency, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the trip was for official state business, the commission lawyers 
determined that the gifts were exempt from the $250 limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the facts showed that this was a 'tropical vacation' rather than 
legitimate business, that obviously would be considered an aggravating factor 
that would potentially change our view of what occurred here," the ruling said. 
"It appears to this agency that the trade mission constituted a legitimate 
governmental purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Press, reached Wednesday, criticized the FPPC. He noted that the commission's 
legal division had said in an earlier letter that the contributions could be 
illegal. "I strongly suspect that if it had been anyone other than the 
governor, the FPPC would have levied a stiff fine," Press said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Wilson, regardless of the commission's opinion, should return the 
money and use taxpayers' funds to pay for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that for the governor to accept and to now spend this money is to 
thumb his nose at the spirit of the law, if not the letter," Press said. "They 
may have found an end-run. But the regulations clearly state that a state 
agency cannot accept corporate contributions and target them for any particular 
purpose. It smells."

<P>
 Signs of optimism emerged Wednesday from PLO-Israeli talks on achieving 
Palestinian autonomy in the occupied lands, with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization reporting progress and both sides breakfasting with Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegations resumed talks unexpectedly Tuesday night, a day after 
announcing that negotiations were being suspended pending a meeting this 
weekend in Switzerland between the PLO leader and Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shimon Peres. 
</P>
<P>
 Statements by the two men after their meeting last week in Oslo indicated 
there was room for optimism that a plan can be reached for carrying out the 
Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.

 A student upset about the plight of Cambodian boat people charged a stage 
where Britain's Prince Charles was about to speak Wednesday night and fired two 
shots from a starter's pistol loaded with blanks before he was subdued. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they apprehended David Kang, 23, an Australian-born university 
student of Korean ancestry.Kang, who was to appear in court today, faces a 
20-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles' 12-day visit to Australia turned into a security nightmare when Kang 
jumped onto the stage where the prince was taking part in ceremonies to mark 
Australia's national day. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Kang had been sitting on the grassy Tumbalong Park oval for 
about 20 minutes before he jumped up and rushed the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Kang was tackled and quickly pinned down by politicians and security men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a stunt for a minute, and then I thought no, this is 
serious," said Ian Kiernan, who helped tackle Kang. "I came round from the 
second row and just got a good headlock on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Kang had written to Charles last month protesting the fact that 
Cambodian boat people are being held in detention camps in Australia. Charles' 
private secretary replied, saying the prince could not become involved in the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiernan said Charles told him the attack was like being charged by an elephant 
in Kenya. "Prince Charles was fantastic. He was as cool as a cucumber," said 
Kiernan. 
</P>
<P>
 After the incident, Charles casually swept his hair back and continued the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Minister Terry Griffiths said he believed that Buckingham Palace had 
requested no security between Charles and the Australian public during the 
visit, but he added that this request will now be ignored and security 
tightened.

LIFT VIETNAM EMBARGO, SENATORS URGE CLINTON; TRADE: BIPARTISAN GROUP OFFERS 
AMENDMENT TO EASE THE MOVE POLITICALLY. OPPONENTS PROMISE TO INTRODUCE RIVAL 
MEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The debate over normalizing relations with Vietnam erupted in the Senate on 
Wednesday when a bipartisan group of lawmakers offered an amendment urging 
President Clinton to lift the trade embargo imposed on Hanoi in the aftermath 
of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing that Clinton is already preparing to take the step, opponents of the 
move said they plan to counter it with amendments designed to retain the 
current trade restrictions until the President certifies that Vietnam has done 
all it can to account for American servicemen still listed as missing in 
Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
 With Administration officials acknowledging privately that they have reached a 
consensus on lifting the embargo, each side said it was moving to preempt the 
other by seeking to attach rival amendments to a $12-billion State Department 
authorization bill now moving through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a former prisoner of war who favors lifting the 
embargo, predicted that the amendment offered Wednesday by Sen. John Kerry 
(D-Mass.) and 17 other lawmakers will pass by "a very significant margin of 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
 While the authority to lift the embargo rests with Clinton, Kerry's 
non-binding amendment would make it politically easier for him to do so by 
expressing the "sense of the Senate" that Vietnam's efforts to account for 
missing servicemen have been substantial and now warrant a reciprocal gesture 
by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Although congressional sources say that the Administration wants to lift the 
embargo, the issue is a particularly sensitive one for Clinton because of the 
controversy he generated by avoiding military service during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing that Vietnam is still withholding information about missing 
Americans, veterans groups and MIA family organizations bitterly oppose lifting 
the embargo in the belief that the Administration will lose the only leverage 
it has to pressure Hanoi into giving a fuller accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Legion, for instance, has called upon its 3.1 million members to 
wage a campaign to keep the embargo intact. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kerry, a highly decorated Vietnam War veteran who headed an exhaustive 
Senate investigation of the POW issue last year, argued that considerable 
progress has already been made in resolving the fates of missing servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the best way to resolve the remaining "discrepancy cases" is to 
improve ties with Hanoi and expand the U.S. presence there. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a question of taking away leverage . . . but a question of giving 
leverage to us," Kerry said, adding that "you can't do the accounting if you 
are not there, not talking to the Vietnamese, to the soldiers and generals who 
know about the war." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the opposition to Kerry, Sen. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.) said he plans 
to introduce an alternative amendment that would allow Clinton to lift the 
embargo only after he certifies to Congress that Vietnam has done all he 
believes that it can do to account for the more than 2,200 Americans still 
officially listed as missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not advocating 100% accountability. I know they can never do that. But 
what we want is the fullest possible accounting, based on the information they 
(the Vietnamese) have in their files, before the embargo is lifted," said 
Smith.

NEW SCHOOLS TEST IF CORPORATE CONTROL MAKES THE GRADE; SEVERAL COMMUNITIES 
ACROSS THE NATION ARE TURNING TO PRIVATE FIRMS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTION AND TRIM 
COSTS.

 When Hurricane Andrew forced the Hirsch family from their house temporarily in 
1992, they enrolled their daughters in South Pointe Elementary, the first of a 
new breed of experimental public schools being operated by private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The family moved back to their more affluent neighborhood, but their daughters 
still travel to a blighted area of Miami Beach daily to attend South Pointe, 
where children learn at their own pace in an environment where competition is 
downplayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drive 50 miles a day to go to this school," said Dale Hirsch, the girls' 
mother, whose enthusiasm for South Pointe is so great that she is now the 
president of the Parents Teachers Assn. and a part-time employee there. 
"There's a sense of community that you don't have in traditional schools." 
</P>
<P>
 As parents and politicians search for alternatives to the public schools they 
feel are failing American children, they are looking more and more at hiring 
private, for-profit companies to modernize instruction and trim bureaucratic 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The pioneer in the broadening field is Minneapolis-based Education 
Alternatives Inc., which has a five-year contract with the Dade County, Fla., 
school system to help run South Pointe. The company also began running 11 
schools in Baltimore last fall and is in negotiations with several school 
systems around the nation, including in San Diego, Milwaukee, Washington, D.C., 
Hawaii and Portsmouth, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Education Alternatives' approach is to save money on the administrative side 
of the budget by cutting non-teaching staff and by purchasing equipment and 
supplies more economically. The company's teaching techniques, which lean 
heavily on individualized instruction, are not revolutionary -- but they are 
more costly because they require more teachers in each classroom and more 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter G. Amprey, superintendent of Baltimore City Schools, is a believer. 
"The statistics show that we as educators have failed a generation of 
Americans," he said in testimony to a Senate subcommittee this week. "What we 
have created is an educational gridlock that would take forever to untangle." 
</P>
<P>
 Education Alternatives is doing what his office never could, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A private company has pierced the bureaucracy for me," he said, and has made 
the schools "look fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee held the hearing to assess whether the federal government 
should support such public-private partnerships as a way to spearhead school 
reform, especially in urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The status quo we know is bad," said Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who chaired 
the hearing. "If you get private management in the schools, it could make a big 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 John T. Golle, Education Alternatives' chairman and chief executive officer, 
told the senators that he believes the public schools "have a moral and ethical 
responsibility" to provide a better education, especially to students from poor 
neighborhoods. "We believe we can be catalytic to systemic reform . . . without 
bankrupting the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, which is trying to spur reform of public schools 
without spending much money, is cautiously supportive. "We don't have a problem 
with it as long as the goal is high standards for all students," said Thomas 
Payzant, an assistant secretary of education and former superintendent of 
schools in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet not everyone is a fan. Many educators and taxpayers oppose allowing 
companies to earn profit -- in taxpayer dollars -- by running public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence that private management in and of itself produces 
miracles or even decent results," Bella Rosenberg of the American Federation of 
Teachers said at the hearing. She also raised questions about claims that 
private companies, over the long run, will be able to perform without asking 
taxpayers for extra money. 
</P>
<P>
 In classroom after classroom on a recent morning at South Pointe, students 
were sitting at tables working on projects independently or in groups. Nowhere 
was a teacher simply lecturing. In each class, two or three students were 
working at computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this school because we have the choice to go at our own pace," said 
Ryan Egozi, a fourth-grade student. "My goal was to finish the fourth-grade 
math book before the end of January, and I'm finishing up the last chapter."

BUSINESS DISCLOSURE LAWS SEEN AS GAINING MOMENTUM ACROSS NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Massachusetts taxpayers recently got a rare glimpse at the state tax returns 
of some big corporations, and what they saw surprised nearly everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new disclosure law, many major companies acknowledged that they paid 
no more than the $456 minimum tax in 1992, far below the 9.5% corporate tax 
rate and less than the tax bill of most state residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some firms that had laid off workers admitted they took a tax credit 
originally intended to compensate companies for creating new jobs. Analog 
Devices, a silicon chip firm that made a $2.1-million profit in Massachusetts, 
paid only $1,367 in taxes after taking $797,000 in credits -- even though it 
was reducing its work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, these disclosures created such a furor among ordinary 
taxpayers that the Massachusetts business community prevailed upon the state 
Legislature to take the sting out of the disclosure law. In the future, while 
their tax payments must still be reported publicly, the names of the 
corporations will be blacked out. 
</P>
<P>
 James Braude, head of Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts, a labor-dominated 
coalition that led the drive for disclosure, said the law was weakened because 
it demonstrated that some businesses are not paying their fair share of taxes. 
"It showed there are some serious abuses here, which the Legislature decided to 
cover up rather than fix," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while the Legislature's action was hailed as a victory for business, tax 
reformers insist it is no more than a temporary setback in what they believe is 
a burgeoning movement for corporate tax disclosure in many states across the 
nation, including California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Rep. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) authored an unsuccessful 
corporate tax disclosure bill similar to the Massachusetts provision last year. 
The California Tax Reform Assn. predicts that a similar measure will be offered 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is the Massachusetts Legislature's action likely to silence criticism of 
efforts by many states to lure and retain business by offering lucrative tax 
breaks. "That's still a very live issue," acknowledged Michael Widmer, 
president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, which successfully battled 
against disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to Analog Devices' $797,000 tax credit, Braude said the 
Massachusetts Legislature still must answer the question: "Can we spend 
$797,000 in another way that is more likely to create jobs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Pomp, a professor at the University of Connecticut Law School, noted 
that many states are offering special tax credits to lure or keep businesses, 
even though experts think the revenue losses often outweigh the economic 
benefits. He said states often see themselves in competition with one another 
to provide better business tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Massachusetts, tax reformers are questioning the effectiveness of a tax 
credit enacted in 1991 to encourage research and development activities within 
the state. While the credit is designed to generate jobs in the long term, the 
law is murky and does not prohibit firms like Analog Devices from taking 
advantage of it at the same time that they are laying off workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reformers succeeded in winning enactment of the Massachusetts disclosure law 
in January, 1993, on grounds that it would enable state legislators to judge 
the effectiveness of business tax credits. Until it was weakened, the 
Massachusetts law was the most comprehensive disclosure law in any state. 
</P>
<P>
 Although publicly traded corporations are required to disclose their federal 
tax payments to the Securities and Exchange Commission, most states -- with the 
exception of Arkansas, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Massachusetts -- do not 
require any public disclosure of state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corporations pay over $20 billion yearly in state corporate income taxes," 
Pomp said, "but the lack of state disclosure makes it impossible to evaluate 
the extent to which the corporate tax burden is being allocated fairly or 
rationally in relationship to measures of profitability."

PROGRAM FOR RUSSIA ATOM SCIENTISTS TO START; DIPLOMACY: PROJECT AIMS TO KEEP 
WEAPONS EXPERTS FROM DEFECTING TO OUTLAW STATES. MOSCOW IS BLAMED FOR DELAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and Russia are only now ready to embark on a program 
announced two years ago to prevent nuclear scientists from the former Soviet 
Union from selling their skills to outlaw states such as Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials blame Russian political infighting for the delay in launching 
the project, which is finally about to get under way with a scheduled meeting 
of the directors of a science center that is supposed to offer the scientists 
peacetime jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials say the plan still is vitally needed, even though the predicted 
rush of defections by scientists has not materialized -- at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic conditions have deteriorated steadily for the once-pampered 
scientists who made the Soviet Union a nuclear superpower, a State Department 
official said. Many scientists have rejected job offers from Iran, North Korea, 
Libya and other countries looking for backdoor entry into the nuclear club, but 
they may be unable to hold out much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lower-level scientists have already left, most of them for China, which 
is already a nuclear -power. But top scientists who could design a nuclear bomb 
from memory have stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of aiding nuclear scientists arose in February, 1992, when James A. 
Baker III, then secretary of state, visited a top-secret nuclear laboratory on 
the Siberian side of the Ural Mountains. Baker was told that the scientists who 
work there were eager to turn their talents to civilian research but that the 
Russian government lacked the funds to finance it. The next day, Baker and 
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin announced plans to create a science center 
to fund peacetime projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was launched with great urgency. Even so, no scientific jobs have 
been created and nothing much has been done. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Russian Parliament refused to ratify the plan because, U.S. officials 
speculate, it became embroiled in political warfare between the lawmakers and 
Yeltsin. The Russian president revived the idea by decree after he closed down 
Parliament last October. Although action by the newly elected Parliament 
probably will be required eventually, the organization has provisional 
authorization to go into operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Early next month, the board of directors of the proposed center -- 
representing the United States, Russia, the European Union and Japan -- will 
meet in Moscow to organize and to consider proposals for projects that create 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years since the Baker and Yeltsin announcement, the EU (formerly 
called the European Community) and Japan have joined Washington in supplying 
money for the project. About $70 million is available -- $25 million from the 
United States, about $28 million from the EU and $17 million from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 That is little more than seed money, U.S. officials admit. However, they say 
that if the plan works the way they hope it will, the Russian science projects 
will soon begin to produce revenue that can make them self-sustaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the science center concept was first conceived, we were just beginning 
to deal with dislocations from the demise of the Soviet Union," a State 
Department official said. "We suspected that (mass defection of nuclear 
scientists) was something that might happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now at the point where the impact on weapons facilities is real. These 
centers which once were sheltered and privileged have now experienced the kind 
of dislocation that might cause people to make life decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 With modern computers and modems, it may not even be necessary for a scientist 
to leave the country to go to work for Iran or some other nuclear aspirant. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Soviet period, the KGB could be counted on to prevent the 
emigration of scientists or anyone else with even a remote connection with the 
country's defense Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian government has taken steps to prevent scientists from defecting, 
but U.S. officials say that Moscow's grip is becoming less sure as democracy 
takes hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a fairly substantial extent, the Russian government knows who is in its 
scientific community, the 200 or so top designers and theoreticians," the State 
Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, their ability to prevent them from going anywhere may be 
declining," the official said. "How do you prevent someone from going to China 
and then to North Korea? . . . There are too many unknowns now."

PARLIAMENT OUSTS BELARUS LEADER, IMPERILS REFORMS 
</P>

From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 The country's Soviet-era Parliament ousted Belarus' liberal leader, Stanislav 
Shushkevich, on Wednesday and appeared to bury any hope of rapid economic 
reforms and a neutral foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators voted 209 to 36 to dismiss Shushkevich, the 59-year-old chairman 
of Parliament who has waged a virtually single-handed ideological battle 
against reluctant converts to market economics. 
</P>
<P>
 His ouster came two weeks after he received President Clinton's backing during 
the U.S. leader's tour of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Belarus' conservative prime minister, Vyacheslav Kebich, Shushkevich's 
constant rival, survived a vote to oust him. A total of 101 legislators voted 
for his dismissal and 175 against. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion accused both men of corruption. But members of Parliament made it 
plain that the vote was intended to censure Shushkevich's support for market 
reforms and resistance to aligning foreign policy with neighboring Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives were gleeful over the outcome, but liberals, a small minority in 
Parliament, said the vote portended the end of Belarus as an entity separate 
from Russia in the post-Soviet era. 
</P>
<P>
 "Belarus' new pro-Russian leadership will conduct its affairs in such a way as 
to bring the country into the Russian empire," said Zenon Poznyak, leader of 
the Belarussian Popular Front.

ROMANIA IS FIRST TO SIGN UP FOR NATO COOPERATION PROGRAM

<TEXT>
<P>
 NATO enrolled Romania on Wednesday as the first nation in its new program 
offering cooperation to former Warsaw Pact foes while denying them full 
membership in the military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu signed the document during a 
meeting with ambassadors of the 16 nations in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Partnership for Peace" program, proposed by the United States, will allow 
East European nations and ex-Soviet republics to join NATO in military 
exercises, peacekeeping operations and other activities. But it does not grant 
them membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Melescanu said his country already has begun informal consultations with NATO 
military experts and hopes to conduct joint peacekeeping exercises later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 President Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania planned to sign up today, followed 
by Poland and possibly Estonia next week.

INDIA DISPLAYS TACTICAL MISSILE IN PARADE; MILITARY: SOPHISTICATED WEAPON IS 
SHOWN PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST TIME. MEANWHILE, RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN ARE AT AN

<P>
 With relations with its longtime enemy, Pakistan, at an acrimonious ebb, India 
on Wednesday displayed for the first time its most sophisticated tactical 
battlefield missile, the sleek-nosed Prithvi. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of the truck-mounted weapons, dabbed with olive-drab and beige 
camouflage paint, rolled slowly through the center of the capital as the star 
participants in the annual Republic Day parade of India's military might. 
</P>
<P>
 Western military attaches said the Prithvi (Hindi for "Earth" or "globe"), 
with a maximum range of 150 miles and a payload of up to 2,200 pounds, is 
similar to a small Scud. They differed over whether the public debut of the 
surface-to-surface weapon was meant as saber-rattling for Pakistan's benefit 
but agreed that it will hardly defuse tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly a display of political determination," one attache said. 
</P>
<P>
 India was careful not to reveal everything, however. The jet nozzles of the 
28-foot-long missile had been concealed with a cover. Viewing them would have 
allowed specialists to deduce how the rocket was guided and also its degree of 
accuracy, one defense expert said. 
</P>
<P>
 And authorities kept security extremely tight at Republic Day festivities, 
held to mark the anniversary of the 1950 constitution that transformed this 
former British colony into a sovereign democratic republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Indo-Pakistani relations have deteriorated badly since widespread insurgency 
broke out four years ago in Kashmir, the only state of India where Muslims are 
the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of the former Himalayan principality is held by Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 The countries have already fought two wars over Kashmir, and attempts earlier 
this month to narrow differences through negotiations were a fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 India accuses Pakistan of arming and supporting the militants in Kashmir who 
are fighting to overthrow Indian rule and either create an independent nation 
or unify with Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, India submitted half a dozen proposals to Pakistan, including a 
pledge by both sides not to use nuclear weapons first.

<P>
 That same day, however, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto indicated that 
there was little room for compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 She accused India of waging a campaign of repression in the disputed state and 
declared: "Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan, and the day is not far off 
when it will be a part of this country." 
</P>
<P>
 She also called for a "total strike" for Feb. 5 in her country and in Kashmir 
to show popular support for a Pakistani-endorsed plebiscite that would ask 
Kashmiris to choose whether to remain in India. 
</P>
<P>
 The military capabilities of India and Pakistan make the conflict over Kashmir 
a possible high-stakes one and have sparked growing concern by the United 
States and other Western nations.

BAR PRESIDENT SWINGS AT 'THREE STRIKES' CRIME PROVISION; LAW: HE CALLS IT A 
POLITICAL 'QUICK FIX' THAT WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT ON CURBING URBAN VIOLENCE. 
LONG-RANGE SOLUTIONS ARE BACKED AT CONFERENCE. 
</P>

 The Clinton Administration's call for life imprisonment for three-time violent 
offenders is a political quick fix that would have no effect on the crime rate, 
American Bar Assn. President R. William Ide said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ide called for a change in direction toward greater local involvement in 
crime-fighting. His comments opened a two-day conference designed to slow down 
or stall the growing White House and congressional support for stiffer 
mandatory sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers applauded President Clinton during his State of the Union speech 
Tuesday night when he advocated swift congressional approval of a crime bill -- 
including the popular "three-strikes-and-you're out" provision already passed 
by the Senate. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to hold hearings on 
its own version of the measure next month, with Senate-House negotiations 
likely to lead to a final bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quick-fix frenzy has captured our political leadership," Ide told an 
audience of law enforcement specialists from 29 national organizations. "It's 
understandable that Congress wants to be seen as tough on crime in a political 
year . . . but federalization of crimes that belong in state jurisdictions is 
posturing and not a long-range solution to violent crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Provisions of the crime legislation would add to a growing list of violence- 
or drug-related offenses that Congress has given federal authorities power to 
prosecute. Such crimes historically have been the purview of local and state 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ide asked Congress and the Administration to consider whether the so-called 
"three-time-loser" provision would be "just another politically palatable quick 
fix . . . or will this new idea be the straw that breaks the back of our 
overburdened criminal justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Philip B. Heymann, who also spoke at the conference, said 
that the Justice Department was examining the Senate-approved provision to see 
what crimes would trigger a life sentence and whether it should apply to 
offenses committed by juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that the law would require life in prison without parole, without 
exceptions, for those sentenced under such a procedure. "The whole purpose of 
this is to send a clear signal" to potential offenders, Heymann said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his address, Ide said that the Senate's classification of handgun murders 
as federal crimes and approval of mandatory federal penalties for using a 
handgun might be self-defeating. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandatory minimum sentencing, he pointed out, has already filled prisons to 
capacity, forcing authorities to grant other violent offenders early release. 
</P>
<P>
 Ide said that the United States has 1.3 million people in prison or jail cells 
-- more than any other country in the world -- with very little impact on crime 
rates over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 James Fyfe, a former New York City police officer who is now professor of 
criminal justice at Temple University, also criticized the "three-time-loser" 
proposal on grounds that the third crime must be subject to federal 
jurisdiction, which does not now cover most street crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really doesn't do much for the little old lady worried about crime in the 
streets," Fyfe said. "There's an awful lot of posturing going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to ask some very tough questions of politicians, especially at the 
federal level, and get them to address root causes (of crime)," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ide also questioned how Clinton's plan to put another 100,000 police officers 
on the streets would impact state prosecutors, courts and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are the resources to try the accused?" Ide asked. "Where are the 
resources to house the convicted?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ide advocated greater emphasis on crime prevention, along with imprisonment of 
career criminals by mobilizing local police, prosecutors, judges, treatment 
specialists, parole officers and community organizations into crime-fighting 
coalitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violent crime is a community problem that must be solved through community 
involvement," he said.

CHOICE AT HEART OF KAISER, PACIFIC VENTURE; HEALTH CARE: DEAL WITH THE NEWPORT 
BEACH INSURER MARKS A NEW ERA OF OPTIONS FOR WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The alliance between Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Newport Beach and 
Kaiser Permanente's California operations is aimed at giving both companies and 
their workers a streamlined health care service with options unheard of a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2.2 million members of Kaiser Permanente of Southern California, for 
instance, would be able to go to the health maintenance organization for 
routine ailments like influenza and common injuries and, by paying standard 
deductibles, go to the doctors of their choice for the same or more serious 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers, meantime, won't be faced with separate sales, administration and 
billing. The program, called Added Choice, will let each employer deal with 
only one representative and one set of policies and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser of Northern California will offer a different plan for its 2.6 million 
members by giving them the choice of joining the HMO or Pacific Mutual's 
regular fee-for-service benefit plan, though members can switch once a year. 
The advantages to employers will be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Mutual, the largest California-based life insurer, and Kaiser, the 
nation's and the state's largest HMO, hope to offer their combined plan to 
companies this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance marks the first time that Kaiser's HMOs have allowed all of its 
California members to seek medical help from non-Kaiser doctors. A pilot 
program in Bakersfield has existed since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture with Pacific Mutual is a response to increasing demands for 
greater health care choices for employees and simplified billing and 
administration for employers. It is also a precursor to President Clinton's 
health care reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Kaiser and Pacific Mutual face an increasing need for providing 
choices," said Michael Berumen, senior vice president for marketing at Pacific 
Mutual's group health and life insurance subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both are very mindful of the need to offer a full range of managed care, 
and Kaiser is sort of the paradigm of managed care," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the alliance is perhaps the biggest venture of its type, so-called 
point-of-service plans have been proliferating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kaiser had no choice if they wanted to catch up with the rest of the 
marketplace," said Bert B. Wagener, president of CIGNA Health Care of 
California, which has had a similar program operating since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net in Woodland Hills, an HMO that Pacific Mutual tried to buy a few 
years ago, has been offering a similar plan for about two years. "It's proven 
to be a tremendous success for us," said Don Prial, a Health Net spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Kaiser of Southern California is taking the bigger step. It 
will join with Pacific Mutual in offering a true point-of-service option. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, HMO members can opt to see a doctor of their choice for any 
illness or treatment and be covered by a Pacific Mutual indemnity plan. The 
Pacific Mutual plan would be a typical group health plan covering most medical 
needs, Berumen said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kaiser, the point-of-service plan will help to ease the fears some have 
about HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've discovered that it's a good opportunity to give enrollees a way to test 
a managed-care system," said Allan Mann, a spokesman for Kaiser of Southern 
California. "Employees feel more comfortable with prepaid medicine if they know 
they can opt for fee-for-service." 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance also will give Kaiser the ability to cover companies that have 
some of their employees working and living outside the HMO's service areas. 
And, since each company has its own working relationship with the Delta Dental 
HMO, each can offer dental coverage as well, Berumen said.

OVERHAUL OF WELFARE WILL DRIVE UP COSTS, OFFICIALS SAY; REFORM: PRESIDENT'S 
PLAN COULD COST $5 BILLION TO $7 BILLION A YEAR. WHITE HOUSE IS LOOKING FOR 
WAYS TO HOLD DOWN PRICE TAG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Some of the warmest applause during President Clinton's State of the Union 
Address came when he pledged to make welfare reform a top priority in 1994, 
launching a process designed to transform public assistance into a "second 
chance, not a way of life." 
</P>
<P>
 But the initial enthusiasm may wane when the repair estimates come in: 
Clinton's reform plan is expected to cost $5 billion to $7 billion a year by 
the time it is fully phased in, senior Administration officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton learned on the campaign trail, proposals to get the poor off the 
dole are always popular with middle-class taxpayers. Yet as momentum builds for 
welfare reform, one of Washington's dirty little secrets will soon become 
apparent -- the current system may not work well, but it's relatively cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives and other critics of the existing system who view welfare reform 
as a way to reduce federal spending on the poor may be in for a rude awakening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paradox is that ending welfare as we know it will cost much more than the 
existing system," said one senior congressional budget expert who asked not to 
be named. "I think there is an increasing realization in Congress and in the 
public at large that it is cheaper to give people money and send them on their 
way than it is to give them money, give them a GED (high school equivalency 
degree), give them child care and give them job training." 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of reform have proved to be the critical stumbling block for the 
Administration's welfare reform task force, which is charged with finding a 
cost-effective way to wean recipients off welfare after two years. It is 
scheduled to unveil its plan as early as March. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House must find offsetting spending cuts to pay for the program. 
Faced with those pressures, the task force has been scrambling to find ways to 
scale back its proposals, target them more carefully or phase them in more 
slowly in order to keep the expenses down. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials stressed that they believe they can fund the program 
at between $5 billion and $7 billion a year, which would keep the initiative 
close to the original estimates that Clinton used for his welfare proposal 
during the 1992 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are further along on coming to grips with the cost problem than most 
people realize," said one Administration official. But to pay for it, the 
official added, the Administration will be forced to propose politically 
controversial spending cuts in other entitlement programs, such as food stamps, 
Medicare or Medicaid, a move that is certain to spark an intense battle on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet almost any major reform effort the Administration unveils would cost much 
more than the current system. 
</P>
<P>
 The government would subsidize jobs for people who get off welfare, and 
provide "workfare" programs to create public works jobs to pay for continued 
income assistance for those who cannot find work on their own after two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Day care would be provided for single mothers, while training, educational 
opportunities and job placement programs would be expanded to help others get 
off welfare before the two-year limit runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of those benefits carry high price tags. The Congressional Budget Office 
estimates that providing day care for the children of welfare recipients would 
add $3,000 to the cost of keeping a family on welfare, while administering 
public workfare jobs would add another $3,300 per job. 
</P>
<P>
 Those costs would come on top of the continued welfare support of $5,100 per 
family under Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the basic existing 
welfare program. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Administration officials acknowledge, moving a single mother from 
welfare to workfare could more than double the government's costs. And that 
doesn't count food stamps and public housing. Roughly 2.5 million families who 
are currently on welfare have been receiving benefits for more than two years, 
a figure that shows the enormous potential costs of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts now say that the White House, in order to hold down costs, may impose 
the two-year time limit only on new welfare recipients or teen-agers. Such a 
restricted reform might be paid for by limiting benefits for non-citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Administration is certain to emphasize relatively inexpensive reforms, 
such as job placement services and tougher enforcement efforts against fathers 
who don't pay child support, which theoretically would help motivate welfare 
recipients and infuse them with a greater sense of personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even those moves won't make reform as cheap as the current system. In 
fact, benefits under the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program have 
fallen 30% to 40% over the last 20 years because they have not kept up with 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular belief, welfare, with a total annual price tag of $24 
billion out of a government budget of $1.3 trillion, is not to blame for the 
bloated federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that reform is going to be more expensive than what we 
have now," said Judy Gueron, president of Manpower Demonstration Research 
Corp., a New York firm involved in welfare reform research. "So that leaves us 
with the challenge of finding ways of getting as many people off welfare before 
the two-year time limit runs out."

LABOR DEPT. PLANS FOR 'RE-EMPLOYMENT'; ECONOMY: NEW JOB INSURANCE SYSTEM WOULD 
PUT EMPHASIS ON COUNSELING, TRAINING AND PLACEMENT. CRITICS SAY IT WILL COST 
TOO MUCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after President Clinton called on Congress to pass a radically different 
job insurance system, Labor Department officials sketched out plans Wednesday 
for a nationwide "re-employment" network that would offer unemployment 
compensation, career counseling and job training and placement. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, which the Administration hopes to introduce in Congress next 
month, would combine the patchwork of federal, state and local job training and 
placement programs into a single system to provide uniform services and 
information to jobless workers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, contained in the Workforce Security Act, is one piece of a broad 
Administration policy that would change government's relationship with 
Americans' livelihoods and the nation's workplace. It has broader appeal than 
some other elements of the strategy because it would serve people in a wide 
range of economic groups -- from laid off high-tech workers to unskilled 
laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are creating a system that links people to jobs and to the information and 
resources they need to get their next job," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich explained that the re-employment program would be phased in. If it is 
successful, he said, "within five or six years America will have a one-stop 
shopping" employment system. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Administration will seek "substantial increases" in next year's 
budget over the $1.4 billion already being spent on various displaced worker 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 When fully funded, the re-employment network is expected to cost $3 billion, 
Reich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich contends that the Administration's plan will save money by reducing the 
need for long-term unemployment. He noted that the government spent $14 billion 
last year alone in compensation to laid-off workers who had used more than the 
standard 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But many labor experts have suggested that the plan will be more expensive 
than envisioned because of the high cost of long-term training and the vast 
numbers of people who will use the services. Politicians and economists also 
have voiced doubt that there will be jobs available for people once their 
training is done. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration contends that current unemployment programs do too little 
for people who are permanently laid off. Designed in the 1930s, it was 
effective when a large percentage of laid-off workers eventually were rehired. 
But as companies have downsized in recent years, three-quarters of laid-off 
workers do not get their jobs back. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the vast majority of unemployed workers receiving compensation 
had no services to help them prepare for and secure new jobs. But under 
extended unemployment compensation legislation enacted in November, all states 
are required to determine which workers have been permanently laid off and to 
provide job search assistance for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying we need a new public service -- a new product," a 
high-ranking Labor Department official said. "The old product is fine, but it's 
obsolete." 
</P>
<P>
 At any time, 2.2 million people in the country have been laid off permanently, 
according to Labor Department estimates. Of those, 1.3 million will need help 
finding new jobs, while between 200,000 and 400,000 of them will need training. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term training programs have had dismal records for helping people get 
good jobs, so the new system would offer longer training programs and income 
support of up to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year of training after high school yields a return in terms of higher 
earning of 6% to 12%," Reich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term training does not come cheap, but the Clinton Administration argues 
that there is no other choice if America is to stay competitive in the world 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will include several financial incentives for getting people into 
the work force sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients of unemployment compensation will be eligible for cash bonuses for 
finding jobs before their benefits expire. Partial benefits will be available 
for people who take part-time jobs.

PENTAGON MAY BE BUDGET BATTLE CASUALTY; DEFENSE: CLINTON OPPOSES MORE CUTS, BUT 
ANALYSTS EXPECT TO SEE EFFORTS IN CONGRESS TO SHIFT FUNDS FROM THE MILITARY TO 
HELP DOMESTIC PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite President Clinton's vow to hold firm against further defense cuts, the 
Pentagon is facing the possibility of protracted battles in Congress this year 
with lawmakers seeking to rechannel some of its money to domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the fiscal 1995 budget Clinton will send to Congress early next 
month will provide $264 billion in new spending authority for military 
programs, up about $3 billion from fiscal 1994, which ends Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure represents something of a victory for departing Defense Secretary 
Les Aspin, who had fought to prevent the White House from slashing more. The 
small increase over the fiscal 1994 level is meant to finance a military pay 
raise mandated by Congress last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts say that, in the face of growing voter demand to pare the federal 
budget deficit further, they expect to see increased efforts on Capitol Hill to 
transfer money from Pentagon accounts to help ward off cuts in key domestic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the increased pressure is that under new budgetary procedures 
Congress has imposed a series of spending caps on discretionary spending 
programs -- those not formally mandated by law -- thus forcing lawmakers to 
fight even harder over the remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the House and Senate removed longstanding budgetary restrictions -- 
called fire walls -- that had protected defense spending from such forays, 
opening the way for lawmakers to divert money from the military whenever they 
can get the votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Also facing defense planners is the question of how quickly the White House 
will move to obtain extra financing for peacekeeping operations in Somalia and 
Iraq so that the Pentagon does not have to use its operating funds, which could 
further erode military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional strategists say that it is too early to tell precisely which 
groups of lawmakers will challenge Clinton's defense spending plan, but they 
are almost certain that such efforts will be made. 
</P>
<P>
 The President decided to hold the line on military spending cuts after critics 
-- including many conservatives in Congress -- warned that further reductions 
could erode military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has served 
notice that his panel will oppose any effort to cut defense spending more 
rapidly than Clinton now plans, and other conservatives in Congress have 
rallied to support him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also is facing a growing prospect that over the medium-term 
it simply will not have enough money, even under current plans, to support a 
military big enough to win two major regional conflicts at once, as Clinton's 
new policy requires. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Administration formally denies any such gap, some private 
analysts have projected that the shortfall could total as much as $120 billion 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 If those estimates prove to be accurate, Clinton could find himself having to 
scramble to find the money to maintain the force size that the Pentagon has 
prescribed. 
</P>

 The President told Congress in his State of the Union Address on Tuesday that 
he "said no" to those who wanted him to cut defense spending further this year, 
for fear that too deep a reduction might hurt the nation's military 
preparedness. 
</P>

 "The budget I (will) send to this Congress draws the line against further 
defense cuts and fully protects the readiness and quality of our forces," he 
said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; TEMPORARY FREEWAY BRIDGES RULED OUT; 
EARTHQUAKE: CALTRANS WILL CONCENTRATE ON BUILDING PERMANENT STRUCTURES. I-10 
COULD BE COMPLETED IN SIX MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Caltrans officials on Wednesday decided against quick-fix bridges that might 
have eased traffic congestion temporarily and will concentrate instead on 
full-fledged reconstruction, which they say will hasten the return of normal 
conditions on the Santa Monica and Simi Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Full reconstruction of the earthquake-damaged Santa Monica Freeway could be 
completed in less than six months, Caltrans District Director Jerry Baxter said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to push for six months because we think it can be done," Baxter 
said. "If I was looking at one year to replace the bridges, I would look hard 
at a temporary bridge. But if we can replace this in six months, a temporary 
bridge doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said his office had considered erecting temporary bridges over one side 
of the shattered portions of the Santa Monica Freeway in the Wilshire District 
and the Simi Valley Freeway in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Santa Monica Freeway, temporary bridges on one side of the freeway 
would have been used for traffic in both directions while the other side of the 
freeway was being rebuilt. Once that reconstruction was complete, the new lanes 
would have been used for traffic while the side with the temporary bridges was 
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Although temporary bridges would have handled many of the thousands of cars 
now detoured along city streets, they would have prevented the simultaneous 
reconstruction of the eastbound and westbound lanes -- thus prolonging the 
entire project by at least three months, Baxter said. On the Simi Valley 
Freeway in Granada Hills, where Caltrans originally had planned to spend time 
and money on another temporary bridge, the agency instead will shore up a 
two-foot sag in the westbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can shore up that bridge deck in three or four days," Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a month, the shored-up lanes will be ready to serve as an interim 
bridge, carrying traffic in both directions until reconstruction is completed 
on the eastbound lanes, Baxter said. The eastbound lanes will then carry 
traffic in both directions until the westbound lanes are rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said reconstruction of the downed bridge on the Golden State Freeway in 
Gavin Canyon near Newhall will begin immediately, and it is hoped that a 
permanent replacement can be completed within six months. Meantime, he said, 
work is largely completed on a detour road around the Gavin Canyon bridge. 
Caltrans expects to open the detour by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on the overall freeway system was down to about 75% of normal, 
apparently because people are using alternate routes. But traffic still crawled 
through the rush hours, and there were other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Accidents in the detour areas claimed the life of a truck driver near Santa 
Clarita and hospitalized a woman whose speeding car hurtled off a ruptured 
segment of the Santa Monica Freeway and plunged into a ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol said the unidentified truck driver died about 11 
a.m. Wednesday when his truck overturned on the transition road from Placerita 
Canyon road to Sierra Highway, one of the detours around the shattered junction 
of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers said the woman, Marciela Gutierrez, 30, of Los Angeles, 
apparently did not realize that several bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway had 
crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 "She mistakenly thought the temporary opening used by freeway construction 
crews were available to all motorists to enter the freeway at Venice 
Boulevard," CHP Officer Rhett Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the woman got on the eastbound lanes of the freeway about 2:20 a.m. 
and accelerated rapidly, reaching a speed of about 60 m.p.h. before her small 
sedan vaulted into space, plunged 40 feet and overturned in a 10-foot-ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said Gutierrez, who suffered a broken thigh, ankle and wrist in the 
crash, was trapped in the wreckage until shortly before 5 a.m., when a passing 
CHP unit spotted her car. She was later listed in stable condition at Kaiser 
Foundation Hospital in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hidalgo, a public information officer for Metrolink, said the rail line 
between Santa Clarita and downtown Los Angeles, which was carrying 950 
passengers a day before the quake, is now carrying about 22,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the system's capacity will be expanded soon with the acquisition of 
additional passenger cars. Eight are being leased from the Caltrans system in 
San Francisco, and the commuter rail system in Toronto, Canada, has been asked 
for 25 more. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated $1.9 billion in federal assistance is needed over the next year 
to pay for freeway reconstruction and additional transit services, Linda 
Bohlinger, Metropolitan Transit Authority financial coordinator, told the MTA 
board of directors on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question is when do the feds declare the emergency over," she said. 
"What happened in the Bay Area (after the Loma Prieta quake) is that emergency 
was tied only to the Bay Bridge. That was up and operating in two months, and 
their funding was cut off. So we have concerns that we really need to be on top 
of it. We need detailed documentation." 
</P>
<P>
 She said two state revenue options are available: One is quarter-cent sales 
tax, which would generate about $700 million statewide; the other is a gasoline 
surtax. "We feel there should be a state sales tax and not a gas tax," 
Bohlinger said. "Although gas tax money could help for freeway repair, it could 
not be used for buses or road repair." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Van Nuys, Small Business Administration officials handed out the 
first $2.5 million in disaster relief loans to 77 families whose homes were 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The first check went to Eli Landaverde of Arleta, a 24-year-old stock clerk 
who picked up the initial $10,000 installment of his $25,700 loan at the Mid 
San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although complaints that the government has been slow to respond were 
widespread, the people who picked up their loan checks Wednesday praised SBA 
officials for working quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, SBA officials had sent out 86,000 disaster relief loan 
applications to families and merchants whose homes or businesses were damaged 
in the quake. Of that number, roughly 2,200 had been returned and will be 
processed over the next seven days, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA spokesman Tom MacKenzie said about 70% of loan applications are approved 
and about 90% of loan recipients qualify for a low interest rate of 3.625%. 
</P>
<P>
 Loan amounts are capped at $200,000 for home improvements and $40,000 to 
replace possessions. Merchants whose businesses were affected can also apply 
for loans of up to $1.5 million. City officials said they had inspected 21,131 
structures and found 16,162 dwellings unfit for habitation.

14, the Friday preceding the quake, to 31,276 on Tuesday. Commuters affected by

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; WORK TO REPAIR FREEWAYS IS 24-HOUR BUSINESS; 
RECOVERY: MORE THAN 1,500 WORKERS ARE ON DUTY AT 500 SITES TO PATCH CRIPPLED 
HIGHWAY SYSTEM.

 Standing on the southbound Golden State Freeway and staring at a 2,000-foot 
gap in what once was a connector bridge from the Antelope Valley Freeway, 
engineer Henry Amigable drew an arm along his brow and gestured at the 
well-orchestrated bustle of his company's heavy machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 A worker in a crane used giant shears to rip away dripping, spaghetti-like 
reinforcement bar hanging off the end of the broken bridge. Crews on the ground 
used hydro-hammers to smash fallen concrete slabs into small rocks. Bulldozer 
operators dodged around the de facto obstacle course, loading the wreckage of 
the connector ramp so that trucks could haul it away. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the remains," said Amigable, of Granite Construction Co., a Caltrans 
subcontractor. "And we're the ones who deal with the remains." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, Amigable and others who deal with such road remains 
struggled to do just that. Some left the wreckage of their own homes to report 
to their jobs; most worked bone-wearying hours, through tremor after tremor on 
unstable and crumbling ground, to begin to put the transit system back together 
again like so many pieces of a giant, fractured maze. 
</P>
<P>
 And all around the construction sites was a reminder of the importance of 
their duties: the excruciatingly long lines of rerouted cars visible to the 
workers as they went about their task. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the day the quake crumbled crucial arteries of the city's freeways, more 
than 1,500 workers have fanned out to 500 sites in the city's interstates and 
highways, from the Westside to the West Valley to the Newhall Pass. Their 
mission is to inspect, to rip down and to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first week after the quake, Caltrans and its subcontractors awarded 17 
repair and demolition contracts and identified 12 unsafe bridges, said Caltrans 
spokesman Rick Holland. Seven of those bridges will be shored up and 
restabilized; five are not salvageable and will be ripped down and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The race to restore a sane commute began just after dawn on Jan. 17, with 
crews cleaning and clearing. 
</P>
<P>
 On a fractured one-mile section of the Santa Monica Freeway, demolition crews 
have rapidly torn down and removed more than 70 million pounds of reinforced 
concrete and debris from two collapsed freeway bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't stopped since we started," said Roy Fisher, a Caltrans senior 
bridge engineer and the person responsible for demolition on the Santa Monica 
Freeway. "We've probably done a month's work in a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Nighttime rain and cooler temperatures gave no reprieve. When darkness fell 
and commuter cars lined up for miles along the freeway's flank, the 12-person 
night crew moved in and pushed on with the task of knocking down the fractured 
Venice Boulevard bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Two crane operators worked side-by-side, hammering away at the broken bridge. 
Several bulldozers scooped up the fallen blocks of concrete and loaded it onto 
dump trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got soaked, but we worked right through it," said Tony May, 45, who has 
spent the days since the quake loading trucks and digging pits for new freeway 
columns. "It doesn't bother us; work is work. When it rains, it just means you 
get wet." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Fisher, 32, has seen very little of his wife or 17-month-old baby in 
Gardena since the quake. Shifts have been a minimum of 15 hours long. There 
have not been any days off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sleep and dream about this stuff all night and all day," Fisher said. "This 
is my focus, 100%. We won't stop until the job is done." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 a.m., a new 30-person crew arrived and quickly huddled with Fisher to map 
out the day's strategy. Their plan was to work through the night to clear 
Venice Boulevard of debris from the fallen bridge and then reopen it to 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 And they were successful. Fisher and his team were able to clear out the 
broken bridge early Wednesday and expect to reopen Venice Boulevard today. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Los Angeles, on the Golden State Freeway, under the hulk of the broken 
Antelope Valley Freeway connector ramp, crews of 20 Granite Construction 
workers toiled day and night to clean away the broken bridge. After sundown, 
they worked under 10 light towers perched on the hillsides above. 
</P>
<P>
 The long hours paid off. Originally projected as a 10-day job, clearing 
instead was finished in four. The freeway break, smoothed over and cleaned of 
its dripping cables, now looks as if it was cleanly cut by a giant knife. 
</P>
<P>
 After the heavy equipment operators finished their heavy hauling and after the 
water truck drivers moved on to cool down another site, Granite called in the 
services of two final workers with four last pieces of equipment: Trace Boden, 
Oscar Ostos and their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do a lot with equipment," explained foreman Frank Eppler, on his 
third 12-hour-plus day. "But you can't do it all." 
</P>
<P>
 So Boden, 27, and Ostos, 30, worked their way down the quieted stretch of 
freeway. The pair bent over and scraped at the freeway floor with their hands, 
pulling up leftover bits of stone and twisted metal and tossing them into a 
heap. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are from Canyon Country. Both lost belongings and bits of their homes 
to the quake and both left the disarray in favor of work. They were 
matter-of-fact about their tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we're out here to do the dirty work," Boden said. "It's mostly heavy 
machinery, then it's us." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the city, six maintenance crews and six bridge crews from 
throughout the state have spent the past week and a half evaluating and 
repairing the shaky above-ground transit ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Perched precariously underneath a buckled and separated connector bridge 
between the Foothill and Golden State Freeways, bridge maintenance worker 
Robert Orozco worked his eighth-straight day of 16-hour shifts on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 His home in Sylmar also showed the force of the quake: cracks in every room, 
separated foundation, crushed treasures collected over the years. Orozco's 
confidence in his wife, who worked at home cleaning up and caring for their 
three children, enabled him to focus on his job despite his fatigue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orozco and four other men were charged with shoring up the bridge, which had 
separated and dropped by several inches at its connector joints. The men used 
timber lifters, as if they were old-fashioned ice block carriers, to together 
hoist up 400-pound, 12-by-12-foot wooden support beams. 
</P>
<P>
 Out at what used to be the Antelope Valley connector, Eppler, deeply tanned 
and with etched lines around his eyes from years as a Granite Construction 
foreman in the California sun, folded his burly arms across his blue shirt and 
orange safety vest. 
</P>
<P>
 He struggled to find the right words to explain a construction worker's 
attitude at times like these -- why he does what he does and how he finds the 
energy to do it is not something he normally thinks about, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a job to do: Clean up this road and get things back to normal for 
all of us," he finally said. "You work and you put your own personal problems 
behind you. Don't you?" The Transportation Tab

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FEMA MAKES ITS POINT IN SPANISH; ASSISTANCE: 
CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION STATUS ARE IRRELEVANT FOR VIRTUALLY ALL QUAKE 
RELIEF, THE FEDERAL AGENCY SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Monge wants to get a message out: Emergency quake assistance is available 
for all eligible residents who suffered losses in last week's temblor -- 
regardless of citizenship or immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to know that we have nothing to do with immigration, and we do 
speak Spanish," said Monge, who heads a Federal Emergency Management Agency 
center opened Saturday in the Pico-Union district, the heart of Los Angeles' 
huge Central American community. "The fact that someone is undocumented or 
isn't a citizen or doesn't have a Social Security number doesn't matter to us." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday afternoon, the FEMA center here -- in space borrowed from the 
Central American Resource Center -- has accepted applications for help from 
almost 800 people, almost all of them poor, Spanish-speaking renters, many 
illegal immigrants. Most are seeking assistance in relocating from apartments 
in this densely populated neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of damage here doesn't rival that in the San Fernando Valley, but 
the quake opened cracks in hundreds of residences, particularly those in older 
apartment buildings. Scores of people are still sleeping on the streets or in 
MacArthur Park, too frightened to return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 While there have been widespread calls in the past year to cut aid to illegal 
immigrants -- and U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, (R-Huntington Beach), has called 
for denying federal assistance to the undocumented -- emergency help from FEMA 
is still generally available to anyone who otherwise qualifies, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only exception, said Brett Hansard, a FEMA spokesman, is Disaster 
Unemployment Assistance, designed to offset loss of work. Only legal residents 
qualify for that benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 The application facility in Pico-Union is one of 13 FEMA mobile centers 
throughout the Los Angeles area, complementing the 16 fixed facilities in 
operation as of Wednesday. However, demand at the Pico-Union site has been so 
great, Monge said, that authorities plan to keep the office at 660 S. Bonnie 
Brae St. operating until at least Friday. The site is open from 9 a.m. until 10 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pico-Union office, like other facilities regionwide, is essentially an 
application center; no aid is dispensed on site. Inspectors are scheduled to 
visit claimants' residences within days to verify damage. Authorities then 
determine if applicants are eligible for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other emergency assistance programs, the government offers three months 
of free rent for those who qualify. That aid can be extended up to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Monge and nine other Spanish-speaking staffers were flown from Puerto Rico 
last week. Once Pico-Union is served, Monge said, he and his colleagues will 
likely be deployed to another area, possibly the Valley, where there also is a 
pressing need for Spanish speakers. His team is routinely deployed to disaster 
zones nationwide where many victims speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pico-Union, FEMA took care to reassure a community jittery about 
immigration enforcement efforts. For instance, Monge declined a police offer to 
post two officers outside the center full time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to scare people," said Monge. "We'd like people to feel like 
they were walking into a church." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those seeking aid said they were simply afraid to return to their 
apartments -- sometimes despite assurances from city inspectors that the 
residences are safe. Despite such findings by local inspectors, Monge said 
residents may still qualify for emergency relocation assistance if FEMA 
inspectors reach the opposite conclusion.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DAMAGE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some facts and figures on the aftermath of last week's magnitude 6.6 
earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * DEATHS: State estimate increased to 57 
</P>
<P>
 * INJURIES: More than 7,707 people have been treated and released at 
hospitals; about 1,495 were admitted for care. 
</P>
<P>
 * AFTERSHOCKS: Aftershocks with magnitudes of 3.8 and 3.6 rumbled through the 
San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys Wednesday. More than 2,500 aftershocks 
have been recorded since the Jan. 17 magnitude 6.6 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * DAMAGE: More than 21,777 buildings had been inspected. Officials have 
declared 5,222 buildings, including 14,884 dwelling units, at least partially 
unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARRESTS: One week after the quake, the Los Angeles Police Department has 
taken 405 people into custody. Most were general arrests and not for curfew 
violations or looting. On a typical day, there are about 530 arrests in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOMELESS: Almost 3,000 remained housed in Army tents at six San Fernando 
Valley parks as another storm approaches. Thirty-three tents have already been 
removed from Lanark Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * NATIONAL GUARD: Officials said some of the 1,199 National Guard troops 
mobilized to help in disaster-relief efforts will begin moving out of the city, 
but some of them will be replaced by Guard troops from other areas. More than 
40 Guard troops are helping clean and repair schools; 63 other bilingual Guard 
troops are acting as translators. 
</P>
<P>
 * UTILITIES: Electricity has been restored to all but a handful of customers. 
Directives to boil water remained in effect for the Santa Monica Mountains, 
Pacific Palisades and the West Valley. At least 120,000 customers have had gas 
service restored since the quake, but several thousand more remained without 
gas because service personnel could not gain entry into homes or businesses. 
Customers are urged to have someone at home or leave keys with neighbors and 
call the gas company at (800)427-2200. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRANSIT: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority set up a line called the 
Westside Special to help commuters cope with the shutdown of the Santa Monica 
Freeway (I-10). A commuter hot line, (800) 286-RIDE, has been set up to provide 
information on car pools, road closures and other information. 
</P>
<P>
 * HELP: The 17th disaster application center will open today at the David 
Gonzales Recreation Center, 10943 Herrick Ave., Pacoima. People affected by the 
Northridge earthquake can apply for a variety of federal, state and local 
assistance programs. Hours of operation on opening day will be 1 p.m. to 10 
p.m. Thereafter, hours will be from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The husband of Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame) has died of injuries 
he suffered in an automobile accident, her office announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Steven K. Sierra, 52, who married Speier in 1987, died late Tuesday night 
after a crash several hours earlier in which he was broadsided by a driver who 
apparently ran a red light at a San Mateo intersection.Speier, 43, has 
represented part of San Francisco and San Mateo counties for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra earned his medical degree with honors from UC San Francisco in 1973 and 
was an emergency room doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the other car was identified by authorities as Thomas Rivera 
III, 24, of Burlingame. He suffered minor injuries. No citation was issued, but 
an investigation into the accident was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Speier recently dropped out of the secretary of state's race because she is 
pregnant with the couple's second child.

ASSEMBLYWOMAN MOORE TO RUN FOR SECRETARY OF STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) announced Wednesday that she will run 
for secretary of state next year to replace March Fong Eu, who has been 
nominated as President Clinton's ambassador to Micronesia. 
</P>
<P>
 First elected to the Assembly in 1978, Moore is chairwoman of the Utilities 
and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the third Democrat to enter the race. Los Angeles City Councilman Mike 
Woo and Eu's top deputy, Tony Miller, have announced their candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side, former Assembly GOP leader Bill Jones of Fresno is 
running for the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said Tuesday that Moore, 53, had failed to file required preliminary 
candidacy documents with the secretary of state's office and asked the Fair 
Political Practices Commission to investigate. Moore called the charge 
ridiculous and groundless and said she had filed the necessary papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore is the author of a 1992 family leave law that allows employees of 
businesses with 50 or more workers to take up to four months unpaid leave to 
care for newborn or sick children or sick parents or spouses without fear of 
losing their jobs.

PARKS FINALLY BECOMING A FRONT MAN; BASKETBALL: AFTER TWO HO-HUM SEASONS AT 
DUKE, FORMER MARINA STAR IS NOW A DRIVING FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his freshman year at Duke, Cherokee Parks admits he was "along for the 
ride," a wide-eyed youngster who took a back seat while Christian Laettner, 
Blue Devil patriarch, drove Duke to the NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks moved up to the passenger seat as a sophomore, but with Bobby Hurley at 
the controls and Grant Hill and Thomas Hill navigating, Parks could pretty much 
roll down the window and enjoy the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Parks is a junior, and while the 6-foot-11 center is not in the driver's 
seat -- that role clearly belongs to super swingman Grant Hill -- there are 
days when Coach Mike Krzyzewski hands Parks the keys and lets him take the Blue 
Devils for a joy ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Like last Saturday, when Parks had 23 points and 10 rebounds in a 106-79 
victory over Florida State. Or Jan. 15, when Parks had 19 points and 14 
rebounds to lead a 66-58 win over Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Jan. 10, when Parks scored 25 points and had 14 rebounds in an 
89-71 victory over Brown, and Dec. 11, when Parks had 23 points and nine 
rebounds in a 73-63 win at Michigan, and Dec. 4, when Parks had 20 rebounds in 
an 82-60 victory over Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
 Get the picture? 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, the former Marina High standout, has gone from a bit player as a 
freshman to Duke's best-supporting actor -- and sometimes leading man -- as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 An almost timid freshman, Parks spent his first college season as Laettner's 
practice punching bag and averaged five points, 2.4 rebounds and 12 minutes. He 
is now the dominating, All-American candidate that most expected when he was 
tabbed "the next Bill Walton" coming out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday's 74-72 victory over Notre Dame, Parks is averaging 15.7 
points, just shy of Hill's team-leading 16.9. He leads the team in rebounds 
(9.5), field-goal percentage (61.5) and blocked shots (24). 
</P>
<P>
 Parks has had only one sub-par game this season, a five-point, seven-rebound 
effort in a 69-68 loss to Wake Forest Jan. 13, but he's one of the primary 
reasons Duke is 14-1 and ranked second in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My role has increased each year, but it seems like there has always been two 
or three go-to guys, so there's not that much pressure," Parks said by 
telephone from Durham, N.C. "Antonio (Lang) will have a great game one night, 
Grant Hill the next, then maybe me. Still, it's nice that I'm doing a little 
more now, getting some more recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 Not if you're an opposing Atlantic Coast Conference coach. Florida State's Pat 
Kennedy saw Parks dissect his front line last weekend and came away with a new 
appreciation for the center known as "Chief." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very impressed with Cherokee's development," Kennedy said. "Being 
able to go away from the basket and help them, I feel that's an added dimension 
for that team." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks has added a mid-range jumper to his repertoire, but the main reason for 
his emergence has been his continued development in the post. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a few more inside moves, he has gained strength, and a summer tour 
through Argentina and Spain with the U.S. Under-22 World Championships team 
helped put him in the proper frame of mind for this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good chance to play against quality players, and the game abroad is 
very aggressive," Parks said. "That whole experience helped me out. I've been 
trying to be more aggressive from block to block. If you're aggressive on 
defense, it all translates to offense." 
</P>
<P>
 When you regularly butt heads with the likes of 7-foot North Carolina center 
Eric Montross, there's no room for timidity. Parks and Montross will renew 
their rivalry next Thursday in Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole Duke-North Carolina thing gets pretty wild here," Parks said. 
"Last year, our school papers were lashing out at each other weeks before the 
game. On the front page of ours, there was this huge, white block of nothing, 
and the caption read, 'This empty white space is here to remind you of Eric 
Montross.' 
</P>
<P>
 "They said something about my hair, that it was too long or bushy, that I 
needed a haircut. I can live with that. It's unbelievable how up the students 
get for this game, and I've never seen anything as intense as the rivalries 
between schools here." 
</P>
<P>
 Some thought Parks wouldn't be able to handle that ACC atmosphere and 
pressure. They thought his laid-back, California attitude -- Parks once said 
his idea of a perfect day would be to sleep past noon and spend the rest of the 
day at the beach -- would shape his on-court persona. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parks has dispelled that myth with his aggressive play. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I heard when I got here was that I'm from California, I'm real laid back 
and I don't try hard," Parks said. "It's not like that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Parks heard a lot more that freshman year. As if the transition from 
the Sunset League to America's best college conference, from Beach Boulevard to 
Tobacco Road, wasn't tough enough, Parks had to do it with Laettner screaming 
in one ear and sticking his elbow in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Laettner, the former Duke All-American and All-Obnoxious Team selection, 
decided to take Parks under his wing, but this wasn't your typical 
veteran-tutors-rookie relationship. It was more of a military academy plebe 
assault, complete with hazing of the physical and verbal variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always coming down on my game," Parks said in 1992. "I'd have a good 
game and he'd tell me, 'Oh, you just got lucky,' or 'Yeah, but their best 
player fouled out,' or 'You're lucky I got in foul trouble and you got some 
minutes.' . . . He tells you exactly what he thinks, and a lot of it's 
negative." 
</P>
<P>
 What was this, Duke or The Citadel? Parks wondered at times, but looking back 
on that freshman year, he realized Laettner was just trying to make him a 
better, tougher player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was on me hard, but he was like that with everyone -- that's just his 
personality," Parks said. "He beat me a lot in practice and rubbed it in, but 
it eventually wore off." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Parks almost a whole year to fully escape Laettner's shadow. Parks had 
a solid sophomore season -- a 12.3-point, 6.9-rebound average, a .652 shooting 
percentage, third best in the nation, and 65 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But an eye injury sidelined him for eight weeks in the fall, slowing his early 
season progress, and he didn't come on until midway through the conference 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks injured his ankle in the first half of Duke's NCAA second-round game 
against California and didn't play in the second half of the Blue Devils' loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of games early on where I didn't show up, and people 
expected more," Parks said. "Christian had a great sophomore season, and they 
were expecting the same from me." 
</P>
<P>
 That was not fair to Parks. Laettner was an all-around talent who was as 
effective shooting three-pointers as he was in the post. Parks is more of a 
traditional center who rarely wanders beyond the key, yet Duke fans expected 
him to do the same things Laettner did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, people said I needed to do this and that, but I haven't heard that 
this year," Parks said. "I've established myself down low. Christian did more 
on the perimeter, but I'm more of a center than he was." 
</P>
<P>
 And less. Parks may not possess all of Laettner's skills, but, lucky for 
Duke's two 6-10 freshmen, Joey Beard and Greg Newton, Parks doesn't come with 
Laettner's sound track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not nearly as hard on them as Christian was on me," Parks said. "I'm 
non-confrontational, laid-back. I let them do their own thing. And I won't be 
hazing any freshmen next year. I may mess with them, but I won't come down on 
them that hard. Thank God they won't have to go through what I went through."

NOW HERE'S A STORY FOR MCSWEEN TO TELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Time slipped by and Don McSween wondered if it would ever happen, if he'd ever 
score an NHL goal, if he'd ever feel the way he did Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 So many things had to happen just right for McSween that it seemed so 
far-fetched. But he never stopped dreaming, never quit believing he'd have a 
great story to tell his son. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, he can say he absolutely flew around four defenders, heck, 
maybe it was five, and unloaded a rocket the goaltender never saw. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, it was a simple slap shot, and a deflected one at that. Winnipeg 
goaltender Bob Essensa couldn't handle the shot after it hit a Jet player and 
the puck settled in the back of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably would have put a hole in the back in the net (if it weren't 
deflected)," said McSween, after the Mighty Ducks' 3-1 victory over Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 He laughed. He knew there was no way that would have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the unlikely set of circumstances that brought McSween to Anaheim, 
there's no use quibbling over the beauty of his first NHL goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real stroke of good scouting for us to wake up and sign him," Duck 
General Manager Jack Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was kidding. The Ducks signed McSween, a former Buffalo Sabre defenseman, 
because three other defensemen were injured and a fourth was deemed not ready 
for the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Ladouceur and Sean Hill went down with injuries. In San Diego, the 
Ducks' minor-league affiliate, Anatoli Fedotov was hurting and Scott Chartier 
simply wasn't playing well enough, according to Ferreira. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they brought in McSween, hoping he could shore up things in the Duck 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the season started, I thought he was the kind of guy that if we really 
got into trouble could help us out," Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, seven games and one goal into his emergency service, McSween has 
earned his keep. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, sidelined for nine consecutive games with a shoulder injury, is expected 
back as soon as Friday's game against the New York Rangers. But McSween isn't 
going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a bomb to get him out of the lineup," Coach Ron Wilson 
said. "He's come through with flying colors. And it's only by accident that 
he's here." 
</P>
<P>
 McSween, who played only nine NHL games with Buffalo before this season and 
none since 1989-90, got a second chance and hasn't disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring comes as a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 The way it happened, after a face-off in Winnipeg's zone late in the first 
period, wasn't memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 But it came against his old college buddy, Essensa, and that made it mean so 
much more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were roommates (at Michigan State)," McSween said. "He stood up at my 
wedding and I stood up at his wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got in a little shoving match later and I asked him if he'd sign the puck 
after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I'll never forget."

 The system eliminates the need for office space or a receptionist, creator 
Steve Fox said. The association is the first customer for Fox's Irvine-based

DISNEYLAND PLANS A CREEPY, CRAWLY ATTRACTION; AMUSEMENT: THE INDIANA JONES 
ADVENTURE TO BE OPENED NEXT YEAR WILL BE FILLED WITH FAKE VERMIN AND FEATURE 
CLIFFHANGER TECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co. on Wednesday unveiled details of a new Disneyland ride 
that it promises will be its creepiest yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indiana Jones Adventure, being constructed between the main parking lot 
and Adventureland at a cost of more than $50 million, will feature a temple 
intentionally filled with fake bats, spiders, snakes and rats. 
</P>
<P>
 When it opens next year, Disney officials said, the attraction will feature 
technology designed to give visitors a different experience every time they 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you ride this ride, you will not be able to figure it out," promised 
Tony Baxter, senior vice president of Walt Disney Imagineering, the company's 
Glendale-based design arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction was previewed Wednesday as part of a day of park festivities 
centered on the official opening of Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin, scheduled to 
be the last major ride to open at the park before Indiana Jones Adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Disneyland will have to manage without a major new attraction 
opening this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 It will need to hold its own against a new Batman-themed roller coaster at Six 
Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, a Mystery Lodge special-effects show at 
Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park and a yet-to-be-named, deep-sea submarine 
simulation ride at Sea World in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 While not offering a new summer ride, Disneyland is expected to revamp its 
Main Street parade to promote the new animated "Lion King" movie due out in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, though, Disneyland will focus on the Indiana Jones Adventure, the 
park's most ambitious effort since the Mickey's Toontown children's themed area 
opened last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride is based roughly on Steven Spielberg's trilogy of matinee-style 
cliffhangers that starred Harrison Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors will find the ride behind the Jungle Cruise. After winding their way 
through a supposed archeological dig, they will board decrepit jeeps that take 
them through one of three doors. Each door offers a different experience, each 
with its own set of up-close-and-personal encounters with various types of 
vermin, engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will feel like they are in the vehicle with you," said Imagineering Show 
Director Skip Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 After Indiana Jones, Disneyland will turn its attention to refurbishing the 
Tomorrowland portion of the park, which has not received a new attraction in 
the past few years, said Judson Green, president of Disney's theme park 
division.

MANUFACTURERS' CONFIDENCE INDEX JUMPS SIGNIFICANTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The spurt of optimism that boosted home and retail sales in the final three 
months of 1993 appears to have grabbed Orange County manufacturers as well, 
according to a quarterly survey of industry purchasing agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-year-old Orange County purchasing managers confidence index jumped more 
than 12 points in the fourth quarter to its highest level since the third 
quarter of 1988, said Chapman University economist Raymond Sfeir, who conducts 
the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The confidence level of 62 represents a significant rise from 50.5 in the 1993 
third quarter, Sfeir said. Levels above 50 track manufacturing industry growth 
while levels below 50 indicate shrinkage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sfeir said that last week's Northridge earthquake should not shake the 
purchasing managers' newfound economic confidence and result in a tumbling 
index when the 1994 first-quarter results are collected in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no major damage to manufacturing plants in the county," he said, 
"and most of our manufacturers' markets are national and international, so the 
earthquake shouldn't disrupt their sales." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of purchasing managers at 60 Orange County manufacturing companies 
found that while they see their industries as recovering from the recession 
that began in 1990, the improvements won't be enough to spur any hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman's Center for Economic Research predicted in December that 
manufacturing employment in the county would drop by about 2,000 jobs this 
year, to about 140,000, and Sfeir said he sees no reason to change that 
forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 The confidence index is based on reported changes in levels of production, 
speed of deliveries by vendors, purchases of raw materials and inventories of 
raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fourth-quarter result came from reports of major increases in raw 
materials purchases -- which means the factories plan to step up production of 
finished goods in response to improving market demand, Sfeir said. The survey 
also found significant increases in factory production. 
</P>
<P>
 Sfeir said that because the survey is a snapshot that only measures changes 
from quarter to quarter, the big boost in the 1993 fourth-quarter confidence 
level doesn't mean things have returned to pre-recession levels -- just that 
things are improving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big increase from a rather small base," he said, "so it means things 
are better than when they were really bad, not better than when they were 
good."

 Writing Their Congressmen: A Laguna Hills-based political consultant, Adler 
Wilson Campaign Services Inc., has designed a computer databank thats allowed 
more than 30,000 home builders to contact their congressional representatives 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The databank was used by the the National Assn. of Home Builders during its 
annual meeting in Las Vegas. Attendees were able to enter their home addresses, 
find the names of their representatives, and create letters on a personalized 
letterhead. 
</P>
<P>
 The wording of the seven letters varied, Jeff Adler said, but each made the 
point that association members would like to see regulations eased that prevent 
the cutting of trees. Lumber prices have increased 67% in the past five months 
because of limited supply, the letters said.

SANTA ANA PLANT TO CLOSE, MOVE JOBS TO OKLAHOMA 
</P>

 Bridge Products Inc. said it will close its Santa Ana manufacturing plant by 
this summer and transfer up to 35 jobs to an existing facility it owns in 
Muskogee, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridge's Camel Tire Products division decided more than a year ago to close 
the Santa Ana plant, which it leases.The company makes tire patches and other 
tire products. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to 17 to 20 hourly manufacturing and support jobs, about 10 to 15 
customer service and administration jobs now at the Santa Ana facility will be 
centralized in Muskogee, and positions in accounting, purchasing and marketing 
will be added, said Bruce Garringer, Camel's vice president and chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 California employees will have first chance at the Muskogee jobs, he said. The 
company said the plant closure was ordered to improve service, enhance Camel's 
competitiveness and cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muskogee site, which will become Bridge Products' Aftermarket Components 
Division, will absorb roughly half of the products formerly manufactured in 
Santa Ana. A company plant in Alta Vista, Va., will take over the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muskogee facility will become the main distribution center for Bridge, but 
Garringer said the Chicago-based company will retain a warehouse, distribution 
and sales facility somewhere in Southern California.

FED EX CHIEF EMBRACES TECHNOLOGY; SHIPPING: THE COMPANY BOASTS OF ITS 
COMPUTERIZED INFORMATION SERVICES MORE THAN ITS TRANSPORTATION MIGHT THESE 
DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN RAMSTAD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 21 years after starting Federal Express Corp., Frederick W. Smith 
thinks the computer has become as important as his first love, the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, absolutely, perhaps even more important," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company that invented airborne overnight shipping boasts of its 
computerized information services more than its transportation might these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is that for hundreds of businesses, the information Federal Express 
provides about shipment and distribution has tremendous value. It allows them 
to cut costly inventory and accelerate business processes, efficiencies that 
can boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 48, said he recognized such possibilities before he started the company 
but didn't realize the role technology would play reaching them. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really led us into it was the recognition that as we were substituting 
this new type of distribution system for physical inventories, it had to 
perform," Smith said. "We recognized we had to have a very sophisticated 
information and telecommunication capability to be able to set up a management 
system for all of these shipments." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Express computer system is now one of the busiest and most 
accessible in the business world. More than 20 million transactions are 
processed a day and 80,000 customers are plugged in. The location of each of 
the roughly 2 million packages and documents the company moves daily is 
recorded six times during shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Smith is still on top of the company is that he has kept up with 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Airlines had to go from pistons to turboprops to jets and so forth down the 
line," said Smith, who was a decorated Marine pilot in Vietnam and remains an 
aviation buff. 
</P>
<P>
 His office is filled with models of Clipper ships, reflecting his belief that 
the company's 467 jets are the "Clipper ships of the computer age." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's business contribution to the city of Memphis has elevated him to the 
status of an economic Elvis. The company is the biggest employer in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hundreds of employees in the Memphis corporate offices, Smith still helps 
sort packages on heavy nights during the holidays. He bases the annual bonus 
for himself and other top executives on an evaluation by the company's 100,000 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In them, Smith has instilled a commitment to customer service that many 
companies envy. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a young woman sorting documents, explaining her role in the 
shipping process to a visitor, said she felt badly for the two customers whose 
packages she had mishandled out of the 20,000 that went through her hands last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 A courier, asked by a customer if he knew someone who sent fresh flowers by 
Federal Express, responded that he'd seen boxes from Calyx & Corolla. In doing 
so, the courier helped establish a big new account for the San Francisco-based 
catalogue firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a CEO of a caliber of Fred Smith could communicate that kind of company 
spirit right down to every courier," said Ruth Owades, president of Calyx & 
Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith demurs such praise, turning it back on employees. 
</P>
<P>
 He marvels, for instance, at the work done by computer system designers. 
"You're talking about people who are worth a fortune," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith made his own tender computer skills the test for allowing the company's 
PowerShip 3 system to be sent to customers. PowerShip 3 is a desktop computer 
and printer for offices to order pickups, print labels and track shipments 
without an operator's assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were people all over the building saying, 'Has the old man put it 
together yet and turned it on?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, along with a predecessor PowerShip 2 for mailrooms and the 
recently advertised Tracking Software, represents a big effort to give more 
customers an electronic connection. All are offered free, because the company 
has discovered they generally lead a customer to increase shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 By summer, the company hopes to offer software that may be used throughout a 
customer's computer system, not just on individual machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The distribution acumen and information power of Federal Express has given 
birth to several companies like Calyx & Corolla, which relies on local growers 
to package and ship the flowers offered in its catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started the company and was trying to convince people they really 
wanted to invest in this, it was pretty crazy to say we're not going to have 
inventory, we're not going to have a warehouse," Owades said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of others have been able to streamline their supply and distribution 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the first time a personal computer by Gateway 2000 Inc. comes 
together is usually in a Federal Express truck en route to a customer. It saves 
money by shipping monitors from Los Angeles, where they've arrived from Japan, 
on the same day a computer is sent from its headquarters in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto manufacturers, clothing catalogue merchants and even makers of human 
joint replacements keep spare products in warehouses near Federal Express' 
chief hub at Memphis International Airport to handle late orders. 
</P>
<P>
 First Tennessee Bank has even set up a check-sorting operation just across the 
street from the Memphis hub, claiming to be faster than the Federal Reserve 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 While the value of such logistics has become embedded in the business 
landscape, it is little understood by the world at large. But that's OK with 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go to the grocery store, you're not really concerned about how the 
eggs got there. But the people who sell the eggs are damn concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, if you go and talk to people that are running these new types of 
logistics solutions to add value to their product or service, they understand. 
And the people who don't understand, they're going to die."

JUDGE REJECTS CLAIM THAT JURIES BAR ASIANS; COURTS: HE SAYS MOTION BY DEFENSE 
ATTORNEYS IN THE STUART TAY MURDER TRIAL AND OTHER HIGH-PROFILE CASES 'BORDERS 
ON BEING FRIVOLOUS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Wednesday rejected claims that Asians are systematically excluded 
from the Orange County Grand Jury and ruled that there is no legal requirement 
for "quotas" to ensure racial diversity on the volunteer panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys in the Stuart A. Tay murder trial and other high-profile 
criminal cases contend that the lack of Asians on the 1992-93 grand jury 
stripped their clients of a constitutional right to have an ethnically mixed 
jury decide their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a 17-page ruling released Wednesday afternoon, Judge Theodore E. 
Millard said the attorneys' motion "borders on being frivolous" and found there 
was insufficient evidence to support defense requests to dismiss indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 Millard's ruling also noted that there is no case law requiring jury "quotas." 
</P>
<P>
 "The process utilized by the court to empanel the grand jury is one of 
inclusion, not exclusion," Millard wrote. "Much time and effort is made to 
solicit applications from qualified minority, racial and ethnic individuals 
here in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and attorneys for the county praised the ruling. Defense attorneys 
said the decision made Asians "invisible" in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I'm disappointed," said defense attorney Marshall M. Schulman, who 
represents one of three Asian defendants accused in the Tay slaying. "According 
to this, Asians have become invisible." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more unusual aspects of the case involved deciding whether Asians 
represented a "cognizable" group, given the dozens of nationalities and 
cultures that are generally included in that category. 
</P>
<P>
 Millard ruled that Asian residents cannot be grouped together, especially 
since they do not all speak the same language. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent hearing on the motion, a defense expert testified that in 
1992, Asians made up 11.7% of Orange County's population. But only two Asians 
applied to the grand jury, and later they withdrew their applications from 
consideration for the panel that handed down the indictments at the center of 
the defense motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and county attorneys denied that there is any systematic exclusion 
of minorities and also contended that they were being taken to task for the 
public's lack of interest in what many agree is a thankless job. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand jurors serve for a full year for a maximum of $100 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased, this is what we have been saying all along," said Deputy 
County Counsel Edward N. Duran. 
</P>
<P>
 Millard said defense evidence documenting the lack of racial minorities is not 
evidence of a "constitutional defect" in the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Constitution does not yet require quotas or proportional representation 
of races, nationalities or any other identifiable segments on a jury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants who mounted the challenge include four teen-agers accused of 
killing Foothill High School honor student Stuart A. Tay on New Year's Eve, 
1992; Alicia Hanna, a Santa Ana clinic owner accused of murdering a woman 
during a botched, illegal abortion in January, 1993; and several defendants 
charged in a massive auto insurance scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 While the court's decision paves the way for the defendants to proceed to 
trial, some defense attorneys may consider asking an appellate court to review 
the ruling, Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury has come under increasing attack in the last 
year. Many in the minority community have complained about the panel's lack of 
minority representation in the wake of a grand jury report that linked illegal 
immigration to a wide array of society's ills. 
</P>
<P>
 The report prompted outrage and helped trigger an upcoming fact-finding 
hearing by a panel of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury recently answered criticism that it is out of touch with the 
county's ethnic minority population by suggesting ways to improve its 
diversity. Schulman pointed to the report Wednesday as evidence that his motion 
was not frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would (the grand jury) say that if it wasn't significant?" Schulman said.

$5-MILLION LIBRARY WINDFALL TO MEAN NEW PUBLICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County public libraries, hard hit during last year's county budget 
crisis, are expected to get $5 million in a one-time windfall that will allow 
cash-strapped branches to buy new books and magazines, according to budget 
reports released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the money would not be enough to restore full-time 
operating hours at the 27 libraries, many of which have been forced to cut 
operations two days each week. 
</P>
<P>
 But county Librarian John M. Adams said the money would allow the struggling 
system to overcome some of the "most serious problems" facing local libraries 
in the next 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very helpful, a bright side," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the recommended funding is approved by the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, 
Adams said he will earmark slightly more than $4 million to buy new books and 
renew thousands of periodical subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will also buy new fax machines for all local branches and help pay 
for the new Rancho Santa Margarita branch scheduled to open in September, Adams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great news," County Budget Director Ronald S. Rubino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The library recommendations were outlined in the county's Mid-Year Budget 
Report. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the report presents a more hopeful financial picture for Orange 
County government with sales tax revenue on the rise. But unemployment trends 
remain high by local standards, leaving the county mired along with the rest of 
California in a slow economic recovery process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 5.6% unemployment rate for Orange County, although low in comparison to 
the state or other Southern California counties, is higher than it has been 
since the mid-1980s," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubino said most of the new money for libraries was made available only 
recently when the county was able to borrow money to make up for delinquent 
property taxes. The $5 million for the libraries is part of an $8-million 
windfall from the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubino said the remaining funds will provide $2.6 million to the County Flood 
Control District and $500,000 to the county harbors, beaches and parks 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the money, however, was being reserved for libraries, which 
suffered an overall 44% reduction during last year's round of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those cuts were forced by a statewide shift of $2.6 billion in local 
property taxes to pay for California public education needs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, local libraries began cutting hours July 1. The overall book 
budget was cut by 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of the system's regional branches in Irvine, Garden Grove 
and San Juan Capistrano, which now operate on five-day workweeks, all libraries 
have been placed on four-day schedules.

'RAINBOW MAN' GUILTY IN STINK BOMBINGS; COURTS: DEFENDANT, SEEN ON TV AT SPORTS 
EVENTS, SAYS HE ACTED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO 'THE RAPTURE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rollen Frederick Stewart, the flamboyant "Rainbow Man" recognized nationwide 
for donning a multicolored shock wig and waving religious placards during 
televised sports events, was found guilty Wednesday of setting off stink bombs 
at four Orange County locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 48, could face as long as five years in prison for placing homemade, 
acid-filled bombs with timers at three religious facilities and in the lobby of 
a local newspaper in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury listened to five days of testimony and 
deliberated Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning before handing down the 
decision. Stewart was convicted on four felony counts each of discharging a 
gaseous, nauseating substance in a public place and placing a fake bomb with 
the intent of making people fear for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart testified Tuesday that his stunts were meant to draw attention to the 
looming arrival of "the Rapture" -- the second coming of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, Stewart was sentenced to prison after being convicted of taking 
hostages at the Hyatt Regency Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport in 
September, 1992. He told police that incident was also intended to publicize 
his message about the approaching Judgment Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's conviction stemmed from stink bomb attacks at the Crystal 
Cathedral in Garden Grove, a Christian bookstore in the same city, the Trinity 
Broadcasting Network studios in Tustin and the lobby of the Orange County 
Register in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's attorney, public defender Sheryl Beasley, said Stewart's goal was 
always to spread his fervent religious belief and save souls, not to cause 
mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody should know Mr. Stewart is not some kind of evil, mean demon or 
anything of the type," Beasley said after the verdict. "Just the opposite, he's 
very much a humanitarian." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. M. Marc Kelly said he was pleased with the verdict, 
particularly because Stewart made "a calculated move" to threaten lives by 
setting off the bombs on religious holidays when crowds at some of the sites 
would be the largest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have been a lot better off sticking with wearing the wig at sporting 
events," Kelly said. "Because what he did with these bombs posed a serious 
danger to the public of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 25. Because Stewart will be eligible for 
parole on the hostage-taking conviction in 1999, Kelly has said he would try to 
have Stewart serve his sentence for the stink bomb attacks first.

SONY CALLED LIABLE FOR SCOREBOARD; ANAHEIM: FIRM WAS 'PRIMARILY' RESPONSIBLE 
FOR ENSURING JUMBOTRON'S STRUCTURAL SOUNDNESS, DATA SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sony Corp. was responsible for ensuring Anaheim Stadium's girders could 
support the 17-ton scoreboard that collapsed during last week's Northridge 
earthquake, city documents released this week show. 
</P>
<P>
 Contracts and letters among the city, Sony and the construction firm that was 
hired to expand the stadium show that it was the electronics giant that was to 
hire the engineers who would conduct load tests of the Jumbotron's structural 
support system and take responsibility for any errors. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Wednesday refused to release copies of Sony's engineering reports, 
saying they were still being looked at by inspectors at the stadium. Nor would 
the city comment on the released documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not offering any interpretation of the documents," city spokesman Bret 
Colson said. "They stand on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth, citing that no other buildings within 30 miles of 
the stadium suffered major structural damage during the Jan. 17 quake, said 
previously that a "structural flaw" in the support system was the likely cause 
of the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoreboard, installed in 1988, fell from its moorings during the quake, 
crushing or damaging at least 1,000 seats in the upper deck in the left-field 
stands. Damage has been estimated at more than $3 million. Hundreds may have 
been killed had the seats been occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which has applied for federal disaster aid to repair the stadium, 
has said it will take legal steps to recoup its losses from whomever it deems 
responsible for the collapse. It has hired three engineering firms to help in 
its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony declined Wednesday to comment in detail on the collapse or the documents, 
citing possible litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're investigating (the collapse), the city's investigating and we all have 
a lot more to learn," Sony spokesman Rick Clancy said. "The city has sent us a 
letter explaining what legal options it is exploring. Under company policy, we 
are prohibited from going into too much detail." 
</P>
<P>
 Clancy said Sony hired a subcontractor, White Way Sign Co. of Chicago, to do 
the installation of the scoreboard. White Way officials refused comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to install a new scoreboard was made in 1985, six years after the 
stadium was expanded to house the Los Angeles Rams football team. The city 
wanted to replace the black-and-white scoreboard that had been installed during 
the $33-million expansion with a color scoreboard, documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 The city began seeking bids from scoreboard companies and in December, 1987, 
signed an agreement with Sony, agreeing to buy the board and its installation 
for $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract said Sony could hire subcontractors such as White Way to do the 
installation, but it remained "primarily liable" for the work, according to 
city documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city rehired the firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, which 
completed the expansion, to review Sony's engineering reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In a December, 1987, letter, Lauren D. Carpenter, a Skidmore associate 
partner, wrote that Sony had retained engineers "who will prepare all necessary 
structural calculations for the new work as well as for checking the existing 
stadium structure for new loadings and for any necessary remedial strengthening 
required." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter goes on to reiterate that Skidmore's task was only to review Sony's 
plans by acting as a consultant to the city and that it was not to be held 
responsible if the plans were faulty. 
</P>
<P>
 Skidmore officials did not return calls for comment.

FORT KNOCKS; COMPLAINTS BY CITY, NEIGHBORS THREATEN BOY'S TREETOP ABODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It may have a balcony, a skylight and an ocean view, but the $3,200 structure 
perched upon two eucalyptus trees behind their home is still just a treehouse, 
a birthday present for their little boy, say Lewis and Linda Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why, the Castillos admit, they dragged their feet after a neighbor's 
complaint that the playhouse blocks his view and invades his privacy drew an 
ultimatum from City Hall two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The city told the Castillos to get Design Review Board approval for the 
structure or dismantle it. When they didn't act, the city attorney took them to 
court, where they were ordered to seek a city permit. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, judgment day approaches for 10-year-old Andrew Castillo's luxury 
treetop abode. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, the Castillos will appear before the review board, a panel that 
will chart new regulatory territory as it considers, for the first time, the 
fate of a wooden fort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole thing is pretty silly," Linda Castillo said. "I mean, a 
child's treehouse?" 
</P>
<P>
 But such matters are serious business in this eccentric coastal community 
that's almost as legendary for its zoning squabbles as for its artist's colony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the city attorney take them into court because they were not 
complying," said Dee Dillon, the city's code enforcement officer. "They were 
not coming into design review or removing it." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Linda Castillo said, "I just want to see whether we can go 
through the process and keep the treehouse." 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are also high for some neighbors, like Geo Moskios, a yoga 
instructor who filed the complaint two years ago. He said the ocean view Andrew 
now enjoys once belonged to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I used to be able to sit here at our dining room table and have 
our breakfast in the morning and look out through those trees and see that 
view," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look in that treehouse, you can look right in my house," he added. 
"There's a major privacy issue here." 
</P>
<P>
 Design review controversies are nothing new for Laguna Beach, a city that in 
1991 temporarily barred a couple from moving into their new home because it was 
painted a whiter shade than had been agreed upon by the couple and the review 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 After that highly publicized incident, the board refused to grant another 
couple approval to build a new home, in part because it would have cast a 
shadow on an existing residence. 
</P>
<P>
 And another time, the city's review board refused to let a woman keep a picket 
fence that was six inches too high. In that case, however, the City Council 
overruled the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest controversy centers on the upscale playhouse the Castillos had 
built for Andrew's sixth birthday. The 10-feet-by-5-feet structure is about 
eight feet tall at the tip of its pitched roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The fort is carefully secured with ropes between two towering eucalyptus 
trees, so the trees would not have to be speared with nails. The Castillos 
maintain that the structure will not fit properly onto any other tree in their 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has at least one defender: Michael Beanan, the craftsman who built 
the treehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the city, Beanan said the claim that the treehouse blocks 
anybody's view is "unfair and unwarranted" because it is nestled in mature 
trees that already obscure the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mention view in this town and everything stops," said Linda Castillo. She 
said Andrew would have to be a contortionist to lean around the treehouse 
balcony and peer into Moskios' back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say the complaints can't be dismissed, partly because the 
treehouse is an "accessory structure" that must win design review approval to 
stay, according to Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any separate structure has to have design review approval," she said, noting 
that this is the first time somebody has complained to the city about a 
treehouse. "If we hadn't had a complaint, we probably wouldn't even have known 
it was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon said she does not expect the structure to receive any special 
consideration from the board simply because it is located in a tree. And, since 
it is in a set-back area at the rear of the back yard, it also will require a 
variance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Castillos say they met with Moskios but that a tentative agreement between 
the parties dissolved when another neighbor also complained about the fort, 
saying it also infringed upon his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Andrew is still playing in his treehouse, crawling up and down the 
rope ladder that dangles from his vulnerable fortress. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as he is concerned, the cool thing about the fort is that he can go 
there with his pals to watch birds, eat pizza, lob rocks at trees and talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to talk about stuff with your friends that your parents can't hear," 
such as sports, grades and their schoolmates, he said. Occasionally, they even 
talk about girls, Andrew said, because "there are a few nice ones." 
</P>
<P>
 "We like bird-watching and stuff because there's a hawk's nest right above 
it," he said. "I really like it up there. . . . I just wouldn't want it to come 
down."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; SCHOOLS TENTATIVELY OK OPEN ENROLLMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees at the Tustin Unified School District tentatively approved a policy 
this week that would allow residents to send their children to any school 
within the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The open enrollment policy was passed by unanimous vote, and officials said it 
was done in compliance with state law that mandates open intradistrict 
transfers starting in school year 1994-95.The district is expected to have a 
final vote on the policy on Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 District administrators have set some guidelines on how the open enrollment 
policy would be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, students who reside within the attendance area of a school will 
have priority and cannot be displaced by a transfer student. Transfers will be 
selected on a first-come, first-served basis. There will be a waiting list if 
enrollment limits at a school or a grade level have been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, requests for transfers must be made by April 15 of the preceding 
school year. The school will send a preliminary notice of acceptance by May 15. 
The final decision will be made by the third Monday of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Once accepted, students are expected to remain for the entire school year. 
Students could stay at the school until they graduate, and their siblings will 
have priority to enroll at the same school. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. David Andrews said that student transfers would be closely watched to 
avoid having schools accept students mainly from one ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 The new enrollment policy would not affect the estimated 468 students from 
other school districts who are attending Tustin schools, or Tustin students in 
other school districts, Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policy is working well," Andrews said. "There is no need for restrictions 
for students going out or coming in." BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; TRUSTEE FOR COLLEGE DISTRICT IS APPOINTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rancho Santiago College District board has appointed Lawrence R. Labrado 
to replace a founding member who resigned last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees chose Labrado from a field of 15 during a public meeting 
on Monday.He replaces Carol Enos, who resigned in December, citing health 
reasons and an early retirement from her teaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 4 to 1 to appoint Labrado. Trustees Brian Conley, Michael 
Ortell, Enriqueta Ramos and Charles W. (Pete) Maddox voted in favor of Labrado. 
Shirley Ralston voted against him, and Tom Saenz abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Labrado, 54, of Orange has worked for Cal State Fullerton in numerous jobs for 
more than 20 years. He is now the university's outreach counselor, responsible 
for encouraging underrepresented students to transfer to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Larry will be an excellent trustee because of his commitment, 
experience in education and his involvement in the community," Maddox said 
after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe he has given a lot to the community and that he still has much to 
give."  
</P>
<P>
 Labrado is representing Trustee Area 3, which covers Villa Park and portions 
of Santa Ana, Garden Grove, Anaheim and Orange. Enos' unfinished term expires 
in November, said Vicki Stevens, board secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking over the position in the middle of a term should pose no difficulty, 
Labrado said after his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in education for 21 years, so I have a good idea what's going on. 
It's familiar, so I'll hit the ground running," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a challenge, but I enjoy challenges." JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TRUSTEE WANTS U.S. FUNDS FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>

 Huntington Beach City School District Trustee Shirley Carey wants the federal 
government to pay for the programs it requires the district to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 She said much of the money that is intended for books, teachers and classroom 
supplies is diverted to a variety of programs mandated by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey said her district of 5,750 students spent $700,000 in 1992-93 for such 
mandated programs as asbestos abatement, removal of underground fuel tanks, 
removal of hazardous waste, implementation of plans to meet environmental 
requirements, and compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal survey of 13 Orange County school districts that was completed 
last week by Carey and Virginia Wilson, a trustee of Los Alamitos Unified 
School District, showed that the unfunded portion of the mandated programs had 
a cumulative cost of $71 million for the last three years, Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating in the survey were the Buena Park, Centralia, Cypress, Fountain 
Valley, Magnolia, Ocean View, Savanna and Westminster elementary school 
districts, Anaheim Union and Huntington Beach Union high school districts, Los 
Alamitos and Irvine unified districts and the Huntington Beach City School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey said the purpose of the survey was to identify the magnitude of the 
problem and to seek support from the Orange County and California delegations 
to Congress when they consider several bills in coming months concerning 
compensation for federally mandated programs.  
</P>
<P>
 She sent copies of the 18-page survey to educational committees in the state 
Legislature, the state Department of Education and Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the National School Boards Assn. in Alexandria, Va., made copies 
of the survey and sent it to its lobbyist working on legislation on behalf of 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey said she believes that the mandated programs are "admirable and 
politically correct." But the lack of federal funding to support the 
regulations "has taken on the characteristics of a parasite . . . feeding 
themselves while destroying the core of the educational organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Garland, also a trustee in the Huntington Beach City School District, 
said that unfunded mandated programs are being thrust on districts at a time 
when they are hard-pressed financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the programs are wonderful, but the money comes out of our regular 
programs and a majority of the kids are being shortchanged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey said that if her district had not had to pay for the mandated programs 
and special education services, it could have reduced class sizes, restored 
nurses and librarians, expanded computer classes, replaced 30-year-old buses or 
expanded the summer school program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering that there are more than 1,000 public school districts in 
California, and more than 16,000 public school systems in the United States, 
the real cost of unfounded mandates is staggering," she said. ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CLASSROOMS BURNED IN HIGH SCHOOL FIRE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An electrical fire burned two portable classrooms at Fountain Valley High 
School early Wednesday, and two firefighters sprained their ankles putting out 
the blaze, a spokesman for the fire department said. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident reported smelling smoke about 1:30 a.m. from the school at 17816 
Bushard St., said Don Heinbuch. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding firefighters saw a glow behind the campus and found the portable 
building containing the two classrooms in flames, he said. About 20 
firefighters controlled the two-alarm blaze in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators determined that an electrical part of a television failed and 
caused the fire, Heinbuch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze caused $60,000 worth of damage to the building, $50,000 to the 
contents and $7,500 to an adjacent building, he said. THUAN LE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; FISHING, FRIENDSHIP ARE CLUB'S CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fish weren't biting much when anglers of the Huntington Beach Fishing Club 
tested the waters off Huntington Beach Pier on Wednesday, but the weather and 
the view were perfect so nobody seemed to mind much. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, which formed last June as a social and inexpensive recreational 
activity, gets together several times each month. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, they cast their lines in search of fun and found it. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is made up of about 30 senior citizens but membership is open to 
anyone who likes to fish. Club members will teach people who don't know how to 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members make about three freshwater and saltwater outings each month and 
expert fishermen offer instructions on knot-tying and other fish-catching tips. 
The club has evolved into a support group for members who are ill or who have 
lost a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, members said they will take underprivileged children whale 
watching and on fishing trips this spring.  
</P>
<P>
 Madeline Gaskins, 64, of Huntington Beach, regarded as one of the club's most 
skillful anglers, caught the first fish Wednesday, a small bass that she 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody should belong to the club," she said. "It gives you a chance to get 
out of the house and leave some work for tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Josephine Wright of Costa Mesa, the club secretary who writes a monthly 
newsletter for 30 members, said she began fishing more than 50 years ago with 
her father on the Santa Barbara pier. It wasn't all recreation because the 
day's catch was an important food source for her family during the Depression, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She heard about the club at a Costa Mesa senior citizens center, she said. One 
of the anglers joined her at a sporting goods store and advised her on the 
purchase of a saltwater rod and reel for $125, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best thing to happen to me in years," she said. "We're all good 
friends and care about each other."  
</P>
<P>
 Lou Zulka, president of the club, is a retired McDonnell Douglas flight test 
engineer who said he grew up fishing in the Chesapeake Bay and has fished in 
many places throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a great respect for the sea and being out in the open, fresh air," 
said Zulka, 65, of Huntington Beach. "If I catch fish it's a plus." 
</P>
<P>
 Zulka said the pier outing was intended more or less as practice for more 
demanding trips. He spent much of the time Wednesday tying hooks and adjusting 
reels for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go the full nine yards the first couple of times," he said. "After that, my 
fingers get tired." 
</P>
<P>
 The club meets the first Tuesday of each month at 9:30 a.m. at the Michael E. 
Rodgers Senior Center, 1706 Orange Ave. in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Surf fishing is scheduled Feb. 9 at Sunset Beach; a deep-sea trip from Dana 
Point is scheduled Feb. 18 and a daylong outing is scheduled at Lake Irvine on 
Feb. 23.  
</P>
<P>
 People can find out more about joining the fishing club by calling the Michael 
E. Rodgers Senior Center at (714) 536-9387. ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; REVISED GRAFFITI LAW TARGETS VANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City leaders are sending a strong message to graffiti vandals: It's a crime to 
deface property. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're prosecuted, you face a stiff sentence, and if you're a minor, your 
parents will be held responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently amended the city's graffiti ordinance, taking a more 
aggressive posture toward people who vandalize and deface property. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Richard M. Tefank said among major changes in the city's graffiti 
ordinance is that the vandal is liable for damages. If the person is a 
juvenile, the parent or guardian becomes responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Tefank said the parent or legal guardian of a minor can be required to pay 
court costs up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thought is that this type of responsibility will encourage parents to 
educate young people that applying graffiti is against the law, and, in 
addition, that there's a heavy financial burden that the parent or guardian is 
responsible for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance also increases criminal penalties that include community 
service of cleaning up graffiti and allows the council to establish a reward 
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of graffiti violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Tefank also said that the ordinance expands the definition of graffiti 
implements to include aerosol paint cans, felt-tip pens and any device that can 
etch or scribble into a surface. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, businesses face new requirements for selling such items. Graffiti 
implements must be placed in a secure area where employee assistance is needed 
to buy the item. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of people we arrest for graffiti, when asked where they got 
the tools, seldom say they bought it," Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tefank said the intent is to reduce the opportunity for these types of items 
to be stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to approve the final reading of the amended ordinance 
Feb. 7. The new ordinance is expected to go into effect in early March. DEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; AGENCY FOR HOMELESS SEEKING NEW OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of a center for homeless people that was forced to close last month 
say they are searching for a new office. They hope to reopen within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Bode, former director of the Episcopal Service Alliance branch on Coast 
Highway, said the program is missed by the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "What ESA was for them was their home more than anything else," said Bode, who 
now distributes sack lunches in a park to those who had received hot lunches at 
the agency. "They miss the showers a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, which served about 600 people each month, was the only place in 
south Orange County with showers for the homeless, Bode said. It did not 
provide overnight shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 After operating here for six years, the office closed in December because the 
property owner had another use for the building, said Episcopal Service 
Alliance's executive director Dennis White. The organization is headquartered 
in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to have another center open in Laguna in six months," he said. 
"There's certainly a need in that area. That's been proven just by the number 
of people we've assisted over the years we were there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach facility on Coast Highway was one of five Episcopal Service 
Alliance centers in Orange County. It offered laundry facilities, food, 
clothing, an employment program and transportation and referrals to other 
county services. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Laguna, you just don't see people carry big sacks of belongings because 
they had everything they needed at ESA," Bode said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the center's closure, workers have been scrambling to meet many of the 
needs of the homeless. In addition to the park lunch program, workers sometimes 
distribute supplies -- such as blankets, jackets and toiletries -- on the 
beach, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Bode said, the Neighborhood Congregational Church is providing 
space so she can continue a separate program that helps needy families pay 
their utility bills. The group is also continuing to distribute food weekly 
from the Woman's Club of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Bode said Monday the group has targeted potential sites for a new office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working on a couple places," she said. "We would like to be closer to 
downtown. That would be our first choice, but it's hard to say anything 
definite at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the financial and other hurdles the center overcame to stay open 
as long as it did, White said it is frustrating to start again from scratch. 
However, he is optimistic the organization will eventually find another niche 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we probably can find someplace where we can be part of the community 
of Laguna Beach," he said. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY OKS PLANS FOR RESIDENTIAL HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capping a year of debate, the City Council early Wednesday approved plans to 
build a single-room-occupancy hotel in an industrial area off Jamboree Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Inn would be the city's first residential hotel -- a landmark 
structure that affordable housing advocates see as an ideal home for people who 
work in Irvine but can't afford to live there. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 3-2 vote came after five hours of emotional testimony. Owners of 
nearby heavy industrial businesses argued that the site near a rock-crushing 
plant and waste facility was not an appropriate location for a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council majority, while acknowledging the location wasn't perfect, 
said the hotel proposal was well-conceived and that it should be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a workable site in a livable location," said Councilwoman Paula 
Werner. "This project would allow workers to live close to their jobs and 
thereby reduce traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co., Shawnatana Development Corp. and HomeAid Orange County sought 
to jointly develop the $12-million Irvine Inn. The hotel would have more than 
100 rooms -- each with a bathroom and kitchenette. A furnished room would cost 
about $370 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers said they would market the hotel for low-wage earners who work 
in such places as UC Irvine and the business parks that line the San Diego 
Freeway. Some entry-level professionals and senior citizens would also be 
encouraged to live at the Irvine Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision came several months after the Planning Commission 
rejected the proposal in a heated meeting that lasted past midnight. Commission 
members said it was not wise to locate a residential hotel in an industrial 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 That point was emphasized again Wednesday by nearby business owners who said 
hotel residents would be bothered by the noise, traffic and pollution caused by 
the industrial work. The owners said they feared the hotel residents would 
complain about the noise and demand that working hours be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Christina L. Shea and Greg Smith sided with the business 
owners. But Werner, Councilman Barry J. Hammond and Mayor Michael Ward 
concluded that the hotel could coexist with the businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 The council also voted to require hotel residents to sign disclaimers stating 
that they are aware of nearby industrial businesses that create noise and 
sometimes operate 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward suggested that the city consider signing a development agreement with the 
businesses aimed at reaffirming their right to operation -- even with the hotel 
next door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to protect them," Ward said. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; PARK TO GET 150 TREES UNDER $7,450 GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has received a federal grant through the California Department of 
Forestry and Fire Protection to plant 150 Italian Cypress trees in the Brea 
Junior High School Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The $7,450 grant will be used to buy and plant the trees along the northeast 
property line of the park, which is adjacent to the Country Road Homeowners 
Assn. clubhouse and pool area. 
</P>
<P>
 The project originated as a solution to the association's concerns, including 
noise and dust from the park. Also, city officials said the clubhouse has been 
damaged when struck by balls flying from the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea is one of 85 government agencies in California awarded grants totaling 
$3,484,448. About 47,000 trees will be planted throughout the state through the 
Small Business Appropriation Act of 1990, which authorized the grants for the 
purpose of contracting with small businesses to plant trees on publicly owned 
and controlled land, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is seeking bids from local businesses for the purchase and planting 
of the trees. The planting is expected to occur on or near Arbor Day in March.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; TEAM TO HELP CREATE MULTIETHNIC CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting to a string of racially motivated incidents, the Saddleback Community 
College District trustees voted Monday to hire a consulting team to advise 
Saddleback College on the development of a multiethnic studies department. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the recommendation of a committee of administrators, faculty and 
students, the trustees agreed to hire Carl G. Clark, a psychologist, and Tom 
Gamboa, coordinator of the Cross Cultural Studies Department at Grossmont 
College in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, an African American, and Gamboa, a Native American, work with other 
professionals on racial counseling and consulting under the name of The Clark 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees authorized paying up to $10,000 to the The Clark Group, which will 
review Saddleback College's curriculum; interview administrators, faculty, 
staff and students, and submit written and oral reports in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The report will also include recommendations on how to set up a multiethnic 
studies program and, eventually, a department offering an associate of arts 
degree in ethnic studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs for the study will be shared equally by the Associated Student 
Government, the Saddleback College General Fund and the Academic Senate's staff 
development fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls for multiethnic studies intensified in the fall after two racially 
motivated incidents on the Saddleback campus in Mission Viejo. In one, an 
African American woman reported finding a threatening note on her car's 
windshield on Nov. 1. A month earlier, two African American candidates for 
homecoming king and queen said flyers containing racial slurs had been left in 
their mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the candidates, Ricc Waddell, the president of the campus's Black 
United Students, withdrew from the homecoming contest and said he had received 
a letter with similar threats earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Waddell also became the spokesman for students who demanded the college 
address the issue by forming a multiethnic studies department. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was on the panel that recommended the hiring of The Clark Group, 
Waddell questioned whether that will lead to the creation of a new department. 
He said the contract's limits of five months and $10,000 showed a lack of 
commitment by the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saddleback has set this thing up to fail," Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Brewer, Saddleback College's acting president, said The Clark Group 
was selected out of three consulting firms that applied. Brewer said Carl G. 
Clark assured him the work could be done within the limits of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Clark nor Gamboa could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This certainly doesn't mean this is going to finish the work," Brewer said. 
"If there are other things we need to consider after the June deadline, I think 
we're committed to following through with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the main thing is to get this business started and move forward and 
see how far we can get." RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; LAW WOULD REGULATE TOPLESS DANCING BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to regulate what could be the city's first topless and nude 
dancing bar, the City Council on Monday night passed an emergency ordinance 
designed to keep patrons at a certain distance from the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 6-0 to pass the ordinance, which requires live entertainment 
establishments, including adult entertainment, to ensure that their performers 
are separated at least six feet from patrons.The ordinance also required a 
floor-to-ceiling glass barrier between dancers and patrons who are closer than 
six feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would regulate what could be the city's first topless and nude 
dancing bar, to be named Mermaids, at 4248 Martingale Way near John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Original Mermaids' designs called for, among other stages for topless dancers, 
a "viewing room" where a nude dancer would perform behind a three-foot-high 
plexiglass barrier for a single patron. For now, said Mermaids' attorney Ronald 
Talmo, the bar will apply for a permit under the amended city code and will 
comply with the emergency ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, we'll probably challenge" the ordinance's legality at a later date, 
Talmo said. Nude or topless dancing is protected under the First Amendment, and 
Talmo said to curtail the distance between dancers and patrons would violate 
free expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night's vote is yet another obstacle thrown in Mermaids' way, Talmo 
said. The city Planning Commission last week denied the bar a permit, saying 
the business would generate parking and traffic problems. Talmo said he will 
appeal the commissioners' decision at the City Council meeting on Feb. 14. LILY

<P>
 A commercial real estate broker who has served on a variety of committees in 
the Irvine Unified School District was appointed to the district board this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen McArthur, 44, will serve the 10 months remaining on the term of Greg 
Smith, who resigned last year to take a seat on the Irvine City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 McArthur will be sworn into office at the Feb. 1 school board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 McArthur, a resident of the city's Northwood area, has served on the school 
district's budget task force, the budget committee, the superintendent's 
curriculum council and the communications task force. He has two children who 
attend district schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact that Steve has had a consistent interest in the school 
district for a long time," said board member Margie Wakeham. "He's not like 
anyone else on the board, but I think he will be a team player." 
</P>
<P>
 The board selected McArthur on Tuesday night from among 11 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not an easy decision," Wakeham said. "All 11 candidates were wonderful 
people who took a long time to think about the issues." SHELBY GRAD

CONFUSION DELAYS CLOSING OF BEACH AFTER SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials blame a miscommunication between a public works employee and a 
dispatcher for causing a delay in closing a beach after 4,000 gallons of sewage 
spilled over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The area near Lagunita Beach was reopened Wednesday, a County Health Care 
Agency spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguards reported the spill to the city at 9 a.m. Sunday, after they were 
notified by a citizen. A public works employee was sent to inspect the site. 
But when he spoke to the dispatcher, the message was misunderstood, said Terry 
Brandt, Laguna Beach director of municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public works employee called her and either she didn't hear him, or 
didn't get it right or simply misunderstood it as a problem for the South Coast 
Water District. And, unfortunately, she thought he meant Laguna Beach Water 
District," Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
 When notified, that agency found that the problem was not its responsibility 
and contacted the city. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city then failed to contact the South Coast Water District, which 
treats sewage, until the next day, Brandt said. The district dispatched a crew 
and discovered that grease and detergent had plugged a manhole, and sewage was 
overflowing at 160 gallons an hour near Lagunita Beach.

<P>
 The site was described as 2,500 feet long from Dumond Drive south to Blue 
Lagoon Drive in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast crew cleared the manhole while administrators contacted the 
County Health Care Agency, as required when there is a spill greater than 50 
gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the verbal direction of the county, we posted beach closure signs," said 
Linda Jones, South Coast Water District assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt said such a miscommunication has never happened before, and next time 
the city will ensure that the responsible agency responds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said tests of offshore water concluded the bacteria level was within the 
state's guidelines. However, a different testing procedure is used by the 
county, which kept the beach closed until its laboratory tests showed the beach 
was safe for swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach was reopened at 4 p.m. Wednesday after the county's laboratory tests 
showed the bacteria level was safe, said Lawrence Honeybourne, County Health 
Care Agency program chief of water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our examination of the test results show that it looks better," Honeybourne 
said. "We use a different methodology than South Coast and rely on a standard 
method for examination of waste water."

PRESCHOOL AIDE DIAGNOSED WITH CONTAGIOUS TB; HEALTH: COUNTY ASKS PARENTS TO 
ALLOW THE 60 CHILDREN AT CUDDLE CARE CENTER TO BE TESTED FOR DISEASE THAT POSES 
WORST THREAT TO VERY YOUNG. IT IS THIRD RECENT OUTBREAK IN SCHOOLS.

 A teacher's aide at a Fullerton preschool has been diagnosed with a contagious 
form of tuberculosis requiring the testing of children and staff members at the 
school, Orange County health officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 County officials learned of the infection when the 28-year-old teacher's aide 
at the Cuddle Care Center was diagnosed Monday at Martin Luther Hospital in 
Anaheim. Hospital officials then reported to the county that she had active, 
contagious tuberculosis, said Orange County Health Officer Hugh Stallworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of the 60 children at the school were to be notified by mail Wednesday 
that their children might have been exposed to TB. The letters from the county 
also asked permission for public health nurses to administer TB skin tests to 
the children at school on Monday. In addition, Stallworth said, eight current 
staff members and two former teachers at the school should be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third time in recent months that TB screenings have been ordered in 
Orange County schools. County health officials say this demonstrates the 
increasing threat of the disease, which was once believed to be virtually 
eradicated in the United States. The two previous alerts were at high schools 
in La Habra and Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis poses its greatest danger to children under age 5 because their 
immune systems often are not strong enough to ward off the lung disease. 
Children at Cuddle Care Center, county officials said, range in age between 15 
months and 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Stallworth said, young children and the elderly are more likely 
to contract an active form of TB and can suffer more complications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could hit them harder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis, a bacterial infection of the lungs, can be successfully treated 
with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Maxwell, the county's program manager for pulmonary disease services, 
said operators of Cuddle Care Center told officials the teacher's aide had 
tested negative for the disease before she began working at the center last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Ritchie, who runs the child care center, declined to comment on the 
situation, referring all questions to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state laws governing the licensing of preschool facilities, preschool 
staff members must be tested for tuberculosis before employment and all new 
students must have TB skin tests. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials said they will hold a meeting at Cuddle Care Center at 
7 tonight to counsel parents and staff members about the disease.  
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis germs are spread through the air when a contagious person sneezes 
or coughs. The disease typically infects those who have been in close contact 
over a long period of time with someone who has the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent increase in tuberculosis cases in the county, Stallworth said, is 
associated with an influx of immigrants from regions such as the Far East where 
there is a high rate of tuberculosis. People infected with HIV or who are 
malnourished, drug users or alcoholics also are "at risk" for the disease, 
Stallworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the county tested all 1,034 students and 189 staff members at La 
Quinta High School in Garden Grove after seven students were found to have 
active TB infections. Another 189 students tested positive for the bacterium 
but were in the earliest stage of the disease, when it has done no harm and is 
not contagious. They were put on medication to prevent their infection from 
becoming active in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In early January, 225 students and 81 staff members were tested at La Habra 
High School after a senior girl was hospitalized with contagious tuberculosis. 
Skin tests found that 35 of her classmates tested positive for the bacterium. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra High students with positive skin tests subsequently received chest 
X-rays to determine whether they had the active disease. Rick Greenwood, the 
county's deputy director of public health, said Wednesday that the X-ray 
results indicate that one more student may have active tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 People who take skin tests and register positive may not have active, 
contagious cases because their immune systems are holding the disease at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who skin test positive who are out there in the 
community," Stallworth said. "At what point they will change to an active case, 
I don't know, but the potential is there for there to be a serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwood said the county will make school skin testing mandatory next fall 
for all new admissions to public schools and start students who test positive 
on preventive therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This approach will prevent TB outbreaks in schools from occurring in the 
future," he said.

LAGUNA BEACH HIGH STUDENTS FIND RACIST FLYERS IN LOCKERS; HATE: PUPILS AND 
FACULTY 'VERY UPSET,' PRINCIPAL SAYS. THE PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOL HAS SEEN 
RECENT RACIAL TENSIONS.

<P>
 Students arriving at Laguna Beach High School on Wednesday found racist flyers 
stuffed in their lockers, a discovery that shocked a campus already taking 
special steps to promote racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Flyers were put into nearly all of the approximately 300 lockers on campus 
sometime Tuesday night, Principal Barbara Callard said.The flyers promoted 
white supremacy and contained racial slurs against several groups, including 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators and student leaders went to every class in the morning to 
denounce what Callard described as an "unconscionable act." A police report was 
filed and the Orange County Human Relations Commission was contacted for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we're not going to tolerate on our campus," Callard said. 
"We're going to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers left the campus "very upset," with both students and faculty 
feeling violated, Callard said. 
</P>
<P>
 A juvenile officer believed a similar flyer had been distributed in Los 
Angeles County, Callard added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although perhaps the first time racist flyers have been distributed on the 
campus, it is not the first racial incident there this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school has experienced a series of incidents since autumn pitting 
white teen-age males against students of Mexican descent. Latino students are 
part of a small, slowly growing minority at Laguna Beach High, which has the 
highest percentage of white students in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the incidents and tension, the school has initiated a number of 
activities designed to promote racial harmony, including a series of 
multicultural events for the week of Feb. 14, Callard said.

SO FAR, SO GOOD-NATURED FOR EL TORO REUSE AUTHORITY; PLANNING: AFTER MONTHS OF 
DEBATE OVER ITS FORMATION, FIRST MEETING IS AGREEABLE. NEXT ONE COULD BE 
DIFFERENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the first meeting of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority is remembered for 
anything it will be for its brevity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without a single word of acrimony, a quality that has marked the seven-month 
organizational process, the new nine-member board Wednesday zipped through an 
opening agenda in less than 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the panel's first actions as it begins to chart the post-military use of 
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station was to begin a nationwide search for an 
executive director who would manage the daily planning operations of the 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it seems we're getting along just fine," quipped Board of Supervisors 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who is expected to serve as the authority's chairman. 
"We have come a long way, but we have a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of an "unbiased" director was needed to steer the process 
through a minefield of opposing views on how the 4,700-acre base should be 
developed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 North County cities have favored developing a commercial airport to boost 
local tourism, while South County cities have said an airport would foul 
residential communities with more noise and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to keep the process open and objective," said board member and 
Lake Forest City Councilwoman Marcia Rudolph. "That will be the success or 
failure of this project." 
</P>
<P>
 As the local planning authority was convening, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons on 
Wednesday reaffirmed its intention to claim part of the base as a 
minimum-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Sledge, the bureau's site selection chief in Washington, said the 
agency would likely submit an application to house 1,600 to 3,000 inmates at El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in everything out there," Sledge said of available federal 
property in California. "We build nice places and we're a good neighbor. We 
have to find out whether we fit into the reuse plan out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau's enthusiasm, however, was not shared by the new authority members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always amazes me that the Bureau of Prisons is looking for sites in a 
residential area," said Irvine City Councilman and authority member Barry J. 
Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no discussion of the bureau's efforts during Wednesday's meeting at 
the Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the group reviewed the needs for governing bylaws and funding to pay 
for the authority's work. At least some of the money could come from a Federal 
Aviation Administration grant to study the possible location of a commercial 
airport there. 
</P>
<P>
 The governing board consists of all five Orange County supervisors, Irvine's 
Hammond, Mayor Michael Ward and Councilwoman Christina L. Shea and Lake 
Forest's Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 North County cities and others not part of the top board of directors have 
been invited to join a 50-member executive council. That panel will also draw 
members from the county, representatives from seven unincorporated areas of 
South County, seven business groups and four universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The leadership structure continues to leave some North County leaders unhappy 
with an authority which they say leans too far in favor of South County 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Councilman Irv Pickler said he would recommend that the city join 
the authority's executive council, but also would request that the city further 
explore its interests in the Orange County Regional Airport Authority. The 
agency, made up of North County cities, supports the conversion of the base to 
an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Pickler said the city would be "foolish to turn its back on the 
executive council. We'll be there. We want to keep the process honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Communities, business groups and universities invited to join the executive 
council have until Feb. 15 to confirm their interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most anticipated action expected out of Wednesday's first meeting 
of the governing board never materialized: City members were expected to 
challenge county members over who should occupy the posts of chairman and vice 
chairman of the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors want two of its members to be in charge for the life of the 
agency, but Irvine officials, who have land-use authority over a small portion 
of the base, want city officials to share the leadership positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is expected to be settled at the authority's next meeting.

LIVE BUT UNARMED MINE DISCOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city sanitation crew clearing a storm drain in preparation for the rainy 
season discovered a live but unarmed Claymore anti-personnel mine Wednesday, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bomb disposal unit from the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, with 
assistance from the sheriff's bomb squad, removed the mine without incident 
about 3 p.m., Irvine Police Lt. Al Muir said.  
</P>
<P>
 Muir said police had no idea how long the mine had been in the storm drain at 
Turtle Rock Drive and Sycamore Creek or how it got there. 
</P>
<P>
 A model still being used by the Marines, the mine was live but did not have 
the electrical impulse device necessary to detonate it, Muir said.

PERSONAL HEALTH; AH, THAT FIRST PUFF OF THE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never mind those old movies where no one can resist that after-sex smoke. 
Among hard-core puffers, the hands-down favorites are the after-dinner 
cigarette or the first one of the day, according to a new survey. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA researcher Dr. Murray Jarvik and his colleagues interviewed more than 
5,000 Bay Area smokers, asking which cigarette of the day they would most miss. 
Forty-four percent said the after-dinner cigarette; 33% said the first puff of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The after-romance cigarette? It ranked No. 15 behind the last cigarette of the 
day, the cigarette with coffee or alcohol, and those puffed during commute time 
or phone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some respondents quit smoking for 24 hours and kept track of their withdrawal 
symptoms. The more nicotine-dependent, the more likely a smoker was to rate the 
first cigarette of the day as most important. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokers trying to quit or cut down might not realize how important certain 
cigarettes have become, says Jarvik, whose study was published in the Journal 
of Behavioral Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be prepared," he advises. "Have a coping mechanism ready." One option: "Get 
some nicotine chewing gum. It's difficult to smoke while chewing it." KATHLEEN

SOME RATTLED SPIRITS FIND A QUICK FIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge quake hits. And now, it seems, many Angelenos are reaching for 
the bottle -- pills and booze. Prescriptions for tranquilizers and sleeping 
aids are pouring in to local pharmacies, several sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard rumors," says Sue Navest, vice president of marketing for the 
California Pharmacists' Assn. "But that is rumor; nothing is confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bob Somers, president of the San Fernando chapter of the association, says 
he can confirm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely," he says. "All of the pharmacies have had an increase in these 
prescriptions -- especially the tranquilizers Xanax, Valium and Ativan, and 
their generic equivalents." These drugs are mild tranquilizers designed to 
relieve anxiety and nervous tension. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Freeman, a pharmacist at Key Pharmacy in North Hollywood, also reports a 
slight increase in these prescriptions since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's quite common that people have difficulty sleeping" since the 
quake, he says. "There is a lot more anxiety. There is just a lot of stress out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone reacts differently to crises, but some people may feel a need for 
(tranquilizers) who have never taken these medications before." 
</P>
<P>
 But experts on drug abuse have something else to say on how people react to a 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the earthquake, the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug 
Information issued a terse warning that "alcohol, tobacco and other drug 
problems increase as a result of a natural disaster such as an earthquake, 
flood or hurricane." 
</P>
<P>
 Prescription drugs can be easily misused in the turmoil following a disaster, 
says Bill Beard, an information specialist with the federally funded 
clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prescription drugs are just that: They should be used under the strict advice 
of a physician. But what happens in many cases is that people act on their own 
to increase the dosage or they use alcohol along with the drug," he says. "Most 
prescriptions have strict warnings on how to use these drugs. In times of 
stress, however, people forget these warnings." 
</P>
<P>
 Beard says the agency also urges people to avoid the use of alcohol to deal 
with stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is offered as a relaxant. But it can cause more trouble if it helps a 
person to not deal with their immediate problems," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, the new prescriptions are being issued by doctors and 
psychiatrists who have decided that short-term use of a tranquilizer can help 
their patients at this time. Somers guesses that perhaps half of the 
tranquilizer prescriptions represent patients who have never been on such 
medications but have a need for them now. But most prescriptions issued are for 
"a small quantity of the drug, for a limited time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Bement, a spokesman for the Thrifty Drug & Discount Stores chain, said 
those stores have not seen an increase in tranquilizers and sleeping aid 
prescriptions, adding: "We would have had some inner discussion about it if 
that were so." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, he says, is because tranquilizer prescriptions must be reported to 
the state in order to prevent drug abuse. The drugs can be addictive with 
long-term use. 
</P>
<P>
 And post-earthquake stress may go on and on and on.

A WAY TO SHAKE OLD PATTERNS; LIFESTYLES: THE QUAKE GOT MANY SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIANS THINKING ABOUT THE WAY THEY LIVE. NOW SOME ARE MAKING SUBTLE -- 
AND NOT SO SUBTLE -- CHANGES.

 On Jan. 16, Anne Fishbein reverted to her old ways. She slept with her pants 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous week, because a swarm of small quakes had rocked the Westside, 
the Santa Monica photographer had pushed her futon into the center of her 
living room and had slept there fully clothed, with her shoes beside her. But 
on the eve of the 6.6 Northridge quake, she dropped her guard. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when her apartment building again lurched and shuddered, she wasted 
several moments rummaging frantically through her rattling closets in search of 
proper disaster wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Fishbein says, bedtime again finds her "back to my National Guard 
attire." 
</P>
<P>
 Across Southern California, quake survivors consciously or subconsciously are 
altering their behavior and the patterns of their lives -- and wondering how 
long the changes will last. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle Rock resident Paul Vandeventer, for instance, has taught his 2-year-old 
son James to cope with the anxiety that rises up during aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop Earth!" the boy now snaps. "You bothering me! I mad at you!" 
</P>
<P>
 But Vandeventer, executive director of the nonprofit organization Community 
Partners, believes that he has also encountered a decidedly different type of 
coping mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
 While talking on the phone immediately after Jan. 19's 5-point-plus 
aftershocks wobbled through his 44th-floor office in Downtown's Arco Towers, 
Vandeventer's gaze drifted to the generally staid windowscape of the tower 
across the way. What he saw stopped the conversation mid-sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 A man and a woman had stripped off strategic pieces of their business suits, 
and were, Vandeventer says, "well . . . doing it. " 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it must be an extreme manifestation of post-earthquake stress 
syndrome come to the workplace," he says, chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Southern Californians report more subtle changes. Commuters say they now 
refuse to stop under freeway overpasses (or they avoid freeways altogether). 
Parents say they willingly share a bed with their children (and, perhaps, their 
children's pets). 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Wilson, the publicity director for I. Magnin, awoke Monday morning to 
find that her collection of demitasse cups had jigged off its shelves and 
landed a la Humpty Dumpty amid a heap of fractured china and crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing that occurred to me is that these days, the way to live would 
be . . . in a very monastic way," says Wilson, who resides near Melrose and La 
Cienega. "I truly have no desire to collect objects (anymore) because I have so 
many that were broken. I'm going to replace the crystal with Libby (mason 
jars)." 
</P>
<P>
 Regionwide, values and priorities have shifted. Parents, for instance, report 
an abruptly raised safety consciousness. Kathryn Bikle, an Altadena director 
and actress, finds herself leading the 5-year-olds who come to play with her 
young children on pointed tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is an earthquake, I'll be with you of course," she tells the kids, 
marching them from room to room and around the yard. "But make sure you stay 
away from the windows. Get under a door frame. Stay away from power lines. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 At Arroyo Vista Elementary School in South Pasadena, students returned to 
classes the day after the quake. Since then, they've put their "duck-and-cover" 
training to good use, scrambling under their desks whenever a serious 
aftershock rattles the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 And a variety of new "earthquake games," from rocking tables to playing rescue 
worker, have erupted in parks and playgrounds, parents and educators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the changes adults made also reflect a certain stoic good humor. On 
the Wednesday after the quake, for instance, Fishbein recorded a new answering 
machine message. For a few days, anxious family and friends heard the shaken 
Chicago native's reassuring voice, with the Doobie Brothers' "Living on the 
Fault Line" as background music. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they hear the late Frank Zappa singing: "Moving to Montana soon. . . ." 
(Frankly, Fishbein says, she's not sure whether she means the message as a joke 
or a serious signal of more substantial life changes to come.) 
</P>
<P>
 Film critic Ella Taylor, on the other hand, represents the more complacent end 
of the behavioral spectrum. For a few days, the self-confessed slave to fashion 
kept emergency clothing bags packed and took only the briefest of showers, 
fearing that renewed quaking might force her into the street unfashionably, or 
simply unattired. 
</P>
<P>
 Now her showers are longer, and her attitude more relaxed. "I suddenly 
realized today how quickly I'd slipped back into denial," she says. "The more 
aftershocks there are, the lazier I get. I don't leap into doorways unless it's 
a 5.5." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If patterns from other quake zones are any indication, the style and longevity 
of post-quake change is no more certain than seismology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us up here had slipped into old habits, bad habits, and we 
re-evaluated again after your quake," says Dave Elzey, a theater manager in 
Oakland.  
</P>
<P>
 People who paid very close attention to where they put their furniture after 
the disastrous Loma Prieta quake -- then gradually let their caution lapse -- 
are again taking heavy objects off high shelves and rearranging bookcases, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd set up three days supplies of food after the last quake, then used it 
for other things," he says. Now he is restocking.  
</P>
<P>
 "Also, on a more human level, one of the more interesting things I noticed 
after the 1989 quake was that people were friendlier to each other. That lasted 
a lot longer than I thought it would. It lasted months and months. There was a 
sense of general sympathy, (a feeling) that the person standing next to you 
could have been affected. People were generally more considerate. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you get through the aftershocks," he continues in a rhetorical aside to 
all Southern Californians, "you'll probably get the same thing. It doesn't 
create the tension you'd think it would." 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Elewski has a similar view. The writer lived in the little town of 
Ferndale when a series of quakes walloped that section of California's north 
coast in April, 1992. Elewski had just sold her house in the wake of a divorce 
and can't entirely sort out which behavioral changes can be attributed to that 
upheaval and which to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She does know, however, that she hasn't hung a single picture in any home 
she's had since then. "I haven't put a nail in a wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, though, the seismic assault shook her up in a positive way that 
might surprise still-quaking Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 The period before the tremor was particularly stressful for her, says Elewski, 
now living in Sunnyvale. "There was a lot of pressure on me in every area of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the ground rumbled, destroying parts of her picturesque town. Afterward, 
Elewski was standing on a deck, contemplating matters -- "Earthquakes are so 
emotional. You have no control" -- when a major aftershock hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I laid face-down on the deck. I gave up. I gave up on all the things that 
were going on in my life. I'd been so stressed, so full of tension, and I just 
let it all go. The earthquake was so big and so bad that it wiped everything 
else out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Gosh, it was a cathartic moment," she says. "I felt so peaceful during that 
aftershock. And that peace stayed with me."

<P>
 After XXVII Super Bowls, memories are stamped into the mind like the smoking 
brands on dumb, snorting steroid-fed bulls, which is sort of what you'll see if 
you watch Super Bowl XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't mean memories of the games themselves. Let's be honest about that. 
XXVII years of Super Bowls have produced the same amount of unforgettable, 
riveting moments as a Jim Nabors concert. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean the real memories. The ones that could never fade, no matter how many 
blows to the head you take or how many Richard Riordan speeches you listen to. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking memories of Super Bowl parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as Super Bowl XVI. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck falls asleep -- or passes out, as everyone except him calls it -- on my 
sofa shortly after halftime. Roger stumbles over to him, a puffy kernel of 
popcorn in each hand. Quickly, with little fanfare, Roger jams a kernel of 
popcorn up each of Chuck's nostrils. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking way up. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck snaps awake with quite the odd expression and, still incoherent, lurches 
wildly across the room, making great grunting and wheezing sounds. Well, we 
assumed they were great sounds. The laughter from the other 14 guys in the room 
pretty much drowned it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that was a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Super Bowl XV, which was just I year before the Popcorn Up Chuck's Nose 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Super Bowl XV became known, in my circle of idiots, as the Pete Has a Halibut 
in His Shorts Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete was an old college buddy from New Jersey who was in Los Angeles on 
business at precisely the wrong time. I brought him to the Super Bowl party at 
a friend's house in Redondo Beach. Pete was also a bit shy, so to ease his 
anxiety in a room filled with strangers, Pete stood in the middle of the room 
and smoked a rather hefty joint. By himself. He then beamed himself into the 
kitchen and drank many, many of the host's beers. 
</P>
<P>
 All by the second quarter of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Round about halftime, Pete noticed that the Pacific Ocean was just outside the 
door. He went for a walk on the beach. But unlike ordinary walks on the beach, 
which generally tend to proceed in a direction roughly parallel to the pounding 
surf, Pete -- who by now was introducing himself as a welder from Shreveport 
named Phillip -- pioneered a style of walking on the beach that was, well, 
perpendicular to the pounding surf. 
</P>
<P>
 He was briefly pummeled by the waves and returned moments later to the house 
with his shorts filled with sand, a large strand of kelp dangling from a 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have a little swim for yourself, Pete?" asked Steve, who did not know Pete at 
all but certainly recognized a target for ridicule when he saw one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe you got a halibut in there someplace," he said, thus labeling that 
Super Bowl forever. 
</P>
<P>
 My point here, I believe, is that for men, Super Bowls are once-a-year 
opportunities to do remarkably stupid things. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask any guy a question about, let's say, Super Bowl XXI. I don't mean who was 
the leading rusher and how many times did he carry the ball. I mean something 
like, "What two teams played in it?" -- and likely you'll get that same blank 
stare you get when you ask him why he still wears underwear that he bought 
during the Johnson Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, they just don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 But ask a guy to give you any outstanding Super Bowl memory, and watch his 
eyes light up as if he had just learned his mother-in-law will be cutting her 
visit short by a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Because in XXVII years, all of us men have stood -- well, slumped -- witness 
to at least one Super Bowl party incident that fell in that hard-to-define, 
gray area between felony and funny. Come to think of it, even the ones that 
might have been felonies were funny. 
</P>
<P>
 So to all the women who don't quite grasp this concept of men gathering in 
front of a TV set to watch people with no necks repeatedly ramming into each 
other as we drink beer, shout and stain your carpets with pepperoni pizza, be 
patient with us. Because we're not quite sure why we do it either. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you're lucky, none of us will sneak out the door at halftime and pee in 
your shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, you betcha' that's happened. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a guy thing.

BOWLED OVER -- AND UNDER; GAME XXVIII OFFERS SOME POSSIBILITIES THAT JUST DON'T

 Excuse my meager supply of testosterone, but I will not be watching the Super 
Bowl on Sunday. I have better things to do, like clean my toaster-oven tray. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Bowl is an event whose sole purpose, it seems, is to give the 
American male a legitimate reason to hurl pork rinds at a big-screen TV. 
</P>
<P>
 It is so perpetually boring that the National Football League resorts to Roman 
numerals to create an aura of importance. This is not Super Bowl 28. It is 
Super Bowl XXVIII -- as if deemed so by some papal edict: "Super Bowl XXVIII -- 
brought to you by Oldsmobile, Budweiser and John Paul II." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to say which is worse: the pregame show or the game itself. The 
pregame program will undoubtedly be hosted by a couple of overgrown men in 
suits speaking in the gravest of tones, as if they were temporarily excused 
from the United Nations Security Council to bring us this special report. 
</P>
<P>
 Their main function is to tell the viewers stuff they couldn't figure out for 
themselves, such as: "The key factor to this football game is going to be which 
of these two great football teams can get the most points up on the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Then they'll take an in-depth look at the nonfactors ("the weather figures to 
be a nonfactor in the football game due to the indoor venue") and the 
sub-factors. One analyst will announce that a team's third-string quarterback 
"sustained a laceration on his left thumb in a domestic accident earlier in the 
week." Next, they'll cut to a gray-haired medical expert who'll use a 
computer-generated diagram to explain just how the guy got a paper cut while 
opening a box of Cheerios. 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes the game -- basically four hours of billion-dollar motor-oil 
commercials with a few holding penalties mixed in. The outcome is usually 
decided so early on that, for the last 3 1/2 quarters, you're left with little 
to do but discern whether your tortilla chips form isosceles or obtuse angles. 
</P>
<P>
 My plans for the Super Bowl include a lot of things, but I can tell you that I 
will not be attending my friend Chris' Super Bowl party in Pasadena. This is 
partly because it will be an excruciatingly tedious affair and partly because I 
wasn't invited. 
</P>
<P>
 "No offense," Chris explained, "but it's really irritating to have people like 
you around. I'm not having a party for a social gathering or a political 
discussion. I'm having a party to watch a football game. Even if the Persian 
Gulf War started during the Super Bowl -- it's like, fine, we can discuss it at 
halftime." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris doesn't think much of the halftime show. "It's an insult to the 
intelligence of football fans," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 That's absurd. The halftime show is the only redeeming aspect of the Super 
Bowl -- particularly this year's version, which features hunky country 
superstar Clint Black. I trust that Clint will perform songs from his hit 
album, "Killing Time," which includes such appropriate lyrics as "killing 
time/it's killing me" and "the lights are on/but nobody's home." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't misunderstand. I don't want to see the Super Bowl abolished. I'm 
actually quite grateful for it. There are plenty of things a woman can do on 
Super Bowl Sunday that just aren't possible the rest of the year, like work out 
at the gym without some guy saying, "Hey, baby, let me be your StairMaster." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a great time to go to the supermarket. For once, guys won't clog up 
the aisles with their carts while they take half an hour to choose between the 
laundry detergent with "extra stain-fighting action" and the one with "extra 
cleaning and freshening power." 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't believe that I consider inspecting heads of lettuce more 
fascinating than watching the Super Bowl, drop by Vons around 4 o'clock on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll be the one tooling happily down aisle XIV.

AGO. SO HOW ARE THEY COPING WITH THEIR SEXUALITY? THE REALITY IS THAT WHILE

<P>
 A little latex never hurt anybody. Yet, despite the consequences, many teens 
still refuse to use condoms or any form of contraceptive when engaging in 
sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent survey of 587 students at Troy High School in Fullerton, 68% of 
those students who are sexually active said they use protection on an irregular 
basis or neglect to use it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 When Troy senior Steve (students are identified by first name only to protect 
their identities) engaged in unsafe sex, he allowed his emotions to override 
his good judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I would go to (my girlfriend's) house, I wouldn't take any condoms 
because we were coming closer and closer to having sex, and I thought that if I 
wasn't prepared I wouldn't have sex. That wasn't the case, though, and we ended 
up having sex and I just wasn't prepared," Steve said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been educated all my life, and I know what the consequences are. I think 
it was a stupid risk. I'm ashamed to say it, but if I had the same situation to 
live over under the same circumstances, I'd probably do the same thing over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for teens such as Steve who don't take precautions, there are 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2 million teens across the United States are infected annually with 
STDs, according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, in 1992 there were 1,199 new cases of sexually transmitted diseases 
among those age 10 to 19, according to the County of Orange Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the most feared sexually transmitted disease is AIDS. In Orange 
County, as of Dec. 31, 1993, seven males and two females age 13 to 19 have been 
diagnosed with AIDS. Both of the females and four of the males have died, 
according to the Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Another serious repercussion is teen pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County in 1992, 51,623 babies were born -- 4,781 of those were to 
teen mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1990, there were 377 pregnancies reported among 7,336 young women age 
15 to 19 in the Fullerton Joint Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy senior Susan became part of those statistics and learned firsthand the 
effects of unsafe sex when she got pregnant her freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes my boyfriend and I would use a condom; sometimes we didn't, and I 
know it was one of the times we didn't that I got pregnant. My mom always told 
me that if I ever got intimate with my boyfriend to come to her and she would 
give me condoms. But when you're having sex, it's not like you're thinking 
about it. Until you skip a period, you don't think about what could happen to 
you," Susan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got pregnant it had nothing to do with (inadequate) information. I'd 
heard it from my mom and from school. It's in the back of everyone's mind, I 
know it is, that little voice saying, 'I know I shouldn't be doing this,' but 
they all think 'it can't happen to me.' You can only harp on someone so long 
before they'll tune you out." 
</P>
<P>
 Modifying sexual practices will require sex educators to do more than inform 
students about the consequences of unsafe sex, Troy health instructor Bill 
Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think nationwide, health educators are trying to come up with a curriculum 
that would be best suited to help in the area of behavioral change. By now we 
should have seen a significant drop in the number of unwanted pregnancies and 
STDs in our society, but that's not the case," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian McMichael, community educator for Planned Parenthood of Orange and San 
Bernardino counties, said there are, basically, four components that determine 
how responsibly a person will behave sexually, and knowledge is just one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, you need to know the facts: 'How do I catch an STD; how don't I?' The 
other component is skill. There are two kinds of skills, technical skills, like 
how to roll down a condom without rupturing it or spilling the contents. You 
also need to have social skills to bring up the issue (of using protection)," 
McMichael said. "Self-esteem is another one: If you don't have good 
self-esteem, you won't stand your ground when you're confronting your partner. 
The last is community, and not just the PTA, but peer support. What do we call 
guys who don't have sex very much? What do we call a woman? The truth is we 
insult them. We don't pat ourselves on the back for taking care of ourselves," 
McMichael said. 
</P>
<P>
 Society, ultimately, has the biggest influence on teen-agers' conduct, and 
education alone cannot reverse its effects, McMichael said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you combat the hours and hours of sex, with all the allure and power 
as it's portrayed on TV, with an average of 555 minutes of sex education?"

<P>
 Why are so many teen-agers having sex? The question seems to come up time and 
time again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mainly peer pressure," said Fullerton High School sophomore Brandon 
Jette. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases of sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancies among teens in the 
county have been increasing. In 1992, there were 4,781 births to teen mothers 
and nearly 1,200 cases of STDs recorded among those 10 to 19, according to the 
County of Orange Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics give only part of the answer. There is confusion among teen-agers 
in making decisions about sex. 
</P>
<P>
 So what should a teen do? Although there is no definitive answer, Jette 
offered this assessment: "Stop necessitating the need to do it just to be 
accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 Many psychologists say the growth in the number of sexually transmitted 
diseases might deter the practice of multiple partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Also entering the debate is whether sex education should be taught at home or 
in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton High senior William Ovando said, "It's got to begin at home, because 
it's more personal, and who knows you better than your parents?" 
</P>
<P>
 However, another senior said, "It should start at school because many parents 
don't know much about sex and are uncomfortable talking about it with their 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the differences of opinion, most say sex education is important 
because of the sexual activity and its risks. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest risks is teen-age pregnancy. A Fullerton High School 
graduate who became pregnant while still in school said: "I was really scared 
and confused, and I didn't know what to do. My life changed dramatically, and 
my dreams were broken. It was the worst experience of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 If they found themselves pregnant, a majority of Fullerton High School female 
students interviewed said that they would have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have an abortion because I wouldn't give birth to a child I couldn't 
take care of," said a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Most male students said they didn't know what they would do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would face up to the consequences of my actions and do everything in my 
capacity to help raise the child," a male junior said. 
</P>
<P>
 Practicing abstinence is one method to prevent pregnancy and avoid sexually 
transmitted disease. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a recent survey of 276 Fullerton High students showed that 63% felt 
it was acceptable to have sex before marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although birth control pills are very effective as a contraceptive, they 
cannot protect someone from contracting an STD. 
</P>
<P>
 "A latex condom, only if it is used properly, is one of the best ways to do 
so," said a UCI medical student who recently presented a program on AIDS at 
Fullerton High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this, many suggest that condoms should be distributed in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Condoms should be available in schools because teen-agers are going to (have 
sex) anyway, and a lot of teens aren't responsible enough to go out and buy 
protection for themselves, mostly because they're embarrassed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton High counselor Tammy Messineo said, "Both people need to be 
responsible and willing to accept the consequences for their behavior. Safe sex 
is important."

<P>
 One-third of 276 students at Fullerton High School surveyed by the campus 
newspaper, the Pleiades, said they have had sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey respondents were divided equally among four class levels.The 
seniors responding to the survey, conducted in November, reported the highest 
rate of sexual intercourse, 56%. The sophomores had the lowest rate, 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly two-thirds of students surveyed said they don't feel it is wrong to 
have sexual intercourse before marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sixty-eight percent of students said the distribution of condoms and related 
information is appropriate in high schools.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sixty-two percent said health and related classes at the school do not 
thoroughly cover teen sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 * A majority of students surveyed felt that education on teen pregnancy and 
birth control, AIDS and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases should 
be emphasized more in classes. 
</P>

COMMENTARY; THE QUESTION SHOULD BE: CAN L.A. HELP HEAL THE ARTS?; CULTURE: A 
PUBLIC FORUM SCHEDULED FOR TODAY HAS CONFUSED THE ISSUE, MISTAKENLY PROMOTING 
THE IDEA OF ART AS SOCIAL THERAPY.

<P>
 Today at noon, Club 100 of the Music Center and the Town Hall of Los Angeles 
will jointly host a distinguished panel of local politicians and arts 
administrators to discuss an oft-heard subject: Can the arts help to heal L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
 The panel was put together long before last week's earthquake. It's safe to 
say the immediate wound in need of healing is riot-related, although other 
urban ills, such as homelessness or gang violence, could easily be included. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as is so often the case with such issue-oriented presentations, the 
question is actually rhetorical. Its answer has been decided well in advance, 
and the answer is yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Club 100 President Genevieve McSweeney observes in the press release 
announcing today's event: "The Music Center, along with the other arts 
organizations in the city, is examining how the arts can be utilized to help 
solve some of the many problems facing our community." So today's panel of 
experts will be expected to tell us how, not whether, the arts can help to heal 
riot- and recession-torn L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 That's too bad. Far more consequential would be a prominent public forum in 
which to vigorously dispute such entrenched claims, which conceive of art as a 
species of social therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Our therapeutic culture, which has made an industry of ravenously diagnosing 
endless social illnesses and recommending innumerable cures, is now swallowing 
the arts whole. It's time to reconsider, not to reconfirm, because the notion 
of art healing civic sicknesses is finally rather like the idea of Miss America 
bringing world peace. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a nice sentiment, and we've learned to expect to hear it touted. But, in 
the end, who can really believe it? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not talking here about the economic impact the arts can have on a 
community, which is huge. Currently, the city's Cultural Affairs Department and 
the service organization, ARTS Inc., are contemplating a study of that 
multibillion-dollar impact locally -- a long-overdue sequel to the one 
undertaken by the L.A. Area Chamber of Commerce in the wake of the 1984 Olympic 
Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 I am talking about the impact art itself has on a community. Back-handedly, 
the distasteful imposition of a therapeutic ideal implies that art is not of 
much significance unless it can be put to demonstrable economic or social use. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Sistine Ceiling really most important because it's a boon to Italian 
tourism? Or because its presence in the Vatican brings diverse audiences 
together in one place? Is that what Michelangelo had in mind when he began to 
paint? 
</P>
<P>
 From the therapeutic angle, the persuasive excitement of the Sistine Ceiling's 
beauty, which is the source of its artistic significance, doesn't count for 
much. Beauty and significance are qualities more subtly demanding and harder to 
codify than tourist receipts or the interaction of crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, gnawing discomfort with the way that truly powerful art makes urgent 
demands on its audience might be exactly what causes some people to want to 
transform it into therapy. After all, one hallmark of therapeutic culture is 
that it turns the tables: Rather than art making demands on an audience, now 
the audience gets to make demands on art. No wonder the art that results 
typically seems powerless and wan. 
</P>
<P>
 The therapeutic ideal for art is not new. Its local application to pressing 
civic problems updates an old riff: Remember all the grand claims once made for 
art as international diplomacy, claims born of the Cold War era? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the perceived crisis was a threat of nuclear war. Under cover of 
diplomacy, government agencies such as the U.S. Information Agency and 
entrepreneurial businessmen such as Armand Hammer put art at the service of 
their political and business aims. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much has changed. Art still rides in the back of the bus: Note that no 
member of today's distinguished panel at the Music Center is an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be two politicians (County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and 
City Councilman Joel Wachs), two civic bureaucrats (County Music and Performing 
Arts Commission President Eunice David and Cultural Affairs Department grants 
director Roelle Hsieh Louie), and three institutional administrators (Cal Arts 
President Steven D. Lavine, County Museum of Art curator Stephanie Barron and 
Music Center President Shelton g. Stanfill). Among them are gifted, insightful 
and articulate individuals. But they are not artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The question "How can the arts help to heal Los Angeles?" is heard most often 
from institutional representatives because, when a city is in crisis, 
bureaucracies always hunker down for self-preservation. Surrounded by daunting 
social and economic problems, they funnel arts resources toward proposed social 
and economic solutions. Public and private programs get designed to urge 
artists to follow the institutional initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, trying to get artists to follow institutional directives is precisely 
backward. Some artists do it -- eagerly -- knowing that's where the 
always-scarce funding lies. But it's backward nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is its influence benign. A primary public focus on managing art's 
impact just contributes to an erroneous perception that art, in its own right, 
is worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in this critical time it's the arts institutions that should be 
actively getting behind artists and what they do, not the other way around. 
Art's authentic power comes from the pleasure and excitement created in the 
beholder. Institutions can't cause that, only talented artists can. Yet 
therapeutic culture usurps the role of assigning art's power by claiming it for 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 So rather than inquiring, "Can the arts help to heal Los Angeles?," today's 
panel might be better equipped to reverse the issue: Can Los Angeles, including 
its civic and private institutions, help to heal the arts? For the arts are 
suffering as they generally do in American life, from trivialization and 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting an affirmative answer to that more apposite question would require 
clear-eyed conviction, because there's only one way our institutions can 
accomplish the task. It's not so mysterious: If arts agencies in L.A. would 
compose their programs in rigorous support of the diverse range of great art 
that first-rate artists already make, the troubled and fractured cultural life 
of Los Angeles would be on its way to healing quite nicely.

'BIRDLAND' PAIR UNRUFFLED BY IT ALL; ENTERTAINMENT: EXECUTIVES WALTER F. PARKES 
AND LAURIE MACDONALD ARE GETTING READY TO TAKE OVER AT SPIELBERG'S AMBLIN, BUT 
SAY, 'WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the new ABC series "Birdland," beleaguered doctors and staff members at a 
hospital psychiatric ward have their hands full dealing with patients whose 
lives have tipped off-center. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the full hands of two of the show's executive producers -- Walter 
F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald -- one might suspect that they may be going a 
bit cuckoo themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the heavy workload of overseeing "Birdland," which airs 
Wednesdays at 10 p.m., Parkes and MacDonald are also rushing to complete 
several movie projects for their production company before they head off in May 
to face perhaps the most heady challenge of all: becoming president and 
executive vice president, respectively, of Amblin Entertainment, Steven 
Spielberg's production company and one of the most prestigious entities in the 
movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the announcement of the appointment by Spielberg last November, Parkes' 
and MacDonald's phones have been ringing off the hook with calls from stars, 
producers and writers, about either "Birdland" or various Amblin projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Birdland" and all the phone calls had to take a back seat one recent 
Friday evening as Parkes and MacDonald, who are married, settled into their 
Santa Monica home for the weekend. More important matters were at hand: Their 
5-year-old daughter, Jane, was preparing for her first ballet lesson, and it 
was unclear whether MacDonald or the housekeeper was going to take her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take her," MacDonald finally decided. "She's been looking forward to me 
doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 "See, these are the really important things," Parkes said to a visitor, 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the overflowing schedules and the crunching deadlines, Parkes and 
MacDonald said, they are managing to keep their heads above water, taking it 
one day at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real exciting time, but we can't afford to get ahead of ourselves," 
MacDonald said. "Right now, our focus is really on 'Birdland.' We can't afford 
to think about too much else right now. We had no idea how much work a 
television series would be. Working in movies pales to the rigors of this." 
</P>
<P>
 "Birdland," which Parkes created with Scott Frank, also an executive producer, 
is the first foray into television for the couple, who are motion picture 
veterans. Among the films Parkes has helped write or produce are "WarGames," 
"Awakenings," "Sneakers," "Project X" and "True Believer." MacDonald is a 
former vice president of production for Columbia Pictures. At their own 
company, Aeriel Pictures, they are working on several movies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been warned that working on a television series would be 
all-encompassing," Parkes said. "We didn't believe those folks. We thought we 
would be the one exception -- that we would be able to handle the series and 
everything else. But it has not worked out that way. There's a tremendous 
amount of work to do with writing and post-production, and the series has just 
swallowed us." 
</P>
<P>
 The one-hour drama, which made its debut Jan. 5, stars Brian Dennehy as a 
psychiatrist who's much more adept at treating his troubled patients than he is 
in dealing with his personal life. The series has more than a few similarities 
to "Awakenings," which revolved around a shy research doctor and his 
involvement with patients in a chronic-care psychiatric hospital ward. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC picked up the show for seven episodes as a midseason replacement. Should 
"Birdland" be renewed for next season, Parkes and MacDonald will work on the 
show as "non-executive producers," they said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running a show like this and dealing with the strong personal responsibility 
was a real good experience for us to have before going to Amblin," MacDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Horton, who directed the first two episodes of "Birdland," said: "Walter 
and Laurie were surprisingly devoted to the show. After the Amblin 
announcement, I had assumed that would be the last we'd see of them. But they 
wound up carrying the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Some eyebrows in the industry were raised when Spielberg chose Parkes and 
MacDonald to take over the reins at Amblin. Producer Mark Johnson had been 
mentioned most often as the top candidate for the position. In addition, Parkes 
and MacDonald are known mainly for their creative output, not for running a 
large entertainment entity. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkes and MacDonald said they see the appointment as a natural extension of 
their personal and professional relationship with Spielberg, who will remain at 
Amblin as chief executive officer and owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've known him for years," Parkes said. "We share the same sensibility. 
There's a great comfort level between him and us. We have the same orientation 
toward scripts and writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Parkes said he and Spielberg had talked about the difficulty of running a 
large company. "Laurie and I are creative people, and I said that if this is 
just about administration over Amblin, there are better people for that job. 
But he was for the idea of bringing our creative engine on board. There will be 
the same room for the continuation of our creative passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are getting ready for their move to Amblin, they are not yet 
involved with specific projects. The future may be unknown, but Parkes said 
Spielberg "has been taking Amblin in another direction. There's obviously the 
identification with broad-based family entertainment that will still be the 
basis for Amblin. But the success has earned us the right to do other sorts of 
pictures, such as 'Schindler's List.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But all that will come later. Right now, Parkes and MacDonald said they're 
flying high on "Birdland" -- and, of course, the excitement of the ballet 
lessons.

NETWORKS SLOW TO AIR CONDOM ADS; TELEVISION: DESPITE AGREEMENTS TO BROADCAST 
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS ADVOCATING USE OF CONDOMS TO CURB THE SPREAD OF 
AIDS, THERE'S RETICENCE ABOUT AIRING SPOTS DURING PRIME TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Federal health officials made front-page news this month with the unveiling of 
a new series of TV commercials that for the first time frankly advocate the use 
of latex condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was significant because the government said all four major 
commercial broadcast networks had agreed to air the public-service spots, which 
are aimed at people from 18 to 25, who are considered a high-risk group for 
sexually transmitted diseases. ABC, CBS and NBC -- fearful of criticism that 
they might be promoting sexual promiscuity -- have not accepted paid 
commercials for condoms, and Fox only recently lifted its ban on such ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet three weeks later, only ABC has aired any of the government-sponsored 
condom commercials. Executives at CBS, NBC and Fox told The Times that they 
still plan to run the spots, but didn't know when they would begin. 
</P>
<P>
 And all four networks said they will be restricting the broadcast times -- in 
many cases until after 11 p.m. -- to reduce the chances of children seeing the 
ads, which also promote abstinence as a means of avoiding AIDS. ABC has been 
showing them several times a week in what it describes as adult-oriented 
programs at 9:30 p.m., 10 p.m. and after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not some dark conspiracy among the networks not to run the 
government's PSAs (public-service announcements)," said Fox spokesman Jeff 
DeRome. "We were moved by this campaign, and we intend to support it, as we 
have run other spots on AIDS. It's just that it is one of literally hundreds of 
spots competing for PSA air time." 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Zonana, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, which developed the ad campaign with the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, said the agency was not discouraged by the delay in airing the 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have commitments from the networks that they will include the spots in 
their regular PSA inventory," he explained. "This campaign has broken the 
silence on the use of condoms (on TV). It's such a giant step that it's going 
to make it easier for subsequent campaigns" aimed at reducing AIDS and other 
sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Roy Schwarz, senior vice president for medical education and science 
at the American Medical Assn., criticized the networks for delaying the ads and 
for restricting most of the air time to late at night, when fewer people are 
watching television. 
</P>
<P>
 "These ads aren't doing anybody any good as long as they don't appear on 
television," he said. "A lot of money and creativity was put into making the 
ads, and they carry a very important health message." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the scheduling, Schwarz said, "I can understand not wanting to offend 
people with children watching, but I don't see why some of these PSAs cannot be 
run in prime time. Young people 18 to 25 are among the most vulnerable to AIDS 
today. It seems to me that, if you're going to reach them via TV, you ought to 
reach them when they're watching, in prime time." 
</P>
<P>
 The networks argue that they can reach the target audience later at night 
without exposing youngsters to the ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are likely to air them after 11:30 p.m. and at 10:58 p.m.," said Rosalin 
Weinman, vice president of standards and practices at NBC. "There are some 
affiliates who are not comfortable with running condom PSAs at an earlier time 
period, and they've told us so." 
</P>
<P>
 The networks apparently do not see any contradiction between their policy on 
these ads and their willingness to deal with sexual themes in programs and 
commercials that air during the first hour of prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcast executives say that they have previously run other AIDS 
public-service announcements that mention the use of condoms, and they say that 
the government's new campaign, however important, is one of numerous worthy 
causes competing for public-service time.  
</P>
<P>
 One network source suggested that economics had something to do with the 
government's condom ads being largely consigned to late-night time slots.  
</P>
<P>
 "A message such as this one about condom use needs repeated exposure to get 
through the media clutter," the source said. "But it's one of many messages 
from many organizations competing for PSA time, and you're just not likely to 
see a network run a PSA in one of its hit sitcoms because the commercial time 
is considered too valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a lot of time for PSAs in prime time," acknowledged Beth Waxman 
Bressan, the vice president in charge of program practices at CBS. But she 
rejected the suggestion that the network was wary of the AIDS issue, noting 
that CBS has been running other, more general public-service announcements 
about AIDS awareness during 8 p.m. shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to schedule the (government's PSAs) at a time when they will reach 
their target audience," Bressan said. "We are committed to running them when we 
have available PSA inventory, and we plan to run them in late-night and news 
programming." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to its competitors, ABC lost no time in getting the government ads 
on the air. The first one ran during an episode of "NYPD Blue" on Jan. 4, the 
day the AIDS-education campaign was announced by Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made a commitment to run these ads because we believe that AIDS is an 
important topic," said Janice Gretemeyer, spokeswoman for Capital Cities/ABC. 
But the network does not plan to run the spots during "Roseanne," "Home 
Improvement" or other sitcoms, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "These ads are not aimed at children -- they're aimed at young people -- and 
we do not believe it's appropriate to run them during our family sitcoms," 
Gretemeyer said. "We think we can reach the target audience with other shows."

ACADEMY REVERSES DECISION TO DROP AWARDS FOR SHORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Closing the door on a controversy that erupted more than a year ago, leaders 
of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have decided to continue 
awarding Oscars for short live-action films and short documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy's Board of Governors voted unanimously in favor of both categories 
late Tuesday night after a brief discussion. The vote reversed a November, 
1992, decision to drop shorts, made on the grounds that these films "have long 
since ceased to reflect the realities of theatrical motion picture exhibition." 
</P>
<P>
 Further study of the matter, however, persuaded the board that although films 
30 minutes or shorter are rarely seen in theaters, "they are staging a 
resurgence in new non-traditional venues," Academy President Arthur Hiller said 
in a prepared statement. In addition to being screened at theme parks and major 
expositions, short films are also being shown in special theaters devoted to 
formats such as IMAX, Cinetropolis and Showscan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board clearly felt that all of these sites fall within the Academy's 
'theatrical film' province," Hiller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's vote came in response to an 88-page report prepared by Heather 
Lindquist, a professional researcher hired by the Academy in response to the 
outcry last year against the board's original vote. Among those protesting the 
decision to eliminate the two categories were some of the industry's biggest 
luminaries, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas among them. Supporters said short 
films deserved recognition as a vital cinematic form, one that often serves as 
a laboratory for experimenting with new techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught off-guard by the fervor over short films, the board, in what was widely 
interpreted as a face-saving move, voted a month later to suspend its decision 
for another year while the matter was researched. A seven-member board 
committee recommended retaining the awards based on the data Lindquist 
collected over a five-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Saul Bass, a 1968 Oscar winner for his short documentary "Why Man 
Creates," and a leader in the fight in favor of the short forms, said he was 
proud of the board's willingness to admit its error. "It is to the credit of 
the board that, having made a decision that was flawed, it had the maturity and 
objectivity to re-examine it and rectify it," he said.

O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: NEDERLANDER MAKES INSIDE MOVE, TO ANAHEIM ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 11 often troublesome and seldom profitable years of promoting pop 
concerts under the stars at the Pacific Amphitheatre, the Nederlander 
Organization will try its luck indoors as the newly appointed exclusive concert 
promoter at the Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Nederlander and Ogden Entertainment Services, the arena's co-owner and 
operator, announced the agreement but would not divulge the terms of the 
contract that they hope will bring 25 pop shows to the arena in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 No new shows have been announced yet. A Luther Vandross concert at the arena 
Jan. 13 was the first staged under the exclusivity agreement; a Feb. 5 rock 
show by Rush and Candlebox was booked before the Nederlander contract took 
effect and is being promoted by Nederlander's rival, Avalon Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Rosenbluth, a Nederlander executive, said the exclusivity contract is a 
multiple-year agreement and calls for Nederlander to pay an undisclosed minimum 
guaranteed rent to the arena regardless of the number of shows staged. Also, 
Nederlander will pay all costs for ushers, stagehands, security staff and other 
concert-related personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the arena, which opened last June with a concert by Barry Manilow, 
had been open to any promoter who wanted to rent the facility for a show. Now, 
outside promoters who want to bring acts into the arena will have to get 
Nederlander's approval and probably include Nederlander as a co-promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of having an exclusive promoter, Rosenbluth said, is that "the 
building then has an advocate who goes out and tries really hard to bring 
business to the building. It's almost like Ogden having a new division that 
knows a lot about concerts and can take risks independently to bring a lot of 
concerts into the venue." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement gives a renewed foothold in the potentially lucrative Orange 
County concert market to Nederlander, a major, nationwide theatrical company. 
</P>
<P>
 Nederlander sold its interest in the open-air Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa 
Mesa last year after absorbing losses that one of its principals termed 
"horrendous." Nederlander also incurred neighbors' wrath -- and a series of 
lawsuits -- over concert noise at the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Mayne, the Anaheim Arena's general manager, said Tuesday that having 
Nederlander as in-house promoter figures to improve the new building's 
prospects as a concert venue after a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage, he said, will be Nederlander's ability to make package booking 
deals in which acts that play at the Nederlander-operated Greek Theatre in Los 
Angeles will come to Anaheim as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having Nederlander on board will strengthen our concerts," Mayne said. "We 
had six concerts in our first six months, and now we hope to have 25 in the 
next 12." 
</P>
<P>
 Most major arenas do not have exclusive promoters, said Gary Bongiovanni, 
editor of Poll Star magazine, a widely read concert-industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden, for instance, also operates the Forum in Inglewood, where any promoter 
can rent the building. The Forum already had longstanding relationships with 
various promoters before Ogden took over the building six years ago, Mayne 
said, and Ogden decided not to tinker with a system that worked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Arena is expected to operate at a loss early on. Reaching the 
25-concert goal could help reduce the amount of red ink in the short run, Mayne 
said. Only after the arena yields a profit will Ogden's partner in the 
building, the city of Anaheim, receive a share of the money from concerts or 
any other arena events. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of 25 concerts per year is fairly modest by Orange County big-venue 
standards. From 1988 to 1992, the Pacific Amphitheatre averaged 37 shows a year 
and Irvine Meadows 39. In 1993, a variety of circumstances, including 
Nederlander's sale of the Pacific, resulted in a weak season (41 shows 
combined) that most observers believe was an anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nederlander, through one of its principals, Neil Papiano, was involved in the 
planning of the Anaheim Arena well before construction began. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point (Nederlander) was supposed to be partners in the arena, but 
along the way Ogden took over the whole private part of the project," Mayne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Nicoletti, an arena spokesman, said that Nederlander was not named as 
exclusive promoter from the start because "it took some time . . . to agree to 
the exact specifics of the contracts. But ever since the arena was first 
conceived in November, 1990, it was known that Nederlander would be an integral 
part of the building." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayne said that Ogden also had "some preliminary discussions" with 
Nederlander's Southland concert rival, Avalon Attractions. The idea of having 
Nederlander, Avalon and Ogden join forces to promote shows at the arena was 
discussed, Mayne said, but it did not go far. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that it is established at the arena, Nederlander will resume its 
longstanding Orange County rivalry with Avalon, the Encino-based concert 
company that promotes shows at Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Amphitheatre also could be a competitor: Its owner, the Orange 
County Fair, intends to seek a new operator to run concerts there, although in 
a scaled-down, 8,000- to 9,000-seat format designed to keep concert noise under 
control.

ARENA NAMED BEST NEW CONCERT VENUE

<P>
 The readers of Poll Star magazine, a trade publication widely read in the 
concert industry, have named the Anaheim Arena the best new concert venue to 
open in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the Fresno-based magazine, said that the arena won 
out over four other nominees, including the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in 
San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a coup for us," said arena spokesman John Nicoletti. "It's 
nice to know we're thought of as a major player among all the new venues around 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Poll Star draws its national readership from the ranks of concert promoters, 
artist managers, booking agents, record company staffers and building managers. 
</P>

 The award, a plexiglass plaque, was conferred at ceremonies Monday night at 
the Paramount in New York City. MIKE BOEHM

SUMMERS COULD BE COLD INDOORS FOR NEDERLANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Operating indoors at the Anaheim Arena, the Nederlander Organization will be a 
decided underdog promoting pop concerts during the long Southern California 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Concert-industry observers say that most major-venue touring acts prefer to 
play in the summer and route their tours through the outdoor amphitheaters, or 
"sheds," that have proliferated across the country over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoor facilities also have built-in cost advantages. The sheds don't have to 
be heated or cooled. They require fewer ushers because they have fewer aisles 
to supervise, and they save on labor costs because stages and floor seating 
don't have to be installed, then removed, for each event, as they do in arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the outdoor concert season has begun as early as the first 
week of March and ended as late as mid-November, a span of 8 1/2 months. The 
Forum in Inglewood staged 22 rock and pop concerts during 1993, and all but 
five took place in January, February, March, November and December, when the 
outdoor competition was hibernating or just thawing out. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the trends we've seen in recent years is more and more artists playing 
outdoor amphitheaters and compressing more of their touring schedules into 
warmer months," said Gary Bongiovanni, editor of Poll Star, a Fresno-based 
concert-industry trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think arena managers would tell you their concert business has been down 
over the last few years as more amphitheaters open up around the country," 
Bongiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Geddes, managing partner of Irvine Meadows and co-owner of Avalon 
Attractions, sees no reason why Orange County should not fit the rule that 
favors outdoor venues during the warmer months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (indoor shows) don't work anywhere else in the country (during those 
months), I don't know why it should work in Anaheim," he said. "Most artists 
and consumers would rather be outdoors in the summertime, especially in 
Southern California. We'd love to book shows in the summer at the Forum, but it 
just doesn't work. The (performers') thrust is toward outdoor facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nederlander executive Susan Rosenbluth said that the Anaheim Arena will 
nevertheless bid to land a fair share of the warm-weather attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be on it regardless whether it's winter or summer," she said. "We're 
going to do our darndest to even up those odds as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Acts whose audiences prefer reserved seats to lawn seating (typically ones 
with fans in their mid-20s and up) could opt for an indoor show, she said. 
Irvine Meadows has a capacity of 15,000, of which 10,500 is fixed seating and 
the rest lawn seating. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Arena's capacity will vary, depending on the size and location of 
the stage set. The largest configuration, 19,200, is for in-the-round shows 
that are relatively rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbluth said that for the more common setup, in which the stage is at the 
arena's east end, the capacity will be about 16,600 if seats are sold behind 
the stage, and 11,200 or 13,000 if seats with blocked sight lines are left 
empty. MIKE BOEHM and RICHARD CROMELIN

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; 23 FIREFIGHTING RECRUITS TO GRADUATE SATURDAY 
</P>

<P>
 After suffering two years of budget cuts and a recent controversy over alleged 
nepotism in hiring practices, the Fire Department will have something to 
celebrate this weekend as it welcomes 23 recruits into its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 The four women and 19 men who graduate from the department's Recruit Academy 
on Saturday are the first new class since November, 1990.Hard economic times 
have stalled hiring since then. 
</P>
<P>
 The class, which trained for 11 weeks, started out under a cloud of 
controversy after complaints that nearly one-third of those chosen for the 
coveted academy slots were related to firefighters or city officials. As a 
result, five of the original seven recruits in question were dropped from the 
academy roster.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 people are expected to turn out for the ceremonies at the 
academy, 2249 Argonne Ave., and to watch the 23 new firefighters put out a 
controlled fire. The city's new fire chief, Harold Omel Jr., will preside.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: PARAMOUNT; COUNCIL MAY ADD EXTRA YEAR TO TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Paramount City Council may tack on a year to their four-year 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity exists because the Legislature moved the date of California's 
presidential primary from June to March, which will crowd the April date of 
some municipal elections.State lawmakers added a provision allowing local 
governments to change their municipal election dates so that residents would 
not have to go to the polls twice within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount council members are considering an ordinance that would delay their 
elections by a full year so that the local elections would not be in the same 
year as the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ordinance passes, council members Esther Corona Caldwell and Gerald A. 
Mulrooney will serve until 1997 instead of 1996. And whoever wins the three 
seats in this April's election will serve until 1999 instead of 1998. Mayor 
Manuel E. Guillen, Vice Mayor Elvira Oropeza and Councilman Henry Harkema 
currently hold those seats and are seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to vote on the new election dates at its meeting 
Tuesday. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: WHITTIER; 2 UPSCALE POOL HALLS GIVEN CITY APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whittier officials have rolled out the carpet for a couple of classy billiard 
parlors to try to drum up business in the Uptown area and at the city's major 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The city recently approved proposals for two upscale pool halls, Q's Billiard 
Club in the historic Uptown business district, and Paradise Billiards Cafe in 
the Wittwood Mall.The two establishments will have restaurants, dress codes and 
-- of course -- bouncers. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials don't want just any pool-hall operator making inroads into the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council nixed the Village Break, a proposed pool hall that would have 
offered more pool than dining. And last week it declared a temporary ban on 
more pool halls -- any business that has two or more pool tables. City 
officials said they are concerned that pool halls may attract unsavory 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fads are wonderful, but we want to be very cautious about this," Mayor Bob 
Henderson said. "You don't want to see a situation where you suddenly get eight 
or nine of these pool halls in every little storefront operation." PSYCHE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: CERRITOS; CITY TO PAY MORE FOR SCHOOL GYM EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has agreed to pay an additional $524,000 to expand the Cerritos High 
School gymnasium for use by students and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The city previously agreed to provide $2 million for the expansion, which 
would double the size of the gymnasium by adding a second regulation-size 
basketball court.The lowest bid on the project, however, was about $2.5 
million. Officials will draw the additional money from the city's reserve fund, 
said Mayor John Crawley. ABC Unified School District will provide maintenance 
and upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district will use the enlarged gym on school days until 5:15 p.m., 
when the city will take over until 10 p.m. On non-school days and in the 
summer, the city will be able to use the gym from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to begin in about three weeks and to be completed in 
about a year. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LYNWOOD; COUNCIL VOTES TO RENEW CONTRACT WITH SHERIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to extend its law enforcement contract with the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, scrapping an earlier proposal that the 
city join forces with the South Gate Police Department.  
</P>
<P>
 The new contract will run through 1998, city officials said.The city currently 
pays the Sheriff's Department $4.8 million per year to patrol the city. Last 
fall, city officials had considered a joint operating agreement with the 
93-officer South Gate Police Department, which they said could have saved the 
city millions of dollars. In return, Lynwood would have provided fire services 
to South Gate, which has a contract with the county Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was scuttled, however, when officials in both cities found that the 
services swap would be more difficult than originally thought. "It got very 
complicated," Lynwood City Manager Faustin Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies replaced the Lynwood Police Department in 1977 and the 
station has been at the center of recent controversy, including allegations 
that some of its deputies were members of a racist gang. In 1992, a special 
investigation found evidence that some deputies had used excessive force but 
praised former Cmdr. Bert Cueva for cracking down on the problems. JILL

CITY SEEKS COMPROMISE WITH STATE PANEL ON BEACH CURFEW; REGULATION: THREAT OF 
CRIME PROMPTS LONG BEACH OFFICIALS TO HOLD NEGOTIATIONS WITH COASTAL 
COMMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach officials, armed with a lawsuit asserting the city's right to 
impose a beach curfew to deter crime, will meet today with California Coastal 
Commission staff members to try to iron out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission has told the city that it violated state law 
guaranteeing public access to the coastline when it imposed a beach curfew 
starting at 10 p.m. instead of midnight. The city must return to the old 
curfew, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Long Beach balked, filing the lawsuit earlier this month. Councilman 
Douglas S. Drummond, who is leading the Long Beach delegation today, says the 
Coastal Commission is interfering with the city's ability to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission apparently is willing to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in nobody's best interest to spend tax dollars on a lawsuit or fight 
this thing out in court," said Peter Douglas, the commission's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas said the Long Beach curfew is too broad. If city officials can show 
there is a crime problem at a specific beach, then perhaps the commission will 
allow the city to impose an early curfew at that beach for a limited time, he 
said. But a blanket curfew would violate the Coastal Act, which guards public 
access to the coastline, Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be difficult for Long Beach officials to persuade the commission that 
an earlier curfew is needed, however. Police say they do not keep separate 
statistics for beach crimes, and have no evidence of an increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond won council support for the early curfew last June, shortly after a 
young man was shot and killed in Belmont Shore near the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 William Shadden, 26, was shot at La Verne Avenue and Ocean Boulevard as he 
headed home from work after 11 p.m. on Memorial Day. He was scuffling with two 
teen-agers who allegedly wanted to steal his bicycle. Two youths are in 
custody. The alleged triggerman, 16, faces a murder trial as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond appealed to his colleagues to tighten beach and parking lot 
restrictions, saying undesirables were loitering there and contributing to the 
city's crime problem. The Belmont Shore Improvement Assn. and other homeowners 
groups supported the restrictions, which the council approved in June. 
</P>
<P>
 When Coastal Commission officials learned of Long Beach's action, they 
instructed city officials to appear before the commission for a permit. The 
commission told Long Beach last month that the new curfew -- and even the 
city's decades-old midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew -- violated the state Coastal Act 
guarding public access to the seaside. The commission approved some parking lot 
restrictions, including closing lots at the end of Alamitos and Junipero 
avenues from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 After Long Beach officials protested the curfew decision, the commission staff 
said the city could keep the old curfew of midnight to 5 a.m. because it was 
enacted in the 1950s, before the Coastal Act existed. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said they want to keep the tougher curfew, and filed the 
lawsuit in Long Beach Superior Court. It asserts that a city's right to protect 
its citizens against crime supersedes the authority of the Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will not press for a hearing until after negotiations with Coastal 
Commission officials, Assistant City Atty. Robert E. Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has enforced the parking lot restrictions, but has not enforced the 
early curfew, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Southern California cities that have beach curfews are in an uproar as 
well over the Coastal Commission's position. Some cities recently imposed more 
stringent curfews because of crime and budgetary constraints. It takes fewer 
police to monitor a closed beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Orange County cities, backed by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach), have joined Long Beach in trying to persuade the Coastal Commission to 
relent. Bergeson and representatives of Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport 
Beach and other Orange County cities are to meet Friday with the commission 
staff.

ABUSE ACCUSATIONS, CRITICISM OF CURRICULUM SWIRL AT CHRYSALIS SCHOOL; 
EDUCATION: ENROLLMENT HAS PLUNGED AT GIRLS' ACADEMY AFER PARENTS HOLD MEETINGS. 
DESPITE SETBACKS, FOUNDER JULIA MARGAUX SAYS SHE WILL NOT CLOSE THE CAMPUS.

<P>
 Kristina Czech thought she found an elementary heaven when she first brought 
her 7-year-old daughter to the Chrysalis School for Girls in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the hurly-burly of public schools, Czech saw small classrooms of 
neatly uniformed children. And there were only girls -- girls who wouldn't be 
overlooked in favor of boys, she thought.  
</P>
<P>
 There was a feeling of family among the school's students, parents and founder 
Julia Margaux, parents said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school that began with high hopes just 16 months ago has suffered a 
number of setbacks. Some parents said they had seen Margaux treat girls roughly 
and use harsh language. Czech said she saw the headmistress grab a girl by the 
arms, shake her and yell in her face. Rumors flew that her curriculum wasn't up 
to par. 
</P>
<P>
 After two parent meetings last month, in which Margaux was not invited, 
parents pulled several children out of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaux says she has yelled at students at times to keep them from hurting 
themselves or others. But she denied parents' allegations of harsh discipline. 
"I understand their fears, even though I'm not a parent," Margaux said. "But 
there have been a lot of rumors going around and most of them just aren't 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 Margaux also disagrees with her critics over the school's enrollment, and how 
many students have departed. Margaux says 29 of the school's 47 students 
departed. Parents said the school's enrollment was 54, and that about 40 
children have left.  
</P>
<P>
 Some facts are not in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of a former Chrysalis student filed a police report in August, 
accusing Margaux of child cruelty for spanking their daughter during a birthday 
party in a private home. The Long Beach city prosecutor's office declined to 
file charges, however, saying there was insufficient evidence.  
</P>
<P>
 Margaux said the child had become incorrigible at the party. "I did swat her 
on the butt two or three times. And then I told her that she was going to 
behave and have a good time," Margaux said. "After that she was just fine. She 
stayed at the party and had fun." 
</P>
<P>
 While Margaux believes she handled the August incident well, word of the 
complaint spread among parents as school began. Parents then began to tell each 
other of additional incidents in which Margaux allegedly was seen yelling at 
children or shaking them. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Margaux) is very charismatic, but then she would flip and become abusive and 
the kids were really confused," said parent Sirri Hanson, who added that her 
daughter had complained that Margaux berated her in front of the class for 
missing words on a spelling test. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 1, a meeting of parents was called. Some said Margaux routinely 
belittled pupils. They also said that in Margaux's classroom, composed of 
fourth- to eighth-graders, all students studied from the same American History 
workbook. Parents praised the three other permanent teachers. Margaux defended 
the school's curriculum, thrusting several different texts and workbooks at a 
visitor as proof of the girls' well-rounded education. Margaux, who received a 
bachelor of arts degree in international business from San Francisco State 
University, said she relied on others with degrees in education to design the 
curriculum. She also taught at an area Montessori school and the Huntington 
School in Long Beach before opening Chrysalis. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Dec. 1 meeting, some children were pulled out of school. By the time 
students returned from the holidays, enrollment had dropped to 18, Margaux 
said. Parent Donna Banks said she's seen student lists, however, that show 
Chrysalis dropped from a high of 54 students to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so sure that (Chrysalis) was the greatest school in the world," said 
Banks, who withdrew her 6-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents who withdrew their children plan to start their own school, 
tentatively named Laurel Crest Girls' School, in a Belmont Heights neighborhood 
a few blocks from the Chrysalis site. They have hired two former Chrysalis 
teachers. As with Chrysalis, the new school will offer ballet and French in 
addition to traditional studies. Parents involved in organizing Laurel Crest, 
which will have 20 students, said they would not return their children to 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 For Margaux, the rumors and sudden drop in enrollment have been a strain. 
Margaux said she feels personally attacked. She has replaced the two teachers 
who departed for the new school, and has been forced to lay off a math teacher 
and a part-time ballet instructor. But she has no plans to close. She said that 
with 18 students she can pay the bills. Tuition is $400 a month.

<P>
 This unlikely temple to the arts in Compton hardly looks worth fighting for. 
</P>
<P>
 Four drab, beaten-down school buildings squat near a crumbling asphalt 
playground against a background of small homes with barred windows to the north 
and colorless industrial buildings to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, without so much as a name, is usually referred to by the address, 
1420 N. McKinley Ave. Many windows are painted over. Pine boards cover openings 
where the glass is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents have stormed into Compton school board meetings, shouted at board 
members and threatened to pull their children from the school district when 
officials have talked about closing the school or slashing its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to protect what goes on inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Into this stark setting, hundreds of youngsters have come after school for the 
tonic of music and art. They left gang-plagued neighborhoods and other troubles 
to finger a violin, raise a handbell, sing in pressed robes and kick their legs 
high and straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter, when she started taking dance classes, had problems in school," 
said Sandra Johnson, the mother of 12-year-old Kortney. "Her success here has 
followed over into her academic work. She is now in classes for the gifted and 
talented. On her last report card she had four A's and two Bs." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Johnsons and others, 1420 N. McKinley is a vital outpost of culture. 
Supporters have fought an ongoing, sometimes losing battle to maintain funding 
for its programs during wave after wave of school district budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle is symbolic of the pressures being faced and often surmounted by 
those who view as essential an education in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Southeast area, hard economic times have felled music and art 
programs, but have also brought out the best from lovers of music and art, who 
have become masters at the art of getting by with less. 
</P>
<P>
 In Montebello, students share instruments, wash their own band uniforms and 
forgo cherished field trips, but stick with their music. In Long Beach, 
teachers organize extra music contests and art programs on their own time. Some 
dig into their pockets to buy instruments, pay for repairs and provide other 
supplies. Regular classroom teachers, already burdened by large classes, are 
taking a stab at teaching music and art in Lakewood. And artists and arts 
organizations, such as the Long Beach Symphony Orchestra, are reaching into 
schools with opera, ballet and classical music to develop the performers and 
audience of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at some of the battlefronts:  
</P>
<P>
 The most recent assault on the program at 1420 N. McKinley occurred last July 
when the Compton Unified School District came under state control as a result 
of a budget crisis. With more than $19 million in debts and officials handing 
out dozens of pink slips and proposing across-the-board pay cuts, it didn't 
take long for administrators to start slashing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The district saved hundreds of thousands of dollars by eliminating the 
specialists who taught dance, music and drama during the school day in the 
elementary and middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The district was also poised to eliminate the after-school classes at McKinley 
-- an arts program that supporters had literally built from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents had constructed a raised dance floor in one classroom so children 
would not have to dance on concrete. In other rooms, they erected risers for a 
chorus and a band. 
</P>
<P>
 A former kindergarten became a mini-auditorium when a donor contributed seats 
from an old Los Angeles-area theater. The tattered seats desperately needed new 
covers, so families adopted one seat apiece to restore -- a substantial 
commitment in the economically depressed city. When a seat was finished, the 
donating family was honored with a nameplate on the back of the chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like the Music Center," program coordinator Joyce R. Jones said. 
Enrollment grew as high as 200 students, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the latest threat came, Sandra Johnson and other parents made a 
last-ditch appeal. They found an ally in Assistant Supt. Lilly B. Nelson, who 
persuaded officials that the after-school program could be funded from a 
portion of money set aside by law for gifted and talented students. 
</P>
<P>
 But they came away with only a partial victory. The current $34,000 budget is 
about $15,000 less than what the program operated on last year. The 
after-school program also lost most of its staff members, who had been 
full-time arts teachers during the school day. They left for jobs elsewhere 
when their full-time positions were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The current skeleton staff consists mainly of regular classroom teachers, who 
do extra duty after school teaching music and drama for $19 an hour. Without 
the full-time music, dance and drama teachers in the schools to spot and 
recruit talent, enrollment after school has dropped to about 90 students, Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a Compton teacher for 33 years, used to administer the arts program 
full time. The budget cutters reassigned her to teach second grade at Kennedy 
Elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of classes, however, she hurries to the McKinley site to work in 
the after-school program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see it die. What if I said no and (officials) just said, 
'Forget it' ?" 
</P>

 When hard times hit the Montebello school district, band leader Leonard Narumi 
bought five saxophones, two clarinets, two flutes, two piccolos, one sousaphone 
and numerous accessory items such as drumsticks and drumheads. The saxes alone 
cost about $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 It was either buy the instruments and then lend them out or see some students 
in his prize-winning Schurr High School band give up music. 
</P>
<P>
 Narumi said he has few other financial obligations. "I have no wife, no life, 
just my two brothers, my mother and the cat. And the cat died."  
</P>
<P>
 Uniforms have also been hard to come by. Narumi's band students purchased 
their own white pants to go along with a minimal supply of school-provided band 
jackets. "We share the jackets or have a rotation for wearing them," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The band ran short of uniforms in 1992 before its first appearance in the Rose 
Parade, so the percussion section wore a completely different outfit, which 
band members paid for themselves. At other performances, as many as a dozen 
students have had to sit out because of the uniform shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise money for equipment and other expenses, students and their parents 
wash cars, market Tupperware, sell cookies and fry pancake breakfasts. They 
organize at least five different fund-raising projects a year, more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, field trips are virtually out of the question. The band used to 
travel all over the country, but not even bus rides to local football games are 
free anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 That costs $60 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Narumi's plight is not unique in Montebello Unified, a cash-strapped school 
district that has slashed arts and music programs that formerly received 
generous support. 
</P>
<P>
 The district saved more than $120,000 by abandoning its partnership with the 
J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu. The museum used to train teachers about art so 
they could pass on this knowledge to students. The program included an evening 
when elementary students displayed their skills by acting as tour guides at the 
Getty Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello Unified once dedicated an entire building for administrators and 
teachers who ran music and arts programs. One room was a makeshift studio where 
musicians recorded samples of classic works as well as their own compositions 
for classroom use. The entire building is now locked up. 
</P>
<P>
 "When their last work day ended they shut the file drawers, turned off the 
lights, turned on the alarm and left," said business manager Glenn J. Sheppard. 
"It's depressing to walk in there." 
</P>
<P>
 The district ended funding for new instruments and even cut the staff of those 
who repair them. 
</P>
<P>
 So Narumi became an instrument collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if he could only master baton-twirling. The reductions also took away the 
teacher who used to lead the drill and flag teams, leaving that task to Narumi 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very distracting," Narumi said of his added chores. "I have to take time 
out to set up the fund-raisers in class when I really should be teaching 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 But he adds: "It would be even more difficult to let the program go." 
</P>

 Bill Heynen's job as master wood sculpture teacher is getting harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of district budget cuts, Heynen's sculpture classes at Montebello High 
have grown from 24 to 32 students. It's difficult to manage the larger classes 
when each student works at a different level on an individual project. 
</P>
<P>
 So he moves more quickly from desk to desk, giving pointers above a maddening 
din of mallets striking poplar, willow and mahogany and the hum of an electric 
oscillating sander. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget cuts have eliminated two of his five woodcarving classes. They've been 
replaced with general math classes, where he has to teach sixth-grade math to 
high-schoolers who care little about school. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement looks more and more appealing to the 55-year-old teacher until he 
considers students such as Fernando Martinez, a 16-year-old junior who captured 
first-place ribbons in his age group for wood sculpture and wood sculpture 
creativity at last year's state fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Heynen's students have claimed 217 awards at the state fair since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said that Heynen's class was the main reason that some students 
stayed in school. "Sometimes his students don't want to go to other classes, 
but they like this class a lot," Martinez said. 
</P>

 Helen Scott, a third-grade teacher in Long Beach Unified, recalls when music 
teachers visited her classroom every week. They kept alive a district tradition 
by teaching her students how to play the recorder, a simple flute-like 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott learned to play the recorder to sneak in extra lessons for students. 
Now, she has volunteered to be the main attraction because the music teachers 
can stop by only a handful of times a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach administrators have frozen the number of music teachers since at 
least 1988, even though student enrollment has increased by 10,000 students 
over that period to about 75,000 students. The school board considered a staff 
proposal to save money by cutting all instrumental music teachers from the 
elementary schools two years ago, but dropped the idea under intense protest. 
</P>
<P>
 In Scott's class at Burcham Elementary in Lakewood, 30 students sit 
ramrod-straight, recorders poised inches below lips, eyes glued to a sheet of 
music projected on a white screen.  
</P>
<P>
 "Say the names of the notes to yourself. Think of where your fingers are going 
to go," she tells them. "One, two, ready, play . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen valiant squeaks later, it is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "An A+," 8-year-old Tessa Petrich says approvingly. 
</P>
<P>
 And just like that, "Hot Cross Buns" is conquered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music puts all students on an equal footing," Scott said later. More than 
a third of the school's students speak limited English, but "it does not matter 
whether they can speak English or not," she said. "They can all learn to play 
the recorder."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With a sweep of his hands, Robert Frelly signals students to begin an excerpt 
from Copland's "Appalachian Spring." Frelly, assistant conductor of the Long 
Beach Symphony Orchestra, stands before more than 70 of the finest high school 
musicians from the Long Beach public schools at Wilson High School.  
</P>
<P>
 The instruments falter, so Frelly tries again, and again -- guiding students 
through the piece gently, but firmly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have the melody, play softer so we hear the melody coming 
through at all times," Frelly says. "First clarinet, just a hair faster than 
that. Violins, make sure the vibrato starts before the first note. Check the 
third note, trombone, it should be G sharp." 
</P>
<P>
 Frelly is preparing the students for a first-ever, side-by-side performance 
with the symphony's own musicians Feb. 9-10 at the Terrace Theater in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The symphony is among a number of arts organizations trying to fill the void 
in public school arts and music programs. In all, the symphony spends $250,000 
a year, 10% of its budget, on education programs. That's three times what it 
spent five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resources of schools have shrunk in the past two decades; the demands 
placed on them are tremendous," said Mary Newkirk, executive director of the 
symphony. "Our role is to serve our community by sharing the unique artistic 
resource of this symphony with our schools and their students." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 30 minutes into the rehearsal with Frelly, 51 strings, 10 woodwinds, 
11 brasses and three percussionists begin to create something recognizable and 
even beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Frelly's arm thrusts out and the violins sing. His fingers beckon and the 
volume rises.  
</P>
<P>
 The eyes of violinist Zhelinrentice Scott follow his every move. She's studied 
the violin for six years. She tries to practice at least two hours a day. She 
endured an arduous audition to win her seat and will add seven two-hour 
rehearsals to her schedule to prepare for this concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way some people feel about sports, I feel about music," said the 
15-year-old 10th-grader from Polytechnic High. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In Compton, at the school with no name, 12-year-old Kortney Johnson now helps 
teach the dance class that had given her the discipline and confidence to 
become an honors student. She's filling in while the stripped-down after-school 
program searches for a permanent instructor. Her mother chaperons the class, 
sweeps the floor -- whatever is needed.  
</P>
<P>
 Kortney's students include seventh-grader Anthony Gillespie, who used to get 
bored spending his afternoons at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it," he said. "You get to flip around, doing that ballet stuff, with 
your leg coming up in the air like this." 
</P>
<P>
 He also takes the drama class and is learning to play handbells, the guitar, 
drums and keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to have things like this where kids can have fun," he said. "Isn't 
that what school's all about?" Cuts in Art, Music Programs District: Compton

 The season has already reached a critical stage for the Cal State Long Beach 
men's basketball team if it hopes to compete in a postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, who have lost two consecutive games for the first time this season, 
including Saturday's 82-66 decision to UC Santa Barbara, play host to Big West 
Conference rivals UC Irvine at 8:30 tonight and Cal State Fullerton at 8:30 
Saturday. Both games will be televised by KDOC-56. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach is 8-5 and 3-3 in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest problem for the 49ers has been injuries. Leading scorer 
Mike Atkinson has struggled since spraining an ankle Jan. 10 against Nevada. He 
had a season-low five points in Long Beach's 92-69 loss to Pacific last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting point guard Jeff Rogers missed the Santa Barbara game because of a 
bruised calf muscle and junior forward Bart Gijbels has been slowed because of 
a knee injury he suffered in a November exhibition game against the Lafayette 
Hustlers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, starting guard Brian Camper was ruled academically ineligible 
after the conference opener against New Mexico State on Jan. 5, and junior 
forward Gerry Branner quit the team for personal reasons Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers' opponents this week also have been struggling. Irvine is 5-9 and 
2-4 and Fullerton 3-12 and 1-6. COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State volleyball team, ranked No. 10 by Volleyball Monthly, was 
defeated by No. 7 Pepperdine, 15-6, 15-6, 15-8, Tuesday night at Malibu. 
COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos College men's basketball will try to finish the first half of 
South Coast Conference play undefeated when it plays host to Mt. San Antonio at 
7:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons, ranked No. 2 in the state behind Ventura by the JC Athletic 
Bureau, are 19-4 and 3-0 in South Coast games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos, which coasted to a 102-80 win over Harbor on Saturday, has been 
paced by sophomore center Javan Rouzan, who averages 20.3 points and 10.6 
rebounds to rank among the state leaders. He has also made a team-leading 57.5% 
of his shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 In the backcourt, Monty Owen is averaging 11 points and Kelly Hambrick is 
averaging 10.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos has averaged 86.8 points, including a 98.3 average in conference 
games. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach City men's basketball team will try to keep pace with first 
place Cerritos when it plays El Camino in a South Coast Conference game at 7:30 
p.m. Saturday at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the last conference game for Long Beach before its rematch against 
Cerritos on Feb. 5 at Cerritos. The Vikings, ranked No. 6 in the state by the 
JC Athletic Bureau, suffered a 93-82 loss to Cerritos on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach improved to 18-6 and 2-1 in South Coast play with an 81-63 win over 
Mt. San Antonio last week. Against Mt. San Antonio, the Vikings were led by 
freshman forward Chris Blanton from Dominguez High. He had 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore forward Kevin Beal, sophomore guard Marcus Rogers and freshman 
forward Marc Neal have been the team's leaders. Beal averages 22 points, 
placing him among the state scoring leaders, Rogers is the team leader in 
three-point baskets and Neal leads in rebounding, field-goal percentage and 
blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 After advancing to the state quarterfinals two seasons ago, the Long Beach 
women's basketball team has struggled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings, coached by Barbara Jackson, finished 4-19 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But Long Beach, which plays host to Pasadena at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, may be on 
the rise. Despite starting four freshman, the Vikings are 10-13. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's offensive leader is 5-9 Dalynne Ware, the only sophomore in the 
starting lineup. She ranks among the state leaders with averages of 19.7 points 
and 11.6 rebounds. Another standout has been 5-10 Jolena Lomax, who is also 
listed among the state leaders at 15.1 points and 11.1 rebounds. PREPS 
</P>
<P>
 Two Southeast athletes are among the early entries announced for the high 
school division of the Sunkist Invitational track and field meet at noon on 
Feb. 19 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Londell Ramsey of Downey will compete in the boys' 50-meter hurdles and triple 
jump, and Stacy Edwards of Gahr is entered in the girls' 880-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey turned in a best of 14.86 seconds in the 110-meter high hurdles last 
season. Among other participants in the event will be Hart's Jason Medearis and 
Santa Monica's Tyson Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, who completed the 800-meter run in 2 minutes 18.60 seconds last 
season, will compete against many of the top half-milers in the state, 
including Shalynn Carr of Bonita and Stacy Kerr of Paradise.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LOS NIETOS SCHOOLS; HEAD START VOLUNTEER APPOINTED TO BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Whittier-area parent will join the Los Nietos School District board, filling 
a vacancy created when Adeline Rocha resigned in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 3 to 1 Tuesday to appoint Bobbie Gray, 40, from among five 
applicants.She will take office Feb. 8 to serve the remainder of Rocha's 
four-year term, which ends in February, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 A mother of two children in the district, Gray has been a volunteer worker on 
several parent and personnel committees, Supt. Chuck Menzies said. She is vice 
chairwoman of the policy-making board for the district's Plaza de la Raza Head 
Start preschool program for low-income families, and has served on a similar 
board for the Los Angeles County Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha, a member of the board for 14 years, left the district after winning a 
seat on the Whittier Union High School District board in the Nov. 2 election. 
The Los Nietos board subsequently decided to appoint Rocha's successor rather 
than hold a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Nietos district serves children in kindergarten through eighth grade 
from the unincorporated area west of Whittier and near Santa Fe Springs.

COMMUNITY NEWS: DOWNEY; PAIR PLEAD NO CONTEST TO MEDI-CAL CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owners of a defunct South Gate-based wheelchair company have pleaded no 
contest to charges of grand theft and fraud for failing to deliver wheelchairs 
to disabled Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Delatorre, 50, of Menifee, and her brother, James Freelove, 48, of 
Norwalk, entered the pleas Jan. 20 and agreed to pay $90,976 in restitution to 
the state.They are scheduled to appear Feb. 17 in Norwalk Superior Court for 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Health Services began investigating the company, 
called The Chair Concern, in July after customers complained that they had 
filed Medi-Cal prescriptions for wheelchairs and parts that were never 
delivered. Delatorre and Freelove were found to have billed Medi-Cal and 
received payment for 42 of the wheelchairs, said Paul Fice, an investigator for 
the Department of Health Services. Most of the customers were outpatients at 
Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Leonard A. Matsuk said Delatorre and Freelove wanted to deliver the 
wheelchairs, but "got caught in a cash-flow crunch. They did not deliberately 
set out to defraud the medical system. They were victims of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Therese Farrell said evidence shows the company 
had "no intention of fulfilling the orders" when it submitted the claims to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuk said Delatorre and Freelove pleaded no contest to avoid trial and a 
possible harsher sentence. They were facing a maximum jail sentence of six 
years, four months.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM STARTS AT FRANKLIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An after-school program for area youth, operated by the Boys and Girls Club of 
Long Beach, has started at Benjamin Franklin Middle School, 540 Cerritos Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Children ages 7 to 17 can join the club for a $10 yearly membership fee, and 
participate in organized sports, games, arts and crafts, supervised homework 
sessions and many other activities from 3 to 8 p.m. weekdays, said operations 
director Randy Rutledge.The club also has a computer lab and weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 The club opened Jan. 7. About 110 youngsters attend daily, Rutledge said. 
Volunteers supervise and teach the various activities, which include cooking 
and sewing classes, weight training and karate. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin school Principal Melvin R. Collins said the program is the only one 
in the area surrounding the school that "can take kids out of the neighborhood 
and off the street, giving them something to do in a positive sense." The club 
also accepts payments of as little 50 cents a week if families cannot afford 
the membership fee up front. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys and Girls Club operates five similar programs in the city, serving 
about 3,500 youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Franklin club is expected to cost about $175,000 a year, officials said. 
Funding for the first two years has been collected through donations from 
individuals, community groups and public and private businesses, spokeswoman 
Helene Belisle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys and Girls Club is seeking volunteers to serve as tutors, coaches, and 
arts and crafts instructors at Franklin. Information: (310) 432-4751.

HE ONLY HAS EYES FOR YOU; VIC DUNLOP WEARS MANY HATS, BUT ONSTAGE THERE'S ONLY 
ONE VISUAL HOLDOVER FROM HIS PROP DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Vic Dunlop gave up being a prop comedian for the more socially acceptable 
pure stand-up gig, it wasn't a decision he labored over. The choice was pretty 
much made for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people will say they wanted to grow. Hell, I didn't care," the comedian 
said, sitting behind his desk at his Sun Valley home, which took a little 
beating during the recent earthquake. (Sun Valley is near Burbank.) 
</P>
<P>
 "About 10 years ago, I was working the Comedy Castle in Detroit. I was doing 
two shows, and between shows I set my prop bag down and someone stole my 
props." 
</P>
<P>
 Left propless, Dunlop was nervous about the second performance, but it went 
fine. "It was actually easier and I got to talk more. The worst part was I 
didn't have any eyes to sell after the second show."  
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Dunlop's bag of tricks included a "Bonanza" map, several hats, a 
Frisbee, a turban and the stash of plastic, bloodshot eyes that he sold after 
his sets. Opening the Detroit show was Tim Allen, who has since turned in his 
caveman shtick for a nicer den on his ABC sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say anything," Dunlop continued, "and I'm not saying Tim 
Allen took them, but I did see a man, grunting, running away. But if Tim still 
has (the props), I'd like them back." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their money-making value, the crazy eyes were the only props Dunlop 
kept in his act. Toward the end of his show, the portly comic pops in the eyes 
and suggests several uses for them. (Discouraging hitchhikers is just one.) 
</P>
<P>
 "All day Monday, they're doing 10 minutes of my act. But I don't care. It's 
more publicity for me," he said, laughing, as he did through much of the 
interview.  
</P>
<P>
 Padding around his office in a green golf shirt and gray slacks set off by red 
tennis shoes, Dunlop preferred to talk freely, and as much as he could, about 
where he sees his niche in comedy's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlop takes out his bloodshot eyes long enough to look at the big picture. He 
is squarely focused on the much-ballyhooed information superhighway, when 
televisions, telephones, computers, databases and cable systems are all 
supposed to collide into instant communications.  
</P>
<P>
 "With the information superhighway coming, I want to be the one to distribute 
product. There's a marketability in comedy product such as Louie Anderson's 
books or cassettes dealing with comics' early live stand-up routines, the 
hidden tapes. These are no buzzer-on-the-hand novelty items. It would be a 
collection of classic stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 To get the word out, Dunlop sees infomercials as his link to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Infomercials are now huge, but they are intensely boring. I'm going to add 
entertainment to the boring." 
</P>
<P>
 By using technology, fresh ideas and some old-fashioned hucksterism, Dunlop 
sees good things happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clubs are kind of red-lining out. This will help keep the clubs alive," he 
said, bemoaning how some club owners' myopic tendencies keep them focusing only 
on the door and not on the big picture window. "The target is to keep comedy 
alive, bring it into the future." 
</P>
<P>
 His main venture is Komedy VideoCards, a five-minute video that comes with two 
passes to just about any comedy club in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, he has five video greeting cards you can punch into the VCR to 
commemorate someone's going over the hill, having a birthday or getting well. 
You can also tell someone you hate them or love them for $9.95, suggested 
retail price. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlop, whose wife, Linda, refers to him as a capitalistic hippie, is also 
working on getting Louie Anderson, Jim (Ernest) Varney and Judy Tenuta (for an 
astro-illogical card). He's also working on a 3D animated card. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlop started shifting his energies when he noticed the comedy boom of the 
'80s was slowing down and clubs across the nation were closing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on the road 18 years, and I'm not the young stud I used to be," 
said Dunlop, who worked clubs about 25 weeks last year but will cut down in 
'94. I don't want to hang on forever. I want to create my own destiny and help 
other comics." 
</P>
<P>
 He's also working with CD/Rom, to get comedy into computers. And he's always 
looking for financing -- to make more VideoCards or develop "One of These 
Days," a recessionary sitcom akin to the old "Honeymooners." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlop has been working on such projects for about three years, but didn't 
consider himself official until he opened a bank account six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my next step in comedy. With the Improv group, I've reached my 
level," Dunlop said, referring to his headlining status with that chain and 
other top comedy clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlop, who gave his age in muffled, barely audible tones as fortysomething, 
got into comedy a few years after returning from the Vietnam War in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 It probably didn't hurt that his father, Vic Dunlop Sr., was an old character 
actor. But the seeds were planted much earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a fat guy who went to Catholic school for 13 years. That's already two 
marks against you." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, he started Natural Gas, a skit-based troupe that spent two years as 
the comic relief on "Don Kirshner's Rock Concert." 
</P>
<P>
 Other credits include the movies "Breakfast of Aliens" (finished but not 
released), "Martians Go Home" (with Randy Quaid) and "Meatballs II." He has 
also sold a script to the producers of "Ghost Busters" and "Twins." On TV, he's 
done "Evening at the Improv," "Make Me Laugh" and "Hollywood Squares." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlop's comedy is nothing you need a college degree to understand. He 
considers himself a blue-collar comic, someone who wonders how the airlines 
expect overweight people to survive a flight on six lousy peanuts or tells 
about school days at Our Lady of the Most Vicious Blood.  
</P>
<P>
 But Dunlop, despite the stereotype of the jolly fat man, is keenly in tune 
with reality. Since 1992's L.A. riots, the comedian packs pepper spray because 
he can't carry a gun, though he did carry a .38-caliber for two weeks after the 
riots. ("I thought I was Wyatt Earp. That was stupid.") And in Portland in 
December, he was almost attacked, he said, by crack dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't die in 'Nam. And I'm not gonna get it on Ventura Boulevard. I'm a 
fat guy with an edge." Who

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: HARRY NILSSON, "ALL TIME GREATEST HITS"; RCA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's doubly sad that Harry Nilsson died last week, before he had a chance to 
reclaim the reputation he established two decades ago as one of the finest 
singer-songwriters of the pop-music era. 
</P>
<P>
 This compilation provides a generous overview of his career, from his first 
hit, 1969's "Everybody's Talkin' " (the Fred Neil theme song to "Midnight 
Cowboy"), through his early-'70s commercial peak with such albums as "Nilsson 
Schmilsson."There was a fetching naivete in early songs including "Good Old 
Desk" and "Daddy's Song," celebrations of childlike wonder that are still 
uncommonly endearing. And his silken voice was a marvel -- when he won a 1972 
Gram my for best male vocal for his recording of "Without You," it was one of 
the few times Grammy voters deserved cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nilsson's star faded as he sank further into the bottle in the late '70s, 
and his albums became proportionately less and less rewarding -- to wit, this 
compilation stops at 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Latter-day redemption notwithstanding -- he reportedly had just finished his 
first new album in 15 years before he died last week at 52 of a heart attack -- 
Nilsson richly deserves a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Expect to 
see his name pop up on some ballots next year -- now that he's gone. RANDY

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: KIERAN KANE, "FIND MY WAY HOME"; ATLANTIC  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

 If they gave prison sentences for artistic crimes, someone would be doing time 
for the 1992 breakup of the O'Kanes, the country duo that was one of the 
freshest additions to the country scene in years. Following two moderately 
successful albums, their third was an artistic breakthrough -- among the best 
of the '90s -- but a commercial flop.All support for the O'Kanes suddenly 
vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is, both members -- Kieran Kane and Jamie O'Hara -- are 
embarking on solo careers, potentially giving O'Kanes fans double the pleasure. 
Kane's solo debut certainly provides reason to celebrate. He carries over the 
same bluegrass-in flected acoustic sound the O'Kanes favored, and his 
songwriting is as lean and virtually cliche-free as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 His slightly smoky voice lends an appropriately gritty edge to his tales of 
characters who are struggling to be better than they often are, to reconcile 
their actions with their intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane chooses words carefully, builds phrases deliberately. The attention to 
song craft is rare in any field of pop, but it stands out dramatically against 
the tide of drek that gushes from Nashville song factories where, ironically, 
Kane once toiled. 
</P>
<P>
 We can only hope Kane will fare better minus the O'. RANDY LEWIS

MUSIC / DANCE; GREEK MYTH BY GRAHAM BY WAY OF TWYLA THARP

 At first blush, "Demeter and Persephone" could easily be another piece from 
Martha Graham's great Greek period. For about a decade beginning in the 
mid-1940s, the visionary modern dance creator scrutinized and reinterpreted 
Greek myths and dramas, retelling them in visceral movement terms and always 
from a feminist perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cave of the Heart," created in 1946, focused on Medea and her abandonment by 
Jason, the opportunistic leader of the Argonauts. In "Night Journey" (1946), 
Graham made Jocasta, the mother and wife of Oedipus, the protagonist of the 
drama, not Oedipus the King, solver of riddles and blind to his own fate. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not turn to the story of Demeter and her daughter Persephone, by which 
the ancient Greeks accounted for the seasons? Persephone had been abducted by 
Hades, god of the underworld. But thanks to the intervention of Zeus, she was 
allowed to return to earth and to her mother, but only for two-thirds of the 
year. Her annual return was signaled by the arrival of spring. 
</P>
<P>
 This would make for a natural continuum, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise. The choreographer who came up with the idea wasn't Graham, but 
51-year-old Twyla Tharp. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is the first in 60 years by someone other than Graham that the Martha 
Graham Dance Company, appearing today and Friday at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts, is dancing.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to "Demeter and Persephone," Thursday's program will include 
Graham's "Appalachian Spring," "Errand Into the Maze" and "Steps in the 
Street." Friday's program will consist of Graham's "Acts of Light," "Night 
Journey" and "Maple Leaf Rag." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, set to klezmer music, the Tharp piece doesn't look at all like 
Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely a different movement vocabulary," said Christine Dakin, who 
dances Demeter. "It's kind of a rollicking dance. The conceit Twyla uses is 
that a band of traveling players is on its way to perform the Eleusinian rites 
(or rites of Demeter). Within that context, the dance tells the story, but not 
in a linear fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dancing looks very easy, but it is, in fact, excruciatingly complex and 
difficult. That challenge is making it look tremendously easy and at the same 
time, keeping it as explicit as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the company went through three weeks of intense rehearsal with Tharp 
to learn the new way of moving, said Terese Capucilli, who dances the 
Interloper, a role akin to a Greek chorus.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not used to moving as fast as Twyla moves," Capucilli explained. "First 
of all, we were working in jazz boots. Generally we are barefoot. In working 
that way, it makes the floor very 'fast,' as Twyla called it -- which means 
slippery. You have to use your legs in a totally different way when the floor 
is that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it was painful. The rehearsal period was three weeks of a lot of pain. Our 
bodies felt tortured. Other than that, the whole piece was wonderful." What: 
The Martha Graham Dance Company in two different programs. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Today, Jan. 27, and Friday, Jan. 28, at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700 Center Court Drive, 
Cerritos.

WANNA DANCE?: FOR ONE-STOP DINING AND DANCING, MUM'S THE WORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA, Rose Apodaca is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's so typical of many to write off the county as a wasteland, with nowhere 
worth clubbing. These same people tend to consider La-La Land as the only hip 
place, even though some of them have only made the drive north less than a 
handful of times in their (night) lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But as annoying as it is to admit it, sometimes the best places to party are 
past the county line, though only just a hop, skip and a jump in nearby Long 
Beach. In that city's renovated downtown is Mum's, a one-stop dine-and-dance 
dig in grand tradition that peaks with its Friday installation upstairs of 
Tango. 
</P>
<P>
 The night is hosted by Indigo Productions, the promotion team that has long 
brought Long Beach and Orange County denizens rip-roaring nightclubs, including 
the Thursday night disco happenings at Roxbury South in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 To Mum's, the team brings all the energy, dress-to-impress attitude and 
cordial spirit of other Indigo Productions. Only in its third week, the several 
hundred stylish twentysomethings already packing the place mark another success 
for Indigo. 
</P>
<P>
 That success, however, is measured in execution and not innovation: The 
mainstream dance pop doesn't earn the club any points in the music department. 
Patrons in the main room listen to deejay Blake Davidson spinning the likes of 
early Prince and current Salt N Pepa. Heading up a ramp and onto the roof leads 
to deej Eric Gailer, giving the crowd old school, new wave and classic KROQ. 
</P>
<P>
 But with so many folks gettin' down and having a genuine good time, who's 
keeping score? 
</P>
<P>
 The freshest sounds can be heard in the VIP room, with its eclectic mix of 
compact discs alternating a cycle of Billie Holiday, then a Grace Jones song, 
followed by a flamenco track. 
</P>
<P>
 Environment plays a key role throughout the two-story building. The main room 
features a large dance floor, its own glass walls giving view to the town and 
two enormous, gilded demon heads overlooking the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The ramp takes a steady stream of customers past the unisex restrooms to the 
rooftop patio. This is one place that should rage come summer time. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstairs at Mum's, patrons who shell out at least $25 a head in the 
restaurant can skip the cover and line into Tango. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't bother showing up for dinner without reservations. Guests dine on 
gourmet pasta, fresh fish, salads and pizzas, from $7.95 to $18.95. Tasty 
appetizers such as crab cakes and beef carpaccio run $6.75 to $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
 From any of the building's bars, a glass of wine is $3.75 to $4.50, wells are 
$3.75 to $4, Coors Light and Bud are $2.75, while Carlsberg Light, Becks, Becks 
Dark, Samuel Adams and Anchor Steam sell for $3.25. Sodas are $1.25, and 
bottled water is $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Tango is orchestrated courtesy of Indigo, the festivities below should 
not be ignored. Eddie Reed's jazzy lounge ensemble downstairs keeps the joint 
jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 * TANGO * 144 Pine Ave., Long Beach. * (310) 437-7700. * 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
every Friday night at Mum's. * $10 cover, but passes are available.

WRITINGS ON THE WALL; ATHOL FUGARD SEES A WAY PAST APARTHEID, IN 'PLAYLAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Jan Herman covers theater for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the obsessive biblical references in "Playland," Athol Fugard's latest 
drama about the existential dilemma of his native South Africa, you'd think the 
author was a devout churchgoer. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the renowned playwright made clear in a telephone interview last week 
from Princeton, N.J., he doesn't even consider himself a Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people ask if I am, I tell them no," Fugard said, his bird-like voice 
lending the words a crisp and definitive ring. "I was brought up as one, but I 
am not any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he finds it difficult, if not impossible, to shake off his 
powerful Calvinist upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when it came to writing "Playland," which opens Friday in a revival 
on South Coast Repertory's Second Stage, he discovered the grip of his 
religious heritage was stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Fugard, who at 61 has long been South Africa's foremost dramatist, recalled 
that he "became conscious time and again of a Christian subtext" to his daily 
experience during the work's creation. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited as a prime example "the horrendous photograph" that triggered 
"Playland" in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was," Fugard explained, "a photograph of two white South African soldiers 
on the back of a truck lowering the body of a dead freedom fighter into a mass 
grave. I saw it on the front page of my newspaper in Port Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The photographer had clicked the shutter at the precise moment when each of 
the soldiers had hold of an arm. It was a latter-day crucifixion image. Those 
were two Roman centurions taking Christ down from the cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I said, I am emphatically not a Christian. But from Day One to the very 
end (of writing this play) I was haunted by Christian imagery -- in the 
accidents of my life and in my thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 Letting his imagination roam, Fugard turned one of those white soldiers into 
"Playland's" Gideon le Roux, now in civilian life and looking to celebrate New 
Year's Eve, 1989, at a traveling amusement park camped near a small town in the 
Karoo, South Africa's arid tableland. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama has only one other character, apart from the offstage voice of a 
carnival barker, and that is the amusement park's black night watchman, 
Martinus Zoeloe, who casts a cold and cynical eye on the New Year's 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation between Gideon and Martinus represents a dark night of the 
soul. Each is plagued by guilt -- Gideon for the many killings he committed 
during South Africa's traumatic Border War against the guerrilla forces of 
now-independent Namibia and Martinus for killing the white man who raped his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of these men are ghosts haunted by murder," Fugard reflected. "But I 
think the end of the play suggests they have the possibility of returning to 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 A prolific writer who speaks of having "appointments" with his plays, Fugard 
considers this 1992 stage work an outgrowth of "My Children! My Africa!"  
</P>
<P>
 That 1989 drama, which he has come to regard "quite simply as my favorite," 
was an emotionally wrenching meditation on the riots that swept the black 
townships of South Africa during the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Its doomed central figure, the anguished black schoolmaster Mr. M., held out 
the hope that the youth of the country -- both black and white -- might one day 
save their society from the racist curse of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with its sweet faith in reason and its moving plea for humanity ("The 
beautiful Mr. M. was an intellectual self-portrait," Fugard says), "My 
Children! My Africa!" still embodied what could only be called hope for a 
distant future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playland," Fugard's 19th drama in 33 years, has updated his sense of events 
and brought him closer to the sort of prescription he believes is necessary for 
justice without violence to prevail in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to write this one to prepare myself for the huge challenge we are 
facing now that apartheid is being dismantled," said Fugard, who directed 
"Playland's" 1992 world premiere in Johannesburg as well as the La Jolla 
Playhouse's American premiere, also that year, in San Diego. "It is a step 
forward in my evolution as a writer."  
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years before the release of Nelson Mandela (in 1990), it became 
obvious to any informed observer of the South African scene that the government 
had started to read the writing on the wall. A lot of people in power were 
realizing they could not hang on to white minority rule indefinitely, and that 
we were headed for big change.  
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that I became aware of this, I couldn't stop thinking, 'All 
right, so things are going to change. But in what way? Where are we going to 
go? What will change mean? How will we facilitate it?' And it became clear to 
me that white South Africans would have to acknowledge responsibility for those 
40 years of apartheid and what they did to the black people of South Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 "Without white South Africa realizing what it had done -- and on the basis of 
that realization having the courage to ask for forgiveness -- there can really 
be no significant movement. Just as, equivalently, it would need a matching act 
of courage on the part of black South Africa to hear and to believe that and to 
find the bigness of heart to say, 'I forgive you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even to contemplate that kind of reciprocity seems nothing short of miraculous 
to Fugard, who believed for decades that a national paroxysm of violence would 
be not just the likely resolution to his country's dilemma but the unavoidable 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 While he always wanted his plays to serve as healing influences, more often 
than not they came off as storm warnings. And because they invariably carried 
profound moral force -- whether overtly political or deeply personal -- they 
irrevocably changed South African theater. They also thrust him into the 
spotlight as an internationally acclaimed voice of conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Fugard's plays are so widely revived these days -- from his Port Elizabeth 
trilogy of the '60s ("The Blood Knot," "Hello and Goodbye" and "Boesman and 
Lena") to his Afrikaaner trilogy of the late-'70s and early-'80s ("A Lesson 
From Aloes, "Master Harold . . . and the boys " and "The Road to Mecca") -- 
that playgoers are liable to come across them almost anywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Next month in Orange County alone, no fewer than five of his dramas will be 
mounted by four different theater troupes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to SCR's professional staging of "Playland" in Costa Mesa, the 
South Orange County Community Theatre is offering "The Road to Mecca" (today- 
through Feb. 19) and a reading of "My Children! My Africa!" (Feb. 17-20) at the 
Camino Real Playhouse in San Juan Capistrano. The amateur Ensemble Theatre is 
doing "Master Harold . . . and the boys" (Feb. 26 and 27) also at the 
playhouse. And UC Irvine's drama department is staging "Statements After an 
Arrest Under the Immorality Act" (Feb. 10-13) at the Fine Arts Village Theatre 
on the UCI campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Fugard, who was in Princeton to direct a professional revival of "Hello and 
Goodbye" at the McCarter Theatre (Feb. 1-20), has no illusions that his 
worldwide reputation gives him any real political clout or social influence 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the white Establishment of his country considers him "a pinko" beyond 
the pale, and the militant black leadership dismisses him as a presumptuous 
white man who can't speak for black South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in that cross-fire, Fugard has described himself in the past as "a 
harmless old liberal fossil." And he has harbored serious doubt that his plays 
could affect the larger outcome of events.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the darkest years of apartheid," he explained, "I was always conscious of 
how desperate the need was to have men of significant action. Real action, not 
just words, not just platitudes, not just rhetoric, but action. And that 
continues to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most of my writing life I've refused to allow myself to believe that 
writing was a significant form of action. I always felt very uneasy about the 
fact that all I did was write in a situation as desperate as apartheid South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether I was correct or not is a different issue. But it was out of that 
sense of my personal impotence that I described myself as an old liberal 
fossil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that is changing. I've reached a point where I realize that writing is, 
in fact, a profoundly significant form of action -- that writing is action. And 
I have tried to embody that manifesto, that faith in the written and spoken 
word, in the plays themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that hasn't changed is his vision of himself as "a miniaturist" 
whose works can be packed into a suitcase and staged on little more than a 
spare platform. He says "small is beautiful" became his credo mainly because of 
the humble circumstances in which he found himself when he first began writing 
for the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the plays weren't simple and the casts kept small, they would never have 
seen the light of day. Nobody wanted to do them, so I had to do them myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Given his sense of proportion, it is perhaps not surprising to hear him 
express distaste for the idea -- put forward by his most ardent literary 
advocates -- that his body of work merits the Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't listen to that stuff," he said. "If I put that stuff into my 
life, you know what damage it's going to do? It's going to screw me up. The 
thing is, nothing that lies behind me helps me write the next new one.  
</P>
<P>
 "You could give me five Nobel Prizes, but God Almighty, I will be as Angst 
-ridden, I will be as insecure, I will be as frightened and uncertain of myself 
as I was with every play I have written so far." What

 Athol Fugard says he was sickened last summer when he learned of the murder of 
Amy Elizabeth Biehl, the white Fulbright scholar from Newport Beach who was 
pulled from her car and stabbed by a mob screaming anti-white slogans in the 
black township of Guguleto, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her death was horrible, awful," he said, recalling that the idealistic, 
26-year-old Biehl had been studying the role of women during South Africa's 
current political changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The slogan that crowd was chanting -- 'One settler! One bullet!' -- is one of 
the bitter fruits of apartheid. It's not just the young men who are chanting 
it, you know, but the young women as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Fugard adds, white South Africa bears as much responsibility for 
Biehl's death as the black youths who actually wielded the murder weapons and 
shouted the slogans. 
</P>
<P>
 "That violence and that rage were created by the system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not absolving those young people of responsibility. But I would be so 
blind, I would be guilty of such terrible complacency if I didn't acknowledge 
that it is the system of white privilege and white domination that created two 
generations of lost young men and women for whom violence is the only way 
forward, as they see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fugard still believes, however, that South Africa's national election on April 
27 will come off as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "What disturbs me very much, though," he said, "is that even the most astute 
and generous of politicians -- men like Nelson Mandela on the one side and 
(President) Frederik W. de Klerk on the other -- have to drop below the level 
of statesmanship the country needs and jockey for power by playing party 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is making promises that once the election is over, we'll address the 
issue of violence. But it would be smart to try and talk the young people out 
of that attitude now, before the elections, because they might end up voting 
for the wrong politicians." JAN HERMAN

 Dana Point-based Race Pace Promotions had a couple of goals when it created 
the three-year-old Saturn Super Series, a trio of 5K runs that concludes Sunday 
with the Big Game Stampede in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, organizers wanted to offer a local alternative to the Super Bowl 
Sunday 10K in Redondo Beach, which is billed as the largest 10K on the West 
Coast, drawing 13,000 last year. About 1,200 are expected for the 5K. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing Race Pace wanted is a series in which cumulative times are 
tracked. Those who run in all three races are eligible for awards given by age 
group. Scott Muirhead of Race Pace said the Saturn Super Series is the only 
such series in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two events in the series were the Halloween-themed Monster Mash Dash 
in Tustin and the Christmas-themed Rudolf Runoff in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 The race starts and finishes at the Crazy Horse Steak House. Muirhead 
described the course as very fast. From the Crazy Horse (just north of Dyer 
Road), the runners will head up Grand Avenue before turning right for a short 
loop through a business district, then returning to Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Awards will be given to Sunday's winners and series winners. Also, all 
participants are eligible to win a new Saturn sedan (hence the name of the 
series) in a drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the proceeds from Sunday's run will benefit the Hope House 
substance-abuse program and the Mater Dei High School cross-country team. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Big Game Stampede 5K run. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, Jan. 30, at 8 a.m. (race-day registration at 7 a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Crazy Horse Steak House, 1580 Brookhollow Drive, Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Exit the Costa Mesa (55) Freeway at Dyer Road. From the north, go 
right on Grand Avenue, then take the first right, Brookhollow Drive; from the 
south, go left under the overpass, right on Grand and right on Brookhollow. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $20 (includes T-shirt).

SPECIAL SCREENING: 'LETTER' PUSHES ENVELOPE FOR 1940S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The missive in "A Letter to Three Wives" starts out innocently but soon 
becomes a monster. Once the usual scribbled pleasantries are out of the way, 
the letter turns nasty. Addie, who wrote it, informs three friends she's 
planning to run away with one of their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the 1949 movie (screening Friday afternoon as part of the Cypress 
Senior Citizen Center's ongoing free film series) becomes a suburban mystery 
intent on peering into the women's marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 Now faced with figuring out which man has strayed, the wives are pushed from 
their domestic routines and forced to evaluate the relationships they've 
chosen. It's not always a pretty picture as director Joseph L. Mankiewicz uses 
sometimes melodramatic, sometimes humorous flashbacks to let us know just how 
jagged the edges are. 
</P>
<P>
 The first shows Deborah (Jeanne Crain), a socially backward girl trying to fit 
into high society with her country club smoothie Brad (Jeffrey Lynn). The next 
centers on Rita (Ann Sothern), a too-busy radio soap opera writer linked to 
George (Kirk Douglas), an idealistic, underpaid teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 The last gives us the great-looking, gold-digging Lora May (Linda Darnell), 
who wins the ultra-rich Porter (Paul Douglas) but doesn't seem to be happy 
about it. Porter isn't too thrilled by the arrangement, either. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, "A Letter to Three Wives" may seem overly quaint, but it was 
fairly provocative in the late '40s, a time when family values may have been 
the staunchest part of the American foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Few movies with domestic themes attempted to cast a critical eye at the 
traditions of marriage or raise the issue of extramarital affairs. And even 
though the film opts for a small smile of an ending, Mankiewicz provides barbs 
along the way. Further, the narrative technique was unusual for the period. 
Addie, for instance, is never seen; we only hear her slightly superior, 
somewhat sneering voice (Celeste Holm did the honors) as the wives sink into 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a smart idea; without seeing Addie as a concrete presence, she becomes 
less of a villainess and more of a vague symbol of danger. Mankiewicz won the 
Oscar for his screenplay along with the best director award. 
</P>
<P>
 The "serious" message that, ultimately, we should be happy with what we have 
and try to protect it, isn't hard to swallow, mainly because Mankiewicz and his 
actors bring a comic chagrin to most scenes that help to keep everything in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the casting often seems inspired. Sothern, with her breezy 
brittleness, is perfectly pitched as the forever-occupied Rita. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the guys, Kirk Douglas goes against type with the self-consciously 
intellectual George, but it works. 
</P>
<P>
 The same for steady, wry Paul Douglas, who turns Porter into one big hound dog 
of a character, tired out by the exasperating hunt that his marriage has become 
but still willing to take another run through the tangled woods. 
</P>

THAI-ING TOGETHER 2 FINE CUISINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Choosing a restaurant in Little Saigon is one of the most pleasant culinary 
dilemmas. Bolsa Avenue is lined with hundreds of places to eat: Vietnamese 
noodle houses hawking giant bowls of pho , faux -French sandwich shops for 
noshing on homemade pate inside crusty baguettes, Chinese dim sum emporia where 
women push carts laden with pint-sized pastries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nam Phuong is one restaurant you'd never even spot without a local guide. It's 
a boxy storefront where a scattering of glass-topped tables, a deli counter 
crowned by a plastic durian (an odorous tropical fruit) and a grand total of 
three red vinyl booths fit into less than 400 square feet of dining space. The 
only reason I stopped in was the sign reading "Vietnamese and Thai cuisine" -- 
an intriguing prospect. Most local restaurants serve a mix of Vietnamese and 
Chinese . That makes Nam Phuong a neighborhood rarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did I imagine that food here would turn out to be top-notch. There are 
two chefs in the kitchen, both women, both Vietnamese. One of them, it turns 
out, lived in Thailand for several years, where she all but mastered the art of 
Thai cooking. That makes it possible to combine the best of two Asian cuisines 
in one sitting, from a menu that has only one dish costing more than $6. Don't 
come expecting soft lighting or tablecloths. Do expect to have a great 
inexpensive meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The house lunch is only $4.50: one main course a choix , flanked by four tasty 
side dishes. First, you are served a delicious clear soup with potatoes, 
carrots and a single ball of spiced, minced meat. Then you choose between 
quail, beefsteak, five-spice chicken or other Vietnamese lunch staples. 
</P>
<P>
 The quail in particular are remarkable, two little birds cooked on a 
rotisserie and lightly perfumed with garlic and anise. The beefsteak is a good 
value, though it seems to have been tenderized. Accompanying the entrees are 
com chien (Vietnamese-style red rice), hot ga oeuf plat (the Franco-Viet name 
for fried egg) and a fine house salad of field greens topped with sliced onion 
and tomato in a vinaigrette dressing that puts those at Bolsa Avenue's many 
French restaurants to shame. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese appetizer goi cuon is another great lunch dish, and at 85 cents 
per portion (OK, $1.70 if you order two), it's possibly the most inexpensive 
lunch on the street. These are Vietnamese-style spring rolls served cold. 
Unlike their better known deep-fried cousin cha gio (imperial rolls), they are 
assembled out of a combination of raw and cooked ingredients. A thin rice-paper 
crepe is wrapped around leafy vegetables, shrimp and a piece of Chinese sausage 
placed strategically beneath the top skin. Dip one in some of the Hoisin and 
chili sauce already on your table, and voila , a veritable dejeuner sur 
l'herbe.  
</P>
<P>
 The Thai dishes make good lunches as well, the catch being that they are 
priced $1 to $2 higher than items from the Vietnamese side of the menu. Order 
gai yang in a Thai restaurant and you get charcoal-broiled chicken on the bone, 
spiced with turmeric, garlic and ginger. Nam Phuong serves the chicken in 
little pieces on wooden skewers, making a dream street food you can't stop 
eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Nam Phuong is one of the very few places on the avenue for som tam , the 
classic Thai salad made from shredded green papaya. This one is laced with tiny 
salted crabs, crushed peanuts and hot chilies, and hardly for the faint of 
heart. You eat it wrapped in cabbage leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 I like the restaurant's pho (rice noodle soups) as light suppers. Pho dac biet 
comes with lean slices of beef brisket and plenty of chopped green onions. Pho 
chin gan is a bowlful of contrasting textures: slippery rice noodles, crunchy 
beef tendon and unctuous bits of tripe. On the Thai side, you can find a 
classic like tom ka kai , the rich, spicy chicken soup made with coconut milk 
and served in an ornate silver tureen. A non- pho Vietnamese soup to try is bo 
vien -- odd, crunchy and delicious-tasting meatballs with a texture not unlike 
that of mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
 The rice plates are quick meals under $5. A good one is the dauntingly named 
com tam bi cha suon nuong. What you get is a lean charbroiled pork chop (bone 
in), a cube of eggy Vietnamese meat loaf, glass noodles, beef and shredded pork 
parts, all for mixing with your clump of partially smashed, steamed rice. 
Another one not to miss is com ga nuong xa , charbroiled chicken flavored with 
a shot of fragrant lemon grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Thai classics are here. You can get sauteed mussels in a spicy red 
chili sauce, the ubiquitous phad Thai noodles (a medley of shallots, dried 
shrimp, bean sprouts and fried rice noodles), tod mun pla (typically rubbery 
fish cakes in a strange red sauce), larb nuea (ground beef with rice powder and 
a powder keg's worth of chilies). 
</P>
<P>
 Almost no one comes here on a warm day without ordering sinh to , the icy 
Vietnamese sweet made from milk whipped with tropical fruits and enough sugar 
to make your teeth hurt. Depending on what is in season, you might get a 
version based on mango, pineapple or even the infamous durian. I can't say I'm 
a fan of Vietnamese desserts, which tend to be squiggly suspensions in 
translucent plastic cups sitting in a row on the top shelf of the restaurant's 
deli counter. 
</P>
<P>
 I did try one, something called suong na. I'd describe it as an other-worldly 
concoction of coffee, cream and lime green gelatin, in separate layers, sort of 
a Vietnamese pousse-cafe without the alcohol. The waitress laughed as she 
watched me bite in. All I got out of it was a mouthful of agar-agar jelly and a 
few chuckles from the women behind the counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nam Phuong is inexpensive, with dishes from 85 cents to $6.95.

LOST IN O.C.: IN A QUAKE, CATS AND PRESIDENTS SAY SQUAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Washburn, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to The Times Orange County Edition. T. Jefferson Parker's column resumes in 
this spot next week.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it's folk hokum, but I've always heard that animals are attuned to 
pending seismic discourtesies, that their keen animal senses feel the earth in 
flux long before we humans do. So you might expect that after years of one 
feeding, housing, medicating and cleaning gum off a pet, the very least it 
could do in return is share this information when an earthquake is about to 
pummel us. 
</P>
<P>
 My cat thinks nothing of waking me when he wants some Smelly Morsels at 3 
a.m., but on Big Monday he was content to instead let me wake to the sound of 
my 1920s Hawaiian koa wood Weisenborn guitar shattering on the floor while my 
house shook like the jewel in a belly dancer's navel. His cat thoughts, as I 
was best able to discern from retracing his footsteps later, were: "Earthquake 
coming: Better eat." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the problem with leaving food out for your pet. If he'd needed me to 
get up and open a can -- and I've been feeding him Sheba too, the fur slug! -- 
I wouldn't have been lying in bed when Satan snored at 4:31 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 By the way, did you happen to see the bit on the news where they interviewed 
the mother of the baby born during the quake? After noting it was a 6.6 shaker 
and that the infant's birth weight was 6 pounds, 6.6 ounces, the reporter asked 
the mom what they were naming the baby. Beelzebub or Little Moloch (they could 
always shorten it to Moe later) came to my mind, but the mom passed on her 
chance to further creep-out the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Have you noticed these tectonic utterances almost always occur in the early 
morning when we're in bed? Scientists claim that's not the case, and that 
there's no scientific reason for it to be, but when's the last time you went 
through an earthquake without pillow creases on your face? 
</P>
<P>
 I have an explanation: Suppose reality was a consensual thing, that all this 
matter around us was only bonded together by our common belief in it. We 
believe green paper has value, and it is so. We believe Regis Philbin is a 
celebrity, and it is so. It's not that big a jump from there to think that we 
also group-imagine the rest of what we hold to be firm and true. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 4:30 in the morning most of us are sleeping, and, left untended, 
reality might just start to break apart in big heaving chunks. Then we wake up, 
and order does its best to scamper back into place, like a pet you've caught on 
the kitchen counter, except mine would just hiss. 
</P>
<P>
 At the extreme end of this theory, the world would simply cease to exist if 
everyone on the planet fell asleep at the same time. Sorta makes you glad 
C-Span isn't carried globally, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't actually subscribe to this theory, though I do subscribe to The Times, 
which, like most papers, ran a splendid photo from a quake site last week of 
the President of the United States looking at a hole. He was hunkered down so 
as to get a better look at the thing, which to the un-Presidential eye looked 
like any other hole in the ground, except it had the President a-hunkered next 
to it.  
</P>
<P>
 It had dirt. It had depth. "It's a hole , all right," he seemed to be 
earnestly concluding, conscious of the cameras and setting the nation at ease 
that he does indeed know Les Aspin from a hole in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The photo caption read, in part, "President Clinton examines a crater. . ." 
which just reads nicer than, "The leader of the most powerful nation on Earth 
-- which he flew across at great taxpayer expense -- looks at a dang hole."  
</P>
<P>
 OK, it was more than a look. It was a concerned, compassionate gaze. But 
unless the President is possessed of the sort of Superman-like laser vision 
that can fuse water mains shut, he really isn't going to do much good in this 
situation. I like Bill Clinton, but I was hoping he'd be the first public 
leader to say, "I don't know squat about holes, though I'm sure you have a fine 
one. Why don't I stay put in Washington, and save you a boodle of money?" 
</P>
<P>
 The experts are estimating it's going to take mega-boodles to repair the 
damage here. Then there's the sagging property values, the expected drop-off in 
tourism and all that to factor in. It can look mighty grim.  
</P>
<P>
 But the geographical region that invented the frozen banana isn't going to 
take this lying down, is it? You bet it isn't! 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing we do is we stop treating these fault lines with such respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure they're inconceivably powerful forces with the life-shaking indifference 
of primal gods. But they're also holes in the ground! Anyone noticed the hue 
and cry in recent years over the shortage of landfill space? Put the garbage in 
the faults! Just dump it on in there and then let the tectonic plates even try 
anything sudden with all our mushy leftovers and Pampers in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it'll work, maybe it won't. At least it's another place to hide our 
garbage for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We all mourn the death and loss of these recent days, but as the President 
pointed out, we should also look at the opportunities presented us, photo and 
otherwise. One silver lining a friend pointed out is that there's nothing like 
having nature play dominoes with our freeways to get us looking at alternative 
mass transit. This is the perfect time to commit to a decent, effective, 
stress-relieving transit system, and I can think of no better model than the 
log flume rides that are so popular at Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would want to be frozen in traffic in a hot metal and plastic cage when 
you could be hurtling home in a stylish log, sluicing though a refreshing water 
spray as you and your new commuter buddies scream with childlike delight? 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to getting tourists to again view us as a golden destination, I 
think Southern California should take another cue from the theme parks. Namely, 
charge them admission.  
</P>
<P>
 What happens at Disneyland? People pay to get in, wait around a hellishly long 
time for the attractions, and then get shook, surprised and made faintly 
nauseous. So let's make all of Southern California the attraction, charge $28, 
and assure people that if they hang around long enough, a quake, fire or riot 
is sure to come along. We can use the money to repair the region, and if 
there's any left over, we could finance an excavation near Washington, D.C., so 
that our leaders can spend quality time with a hole whenever they like.

3-HOUR TOUR: RIDERS SADDLE UP FOR THE HAPPY TRAILS OF CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, Anne Michaud is a staff writer for The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking at Orange County from the back of a horse can call to mind the area's 
wild heritage of missions and rancheros. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for those who do not ride much, there is a very tame, guided trail 
tour in San Juan Capistrano. You must call ahead for reservations; one day's 
notice is ample. The cost is $20 a person. 
</P>
<P>
 9:40 to 10:40 a.m.: Weekend cowpokes need energy, so you might stop by Buffys 
Family Restaurant first for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 This former coffee shop has expanded its menu and space. But the employees are 
so friendly and down-home that they make you feel you stop there every morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu caters to people with big appetites. The "Five Deuces," for example, 
includes two eggs, two slices of bacon, two sausage links, two hot cakes and 
two nonalcoholic beverages for $5.59. 
</P>
<P>
 There are $2.99 specials for lighter eaters. The waffle ($2.59) is served 
slightly crispy and is very good. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffys' informality is charming. Behind the counter is a photo of a baby with 
a grease smear on his (or her) forehead and the caption, "I love truckers." 
</P>
<P>
 Another casual touch is the Bio-Rhythm machine just inside the front door. For 
a quarter you can dial your birthday, and the machine will tell you your scores 
for any other day of your choice. 
</P>
<P>
 My "endurance" and "leisure plans" scores for the day of the horseback ride 
were low, which didn't bode well. However, "luck" was running high. 
</P>
<P>
 10:40 to 11: Make your way over to the Sycamore Trails Stables. 
</P>
<P>
 If you drive along Camino Capistrano, you will pass the Bathgate family 
Christmas tree farm on your left. Just above it curves Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Every once in a while, a car careens off the freeway and drops into the tree 
farm. Employees never know when they will find a car there in the morning, a 
Bathgate family member once told me. 
</P>
<P>
 11 to 12:30: Sycamore Trails asks that riders arrive half an hour early. 
You'll want to leave behind anything you can't carry in a pocket. Bring $20 to 
pay for your fare at the front office and some spare change for later. 
</P>
<P>
 The desk attendant will give you a name tag and direct you out to where Molly 
operates the trail ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Over rippled potato chips and an orange soda, she explained some rules of the 
trail: Walking only, no trotting. If you drop anything, she'll pick it up for 
you. Stay three feet behind the horse in front. Pull the reins toward your 
stomach if you want the horse to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Molly matches riders with horses based on experience and temperament. A 
4-year-old girl, who was planning to ride with her dad, secured Popeye, who 
likes kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail itself is an hour's ride. It crosses a couple of streams and ascends 
and descends some small hills. For the most part, it is flat and dusty. 
</P>
<P>
 At this time of year, the trail is lined with sun-baked reeds and leafless 
bushes. An orange tree pops up here and there, bearing fruit. Sycamore trees 
and cacti appear on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Molly, who leads the single file of horses, calls out instructions to riders 
as they proceed. Lean forward when traveling uphill. Don't tip yourself to 
either side, or your saddle may slip. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail winds against the face of some steep, parched foothills. For a 
moment, I thought I saw Jesse James galloping across. But a single-family 
subdivision peaked between a pair of hills, and the illusion was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 12:30 to 12:40: Back at the front office, pull that spare change out of your 
pocket and buy yourself a can of soda. You'll be thirsty after this ride. 
</P>
<P>
 If you like, you can lean against the corral fence, just across the road, 
where instructors are training some real riders.

CITY HALL NEWS: ELSEWHERE

<TEXT>
<P>
 ALHAMBRA: The City Council has given preliminary approval to rezone some 
properties south of Mission Road and west of Atlantic Boulevard from 
multifamily housing to single-family. In addition, the council approved a 
$73,094 contract with Aquatic Design Group. Inc. to redesign Granada Park Pool 
and Poolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 COVINA: Eastern Los Angeles County cities hope to break a deadlock next week 
over replacing former Covina Mayor Henry Morgan as their representative on the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District. Morgan, recalled from the Covina 
City Council, will vacate his seat Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 DIAMOND BAR: The city is $2.3 million richer because the county has agreed to 
return four years' worth of disputed property tax revenue. The out-of-court 
settlement calls for the county to repay the revenue -- withheld between 1989 
and 1993 -- in three installments, and permanently changes the method of 
determining property tax allocation to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 DUARTE: Winston Bautista has been appointed to a four-year term on the city's 
Planning Commission. He is a senior designer at the Pasadena office of 
McClellan Cruz Gaylord & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA -- Severo Esquivel, 55, was sworn in as Pomona's city administrator on 
Monday, replacing interim city administrator Lloyd Wood, who will continue in 
his capacity as police chief. Esquivel served as deputy city manager in San 
Diego for more than five years.

CITY HALL NEWS: BRADBURY; COUNCIL NAMES 2 TO FILL SEATS VACATED IN RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bradbury City Council appointed two new members Monday to fill seats 
vacated in November's recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Mark Flewelling and Rick Barakat were the only candidates to file for 
the posts, the city made the appointments in lieu of an election. 
</P>
<P>
 Flewelling, a business attorney and six-year Bradbury resident, was appointed 
to fill the seat of former Mayor Audrey Hon. Barakat, a business-owner and 
four-year resident, will fill the seat of former Councilman Tom Melbourn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hon and Melbourn were recalled in November, seven months after former City 
Manager Aurora (Dolly) Vollaire was fired for spending tens of thousands of 
city dollars on personal luxury items. Some residents complained that council 
members had failed to notice Vollaire's spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members new and old said Monday's appointments heralded a new era of 
clean government and community involvement in Bradbury.  
</P>
<P>
 "What I hope to do first is to restore confidence in city hall," Flewelling 
said of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Flewelling said he hopes to more closely scrutinize city contracts, some of 
which he said never went to bid during Vollaire's term, and diversify the 
city's investments in order to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
 He also hopes to open the line of communication to city officials, and bring 
residents of the city's disparate council districts together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we need to restore a sense of community. Certainly the last year 
has been a tumultuous one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barakat won local fame when he dug through the city trash with resident Robert 
Penney Jr. last spring, uncovering city credit card receipts that betrayed 
Vollaire's expensive tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main thing is just to try to make it harmonious," he said. "I want to make 
our city hall and its staff resident-friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 The new mix on the council should strengthen the city, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pure iron is pure iron, but it takes impurities to make steel, the product 
you can use," he said. "I think our council needs diversity to make it strong. 
We've got a broader mix of backgrounds now." 
</P>
<P>
 The new council members join Mayor Audrey Chamberlain, a homemaker, Beatrice 
LaPisto-Kirtley, principal of Glassell Park Elementary School in Los Angeles, 
and John H. Richards, a Caltech professor who served as Bradbury's mayor for 
six years.

LOBBYISTS, LAWYERS ARE SURE WINNERS IN FIGHT OVER FREEWAY; TRANSPORTATION: 
ALHAMBRA AND SOUTH PASADENA HAVE SPENT MORE THAN $1.3 MILLION ARGUING OVER 
HIGHWAY EXTENSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether the extension of the Long Beach (710) Freeway is approved or rejected, 
three groups are sure to have benefited from the struggle: the army of 
lobbyists, lawyers and public relations people employed by South Pasadena and 
Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 On the pro-freeway side in Alhambra, where streets are jammed daily by 
thousands of cars spilling onto and off the dead-end freeway, $439,424 has been 
spent on a cadre of legal advisers, Washington insiders and public relations 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena, which would lose 315 homes and see its largely upscale 
residential neighborhoods sliced in half, has so far paid $875,208 to 
attorneys, lobbying firms and planners to argue the anti-freeway cause. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Farfsing said South Pasadena probably will spend much 
more on a massive lawsuit if the California Transportation Commission and 
Federal Highway Administration approve Caltrans' 6.2-mile extension of the 
freeway between the San Bernardino and Foothill freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit would challenge the environmental report on the north-south route 
that would run from the Alhambra city limits, through a portion of Los Angeles, 
South Pasadena and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the freeway fight say legal and lobbying costs have escalated since 
the late 1980s. The South Pasadena City Council at that time decided to use 
Community Redevelopment Agency funds to hire Antonio Rossmann, a respected 
$200-per-hour environmental lawyer, and Ochoa & Sillas, a $90-per-hour 
Sacramento lobbying firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel these people are lining their pockets at the taxpayers' expense," said 
Robert O. Cook, a member of the South Pasadena Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, 1989, Rossmann has been paid $389,049 for work on the freeway. 
Ochoa & Sillas, led by Ralph Ochoa, ex-chief of staff for the state Assembly 
Speaker, has taken in $351,902 since December, 1988. Last month, the city 
manager hired Cochran & Lotkin, a Los Angeles and Washington law firm, to lobby 
the federal government. Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. is also Michael Jackson's and 
Reginald Denny's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra has fought back. It has paid the Los Angeles law firm of Burke, 
Williams & Sorensen $233,004, Read Communications of Pasadena $115,839 and 
Washington lobbying firm The Ferguson Group $77,541 to make its point. Read, 
Ferguson and another Washington lobbying firm, Marc & Associates, are all paid 
monthly retainers of $2,000 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena leaders agree that the freeway fight is costly for a small city 
with a $16-million budget. But they say the consultants have earned their pay 
because there still is no freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa helped persuade the National Trust for Historic Preservation to 
designate South Pasadena as one of "America's Most Endangered Places." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Rossmann successfully challenged a 1982 state law that allowed 
Caltrans to build the freeway through South Pasadena without its permission. 
The judge said the legislation had expired. The decision has been appealed and 
the issue remains clouded. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra officials describe their pro-freeway campaign as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are spending on this issue is absolutely justifiable. We want traffic 
off our streets and onto the freeway," said Julio J. Fuentes, city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've spent $5 for every resident compared to $37 for South Pasadena," he 
said, noting that Alhambra has 82,000 residents compared to its northern 
neighbor's 24,000 residents. Costs of the Freeway Fight 05,26,09,10,10,10 SOUTH

DUARTE THEATER TRIUMPHS IN OFFSTAGE DRAMA; FINANCES: COMMUNITY PLAYHOUSE AVERTS 
CLOSURE OVER PAST-DUE RENT WITH THE HELP OF 'ANGELS' IN THE WINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Duarte Center Theatre staged a nail-biter last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, however, took place offstage and threatened the future of the 
fledgling community theater. Fortunately for Duarte theater, a dramatic rescue 
enabled the show to go on. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the theater's director, Mary Bowman, was taking ticket orders last 
week for her company's season opening adaptation of Gilbert and Sullivan's 
"Ruddigore," she wasn't sure she had a venue from which to stage the satire. 
Bowman and the Duarte Center Theatre were locked out of the theater, at 2160 E. 
Huntington Drive, all week after being evicted for not paying rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, who is in her 60s and has been staging shows for 15 years, had not 
paid rent for the theater since she brought it to Duarte a year ago. She said 
that money has been tight because public support for the theater was building 
slowly. Bowman's attorney, John Blackburn, said she had spent money improving 
the facility and that there was also a dispute, now resolved, over how much the 
landlord should pay of the improvements' costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest problem is being undercapitalized," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no question that Duarte Center Theatre owed landlord Harry Nazarian 
money. Municipal Court proceedings determined that the theater owed $18,708 in 
rent. "They never paid rent. They just kept giving excuses," said Diran 
Afarian, Nazarian's son-in-law and real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes were raised when Nazarian agreed in September to give Duarte Center 
Theatre another chance to enliven the Duarte arts scene. The compromise called 
for the theater to begin repaying a modest chunk of its debt on a payment 
schedule before resuming regular rent. "We worked out what we thought would be 
an exceptionally reasonable plan for them, but they haven't been able to 
comply," Peter E. Ronay, Nazarian's lawyer, said last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the opening date fast approaching, it looked like curtains for the Duarte 
Center Theatre's 1994 season. Then came the white knights. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Kevin Kaufman, the 43-year-old executive director of Broadway on 
Sunset, a North Hollywood-based theater company. "We are the only West Coast 
theater exclusively producing originals," said Kaufman, whose group is also 
sponsored by the Songwriter's Guild of America and features two-time Tony award 
winner Grover Dale as creative director. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman had planned to launch five original shows this year on the Duarte 
theater's cabaret stage. Two more were scheduled for the 99-seat main stage, 
including "American Twistory." 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership with Duarte Center Theatre elevates the status of the 
community theater, Kaufman said, while allowing him to reach new audiences. "We 
are interested in areas that are not saturated with theater and are interested 
in original musicals," Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Kaufman heard that Duarte's 1994 season might be lost, he had 
already sent out fliers and releases touting the partnership. To help save the 
season, Kaufman and his managing director, Ron Gaiser, lit into a frantic 
fund-raising drive that netted a couple of thousand dollars. Kaufman would not 
give an exact figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it for Duarte because of our interests," Kaufman said. But they were 
still short of the more than $8,000 that Duarte Center Theatre needed to get 
back the keys to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the city of Duarte pitched in. City Manager Jesse H. Duff authorized 
advance ticket purchases of $4,000 to aid the theater. Duff said the city will 
resell the tickets later. "We think they bring enough of value to the city to 
support them," Duff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined efforts of the city and Kaufman, along with last-minute donations 
Bowman was able to obtain, raised enough money to get the theater back in the 
door. The final hurdle was to resolve some lingering animus between Bowman and 
Nazarian -- which their lawyers were finally able to do late last Thursday -- 
in time for a rehearsal or two before the weekend's preview shows.

RELIGION; ETHNIC DINNERS REFLECT JEWISH HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were no bagels, lox, gefilte fish or other typically Jewish delicacies 
served at the Congregation Shaarei Torah Temple in Arcadia on Saturday night. 
Instead, members ate black beans, baked bananas and white rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it kosher? 
</P>
<P>
 "One hundred percent," said Evita Maya, a Cuban-born congregation member who 
prepared a Cuban meal for about 100 members and guests who attended the first 
in a series of ethnic dinners at the temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people in this nation stereotype Jews as being of European descent only, 
and they aren't," said Octavious David, 27, a congregation member who was 
raised in Honduras and lives in Arcadia. "(Jews) are of many different faces -- 
Latin, Indian, Arabic. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Latino Jews are a double minority -- and a relative rarity. 
Organizations that combine the two are rare, but one recently sprouted in 
Orange County, where about 200 Jews of Latino background have recently found 
camaraderie in the new Club Hebreo Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 At the temple in Arcadia, Maya and David are among less than a dozen Latino 
Jews in their congregation, which has more than 300 members. 
</P>

 Congregation leaders say the new ethnic dinners are meant to expand the

MEDIA; CHINESE TV CHANNEL EXPANDS PROGRAMMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A South El Monte company has become the first in the country to offer 
Chinese-language programming via satellite 24 hours a day. This year, it also 
became the first to broadcast the Rose Parade in Mandarin and Cantonese. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese Communication Channel, established in 1989, is eagerly tapping 
into a vast audience of Chinese speakers across the country, putting out a mix 
of its own and imported programming, and selling satellites to help customers 
receive Chinese-language programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can honestly claim we are the one and only in the U.S. to go 24 hours, as 
far as Asian television. We really do see the potential in the Asian market," 
said Jocelyn Chan, director for sales and marketing for the company, a division 
of North American Television. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers with access to the five cable companies that carry CCC throughout the 
Southland, or the one Seattle cable company that carries it, can still watch 
the Chinese-language programming only in blocks. But last November, Time Warner 
Cable in New York started offering the programming 24 hours a day. As of Jan. 
1, viewers who have a satellite dish can also tap into continuous programming, 
Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Programs are mostly in Mandarin, but all are subtitled in Chinese characters, 
which do not vary among dialects, Chan added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Parade was broadcast live, with Mandarin- and Cantonese-speaking 
commentators offering description and analysis, and complete with major 
corporate sponsors. It was so successful, Chan said, callers asked that it be 
rerun twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will be broadcast in two Mainland Chinese provinces early next 
month, around the time of Chinese New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crown, ATC, TCI and Apollo cable companies carry CCC in Southern California. 
The Feb. 12 Chinese New Year's Parade in Alhambra will also be broadcast live, 
Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The response shows just how big and eager the Chinese-speaking market is, Chan 
said. Programming expanded from six to 12 hours in September, and then to 24 
hours last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Satellite dish orders handled through the company's satellite division 
skyrocketed, from about 170 a month when CCC offered only six hours of 
programming to 300 a month when programming went to 12 hours in September. So 
far this month, the company has received about 80 orders a day, Chan said.

POLICE BLOTTER; AROUND THE VALLEY . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

equipment from a car. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: A 27-year-old man tried to set ablaze his grandmother's four-door 
sedan after she refused to lend him the vehicle Saturday afternoon, police 
said. Glen Haft of Arcadia tried to borrow the car parked in the 2300 block of 
South Fifth Avenue at about 3:30 p.m., but when his grandmother refused to give 
him the keys, he stuffed a rag into the gas tank and lit it, police said. Haft 
was arrested and is still in custody on charges of of burglary and arson. His 
grandmother extinguished the fire before it damaged the car. 
</P>
<P>
 BALDWIN PARK: Over a dozen rifle rounds were fired into a house at 13518

of Gale Avenue at about 12:45 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 MONTEREY PARK: Police will set up a sobriety checkpoint Friday. The checkpoint 
will be established after dark at an undisclosed location in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 MONROVIA: Two carjackings were reported to Monrovia police over the weekend. 
The first occurred in the 400 block of East Olive Avenue about 9 p.m. Saturday 
after a man pretending to have a weapon in his pocket stopped and stole a white 
1980 Audi, Police Sgt. Rick Miglia said. The Audi was recovered Sunday at 2:23 
p.m. about four blocks from the scene of the crime. The car stereo was stolen. 
The second carjacking occurred at 2:08 Monday morning in the 500 block of South 
Ivy Avenue and involved two men pretending to have weapons in their pockets and 
then making off with a 1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass, Miglia said. No arrests have 
been made.

<P>
 WALNUT: Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies and county Children's Services 
workers rescued a 4-month-old boy born addicted to cocaine after his 
16-year-old mother allegedly snatched him from his Walnut foster home. A 
neighbor jotted down the license plate of the car in which the mother arrived, 
enabling authorities to track the baby down in Long Beach. Authorities had to 
act quickly because the baby, who also has epilepsy, needed medication. The 
mother and three alleged accomplices were arrested.

SHOOTING DEATHS OF 2 TEEN-AGERS LINKED TO ASIAN GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two San Gabriel Valley youths died last week in separate incidents after 
shouting matches escalated into shootings outside a Hacienda Heights high 
school and an El Monte video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Barraza, 17, was shot three times in the chest about 3:10 p.m. last 
Thursday after arguing with a carload of other teen-agers in the parking lot of 
Los Altos High School, said Lt. Leonard Tyko of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Barraza, a cornerback for the school's junior varsity football team, was 
pronounced dead on arrival at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina. No 
arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Donald White called the incident shocking and said nothing like it 
had ever happened at Los Altos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no evidence at all that there were any Los Altos students involved in 
this," he said. About 1,600 attend the high school. 
</P>
<P>
 White added that Los Altos was named a California Distinguished School last 
year, based on test scores and student achievement, by the state Department of 
Education. "We have one of the lowest suspension rates in the state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students and parents said Los Altos is a safe campus, but some students 
said they had friends who had brought guns to school, and they talked about 
tensions between an Asian gang and Latino students at Los Altos. Barraza's 
attackers were Asian, Tyko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barraza was described by teachers and fellow students as "a good kid, quiet 
and shy" and "a cool friend." Family members declined comment, but priests at 
St. John Vianney Church in Hacienda Heights, where Barraza's memorial service 
was held Wednesday and where he was confirmed last year, said the youth had no 
known gang affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 An Asian gang is being blamed in another death over the weekend, this time of 
a Vietnamese youth. Linh Bao Vuong, 14, of Alhambra was beaten and fatally shot 
outside the Arroyo Arcade in El Monte, Deputy Gabe Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vuong was approached by a carload of gang members as he and his friends left 
the video arcade and pool hall, at 10755 Lower Azusa Road, to use a pay phone 
about 10 p.m. Friday night, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four gang members shouted at Vuong and asked him for his gang affiliation, 
then began beating and kicking him. After Vuong was on the ground, one of the 
four shot him several times in the upper body with a handgun, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vuong was taken to Methodist Hospital in Arcadia, where he remained in 
critical condition through the weekend. He was declared brain-dead about 1:15 
p.m. Monday, said hospital spokesperson Nancy Dolan. A life-support system kept 
him alive until midnight, when his family decided to let surgeons remove some 
of his organs for donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Vuong was not enrolled in the Alhambra School District, officials reported.

DMV: EXTENDED OFFICE HOURS ARE NICE, BUT WHERE ARE THE HANDBOOKS IN ENGLISH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is about the DMV article of Jan. 13, Page 6.It's commendable that DMV has 
extended hours and changed days of operation to accommodate the public, but 
they have neglected to state that there are no English versions of the handbook 
available. Unless you read Spanish or Vietnamese, you're in trouble. Not only 
are English books not available, but the staff at the Pomona office is not 
interested in calling other DMV offices in the area for you to see if they 
might have several books.

710 FREEWAY: NOT ALL IN ALHAMBRA FAVOR IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Alhambra (former) Councilman Michael J. Messina's letter on Jan. 13, 
we would like to clarify one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Messina speaks about Alhambra's support of the 710 Freeway extension as if he 
is speaking for the entire city, not just the City Council and Redevelopment 
Agency, which have staked the city's plans on the construction of this concrete 
monstrosity. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many Alhambra residents oppose the freeway for reasons that have 
nothing to do with South Pasadena. Messina and his colleagues have received 
letters and petitions telling them of our concerns, but we have been dutifully 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Alhambra residents are angry at the prospect of having our neighborhoods 
disrupted by 10 years of freeway construction, as the Century Freeway did in 
Los Angeles. Nor do we believe that this $651-million transportation 
"improvement" will do much to improve traffic along Valley Boulevard, which is 
heavily congested through Alhambra, San Gabriel and Rosemead, or along 
north-south arterials such as Atlantic Boulevard, Del Mar Avenue or Rosemead 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike South Pasadena, which is pursuing a "low build" alternative to the 
freeway, we would rather have Caltrans look at solutions for the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who drive the streets of the San Gabriel Valley know that roads 
from Alhambra to Pomona are woefully in need of widening, left-turn lanes and 
synchronized signals. Why should California taxpayers spend upward of $651 
million to alleviate traffic just in Alhambra and Pasadena? 
</P>
<P>
 Since street congestion is our agreed-upon problem, we should look to regional 
street improvements to solve them. How many drivers have asked why Alhambra has 
only one through lane of southbound traffic on Fremont Avenue at Valley 
Boulevard? Situations like these are our real problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, which has similar traffic difficulties, is building a "super 
street" system instead of more freeways to combat its growing gridlock. A 
"super street" has three open lanes of traffic in each direction, left- and 
right-turn lanes, timed lights, bus bays and no street parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's first super street project is a seven-mile section of Beach 
Boulevard through Buena Park and Westminster. While it is similar in length to 
the proposed 6.2-mile 710 Freeway extension, there is no similarity in cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beach Boulevard super street, which is nearly complete, is now estimated 
to cost nearly $11 million. That is about 1/60 the cost of the $651-million 710 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps we should look to our suburban neighbors to the south for a solution 
that is affordable, economical and, best of all, immediately do-able.

MULTICULTURAL MEDICINE; HOSPITALS ARE GOING BEYOND CURSORY MEASURES TO

<P>
 The morning after Suwen Shen's son was born, a Garfield Medical Center nurse 
swaddled her baby in a red-and-green blanket -- avoiding white, the traditional 
Chinese funeral color. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurse also brought a breakfast tray with a man tou roll, rice porridge and 
warmed soybean milk, knowing that in Chinese culture, cold fluids are taboo for 
new mothers and sick people. 
</P>
<P>
 Shen, a 31-year-old Taiwanese native, blissfully turned her thoughts away from 
nagging superstitions and toward her newborn, who, she hinted on the 
mid-January day after his birth, already has the makings of a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me feel like home," said Shen, a south Orange County resident who 
came to the Monterey Park hospital primarily because of its multicultural 
environment. "It made me feel like they care and respect our culture." As the 
San Gabriel Valley's demographics change, Garfield Medical Center and a few 
other hospitals are extending themselves beyond the basics of providing 
translators, multiethnic staffs and trilingual signs and forms, actions that 
cost tens of thousands of dollars. These efforts -- no matter how expensive -- 
are not always enough in a fiercely competitive health-care market, in which 
hospitals are offering more culturally based extras than ever before. In 
ethnically diverse areas such as Monterey Park and Alhambra, hospitals are 
boning up on the folklore and traditions of their multicultural communities, 
sometimes even bending the rules for the sake of a patient's or family's peace 
of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a major trend in the hospital community toward the increasing 
recognition of ethnic and racial diversity," said David Langness, a vice 
president of the Hospital Council of Southern California trade group. "I see 
hospitals beginning to go beyond the standard signs in different languages and 
staff people who can translate etc., into a deeper recognition of the cultural 
differences in certain populations and ways to treat them." 
</P>
<P>
 The push for cultural awareness is part business, part goodwill, said 
Langness. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing in Los Angeles and Southern California is the first world 
metropolis," he said. "Hospitals have to respond to that . . . if they don't, 
they'll lose patients. It's not a matter of being politically correct. It's a 
matter of responding to your patients' needs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asian culture is particularly rich with ancient superstitions associated with 
milestones, such as birth and death -- beliefs that hospitals such as Garfield, 
where Asians account for 55% of the patients, cannot afford to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Other hospitals with relatively large minority populations include Alhambra 
Hospital, where Asian, white and Latino patients are seen in roughly equal 
numbers; and San Gabriel Valley Medical Center, where patients are 55% white, 
26% Latino, 16% Asian and 3% other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena -- the Valley's 
largest -- only 7% of the patients are Asian and 22% are Latino, according to 
1992 statistics, the latest available. Consequently, Huntington and other 
hospitals with fewer minority patients have made relatively few changes to 
accommodate ethnic populations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The nod to multiculturalism in medicine is sometimes as simple as adding a 
pair of chopsticks to a hospital tray or as thoughtful as offering gift-shop 
wrapping paper in the Chinese lucky color of red, the way Alhambra Hospital 
does. 
</P>
<P>
 Or as savvy as providing mahjong sets for Asian recreational therapy patients, 
the way Garfield does. 
</P>
<P>
 Or as community-minded as celebrating the Chinese New Year on Feb. 10 with 
gifts for newborns, the way San Gabriel Valley Medical Center in San Gabriel 
will do. 
</P>
<P>
 On a deeper level, hospital staffs are learning about and accommodating the 
traditional rituals that some families and patients swear by. At several local 
hospitals, for instance, expectant Chinese mothers who need Cesarean sections 
ask their doctor to deliver at an auspicious time and day, as selected by a 
fortuneteller. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield nurses say they will wrap the nutrient-rich placenta in a plastic bag 
for Vietnamese mothers who take it home to eat or for Filipino mothers who bury 
the placenta with books in the belief that the ritual will make the baby smart. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Alhambra Hospital, administrator Elaine Reavis remembers the time last 
November when a Chinese Buddhist family asked that a loved one's body stay in 
the hospital room for eight hours after death so the soul would have a chance 
to depart while a monk chanted the proper prayers. The hospital agreed to bend 
its rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Tied to the respect for tradition is a recognition of the mind's power to 
heal, said Pitzer College sociology Professor Jose Calderon. For instance, 
Calderon said, when he was sick as a boy, his mother put potatoes on his head 
as a way to draw the fever out, an old Mexican folk remedy that he says is 
medically harmless but psychologically healing if a patient believes that such 
a "cure" works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the real significance of all this -- to really build up the living 
force of the patient, the desire to keep themselves alive," said Calderon, 
chairman of the Alhambra School District's Human Relations Advisory Committee 
on ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be something the medical world says this doesn't work, but it would be 
very disrespectful to tell someone that it doesn't work," he said. "We have to 
be able to integrate what our beliefs are in terms of our traditions and 
contemporary medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors who ignore other cultures can risk more than offending people, said 
Dr. Jeffrey Tsai, a Chinese American urologist and chief of staff at Alhambra 
Hospital. For example, some Vietnamese and Chinese patients put heated 
porcelain bottles filled with alcohol against their skin, in an attempt to suck 
out the sickness. The hot pressure leaves marks that look like bruises, he 
said, leading some doctors to mistakenly suspect domestic or child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Even doctors who are sensitive to patients' needs have limits, said Dr. Thomas 
Tam, chairman of the obstetrics department at Garfield. For instance, 
physicians will not approve Cesarean sections for mothers who don't need them, 
he said. But Tam, who is Chinese American, will go along with mothers who 
require Cesareans and want to deliver at a predetermined lucky time, even if he 
has to work on a holiday or at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If it doesn't hinder the general good practice of medicine, I will comply to 
make her happier for psychological reasons," Tam said. "I will run the extra 
mile, beyond the call of duty, to make her happier in her cultural needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Asian residents with longtime roots in the United States sometimes find 
it hard to shake the old ways, said Marina Tse, co-chair of the Multi-Cultural 
Community Assn. of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up listening to it, exposed to it, and people gave me examples of it 
(working)," said Tse, a Monterey Park resident who has a master's degree in 
special education from USC. "You forget about logical thinking. Somehow my 
heart's afraid a little bit (of not following tradition)." 
</P>
<P>
 In Chinese culture, superstitions are passed through the generations over 
thousands of years, with the same fervor that prompts ailing Americans to turn 
to chicken soup, said Tse, who has advised local hospitals on such traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the common clashes with Chinese tradition: hospital beds that don't face 
south, believed to be the only lucky direction; decor in blue and white, which 
are traditional funeral colors; assigning patients to a room No. 4, a number 
that sounds like the Chinese word for death; and prescriptions written in red, 
an ink color chosen when a writer wants to signify the end of something, such 
as a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Most patients do not demand such changes, hospital administrators said. But 
they are grateful for small favors -- the little touches that make them feel 
that a hospital respects their roots. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning at Alhambra Hospital, 77-year-old patient T.P. Wu was 
recovering from injuries resulting from a bad fall. The Taiwanese native clad 
in pajamas sat on his bed, circling his meal choices from the Chinese-language 
menu. A stack of Chinese newspapers was on his bed, delivered by hospital 
staff. On his night stand was a thermos of hot water, brought by nurses who 
knew that he would want to avoid cold liquids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, Wu had the option of watching a Chinese language documentary 
on the in-house cable system. When he is discharged, he'll pass by original 
Chinese calligraphy scrolls in the admitting room. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone respects us and understands what we want, it helps us recuperate," 
said his grateful wife, Li Ming Lu, through a hospital-provided translator. 
</P>
<P>
 The respect also gets business. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, after a Chinese Eastern Airlines flight from Shanghai crashed in 
Alaska, 20 of 160 injured passengers made their way to Alhambra Hospital, said 
Iris Lai, the hospital's director of marketing. A group of recuperating 
passengers had asked to be transferred to Los Angeles, their original flight 
destination, where they heard about Alhambra Hospital's staff and services from 
local doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lai and the hospital's Chinese chef, Benny Chung, visited each patient's 
bedside, asking for meal requests. Chung then whipped up individual requests 
for broccoli beef, sweet and sour pork and pickled vegetables in the hospital's 
kitchen, which is equipped with a special Chinese range, wok and rice cooker. 
The crash victims left Alhambra with only one complaint -- the hospital had 
served no shrimp dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital staffs are also learning about the psyche of patients who come from 
countries in which the Western practice of medicine is often bewildering. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia has presented ethnic 
awareness seminars to avoid misunderstandings, said Marcia Jackson, an 
administrator for the parent company. Staff members have learned, for instance, 
that some Asian patients avoid eye contact, a sign of respect in their culture, 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Asian cultures, doctors are often looked upon as gods, and patients tend to 
be blindly obedient, said Wendy Chan, the Chinese American director of 
marketing at Garfield Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just follow, like the Holy Bible," Chan said. In staff training, nurses 
are instructed to press Asian patients for questions and make sure they 
understand the doctor's instructions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients come to Garfield from as far away as San Diego for multicultural 
services that include ultrasound cards in English, Spanish or Chinese labeled, 
"Baby's First Picture" and trilingual classes on breast self-examination, 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and prostate cancer, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one complaint that I have is they're so popular here," said Richard Eng, 
whose pregnant wife could not get a spot in the hospital's Chinese-language 
Lamaze classes. 
</P>

 Eng, 30, a resident of North Hills in the San Fernando Valley, said the 
40-minute drive to the hospital is worth it because the Chinese nurses and 
doctors there understand the needs of his Hong Kong-born wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just hiring bilingual nurses and putting up a few signs," said Eng, 
an engineer. "Cultures are very different. There are a lot of little things 
that not everyone knows. It's a big commitment (to learn)." 
</P>
<P>
 Asian traditions are among the most complex; hospital administrators say it is 
usually easier to meet the needs of other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino patients, for instance, tend to have long visits from members of their 
extended family. Consequently, San Gabriel Valley Medical Center designed 
extra-large maternity rooms for its new obstetrics unit, which opened in June, 
1993, said Virginia Gladwin, administrative director of obstetric services.

 At Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina, nurses have allowed Hindu 
families to sprinkle rose petals around a loved one's dead body and a family 
from the Middle East to pour honey on the head of a newborn baby as a blessing, 
said Vivian Branchick, vice president of patient care services. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some health-care providers are refusing to acknowledge even the basics 
of multiculturalism, said Calderon, the Pitzer College professor. Last year, he 
said, his Spanish-speaking grandmother died in a Monterey Park convalescent 
home that had "English Only" signs posted for its workers. Calderon was the 
only one who was able to feed his grandmother, though he did this by trickery. 
He would ask questions like, "Com o se llama?" ("what's your name") and would 
spoon in the food when she opened her mouth to answer -- something she would 
not do with English speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It showed a real insensitivity," he said of the convalescent home's 
English-only policy. "Those kinds of things still exist." Patient Populations 
</P>

 The following is an ethnic breakdown of patients in selected local hospitals, 
according to the latest available statistics:

 Alhambra Hospital, Alhambra White 36% Asian 31% Latino 30% Other 3%

WHITTIER; CENTER HELPS DISABLED BE SELF-SUFFICIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Litman's afternoon rock 'n' roll break will have to wait. For the next 
half-hour he will be busy, under the watchful eye of his trainer, preparing 
turkey sandwiches for the next two days' lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a week, Litman, who is mentally retarded, is visited by his life-skills 
trainer, Jennifer Walker. Litman, 33, turns down his stereo, heads straight for 
the kitchen and begins pulling vegetables from the refrigerator. His four 
sandwiches look like a garden salad between bread, with only a paper-thin piece 
of turkey hidden under cucumbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of his goals last year was to lose weight," said Walker, who has worked 
with Litman for more than a year. Litman also wanted to start saving money, and 
he opened a savings account. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than planning, Litman needs little help these days. Since high school, 
he has become more and more self-sufficient with the aid of the Career 
Assessment Placement Center in Whittier, which teaches mentally and physically 
disabled adults job and living skills. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives in an apartment with another disabled adult, is engaged to a woman he 
met in the program, has been employed at the same job for five years and comes 
and goes as he pleases on Whittier buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Hulbert, the center's director, said the program, which receives about 
$1.6 million a year in state funds and grants, begins serving clients when they 
are in high school and helps them throughout their adult lives. Most similar 
programs help clients during school or during the transition to independent 
living, but don't have the continuity of the Placement Center, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Litman was one of the first to go through the center's three-phase program, 
beginning in 1981. He learned to work in a restaurant, busing tables and 
stocking supplies. After high school, he learned "societal survival skills" 
such as how to read a bus route and shop for groceries. This part of the 
program usually lasts until the student turns 22. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third phase, disabled adults are assigned an independent-living trainer 
and a job coach, who works side by side with a disabled adult.  
</P>
<P>
 The program matches the clients with volunteer organizations and employers.  
</P>
<P>
 Susan Hartley, the center's job placement specialist, helps the center's 90 
clients find jobs stocking warehouses, preparing fast food and working as 
cashiers in Santa Fe Springs, Whittier and Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 Litman works at Polly's Pies in Whittier, where he cleans and boxes pie tins 
and tidies up work areas from 8 to 11 a.m. He is paid $4.35 an hour. His coach, 
Cynthia Poe, stops by just twice a month to check his progress with the store's 
supervisor, Robert Hoffman. Litman is never late and does an excellent job, 
Hoffman said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CERRITOS; RIDING BUS TO SCHOOL WILL BE FREE IN FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning in the fall, students will no longer have to pay a fee to be bused 
to schools in the ABC Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board, which had received complaints from parents, voted 4 to 3 
last week to eliminate the fee.The district charged $200 to $600 for passes for 
310 students who ride buses to elementary, middle and high schools. The fees 
have generated $50,000 for the district this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees were imposed last summer in an attempt to trim the district's losses in 
the school-busing program, Assistant Supt. Patricia Koch said. Last year, the 
district spent $1.2 million on bus service but received about $900,000 from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Dixie Primosch, Robert Hughlett and Jim Weisenberger opposed the 
decision to drop the fees, saying the school district could not afford to lose 
more money on busing. 
</P>
<P>
 The ABC district operates schools in Cerritos, Artesia, Hawaiian Gardens and 
surrounding communities.

BRIEFS; IRWINDALE OKS CONCEPT FOR HUGE DISNEY-STYLE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irwindale City Council has given thumbs up to an idea for a 
Disneyland-style theme park in a huge quarry pit that has long been dubbed "The 
Raider Crater." 
</P>
<P>
 The name refers to a former 70-acre quarry owned by the CalMat excavation 
company and once considered by the Raiders professional football team as a 
possible stadium site.Seven years later, the pit, at the intersection of the 
Foothill (210) Freeway and Irwindale Avenue, remains empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Irvine-based theme park builder Battaglia Associates told 
city officials it wants to build a $100 million-plus family-oriented 
entertainment complex in the pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Battaglia, which has built theme parks worldwide, wanted the council to 
approve the concept of building a theme park there before investing about 
$300,000 on a development proposal. The developer has not asked the city for 
financial assistance in the project.

CONSTRUCTION; TEMBLOR TURNING THE TIDE FOR BUILDERS; REBUILD: DESPITE TIGHT 
REPAIR BUDGETS, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION FIRMS ANTICIPATE AN UPSWING IN 
CONTRACTS TO FIX QUAKE DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After enduring three grim years in the construction industry, scores of San 
Gabriel Valley building contractors, engineers and others see a silver lining 
of rebuilding money in the aftermath of last week's devastating earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down the road I think this might generate a lot of work for (construction) 
people in the San Gabriel Valley," said Linda Zirbes, who with her husband, a 
plumber, runs D'Z Plumbing in Covina. Last week the company responded to a call 
for emergency help in Chatsworth to restore water service at a mobile home 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers from ASL Consulting Engineers in Arcadia have been inspecting 
buildings in areas heavily shaken by the quake to determine whether they are 
structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the firm, which specializes in civil engineering and water 
systems, hope to play a role in new construction or repairs once contracts 
start flowing. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to killing at least 57 people, the quake rendered thousands of 
buildings uninhabitable and caused more than $30 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction industry officials said renewed employment in their field is a 
positive glimmer amid an otherwise grim loss of life and property in the San 
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, as well as the Westside and other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some good coming out of all of this disaster," said Tom Davis, 
senior project manager for quarry operator CalMat, which operates sand, gravel 
and asphalt operations in Irwindale. "Our business will have to increase to 
some extent. Our stock is going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 CalMat's stock shot up wildly the day after the earthquake, reaching a 52-week 
high of $25.63 a share during trading that day. By close Tuesday, it had 
dropped to $23.50 a share, still higher than its pre-quake high of the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The upswing may be due to investors who anticipate increased demand for raw 
materials CalMat may supply to contractors to repair roads and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pasadena-based engineering and construction management firm the Parsons 
Corp., officials were hoping to land major contracts for new construction or 
seismic retrofit work on highways and railroads. Parsons helped with redesign 
work on two major freeways in the San Francisco Bay Area damaged in the 1989 
Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to know what the impact on our workload will be," said Michael 
Ellegood, manager of De Leuw, Cather & Co., which is Parson's construction 
group for freeways, bridges and rail systems. "A lot of it depends on how 
Caltrans chooses to do the work." 
</P>
<P>
 Though untold numbers of workers have lost their jobs -- temporarily, at least 
-- while San Fernando employers rebuild or consider rebuilding, there will be 
at least a short-term rise in construction employment in the Los Angeles area, 
industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a bonanza for the construction industry," says Jack Kyser, 
chief economist for the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. "(The 
earthquake) may put the tourism industry on hold but the impact on construction 
is significant. Many construction-related stocks have shot up. Firms will have 
to get out and be aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 He said government programs to speed funding for water and sewer system 
replacement, as well as low-interest financing for replacement of damaged 
homes, will help spur immediate work. Also, he expects the oversupply of office 
space in the Los Angeles basin to be partially absorbed by San Fernando Valley 
firms looking to relocate because of quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena stands to pick up a substantial number of new office and industrial 
tenants, said Darla Longo, senior vice president of CB Commercial Real Estate 
in the San Gabriel Valley. She has received numerous inquiries from firms whose 
buildings were damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors are waiting to see what the quake might bring in the way of 
business. Despite the extensive damage to public and private property, many 
companies and government agencies may take years to rebuild because of budget 
constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District, for instance, faces enormous repairs 
that may cost up to $700 million -- cash the district does not have. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just waiting to hear from them," said Fred Hodges, project manager at 
the Alhambra-based Steed Brothers Construction Co., a general contractor that 
has built schools for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 A contract for major construction work at schools would be a major boon to the 
74-year-old company, he said, because business has dwindled during the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business has been really slow for three years -- almost dead," he said.

KID SUCCESS; THAT COMIC SUPER-HERO IS REALLY MILD-MANNERED JENNY LEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jenny Lee never used to read comic books -- until she became a character in 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old sophomore at Arcadia High School won a contest sponsored by 
Defiant comics to become a super-hero in a new comic series "The Good Guys" 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't (read comics before)," she said. "But it was just something fun to 
do. It was, I guess, a spontaneous thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Defiant created a cast of eight characters, then had a contest in search of 
real-life kids to match them, said Ed Polgardy, the comic's editor. Applicants 
submitted essays or artwork that explained how they would use their 
superpowers, and Defiant editors picked eight whose personalities and physical 
characteristics fit the roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners' faces were used as the models for their characters in the comic 
and their names were used for the characters' alter egos. Each received $1,000, 
a trip to Disneyland and royalties from future sales of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Comic artist Grey, who drew "Good Guys," said Jenny's essay stood out clearly 
from the 2,000 submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a sense of charisma in her submission that just wasn't there for 
anyone else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like my super-hero to be one that uses her brain to get out of tough 
situations rather than violence, but when she does fight, she uses her 
knowledge of martial arts," Jenny wrote. "My super-hero is fun-loving, stands 
up for what she believes in, and fights for equal rights for everyone, whether 
they are Asian or Caucasian, male or female, gay or straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Grey said Jenny's character, White Crane, "While being quiet, when pushed can 
become feisty. She's not combative, but doesn't back away." 
</P>
<P>
 When White Crane is not being a super-hero, she is named Jenny Lee, like 
Superman is Clark Kent. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny got the news that she had won in the middle of October, and by the end 
of the month the first issue of "Good Guys" was released. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of weird seeing me as a character," Jenny said. "But I read it 
and I liked it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's mother said she was not surprised to see her daughter cast as a 
super-hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's pretty smart," Pamela Lee said of her daughter. "She always got good 
grades at school. When we went to Anaheim, the editor told me she's one of the 
leaders of the Good Guys, one of the smartest ones. Sometimes power's not from 
your strength, it's from your mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning the contest has given Jenny a new hobby, in addition to swimming, 
martial arts, Hapkido, jazz dance and several school clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I go to the comic book store more often," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kid Success profiles teen-agers who have achieved some kind of extraordinary 
accomplishment, whether it is in school, in business, in arts, in kindness to 
others or in some other way.

 Patience is paying off for San Gabriel girls' basketball Coach Lyle Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Honda began grooming a class of freshmen with hopes that they 
would mature into a contender. The plan seems to have worked as San Gabriel 
entered the week 15-4 and 5-0 in the Almont League. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel is led by junior guard Joyce Garcia, who is averaging more than 25 
points a game.

<P>
 Sermons, who helped lead Bishop Amat to an unbeaten season in 1992, chose USC 
over Washington and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Other San Gabriel Valley players who have made unwritten commitments include 
Walnut wide receiver Tod McBride, who will attend UCLA, Bishop Amat running

 Sierra Vista's 54-49 victory over Gladstone ended the Dons' 32-game Montview 
League losing streak. Keith Closs, a 7-foot-1 senior, scored 22 points and had 
20 rebounds to lead Sierra Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons, under Coach Doug Watt, entered the week with a two-game win streak, 
having followed the win over Gladstone with a victory against Bassett.

 The Pasadena boys' basketball team also ended a noteworthy streak on Friday 
when the Bulldogs defeated cross-town rival Muir, 52-44. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Pasadena's first Pacific League victory over Muir in three years. 
Earlier this season, Pasadena defeated the Mustangs, 63-59, for the consolation 
title of the Tournament of Champions. COMMUNITY COLLEGES

 Leonard Green of Mt. San Antonio College, a running back who led the nation in 
scoring and all-purpose running last season, has made an unwritten commitment 
to play for USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the past two years, I've been working very hard to be in the position I 
am now," said Green, who also considered Maryland, San Diego State and Arizona. 
"I went to USC last weekend and the trip there just sold me. I saw the inside
