 Amy, an ethnomusicologist, is excited about attending a Hmong New Year's 
celebration. Part of the ritual for these Laotian natives consists of a feast 
where everyone contributes food.Amy sets down her corn pudding next to dishes 
of rice, chicken and pork. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the evening, Amy is mortified to discover that while all the 
other platters of food are empty, hers is still full. Not one of the nearly 
1,000 people at the event even tasted her offering. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 90,000 Hmong in the United States. Most emigrated after the 
collapse of the Laotian government, when they feared retribution for aiding the 
CIA during the Vietnam War. The Hmong didn't eat Amy's corn pudding because, to 
them, corn is fit only for pigs, making it particularly offensive on their New 
Year's table.  
</P>
<P>
 In their homeland, the Hmong celebrate the new year at the end of November or 
beginning of December. They have adjusted the date to coincide with the 
American holiday season but mark the event in traditional ways: deceased elders 
are honored, parents search for spouses for their children, and marriageable 
girls show off their domestic skills by wearing finely crafted hand-embroidered 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: New Year's can be as different as the culture observing it, from the 
dates celebrated to the foods eaten to the meaning of the holiday.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: LETTER TO VOICES; 
CONSEQUENCES OF 'HANDS-ON LEARNING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article "Is Hands-On Learning Sending the Wrong Message?" by Arpi Sarafian 
(Voices, Dec. 19) expresses so well what is happening in the elementary schools 
of California today. Sarafian is right in her observations that the playground 
has been moved into the classroom and that many teachers are feeling angry and 
impatient that they are trapped in a system they cannot change. 
</P>
<P>
 I am one of those teachers. I have taught for more than 30 years in 
kindergarten through 8th grade, currently 5th grade. I care deeply about the 
children I teach, and I am very concerned about the radical changes I am 
observing in their response to learning. Today's children are slipping into a 
pit of mediocrity. One might easily blame this on the ills of society, 
declining values, broken homes, and so on. This may be partly true. However, it 
is also true that the current teaching methods we are expected to implement are 
giving them a strong push into that level of poor performance. A handful of 
children excel with these new programs, but there are children who learn no 
matter what method is utilized. To Sarafian's comments, I would like to add the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
 1. "Hands-on" science activities are wonderful motivators for interest in 
science. I utilize the technique regularly. However, they must be accompanied 
by some "old-fashioned" textbook learning and individual assignments that teach 
some specific scientific facts, rather than generalities of science. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Another technique in common use is "Cooperative Learning Groups." On paper 
this technique has a noble purpose -- to teach children to solve problems in a 
spirit of cooperation, with learning as the end product. But children are 
losing the ability to work alone. On individual assignments, they seek an easy 
answer by talking to their classmates rather than looking on their own. Also, 
when they work in these groups, some children never contribute.  
</P>
<P>
 3. If learning is not presented in a fun, entertaining manner, some children 
will not do the accompanying work at all. Every classroom today has its share 
of "non-workers," who sit and do little or no written work at all.  
</P>
<P>
 4. All of these activities require a tremendous amount of preparation. Today's 
teacher spends too much time on creating learning activities, often with no 
text or manual to follow. The hours are long and the stress levels are high. 
Today we are dealing with children who, for a variety of reasons, need more 
structure and higher expectations for their behavior and academic performance. 
Instead we are providing them with less structure and lowered expectations. The 
state board of education, administrators and legislators must become sensitive 
to the opinions of teachers and parents. Ask us! We know, for we see it every 
day.

 Los Angeles' South Vermont Avenue, once a vibrant commercial street, was done 
in by the loss of the electric trolleys and the rise of mini-malls, among other 
things.But a glimmer of a turnaround is in the works. A contest sponsored by 
First Interstate Bank has produced a striking design for a neglected block at 
81st Street. Its mix of housing and business space suggests a new pattern of 
use for commercial corridors. The winning architect, Daniel Solomon, is 
interviewed for today's Conversation. At right are present, past and future 
images of the site.

 For a poor child in Chile, the gift of a sister's homemade candy stayed vivid 
in memory. A wealthier child first understood injustice on a Christmas Day. And 
a formerly homeless man recalls every detail of his last miserable holiday on 
Skid Row. Southern Californians share their tales with TRIN YARBOROUGH. SCOTT

</P>
<P>
 As I sit here on a nice couch, staring into a warm, glowing fire, my wife and 
daughters asleep, I can't help remembering what it was like for me on the 
Christmas of 1979. I was 29 and sitting in an alley on East 5th Street in 
downtown Los Angeles, freezing my butt off, a so-called street person.  
</P>
<P>
 I was awakened on that Christmas morning when another street person tried to 
steal my last couple of cigarettes. I guess it was 9 a.m. when some people 
started setting up dinner tables on Skid Row. Knowing that I didn't have enough 
cigarettes to last through the day prompted me to leave my safe doorway and go 
over to the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
 A volunteer lady came back with a whole pack of Camels for me. I gave her a 
quick nod, grabbed a piece of watermelon and went back to my doorway.  
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden, I felt the whole eight years of loneliness that I had spent 
on the streets. I missed my daughter in Virginia. I missed my family. My shoes 
were digging into my feet because I wore no socks and my back ached from 
sleeping on the cold, damp concrete. I cried all night. I hadn't cried for at 
least 15 years.  
</P>
<P>
 A short time after, I crawled into the Salvation Army on East 5th Street. With 
the help of the staff, counselors and a 12-step program, I have a new lease on 
life. This Christmas, I asked Santa for a home for the homeless, toys for the 
toyless, food for the foodless and hope for the hopeless. ANA MURPHY 
</P>

<P>
 Like many people I get a little depressed around Christmas. Maybe it's because 
of memories of being very poor growing up in Chile, before I married and came 
to the United States. Or maybe because I wish I could be close to all my 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christmas I was 5 we had no presents at all, although we did have enough 
food for all of us -- my mother, myself and my eight brothers and sisters. But 
when I was 6, my oldest sister, Cecilia, was 11. She had been collecting and 
saving little matchboxes, lollipop sticks and such. She found a pine branch and 
shaped it into a Christmas tree. Then she cooked some sugar into candy, put a 
bit of it into a matchbox for each of us, wrapped them in white paper and drew 
pictures on the wrapping. I was very excited that she was making this candy for 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 Presents at Christmas are not my main concern. My main concern is being 
together with people I care about. I want my little girl, who is 6 now, to know 
that some people -- some of my family in Chile -- are praying for her and 
sending her all their best wishes. LUPITA ALBARRAN

<P>
 The Christmas I was six was the first time I thought about injustice. I was 
born in Mexico. My family was very comfortable economically. We had a big house 
and seven servants. In those days we celebrated Christmas on Jan. 6 (which 
commemorates the arrival of) the three Magic Kings, who, according to the 
Bible, brought gifts to baby Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 Today children write Santa Claus, but then we would write the Magic Kings. On 
that Jan. 6 I ran to see what the Magic Kings had brought and it was everything 
I asked for. Yet I saw many poor children in the streets who hadn't received 
anything. Some did not even have a piece of bread. "Why did I get these 
beautiful toys, but poor children, who can be bad or good just like me, didn't 
get anything?" I asked my mother. "It's not fair of the Magic Kings!" She said: 
"Don't ask questions. That's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 But I promised myself I would do something for poor children. As I grew older 
I always gave some of my toys to them. Even today I am sad for poor children, 
and about injustice. KYMBERLEIGH RICHARDS

 I transitioned -- began living full-time as a woman -- in July, 1990. 
Christmas, 1990, was the first I spent as a woman. But it didn't seem that 
different because my friends, my mother and I usually don't exchange 
gender-specific gifts anyway. For example, a couple of years later a friend 
gave me a video of "Dances With Wolves" because one small part of my identity 
is as a Cherokee Indian. 
</P>

 Like a lot of people, I don't celebrate Christmas as the year's major holiday 
but put more emphasis on my birthday. ROBERT

 I spent last Christmas in jail. I was 14. They picked me up for cursing out my 
mama, then found an old case of grand theft auto.  
</P>
<P>
 The guys in with me were there for murder, stealing, vandalism, robbery. And 
in jail people fight on Christmas because they don't want to be there then. 
They didn't have anything special to eat. The only good thing was a big old 
chocolate chip cookie. I wanted to cry but didn't have any tears.  
</P>
<P>
 Some church people came, sang a little song, gave me a little teddy bear in a 
bag. It felt nice because I didn't think anybody was going to give me anything. 
But the day after Christmas somebody stole it.  
</P>
<P>
 This Christmas will be the best ever. I'm living in this group home in 
Compton, with some people who really care about me. Now I know how to 
communicate and have a lot less conflict. DIANE HOSIE

 My mother came here from Portugal after she married. She saw all these 
commercials for snack foods and thought that was what all American children 
ate, so at first she would pack school lunches made up of chocolate milk, 
Twinkies and Ho-Hos. At Christmas, since she couldn't read English, she chose 
our presents according to the pictures on the boxes. It led to some very 
strange gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 My sister Linda was three years older and before Christmas she'd sneak a look 
at what mother got us, and make us look too. One year she showed me that mother 
had bought toy statues of Mickey Mouse and Alice in Wonderland, each with a 
matching watch. Both of us hated Mickey and wanted Alice. That Christmas 
morning, while my sister was still asleep, I snuck downstairs and tore open the 
Alice. My sister was so mad that she chopped off Alice's head. I screamed and 
cried and chopped off Mickey's ears. But my sister didn't care, because she 
hated Mickey. I wish I had that Mickey watch today. It'd probably be worth a 
fortune.

FEAR: 'A PRISON OF MY OWN MAKING'; VIOLENT CRIME IS DOWN, BUT CRIME NEWS IS 
EVERYWHERE. ONLY BY RESISTING THE HYPE CAN WE BELIEVE THE BEST ABOUT OTHERS.

 The Scene: It is late on a Friday night in a shabby neighborhood in Long 
Beach. A woman alone in a station wagon slows for a stop sign on a dimly lit 
street. A dozen or so young men, perhaps gang members, mill around the corner 
she is approaching. She stomps on the gas. The young men chase the car, banging 
on it and yelling. Her hands tighten on the steering wheel as she envisions 
being dragged from the car and attacked. Then she hears their words: They are 
warning that she is going the wrong way on a one-way street. She turns around 
and drives unharmed onto the freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 I was that fearful woman. Now I wonder why was it automatic to assume that 
those teens were going to hurt me rather than to believe that they meant me 
good? Is my life at less risk -- or more -- when I assume the worst about my 
neighbor? 
</P>
<P>
 Given the crime reports, it's no wonder I feel scared: A mail bomb kills an 
advertising executive. A department store worker is convicted of the slaying of 
an 8 year old. But is there really mayhem in the heart of every stranger or are 
hysterical perceptions scaring me -- and a lot of Americans -- to death? 
According to the FBI, crime is declining. For the first six months of 1994, 
violent crime -- defined as murder, rape, aggravated assault and robbery -- 
dropped 4% nationwide, continuing a trend that began in 1993. Yet in a Gallup 
Poll last August, Americans ranked crime as the most important problem facing 
the nation.  
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1990, FBI statistics showed an 11% rise in violent crime. But 
Americans were more concerned with the growing conflict in the Persian Gulf and 
recession. A Gallup Poll in November of that year ranked crime below Iraq, the 
economy, the federal budget deficit, drug abuse, poverty and unemployment. My 
fellow Americans even ranked crime below "Don't know."  
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for our fear today is the sheer quantity of news. When I 
was growing up, we had a half hour each of local and national news each day. 
Now we have local television news almost hourly in the evening, plus morning 
shows, late night news, tabloids, prime-time news magazines and Cable News 
Network around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a lot of time to sell, and crime sells. So the more gruesome the crime, 
the more likely it seems that we have a minicam or radio reporter live at the 
scene. But another part of the problem is that we fail to look behind the 
headlines at the huge discrepancy between what gets reported and the reality of 
our own lives. For every person who is murdered in any fashion, be it a 
carjacking or drive-by shooting or a jealous lover, there are 10,000 people to 
whom that didn't happen. For every act of violence, there are scores of what 
one bumper sticker calls "random acts of senseless kindness" like the young men 
in Long Beach who kept me from a possible head-on collision.  
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago, in a world far more dangerous than our own, Anne Frank looked 
on from a tiny attic tomb and wrote a remarkable journal of life. For two years 
she lived in constant fear of those whose hatred would cause her death. And yet 
she could write, "In spite of everything, I still believe that people are 
really good at heart." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes stubborn courage to believe the best about others in a fear-driven 
world. Occasionally, that trust may prove hollow or even deadly. But the 
alternative is to live a life of media-hyped anxiety, cut off from people. I am 
not willing to sentence myself to a prison of my own making.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
DANIEL SOLOMON; THE 'REINVENTING OF VERMONT AVENUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A vacant lot and long-abandoned 1931 Moderne landmark building that once 
housed a grocery store and later the offices of Pepperdine University is soon 
to be restored as the focal point of a development at Vermont Avenue and 81st 
Street. The winner of a competition sponsored by First Interstate Bank to 
revive the once-lively commercial street in South-Central Los Angeles is an 
$11-million, mixed-use project with a distinctive 125-foot-high tower. It will 
provide 35 for-sale townhomes, ground-floor commercial space, a Boys and Girls 
Club, day-care center and offices for USC's Business Expansion Network.  
</P>
<P>
 The winner, selected by a jury that included neighborhood residents, was led 
by San Francisco architect Daniel Solomon and Caleb Development Corp. of 
South-Central Los Angeles, teamed with local architect John Maloney and other 
local firms. Solomon, a teacher at UC Berkeley since 1966 and author of 
"ReBuilding," talked with Public Places columnist JANE SPILLER. Question: What 
was the central challenge of the project for you?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Our intention was to invent a strategy for rebuilding Vermont Avenue. 
The problems of South-Central L.A. are so vast that one successful development 
project is almost irrelevant. Whole commercial streets have to be brought back 
to life. Neighborhoods are desperately without services like stores, cafes and 
recreation for kids. Residents have to drive all over to shop. Still-healthy 
neighborhoods need to be linked to commercial streets so they do not become 
even more isolated, connected to the world only by car and by television.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What brought Vermont Avenue to the deteriorated state it's in today?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Vermont Avenue was once served by the Pacific Electric Line streetcars. 
With the conversion of L.A. to the automobile, the best public transit system 
in the country was dismantled. In 1958, they reconfigured the street for 22 
blocks with frontage roads for parking. Vermont Avenue declined, but the real 
collapse came after the mid-1970s with the advent of the mini-mall. Mini-malls 
are all for cars; they destroy pedestrian use of the street and compete with 
street-front retail.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What were your goals in designing the project?  
</P>
<P>
 A: First, to find a way to bring the street back to life. We mix housing with 
a small number of neighborhood-serving stores that will draw people onto the 
street. We want to revitalize what's around it but not steal tenants from other 
properties on the street. South-Central is crazily overzoned for commercial. It 
would sustain 10 Hong Kongs. There's no market for millions of square feet of 
commercial space, and this dooms much of the land to be moribund.  
</P>
<P>
 Second, to find a way to link the street with the neighborhoods. On the west 
is Vermont Knolls, an impeccably maintained middle-class neighborhood. On the 
east is a really sad abandoned neighborhood. The key was to provide some 
stores, like a bakery, dry cleaners or video store, mixed with the same kind of 
(middle-class) housing that now exists. There are terrific streets like this in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 We also wanted to create jobs. We brought in the Business Expansion Network as 
anchor tenant to create new community-based businesses for our project and for 
other vacant spaces. Q: Did your meetings with neighbors affect the design?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Initially the neighbors were in a state of considerable agitation because 
they thought this was going to be a 130-unit, low-income rental housing 
project. We were dissuaded from that by the neighbors, and for very good 
reasons. There is other affordable housing sitting vacant nearby and it is 
important for Vermont Knolls to reinforce home ownership.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why should people who don't live there care about what happens on Vermont 
and 81st?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We're all affected by the abandonment of inner-city neighborhoods. Finding 
a pattern for reinvestment is important to help build up the still-living 
tissue of a pretty unhealthy part of the city. And dead commercial streets are 
not a phenomenon restricted to South-Central.

 The Republican majority in Congress has renewed the call to restore prayer in 
public schools. Organized prayer is prohibited, although many school districts 
allow students to have religious clubs and prayer groups as extracurricular 
activities. We asked Southern California students if they prayed that day at 
school and whether they felt school prayer should be more formal. LEAH CHER

<P>
 Usually, I pray before tests. So usually that's every day. It makes a lot of 
difference. I know that studying helps, but prayer before tests gives you a 
little hope, and makes you straight and focused. It gives you a little 
encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't fold my hands or bow my head. I will close my eyes, sit still a 
minute. If people are trying to talk to me, I tell them to wait. It's not like 
I talk out loud, I talk in my head. 
</P>
<P>
 My family prays together. We are strong Christians. I go to a school that is 
multiracial, multiethnic. There are Hindus, Buddhists, Mormons, Jewish people. 
I don't think they should single (school prayer) out as a Christian prayer. But 
if it were a moment of silence, everyone could do their own sense of prayer.

</P>
<P>
 School prayer has nothing to do with education. They don't teach religion 
here, and it will conflict with other subjects. It will discriminate against 
people. What religion will it be mandatory to pray to? Are we going to have to 
pray on our own time? It will just take up our time to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't really heard it discussed at our school. It's more of an issue back 
East. Here, there's a diversity of religions. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be great to see everyone express their religion. But school time is 
not the appropriate time. If someone is forcing them into something, they're 
not going to do it. It won't change anyone's attitude. JACQUELINE RODRIGUEZ 
</P>
<P>
 17, senior, Santa Ana High School 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I have prayed in school, but to myself. I'm involved in sports. 
Sometimes before a big race, I pray for God to give me strength to finish. I'm 
Roman Catholic and pray at home. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the problems in schools come from the atmosphere students are living 
in, like living on the street or gangs. But if you're praying in school, that 
might bring other problems up. Cliques would start, with Catholics on one side 
and others on another. That would separate students with other beliefs from 
their friends because they don't think the same way. CHRISTOPHER WRAY

 I did pray today. It's one of those things I just never really think about. I 
just do it. There was a fight this morning that kind of prompted me. 
</P>
<P>
 Before prayer was taken out, the problems in the school systems were very 
minimal like chewing gum, talking out of turn. Violence and many things in the 
negative aspect of life have risen drastically since prayer and Bible reading 
were taken out of schools.  
</P>
<P>
 America broke off from Great Britain not only (because of) the Parliament, but 
for religious freedom. The Bible was a cornerstone for American liberty. It was 
the one (book) that everybody learned from. I think the Bible can be pretty 
much mixed in with all aspects of education.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
NORWALK: PUT HEALTH CARE WHERE KIDS ARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kaiser Permanente's Bellflower Medical Center, part of California's largest 
health maintenance organization, asked Norwalk officials last year which city 
neighborhood could benefit from a free immunization event, they suggested the 
community around Edmundson Elementary School. Many of the working-class 
families who live in this part of the southeast Los Angeles County lack private 
health insurance, but usually earn too much to qualify for Medi-Cal. Even so, 
local officials and Kaiser Permanente workers were stunned when more than 500 
people came to an event expected to draw about 150 people. They were just as 
shocked weeks later when they found that 20% of those who completed TB exams 
tested positive for exposure to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers alone signaled that the neighborhood had serious unmet medical 
needs. Kaiser and the city decided to bring care to the community by helping 
establish a childrens' clinic at the elementary school. The Edmundson Well 
Child Clinic now provides basic health care for free to any Edmundson student. 
A pediatrician and nurse from Kaiser Permanente donate their time to provide 
medical screenings, offer health education and treat minor illnesses. An 
outside service provides on-site lab work. Since the clinic opened a year ago, 
more than 550 children have had check-ups at the school.  
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) WHO BENEFITS FROM THE CLINIC OUTREACH?

 "My children are the children of the working poor. Many have no health care. 
They come to school with earaches, sore throats or flu. And they can't learn 
when they're ill. Since the clinic opened I don't see children coming to school 
with aches and infections and flus that last two or three weeks. Now there's so 
much more learning that can happen." -- Rosa Carreon, principal of Edmundson 
Elementary School 
</P>
<P>
 "If we improve the health of the community we're also improving the health of 
our members who live there. If we take care of more people, fewer diseases are

CHINA ROUGHS UP HONG KONG; BEIJING VENTS ITS ANGER OVER REFORMS AS THE BRITISH 
COLONY NEARS ITS HISTORIC CHANGE IN 1997 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Uncertainty clouds the future in Hong Kong as Beijing flexes its muscle on a 
number of issues affecting the British colony after its scheduled return to 
China in 1997. Still bristling at the electoral reforms introduced by Hong 
Kong's last British governor, Chris Patten, China is making some worrisome 
changes that undermine the 1984 Sino-British agreement to allow Hong Kong to 
preserve its economic and social way of life for 50 years under a Chinese 
policy of "one country, two systems." 
</P>
<P>
 First, Beijing has vowed to replace the Hong Kong Legislature, which will be 
elected next year under new British reforms, with lawmakers of its own 
choosing. The appointed legislature would serve for an interim period. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing has also indicated that it will reject any substantial changes in laws 
passed by the legitimately elected Hong Kong Legislature between now and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 New questions about what legal system might or might not be in place in Hong 
Kong under the Chinese are unsettling. The Sino-British agreement provides for 
the creation of a Court of Final Appeal as the territory's supreme legal 
authority after 1997. At issue now are the representation and composition of 
that court. Controversy over that does not inspire confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 There are concerns about existing Draconian laws that restrict press freedom, 
especially in light of Beijing's recent imprisonment of two journalists. In a 
speech to the National Press Club in Washington last month, Daisy Li Yuet-wah, 
vice chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Assn., described press freedom as an 
"endangered species." She cited increasing pressures for journalists to change 
to fit into a Chinese system. 
</P>
<P>
 Also troubling are recent incidents of self-censorship in publishing and 
broadcasting. TVB, a leading station in Hong Kong, had the broadcasting rights 
but refused to air two BBC documentaries, one on Mao Tse-tung and another on 
Chinese labor camps, to avoid embarrassing China. Some Hong Kong publishers are 
refusing to print schoolbooks that would be used after 1997 without assurances 
that the books, designed to accompany a new 1996 curriculum, will not be 
rejected by the Chinese government. The publishers believe chances are slim 
that the Chinese will accept any textbook written under the British 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Such developments do not portend a smooth transition from British rule to 
Chinese sovereignty. They send all the wrong signals to those within and 
outside Hong Kong. But Beijing still has the opportunity to restore faith in 
its "one country, two systems" policy. It needs to work with and for the people 
of Hong Kong rather than venting its anger at Gov. Patten and his reforms.

A RIVER DOESN'T RUN THROUGH IT; NORMALLY DRY L.A. RIVER IS FLOODED WITH POLICY 
QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles River might usefully be regarded as a Rorschach test of sorts 
for the future direction of this region. The questions it poses to those who 
visit its graffiti-scared shores and peer into its murky, trash-strewn waters 
are: Which past will be prologue here? Does the relentless concreting of open 
spaces push us toward more of the same? Or can natural resources be reclaimed 
and enhanced for a variety of public uses?  
</P>
<P>
 In the months to come, there will be a significant debate on this matter. The 
narrow issue is how best to protect downstream neighborhoods and cities from 
flooding. The challenge for public agencies and community groups is to find a 
way to better control the river while at the same time restoring it as a 
watershed and recreational resource. 
</P>
<P>
 Six decades after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began to channelize the 
river, there is little middle ground; the stark choice is more concrete or 
less.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the concrete was laid, the Los Angeles River, like most, was 
unpredictable. It often flooded in winter, dried up in summer and occasionally 
changed its course. Now the river is 58 miles of man-made dams, reservoirs and 
storm drains originating north of the San Fernando Valley and emptying into the 
sea at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, channelization has made the river more dangerous in some ways. 
Although there is barely a trickle much of the year, more than six people, on 
average, drown in the river every winter. It is then that storm waters -- which 
before the 1930s percolated into the ground to replenish natural watersheds -- 
race to sea at up to 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 With continued urban development, some say, the threat of river flooding has 
increased. The Federal Emergency Management Agency fears that an extreme rain 
would push river waters over existing levees, flooding downstream cities. 
Although critics have questioned FEMA's risk analysis, the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers and the L.A. County Department of Public Works are determined to 
raise the levees, elevating walls four to eight feet on the lower Los Angeles 
and the Rio Hondo, a main tributary south of Downtown. Construction could start 
in the spring, and public dollars may be forthcoming for the levee work sooner 
than for worthy infrastructure projects such as the Alameda Corridor, which 
will speed cargo back and forth between local ports and inland rail links. 
</P>
<P>
 So concrete inexorably begets more concrete? Some say no. Community groups, 
including Friends of the Los Angeles River and some farsighted local officials, 
are discussing a different future, one which addresses the threat of flooding 
while incorporating the river into the recreational life of the city. Urban 
rivers elsewhere, even some as channelized and waterless as the Los Angeles 
River is most of the time, often both serve as a tool of flood control and draw 
people who want to stroll, bike or just sit.  
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, among the places this could happen are the gritty, park-poor 
neighborhoods that line long stretches of the Los Angeles River. Levees, set 
back from the river banks on reclaimed parkland, could provide flood protection 
as well as space to play and relax. But time is growing short. Absent 
grass-roots consensus on an alternative, Los Angeles County and the Corps of 
Engineers could be mixing the concrete within months. Serious dialogue is 
beginning between agency officials and residents in riverside communities; it 
must continue.

STATE PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California state legislators' recent salary increase from $52,000 to $72,000 
(38.5%) makes them the highest paid state legislators in the country. However, 
in the amount of money we spend on education, our ranking is closer to the 
bottom than the top.We rank 41st in the nation on a per-pupil expenditure of 
$4,621, which is considerably below the national average of $5,604. There are 
only nine states that spend less per pupil than we do. 
</P>
<P>
 I dare say our society would be much better served if the exact opposite were 
true: That we were first in the nation on educational expenditures, and that 
our legislators' salaries were ranked 41st. It's obvious that there is 
something terribly wrong with our priorities.

THE WORKING POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article by Hugh Price, "The Alienated Poor Are Today's National Threat" 
(Commentary, Dec. 12), deserves attention.It makes sense that "people with no 
prospect of decent jobs will reject society's institutions." Why shouldn't 
they? 
</P>
<P>
 Two other points Price makes need reiteration: 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a glaring disconnect between emerging welfare policies, which insists 
that the poor work, and Federal Reserve Board policies that proclaim the 
economy overheated when unemployment falls below 6%." 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed are "assurances that those who work won't be poor. This means a 
much higher minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
 To me this means an increase from $4.25 per hour to at least $6.

CARTER TRIP TO BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Carter, Driven to Do Good, Looks to Bosnia Quagmire," Dec. 17: 
</P>
<P>
 "Why he pursues his altruistic agenda is a mystery to many" is the subhead on 
the story of Jimmy Carter's attempt to help negotiate a solution in Bosnia. 
Questioning his motives is astonishing and in itself may indicate what's wrong 
with our media's values. 
</P>
<P>
 In the body of the story, the reporter states that "many believe he is 
shamelessly seeking the Nobel Peace Prize." Shamelessly is an adverb that might 
better be employed if Carter was trying to accumulate more money than Michael 
Milken. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Testament posed the question, "Am I my brother's keeper?" Carter has 
answered in the affirmative. We all should. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What a surprise that Ol' Jimmy Carter was invited to talks regarding the 
Bosnia mess. If I were the one choosing someone from the U.S. to go, who better 
than Carter? He has shown that he is a "crack" negotiator. He single-handedly 
negotiated America into a corner regarding the situation in North Korea, giving 
away the farm and leaving us with nothing except the promises of a morally 
bankrupt nation and a multibillion-dollar bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Radovan Karadzic must be hoping that we don't recognize the errors of our 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 LARRY GORNEY 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jack Nelson, in writing about Carter, missed the forest for the trees. In 
seeking to know the mystery of "what makes Jimmy Carter run," he examines such 
driving forces as world peace, a legacy in history or a huge ego. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere amid his analysis does Nelson examine President Carter's deeper 
motivation of Christian faith. Such a faith is not mysterious, magical or new. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, it is "trust." Trust in God. Trust that the future is being shaped 
by God's love. Trust that together with God, we as people working together can 
make a difference in that future. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carter's active engagement in the world, from Sunday School class, 
to Habitat for Humanity, to Haiti, Disease in Africa and Bosnia comes from a 
profound gratitude before Christ for all the love and forgiveness that he has 
been given. Such gratitude leads him into prayer, regular conversation with God 
about many of the world's ills. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of such a close relationship with God comes a responsibility to use those 
gifts to the greatest benefit of all those around him. He is clearly engaged in 
a Christ-inspired "ministry of reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
 The world may misunderstand and ridicule such behavior, but seen from a 
spiritual viewpoint, it offers a way out of the social morass of the cynicism 
and the "me-first" attitude that we all unconsciously promote. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank God for President Carter and all who like him who have the courage to 
live out a life filled with God's love . . . no matter what the "worldly" cost.

 The hand-wringing going on over the Balkan situation would be comical if it 
weren't so tragic. The specter of a little country like Serbia thumbing its 
nose at the powerful nations of the West is not hard to understand if we just 
look for reasons behind this amazing show of boldness and bravado. Isn't it 
obvious that these people are getting all their moral and material support from 
Russia? Does anyone believe they would be so intractable and impossible to 
negotiate with if Russia were to withdraw its support? 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is how to persuade Russia to use its influence to bring that war 
to a satisfactory conclusion. I believe Russia will only be moved by getting 
something in return. There are two things that might influence Russia to alter 
its stance toward the West at the present time -- a greater show of respect 
from us and membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we seem to be reaching out to them in matters of trade, we continue 
to treat them as enemies in international affairs. Why not let them into NATO? 
I know that many people in America and Europe would prefer to keep Russia out 
of NATO but it would seem to me that we would have greater control over their 
behavior if they were in NATO than if they were not.

LONG BEACH VOTERS DID GET IT RIGHT; JUNE CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM HAS MODEL 
ELEMENTS -- WHY TURN BACK THE CLOCK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach voters last June approved a campaign finance reform that was a 
model of what such a reform should include. Last week, council members Doris 
Topsy-Elvord, Jeffrey Kellogg and Jenny Oropeza led an attack on the new law. 
We urge the voters of Long Beach to see to it that their law does not suffer 
the death of a thousand political cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The key features of the new law include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A strict limit on contributions; $250 per election to a candidate for the 
City Council, $500 per election to a candidate for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A strict limit on spending; City Council candidates held to $40,000 in the 
primary and $20,000 in the runoff election, mayoral candidates held to $200,000 
in the primary and $100,000 in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Partial public funding; though only small contributions are matched, 
candidates may receive up to one-third of the expenditure limit in public funds 
for the primary and up to one-half of the limit in the runoff. Because of the 
spending caps, the overall cost of the funding part of the reform is low: 
$250,000 per year or about 50 cents per resident per year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A time limit on fund raising; candidates and officeholders would be barred 
from accepting money except during an 18-month election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was aimed at the last of these features. The anti-reformers want 
officeholders to be free to raise funds year-round. They would eliminate a 
subsidiary provision that requires candidates to return to the Long Beach 
general fund any campaign funds in excess of $5,000. Ten thousand dollars 
strikes them as a preferable ceiling, and they would like to be free to raise 
another $10,000 per year while in office. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of "officeholder account" is far from unknown in politics. 
Incumbents defend the practice as necessary if they are to perform private 
services for their constituents, and even under the often-praised Los Angeles 
ethics reform law, relatively modest officeholder accounts are permitted. But 
it must be admitted, even by supporters of the practice, that there is a 
potential for abuse, and Long Beach has no ethics code comparable to Los 
Angeles'. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, if Long Beach council members need officeholder accounts at 
all, they should offer public arguments -- and hear rebuttals -- about how 
large such accounts need to be and how the money may be spent. At a meeting 
last Tuesday, the council voted 6 to 2 to adopt the anti-reform, but final 
approval has not yet come. We urge the council to stay the course set by the 
voters last June. Long Beach is onto something very valuable here.

IT'S ALREADY 1997 FOR MUCH OF HONG KONG; CHINA TAKEOVER: WESTERNERS POUR IN, 
THE ECONOMY BOOMS AND A COMMUNIST SCION BECOMES AN ACCIDENTAL PHILANTHROPIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ROTHCHILD, John Rothchild is the financial columnist for Time magazine.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brits are losing Hong Kong in 1,000 days, but Westerners are not fleeing 
the prospect of imminent Chinese rule, they are pouring in. The U.S. contingent 
has doubled in size since 1984, to 30,000, and includes a large squadron of 
investment bankers whose presence puts upward pressure on the already high 
apartment prices. The Japanese are flocking here as well, hoping that the 
Chinese don't carry grudges, and even the Brits have multiplied, from 17,700 to 
24,700, at the very time you'd expect them to be leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest influx by far is Filipina maids, 116,000 by official tally. The 
Chinese don't do housekeeping work anymore. They've got better prospects, 
thanks to the capitalists who operate freely on both sides of the Hong 
Kong-Chinese border. 
</P>
<P>
 I surveyed that border on an hour-long helicopter ride sponsored by Government 
Information Services, my hosts on a recent junket. We flew into Chinese 
territory where the water buffalo once roamed but now the bulldozers and 
front-end loaders play as south China is transformed into a great eyesore of 
prosperity -- factories, low-rises, high-rises and smokestacks -- built with 
Hong Kong money. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Cuban exiles in Miami have refused to do business with Cuba as long as 
Fidel Castro is in power, Chinese exiles in Hong Kong have been merrily making 
deals on the mainland since 1979, when Deng Xiaoping said the magic words: "To 
be rich is glorious."  
</P>
<P>
 "1997 happened a long time ago," says Iain Donnachie, an Australian who runs 
money for an outfit called Asia Equity. He's telling me this over lunch at the 
China Club atop the old China Bank building, the former headquarters of the 
communists, which now attracts the downtown finance crowd. Tables are set with 
silver chopsticks and the waiters are dressed in Mao suits. We're surrounded by 
money managers and Hong Kong millionaires with dual passions: investing and 
playing the horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong is a tout's paradise -- betting on the races accounts for 8% of the 
gross domestic product. There are too many bettors and not enough horses, a 
problem that was solved with the building of a ghost track, where people cram 
in by the thousands to watch giant overhead screens. The cheering from the 
ghost track is just as loud as the cheering from the primary track, where the 
live horses can be seen. It was at the primary track where Larry Yung made his 
fabulous ghost bet, the most interesting story I heard in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Yung is not your average plunger. He's one of the new breed of billionaires 
from the communist side. His father is a vice president in the current Beijing 
government, but Yung left China in 1979 to seek his fortune in Hong Kong. He 
got into semiconductors, and one thing led to another, until a year ago when 
Yung became the first mainlander to be named steward of the Royal Jockey Club 
-- safari hats, English roses, the most elegant of Maughamian enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 He owns and bets on horses in the efficient Hong Kong way, with a hand-held 
computer that makes the wager and debits his bank account; if he wins, the 
proceeds are credited to his bank account, with no fuss and bother about cash 
and tickets. He was checking his balance one day when he noticed $37 million in 
Hong Kong dollars (about $5 million U.S.) he didn't know he had. This was the 
payoff from a 100-1 shot that he'd bet by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Hong Kong in a nutshell: A son of a communist official arrives, 
prospers, wins $37 million by accident and doesn't realize it until he consults 
his hand-held computer. He donated the windfall to Stanford University, where 
his daughter is enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 From what I can gather, Hong Kong is more relaxed about the Chinese takeover 
than it was in 1989, the year of Tian An Men Square, but that's because of all 
the commerce. What the financial types are saying is that capitalism has gone 
too far to be stopped and that Hong Kong is China's cash cow -- a cow that 
Beijing would never be dumb enough to butcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese and the British already have agreed to the basic principle of the 
changeover: that China will not meddle in Hong Kong affairs and will leave the 
legal system intact for at least another 50 years. But both sides have been 
bickering over the details. The British keep referring to the rule book and the 
Chinese keep saying that they will make their own rules when they get here. It 
doesn't help that Hong Kong's current governor, Chris Patten, is a former 
government official from Bath, England, whose only prior experience with the 
Orient was in his neighborhood Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hong Kong media are practicing what is locally referred to as 
"self-censorship" in preparation for 1997. Already, the TV stations are being 
careful not to broadcast anything that might miff officials in Beijing. The 
Chinese are miffed about a lot of things, such as the contract for a new 
container port that was awarded to Jardine. Jardine is a British company that 
got its start smuggling opium into China in the 19th Century. It was on 
Jardine's behalf that Britain fought the Opium War to defend the drug traffic 
and won Hong Kong in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The British governors, meanwhile, have developed a sudden interest in domestic 
reforms -- power to the people, elections for local legislators -- none of 
which they bothered about until quite recently, when they started packing their 
bags.  
</P>
<P>
 As the Brits prepare to pull down the Union Jack, the Hong Kongers have 
surpassed them in GDP per person. It's an amazing achievement when a colony 
becomes more productive and wealthier than the colonizers. In spite of its very 
low taxes and a high level of social services (good schools, 47% of the 
population in government housing), Hong Kong manages to run a budget surplus 
and keep itself out of hock. This poses a problem for the newly arrived 
investment bankers: With no government debt, how can you start a decent bond 
market?

PERSPECTIVE ON ORANGE COUNTY; BULLETIN: THE SKY ISN'T FALLING; THE ECONOMY IS 
SOUND, REVENUE IS FLOWING IN AND THERE'S NO NEED FOR A BAILOUT; THE EAST COAST 
MEDIA CAN STOP GLOATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER COX, Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) is a member of the 
House Budget Committee and chairs the Task Force on Budget Process Reform. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the financial crisis in Orange County has been an unambiguous misfortune 
to Southern California, some East Coast commentators -- who badly need a lift 
these days -- see it differently. In fact, multibillion-dollar losses in Orange 
County's investment portfolio have been a real shot in the arm to the likes of 
the New Republic and Richard Cohen of the Washington Post, who see the 
unfolding events as a morality play in which putative fiscal conservatives 
receive a deserved comeuppance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoary stereotypes of an Orange County that is long gone (if it ever existed) 
provide the basis for pieces like Cohen's recent commentary, "The Affluent 
Passing the Buck." He pillories small-government Orange Countians, supposedly 
enamored of virtues like self-reliance and hard work, for an alleged 
unwillingness to accept personal responsibility for the losses. The New 
Republic, reveling in the thought of prosperous, Republican Orange County 
crawling to Congress for a bailout, asked whether conservatives will "let their 
mecca end up like Bridgeport, Conn. Or can we safely redefine a liberal as a 
conservative who's gone bankrupt?" 
</P>
<P>
 For those who understand the facts, all this gloating makes the gloaters look 
foolish. Reports of Orange County's demise are greatly exaggerated, as are 
reports of its desire for a federal bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, the fundamentals of the county's economy remain unchanged, 
indeed are rock-solid. Our 2.5 million people are among the most hard-working 
and best-educated. If we were an independent nation, we would have the world's 
30th-largest economy -- larger than Singapore's and comparable with those of 
Portugal and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 Our county tax base, on which our ability to refinance depends, is 
exceptionally strong. Today's Orange County, unlike the straw man in the 
Washington Post editorials, is a diverse, high-tech manufacturing economy with 
growing trade connections to Asia and Latin America. Orange County already 
benefits more than Los Angeles from exports. As the Los Angeles Times recently 
wrote, Orange County is, more than anything, "like a Silicon Canyon, with 
business concentrated in computers and machinery, microchips and software and 
medical and scientific instruments." We are ideally positioned to compete in 
the global economy of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing that has happened in the last few weeks has changed these realities. 
To the contrary, every serious financial expert who has spoken about the 
bankruptcy -- and believe me, there are many -- says the same thing: Seen in 
the context of Orange County's strong economy, the $2-billion loss in the value 
of the portfolio is a very serious, very painful, short-term problem. But it is 
not a long-term or even a near-term threat to county prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping our heads when all about us are losing theirs will determine whether 
ours is a painful but manageable problem or an uncontrolled panic. The danger 
is not just psychological: In addition to the anguish felt by the county, a 
loss of perspective could devalue the county's securities, increasing the cost 
of our recovery for all of us. And it could lead to widespread anticipation of 
a tax increase, which in turn would produce taxpayer flight and an erosion of 
the now-solid tax base.  
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, it's important that the truth about Orange County be heard loud 
and clear. However painful the effects of this crisis in the short term, it 
will not derail the county's future, which remains bright. The actual burden on 
the county is the annual cost of interest and sinking-fund payments that will 
be needed to refinance the loss -- which should work out to hundreds rather 
than thousands of dollars per taxpayer. If government officials are willing to 
cut costs in that amount by downsizing county or local government, or by 
prudently liquidating some government assets, we can obviate entirely the need 
for a tax increase -- let alone a bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's "irresponsibility" is another canard. Cohen himself wrote that 
voters cannot be responsible for analyzing "an investment policy centered on 
derivatives and based on heavy borrowing. This is the particle physics of 
finance." Even closer to the point, there simply wasn't enough public 
information for voters to know what county Treasurer Bob Citron was doing. And 
many of the public agencies whose funds were in the Orange County investment 
pool didn't have any choice; they were required by law to invest there. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tribute to local self-government that despite the arcane subject 
matter, many ordinary Orange Countians did object to Citron's high-risk 
investment strategy. His Republican opponent, John Moorlach, whose campaign I 
chaired, made Citron's risky investments the central issue of his campaign. 
While we didn't win, we rolled up a thoroughly respectable vote total. 
</P>
<P>
 At a more fundamental level, however, the charge of "irresponsibility" is not 
only false, it is the very opposite of the truth. The hallmark of 
responsibility is the willingness to accept the consequences of one's actions. 
Orange County is doing exactly that. We are not demanding a state or federal 
bailout. We are not attempting to avoid the loss through higher taxes, passing 
the results of Citron's mistakes on to county taxpayers. We will tackle this 
problem head on by reforming government because it's the responsible thing to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 Among East Coast exemplars like New York City and Washington, the traditional 
responses to municipal fiscal calamity are bailouts, tax hikes and red ink. 
That simply won't wash in Southern California in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Orange County needs help to deal with this crisis. But we know that in 
the end, it's our problem to solve. So to our detractors, current and 
potential: Sooner than you think, we'll be back on our feet, and you won't have 
Orange County to kick around any more.

IN BIHAC, A HOSPITAL UNDER SIEGE; WAR: MEDICINE AND FOOD ARE ALMOST GONE FOR 
900 PATIENTS TRAPPED IN A SERB CHOKEHOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEKIR TATLIC, Dr. Bekir Tatlic is director of the Regional Bihac Hospital. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Regional Bihac Hospital, which cares for an area with a population of more 
than 350,000 that has been surrounded by Serbian rebels for three years, has 
managed through the sacrificial dedication of its staff to continue its work. 
Yet even when aid convoys were able to pass through to this region, and along 
with the help of humanitarian organizations, the hospital was unable to do all 
that was expected of it under its mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since April, not one sizable shipment has reached the hospital from the world 
humanitarian organizations; we have received only several small consignments of 
medicines via the World Health Organization, the Red Cross and Doctors Without 
Borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital has exhausted the last of its food and medical reserves, so that 
the feeding of the sick and wounded, more than 900 patients, is now limited to 
one meal per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment can be given only to the most desperate cases, so we can no longer 
even consider treatment of any kind that would lead to our patients' recovery. 
Operations are being performed under local anesthesia, since we lack the basic 
instruments and medicines needed to carry out normal operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital is full of premature and stillborn babies; babies that are born 
full-term are well under the desired weight. For a long time now, we have been 
lacking any kind of baby food and are not able to feed these underweight 
infants. 
</P>
<P>
 In this desperate situation, without the necessary food and medicines, 
infectious diseases are spreading -- tuberculosis, intestinal diseases, 
hepatitis, vitamin A deficiency. This hospital is no longer in a position to 
help the inhabitants of this area. 
</P>
<P>
 All the employees of the hospital appeal to the whole world and especially to 
the world health organizations, humanitarian organizations, doctors and all 
medical workers to raise their voices for help for the Bihac Regional Hospital. 
If help does not come immediately, help will no longer be necessary, as there 
will not be a single patient left; such a fate may also be in store for the 
rest of the inhabitants of this region. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe that the world has a moral responsibility to help us; we ask that 
every last possibility be taken to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Please help us. Alone we can no longer do anything.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; CREMATORIUM CASE RESULTS IN REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relatives of thousands of people whose remains were entrusted to an Anaheim 
crematorium have agreed to a settlement of their civil lawsuit regarding the 
manner in which the remains were treated. It appears to be a sensible end to an 
emotional proceeding, and should help grieving family members proceed with the 
healing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Cremar Crematorium and several Orange County mortuaries and 
funeral societies that were also defendants in the legal action said their 
clients did not admit any guilt or wrongdoing in this month's settlement. But 
they said it would have taken too long, probably several more years, for a 
trial and likely appeals before final disposition of the lawsuit, which was 
filed in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15,000 relatives of people who were cremated at the Anaheim facility 
between 1981 and 1991, and their lawyers, will share in a settlement of more 
than $16 million. The plaintiffs charged that the remains of their loved ones 
were mishandled, commingled and suffered the removal of dental gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the cash payment, which after lawyers' fees is likely to average 
around $600 to $700 per family, the relatives also can take satisfaction from 
the knowledge that their claims and lawsuit helped cause changes in state law 
regarding funeral practices. A new state law requires annual unannounced 
inspections of crematory facilities and makes the misappropriation of dental 
gold, silver or jewelry a felony. Additionally, corpses must be refrigerated 
before cremation and more training must be provided for workers at 
crematoriums. Considering the charges in the lawsuit and in similar court 
claims elsewhere in California in recent years, the reforms were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, California's funeral home industry was rocked several years ago 
when a San Bernardino County sheriff's investigator found partially cremated 
bodies and trash cans full of human ashes at a ceramics plant in the high 
desert community of Hesperia. The son of the former owners of a Pasadena 
funeral home pleaded guilty to mishandling remains and served more than two 
years in prison. That case, too, led to reforms in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement of the Anaheim case in Superior Court in Santa Ana was filled 
with poignant testimony from relatives about the trauma they claimed to have 
suffered from the alleged mishandling of the remains of family members. The 
death of a loved one is a difficult enough time without the added burden of 
uncertainty about disposition of the remains.

STREET SMART:: WHOM TO FLAG WHEN THEY SHOULD BE WORKING ON THE RAILROAD

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Please advise what the procedure is to register a complaint with Union Pacific 
Railroad to repair the track crossing on Dale Street between Malvern and 
Artesia avenues in Buena Park. The surface consists of wood and paving material 
and is so broken, bumpy and in bad shape that it is especially hard on tires 
and alignment. It would be so much better to have a grating-type crossing, such 
as the one on Western Avenue, which can't get torn up by heavy trucks and long, 
hard use. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia J. Hand 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The railroad crossing in that location is owned by the Atchison, Topeka & 
Santa Fe Railway. To report the problem, call (800) 333-2383. This is the 
railroad's 24-hour number, which taps into the communications center in Topeka, 
Kan. Employees there will relay the information to local repair crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 What purpose is served by those blank, green signs posted on Harbor and 
MacArthur boulevards in Santa Ana? 
</P>
<P>
 Margot Johnson 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the "trailblazer" signs recently installed by the city of Santa Ana, 
and they won't be blank for long. By February, city traffic engineers will be 
able to display electronic messages on the 42-by-84-inch signs to alert drivers 
to construction detours and alternate routes to the San Diego Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 There are eight signs, two on Harbor and MacArthur boulevards, three on 
Fairview Street and MacArthur, and three on Bristol Street and MacArthur.  
</P>
<P>
 City traffic engineers will be able to broadcast messages via remote control 
from the traffic management center at Santa Ana City Hall, said Vinh Nguyen, 
associate transportation engineer for Santa Ana. The messages, in white 
lettering, will include arrows. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, a metered on-ramp light became operable at the Avenida 
Pico entrance to the northbound side of the Interstate 5 freeway in San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, one straight limit line keeps cars even with one another until 
the light changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it is out of the pits in high gear or get trampled. It's whoever has the 
fastest car goes first, making a very dangerous beginning to each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't it be better and isn't it possible to have a left side stop ahead of 
the right side, such as the Tustin Avenue on-ramp to the southbound Costa Mesa 
Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 I dread each morning now, knowing that, regardless which lane I'm in or how 
long I've waited for the light change, the guy next to me is going to gun it 
and peel out, leaving me along the side of the road in his exhaust. 
</P>

 Caltrans traffic engineers believe that a staggered limit line doesn't make a 
significant difference in helping drivers merge from two lanes to one, said Pam 
Gorniak, a Caltrans spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the benefits of this system is that it allows more cars to queue up 
than would a staggered line, said Rose Orem of Caltrans. But, generally, one 
driver is more aggressive and will proceed ahead of another, Orem said. It is 
best to yield to the driver who accelerates more, she said.

300 JEWISH VOLUNTEERS BRING CITY A YULE GIFT; RELIGION: VISITS TO RUNAWAY 
SHELTER AND AIDS PATIENTS MARK JEWISH FEDERATION COUNCIL'S FIRST ANNUAL 
CHRISTMAS DAY OF GOOD WORKS FOR LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 300 volunteers turned out Sunday to clean beaches, paint T-shirts 
with runaway youths in Hollywood, deliver food to AIDS patients and join in 
other activities in what was billed as the first annual Christmas Day of good 
works by the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking note of the youngish character of the crowd, composed of many singles 
and young people, Rabbi Harvey Fields said the outpouring "put the lie to those 
who say the 25-to-40s don't care about society." 
</P>
<P>
 "As Jews give a kind of Christmas gift to the city we love, I feel a 
particular joy," Fields said at the federation's Wilshire Boulevard 
headquarters before the volunteers fanned out in car pools to their various 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky, Los Angeles' newest county supervisor, said: "Looking around 
the world today, we see so many people at each other's throats. It is unusual 
when one community reaches out to another as we are today. We are in a sense 
filling a 24-hour void created by so many others celebrating the holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 LA Works, a group that organizes such missions throughout the year on a 
nondenominational basis, helped the federation choose the activities. Calls to 
participate went out in the federation's newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
 After a continental breakfast with bagels, team leaders set up car pools and 
went to their designated sites. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles Youth Network's emergency shelter for runaway youths on 
Gower Street in Hollywood, 16 federation volunteers were joined by members of a 
Jewish rock band and cast members from the television program "ER."  
</P>
<P>
 When the band played, its lead singer, Paul Goldowitz, sang distinctly 
non-Christmas songs. Then everyone painted T-shirts and made jewelry. At the 
end, some of the youths staged their own dance numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Shechter, the team leader, greeted the youths with a hearty "Merry 
Christmas from the Jewish Federation Council." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to celebrate their holiday," Shechter said later. "That's where I 
was coming from, but, of course, we're secure in our own religion." 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Pallares, the activities coordinator at the shelter, asked that the 
youths, most of whom are in their mid-teens, not be interviewed or identified 
by name to guard their privacy. He explained that many of the young people come 
from homes where they were abused and in some cases do not want their families 
to know where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter tries to keep the youths no longer than two months, either 
encouraging them to return home, if that is appropriate, or trying to find them 
more permanent shelter, the staff said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Christmas event, "you never know what this does," said Joe 
Cislowski, another volunteer. "You walk away with a good feeling, and someday 
some good may come out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer Howard Schwimmer said knowing what was accomplished wasn't 
necessary. "It's a little too early to write off these kids," he said, "and I 
just wanted to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Another party of volunteers went to the Estelle Van Meter Multi Purpose Center 
on East 76th Street in South Los Angeles so they could paint it. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers also visited two AIDS hospices and landscaped a housing project, 
among other missions.

STATE ORDERS SHUTDOWN OF PARKING STRUCTURE; SAFETY: THE 145 S. BROADWAY 
FACILITY COULD COLLAPSE IN A MODERATE QUAKE, AN ENGINEER SAYS. SEVERE SHAKING 
WOULD THREATEN ADJACENT STATE OFFICE BUILDING, BUT IT WILL STAY OPEN.

<P>
 State officials have ordered the closure Sunday of a 905-car parking structure 
serving state employees Downtown after a structural engineer found that the 
facility could collapse under moderate shaking from an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 However, also acting on the advice of two engineers from separate firms, the 
state Department of General Services has decided to keep open the Junipero 
Serra State Office Building at 107 S. Broadway, which is next to the parking 
structure. The building houses about 1,750 employees and is frequently the site 
of large public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The building is stronger than the parking structure, the engineers said, 
although they cautioned that it too could fail in a "severe" earthquake. Still, 
they said, such a quake is unlikely in the next five years that the building is 
expected to be occupied. The state has plans to replace the building but has 
not said when. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a Nov. 14 letter to State Architect Harry Hallenbeck, Allan E. Porush, a 
structural engineer with the Los Angeles firm of Dames & Moore, said his firm 
had concluded that "even moderate intensities of earthquake groundshaking could 
result in unacceptable behavior" of the parking structure at 145 S. Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore, we would not be adverse to demolition of the . . . structure, or 
at least removal of the top three stories as a precautionary measure in the 
earliest practical time frame." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the Serra Office Building and another adjacent parking structure on 
Hill Street, Porush said: "We have found that these two structures do not have 
adequate strength or ductility (flexibility to bend without breaking) to 
withstand the severe groundshaking intensities such as those that might, on 
average, occur once in 475 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, it is my opinion that the risk to building occupants due to 
continued use of the two structures for a five-year period is limited and 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason for this opinion is that the probability of a major earthquake 
occurring in close proximity to the site within the next five years, and 
resulting in severe damage and adverse life-safety consequences, is 
sufficiently low. Therefore, we believe that immediate evacuation of the 
buildings is an unnecessary precaution." 
</P>
<P>
 A second engineer, Saiful Islam of the firm of Englekirk & Sabol, concurred 
with that assessment on the office building and said that the 145 S. Broadway 
parking structure should be restricted in its use. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a Nov. 29 letter to the state architect's office, Islam said of the office 
building: "The probability of a major earthquake which may result in severe 
damage and probable life threatening condition . . . is significantly less 
likely in the next five years than it is during the assumed design life of 
typical structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore, in our opinion, the probable performance of these structures in a 
major earthquake, which has very small probability of occurring in the next 
three to five years, should not be used as a criterion to decide whether or not 
these structures need to be evacuated immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Joel McRonald, a principal architect in the state architect's office, 
summarized the decision on closing the parking structure but keeping the office 
building open as "just sort of playing the odds" based on the probabilities 
that moderate shaking may well occur but severe shaking is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Porush said in an interview that severe shaking was defined by his firm as an 
earthquake that would cause a ground acceleration equivalent to 40% of the 
force of gravity. He gave no quake magnitude in defining severity. 
</P>
<P>
 He conceded that some acceleration readings in the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake damage zone were considerably higher than 40%, but said that 40% was 
"about the average." 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a 10% probability of such ground shaking Downtown in the next 50 
years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the assessment in his letter that such shaking would only occur once in 
475 years, Porush said that is based on "standard consensus" governing the 
state's building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he acknowledged, the assessment of a 475-year interval in a severe 
quake Downtown "might be updated in the wake of Northridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Some earthquake scientists have been cautioning since 1987, when the magnitude 
5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake struck southeast of Los Angeles, that the fault 
involved, the Elysian Park, runs just north of Downtown and could cause as 
strong as a magnitude 7 earthquake there, but they have not put a time frame on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have told employees who pay $44 a month for parking at the 
garage to move out and either seek parking nearby or start riding public 
transit. Some employees said they have been able to find other parking for $50 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Union of Safety Employees has expressed some concern regarding 
the status of state buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Dec. 16 letter to the state Department of General Services, union 
official Miriam S. Doonan noted that the department has identified 37 state 
buildings and parking structures for earthquake safety upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, she said, it has provided information on the status of only the Serra 
building and the two parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am asking for the risk level rating for each identified building," she 
wrote.

SANTA CLAUS REALLY DELIVERS ON CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A small measure of what makes Christmas a special time was played out on the 
steps of a Hollenbeck retirement home Sunday morning when Delbert Ray Phillips 
showed up with a present for Viola Butterfield. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 87-year-old Butterfield could not have been happier to see Phillips, 
who was decked out in a red suit and white beard with a "ho, ho, ho" on his 
lips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa, I just wanted to come and thank you personally," the smiling 
Butterfield told Phillips, a 44-year-old special delivery messenger for the 
U.S. Postal Service. "This was a real surprise for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips and about four dozen of his colleagues in Los Angeles rose bright and 
early to make Christmas morning a little more joyful by delivering packages. 
Officials estimate that about 1,600 such deliveries were made in Los Angeles 
via Express Mail, the Postal Service's only mail delivery on the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips was the only Los Angeles messenger to masquerade as Santa, and his 
costume drew stares from adults and oohs and ahs from children along his 
Eastside run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-year Postal Service employee says he has volunteered to work every 
Christmas, mostly because of the smiles the Christmas Day packages bring to 
children who peep around their front doors wondering what new delights are in 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one stopover in a housing project last week when I was out in the Santa 
costume and about 30 kids came out from everywhere and surrounded me," he said. 
"I'm going back over there after my run to find out if they got what they 
wanted for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 But unexpected encounters like that with Butterfield also make the Christmas 
workday worthwhile, he said. Phillips had delivered the package to the 
receptionist at the Hollenbeck Home and was about to leave when Butterfield 
emerged from the lobby to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wasn't expecting to get something today," said Butterfield, who 
added that she did not know who sent the package, though it bore a return 
address from a Canton, Ohio, jeweler. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips' presence on Christmas morning sometimes evokes disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never gotten any mail on Christmas before," said Jose Corona, who opened 
his door with a bewildered look on his face to accept an envelope. The packet 
held a card from a San Diego friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is wonderful," said Cecilia Barrera, who also had never received a 
Christmas Day package. "I looked out my window and saw this big red thing, and 
it turns out to be Santa. What a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrera regretted that her two youngest children had just left with their 
grandmother to go to Sunday church services. "They would have loved it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, who made more than 20 stops before his day ended, said his family's 
early morning celebrations have become routine because of his Christmas Day 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like it and they don't like it," he said. "They know I've got to work. 
We're getting together at my sister's house this evening, so we'll still have a 
lot of family time for ourselves."

STREET SMART / L.D. STRAUB: HATE TO BUCKLE UP? AVOIDING IT IS A BIGGER PAIN 
THAN YOU THINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No one relishes the thought of being thrown to the pavement in a car wreck, 
but lots of motorists still come up with reasons not to buckle up. Seat belts 
are uncomfortable. They wrinkle your clothes. They can be, literally, a pain in 
the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 And with all the new safety features available in new cars, such as air bags 
and automatic shoulder straps, are seat belts really vital to your safety? 
</P>
<P>
 You better believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 California has seen a steady decline in highway fatalities over the past few 
years. Although highway safety efforts have been multifaceted, more-stringent 
laws mandating safety restraints have played the most significant role in 
keeping people alive, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't attribute the decreased deaths to one factor, but increased safety 
belt usage constitutes the biggest part because it has the widest application," 
said Steve Kohler, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol. "More of the 
population is affected -- and can be affected -- by safety restraints than by, 
say, drunk driving laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Although figures are not available for the year coming to a close, the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says that an average of 110 
people died on the nation's roads each day in 1993 -- one every 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 On California surface streets and state highways, one person was killed every 
2 hours and 6 minutes. One person was injured in a traffic accident every 1 
minute and 40 seconds. That makes for 76 injuries for every traffic death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the CHP has analyzed whether people killed in traffic accidents 
while not wearing seat belts could have survived if they had taken the time to 
buckle up. In 1993, 1,060 people killed in traffic accidents were not wearing 
seat belts. Two-thirds could have survived if they had used safety restraints, 
the CHP estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Californians are more likely than other motorists in the nation to 
use seat belts. The CHP estimates that 83% of Californians buckled up in 1993. 
Nationally, the average was 62%. According to Kohler, the increased use of seat 
belts in California reveals the powerful effects of vehicle restraints. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only 1 in 2 Californians buckled up in 1988. Now that ratio exceeds 4 in 5," 
Kohler said. During the same five years, the mileage death rate per 100 million 
vehicle miles of travel plunged from 2.3 to 1.56. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in seat belt use in California has jumped in tandem with the 
tightening of legislation regarding their use. 
</P>
<P>
 California was one of the first states to adopt the Primary Safety Belt Law, 
which means that officers may stop and cite a driver simply for failing to wear 
a seat belt. Before 1993, an unbelted person could be cited only when stopped 
for another violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of seat belts has increased from 12% to 16% each of the several times the 
state has tightened its laws over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simply buckling up that belt is not enough. There are right and wrong ways to 
wear a seat belt. The lap belt should be worn low and tight across the abdomen 
and high across the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to be tight to really be secure, but if you find it uncomfortable, 
you are not going to wear it," Pulley said. "Generally, if you loosen it up 
enough to slide your fisted hand between your body and the belt, you should be 
both comfortable and safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Pulley also warned against the habit of wearing the shoulder strap either 
beneath the arm or behind the back. Both practices severely limit or eliminate 
the protection provided by the shoulder belt and can increase trauma to the 
abdomen in case of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Also dangerous is the notion that the automatic shoulder belt available in 
some cars provides adequate protection. If the lap belt is not fastened, the 
shoulder belt may not catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the lap restraint, you are likely to submarine-out from under the 
shoulder belt into the steering column, increasing injury to your lower body," 
Pulley said. 
</P>
<P>
 And air bags, Pulley said, offer no protection from being thrown around the 
car during a crash. Recent studies show that even when they do inflate, air 
bags alone offer only minimal protection. 
</P>
<P>
 In two years, 95% of all new cars will be required to have both driver-side 
and passenger-side air bags. By 1998, all new cars will have to meet that 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has said he wants to see seat belt usage raised from the 62% 
to 70% nationwide by the end of his term. As David Alexander of the National 
Safety Council noted: "Sixty-two percent of the nation wearing seat belts means 
that 38% still are not. . . . Pledging to make sure that you are belted up, and 
that every passenger in your car is properly restrained, would be a good New 
Year's resolution for everyone."

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1894, the village of Garvanza lay in open country between the rapidly 
growing towns of Los Angeles and Pasadena. Los Angeles' population had reached 
70,000, Pasadena's was approaching 10,000, but Garvanza boasted no more than a 
few hundred residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The hamlet was linked to its larger neighbors by rutted roads known for 
choking dust in summer and deep mud after winter rains. Many residents worked 
at trades, but there also were a number of farms and ranches. Citrus fruit 
thrived and flocks of sheep grazed on the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two Garvanza women known as the Magazine Club were the driving force 
that year in creating a lending library of 800 volumes in a small building. All 
the books were donated by local citizens, and annual membership was 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1899, Garvanza, near what is now Figueroa Street and York Boulevard, was 
annexed by Los Angeles. The library became a city library branch. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1904, a new library opened at Avenue 64 and Ruby Street. 
Architecturally, it belonged to the historic Mission style, but its amenities 
were up to date, including a gas heater and electric lights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The area kept pace with Los Angeles' mushrooming population, and by 1913 the 
library needed more room. On Sept. 8, 1913, the Los Angeles Times reported, 
"Highland Park and Garvanza shall have a (new) library. It will be a Carnegie 
Institution, located either at Avenue 56 and Pasadena Avenue (later named 
Figueroa Street) or in the delta between Piedmont and Pasadena avenues." 
</P>
<P>
 Civic leaders organized a subscription drive and raised $5,680 toward purchase 
of the latter site. The Arroyo Seco Branch Library was paid for from a Carnegie 
grant to Los Angeles and completed in 1914 -- the same year the Southwest 
Museum, another Highland Park landmark, moved into its Mt. Washington home. 
Total cost for the library's site and construction was $44,775.  
</P>
<P>
 The library was an impressive edifice, reminiscent of classic Greek 
architecture. Slender columns lined the building's exterior, framed the tall 
windows and flanked the portico at the front entrance. The motto "Free to All" 
was carved in cream-colored stone over the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The building was also notable for unusual problems posed by the site's shape 
and contours. In its December, 1917 issue, Popular Mechanics noted that the 
site was "V-shaped (and) bounded by two converging streets, one of which slopes 
downward from the intersection past the site, while the other slopes upward 
past the site. The building faces the point of the lot." 
</P>
<P>
 These problems were overcome by sculpting the earth along the building's 
perimeter and making it slightly wider at the back than at the front. Standing 
well back from the library, a spectator could see the front and both side 
walls. From the front, the library appeared to be one story, but in back, on 
lower ground, the entrance to a basement-level auditorium could be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael W. McClintock, raised in Highland Park, remembers the building well. 
"That old building conveyed a feeling of power and permanence. Inside you could 
just smell all the years of people, books, dust -- and history. It was a warm, 
comfortable place. After my own home, that library made the deepest impression 
on me as a 5- to 10-year-old child." 
</P>
<P>
 The Carnegie grant library was razed in 1959 after 45 years, and a new 
structure replaced it, opening Oct. 17, 1960. The building, still in use at 
6145 N. Figueroa St., is streamlined, unadorned, functional. 
</P>
<P>
 But McClintock recalls one special feature of the building that won him over 
quickly. "The first week it was open my dad drove me to the library, and I 
didn't know quite what to expect. He could (have) parked at the curb or in the 
lot beside the library. Instead, without a word, he swung the car onto a narrow 
ramp and zoomed to a rooftop parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 His fond memories of the two libraries have influenced his life. McClintock, 
44, attended nearby Occidental College and USC, where he earned a master's 
degree in library science. He worked as an intern at the Arroyo Seco branch 
from 1974 to 1976. Today he is area manager of the Los Angeles County library 
system's east San Gabriel Valley region. 
</P>
<P>
 The two library buildings have occupied a strip of land between a hill known 
as Mt. Angeles and the Arroyo Seco for a total of 80 years. Now the Arroyo Seco 
Regional Library, the facility is headquarters for the 10 branch libraries of 
the city's northeast area. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 100 years, the Magazine Club's collection of 800 books has grown to 
78,000 volumes. STEVE TICE

HOT JOBS: METER READER: A JOB YOU CAN WALK AWAY WITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Traversing the roads of Orange County for more than 13 years, Richard Johnson 
has raked up quite a few miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 37, who works for Southern California Gas Co., said he enjoys his 
independence as a meter reader and the benefits of being outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 The last job he held was as a busboy, which he said "just wasn't for me." He 
got a job as a meter reader thinking it would be good because if you finish 
your rounds quickly, you get off early. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw guys getting off at 4:30 p.m., I decided this was the job for me," 
he said. Under optimal conditions, Johnson makes his appointed rounds and is on 
the beach surfing by late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he can't make it to the beach, he stays physically fit as a result 
of his job. Johnson estimates he walks eight to 10 miles daily reading meters 
at homes and offices. Though he loves the outdoors, he admits having a job that 
demands he be outside isn't always a plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's raining, that's when we really earn our money," Johnson said. "And 
when it's real hot, you get the heat headaches and you fatigue easy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the benefits are that essentially he is his own boss. In the morning, 
meter readers check in to pick up a computer that tells them how many and where 
the meters are they have to read. When they are done, they head back to the 
office and turn in the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, you are in charge of your own schedule, Johnson said. You decide 
when you take your breaks, and there is no boss constantly watching over you, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But dogs can be a problem. Johnson has been bitten three times and landed in 
the hospital once resulting from one of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not only the dogs he has to watch out for. According to Johnson, 
people increasingly are becoming unfriendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether his clients are friendly or not, Johnson maintains a smile. "I like to 
chat with the clients. I still do the 'How's it going?' thing," he said. 
OCCUPATION: Meter reader 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Monitoring and recording utility meter use for billing 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospects: The number of meter readers working in the county is expected to 
increase by 23.1% to 160 by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $10 per hour 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Meter readers are outdoors all day and work independently. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Must beware of vicious dogs and bad weather. It also can get boring 
working alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "When I saw guys getting off at 4:30 p.m., I decided this was the job 
for me." -- Richard Johnson

VALLEY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: GIFT RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Abigail Goldman and Chip Johnson and L.D. Straub 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CAVEAT EMPTOR: Do you have a right to return that truly awful gift? State law 
expects retailers to give a full cash or credit refund if a customer returns 
merchandise and a proof of purchase within seven days. . . . But, says the 
Department of Consumer Affairs, all a merchant has to do to get around that is 
to have a "conspicuous display" of any policy to the contrary. Like posting, 
"ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS." 
</P>
<P>
 THANKS, I THINK: If a gift from a loved one doesn't suit your taste, it's 
socially acceptable to ask where they bought it so you can exchange it. . . . 
But if it's from a business associate, that teal jumpsuit could be yours 
forever. "If it's an acquaintance or a colleague, you may be creating a 
problem," says Kimber Lee Wilkes, who teaches an etiquette class at Pierce 
College. "I would keep the gift and maybe give it to someone else with that 
kind of taste." 
</P>
<P>
 NO THANKS: Try putting one of these back in the gift box. . . . At the Mar-Tex 
Pet Shop in Encino, people have returned everything from puppies to reptiles 
known as water dragons. But store owner Susan McCoy, above, says she will 
always take back a failed pet "because the worst thing that could happen is 
that these animals end up where they are not wanted or cared for." 
</P>
<P>
 NO REFUNDS: When most people take back a gift, they usually want another gift. 
So says Mike Gatti, vice president of marketing for the National Retail 
Federation. . . . Only about 10% of gift purchases are exchanged for cash 
refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 IN PRIVATE: Returning a sweater is one thing, but lace panties? It happens. 
"If guys try to buy bras for women, they will come back because those are items 
that must be fitted," explains Monica Mitro, a spokeswoman for Victoria's 
Secret. There's some cheery news, though. Over the years, Mitro's noticed that 
some women are "thrilled to death" when their husbands mistakenly buy 
brassieres that are too small for them. Abigail Goldman and Chip Johnson and

 THRILL MASTER: It's got a psychotic madman, a renegade government agency and 
good guys on the run. Dean Koontz's "Dark Rivers of the Heart" is one of the 
holiday season's biggest national bestsellers. "It's a brutally tough season," 
says the Newport Beach author, who is selling nearly 40% more books than ever. 
"The numbers you have to sell to get on the list this season is really 
something.". . . Koontz considers the book, which CBS will turn into a 
miniseries next year, to be a breakthrough novel: "There's those moments in 
your career when you realize you've taken a step up and are writing better than 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
 HELP WANTED: Self-help books may not be so helpful after all. They usually 
bypass the unconscious, says Newport Beach psychologist Alice Vieira. If you 
try to change a behavior without knowing what the underlying belief system is, 
it's not going to work, she says. But isn't Vieira's "Belief Systems and Your 
Personal Power" a self-help book? "I tried not to say this is what to do to 
change, but just be aware of what you're doing," she says. "Without awareness 
there are no options. You just continue doing what you have done in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 MOUNTAIN MAN: "Ponder the Path" by Gary Wiles and Delores Brown of Laguna 
Niguel is a rousing historical novel about the opening of the Oregon Trail. The 
authors, who spent two years researching the book, show up at book signings 
dressed in 1830s period costumes. At 6-foot-4 and 250 pounds, former lawyer 
Wiles Brown strikes an imposing buck-skinned figure. "I also have a foot-long 
knife on one side and a pistol on the other," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 WORKOUT: Ready to shed those extra pounds? Many who join gyms stop going after 
a few weeks. The reason? "One of the most common comments is they feel foolish 
because they don't know what to do," says Dana Point fitness center owner Lou 
Gaudio, author of "Lou Gaudio's How to Stay Young Workout: The First 90 Days." 
The wire-bound book, designed to be taken to the gym, also keeps records and 
charts progress.

WILDERNESS LOST; URBAN 'PLINKERS' TURN REMOTE CANYON INTO SHOOTING RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing next to his mud-splattered pickup truck, Stan Zarkowski took aim with 
his Chinese-made MAC-90 and ripped off six quick rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Small spits of dirt jumped around the target -- a diamond-shaped "Divided 
Road" sign propped against a stream bed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was noon, and the 33-year-old maintenance worker from Thousand Oaks had 
been target shooting for hours. An open Coors Light rested on his tailgate near 
boxes of ammunition, a 9-millimeter Ruger pistol and a new Smith & Wesson 
.357-magnum revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 By his estimate, $70 worth of spent shell casings littered the ground nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come up here and let your frustrations out," said Zarkowski, clad in a 
sweat shirt, dusty jeans and tennis shoes. "It keeps you in line. It keeps you 
out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the remote spots in Ventura County's backcountry, Cherry Canyon has 
emerged as an unofficial, unregulated shooting range for urban "plinkers." 
Because of its immense popularity, the canyon also has become one of the most 
abused stretches of wilderness in the Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Broken glass sparkles on the hillsides. Bullet casings and shotgun shells 
carpet the ground. One of the larger piles of trash contains a toaster, a 
toilet rim, a Twinkie display stand, clock radio and dozens of beer cans. 
</P>
<P>
 At a clearing that was once an established campground, plinkers blasted a 
picnic table so often that U.S. Forest Service officials removed it last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come out here with a gun and their mind-set all the sudden changes to 
this Rambo-type attitude," said George Garcia, a wildlife biologist with the 
Ojai Ranger District. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Forest Service has done little to discourage shooting at 
Cherry Canyon. Under a broad policy, guns are allowed throughout the national 
forest, except near campgrounds and other recreational areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody really turned a blind eye to it," Garcia said. "The attitude was: 
It's better to have it there than scattered throughout the whole district." 
</P>
<P>
 But rangers are now taking a closer look at the canyon and figuring out ways 
to repair the environmental damage. Eventually, they may issue a plan to 
protect the canyon from further abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger Linda Riddle said the Forest Service could decide to ban shooting in 
the canyon, though that decision will probably not be made within the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is that possibility," she said. "But I just don't know how it's going 
to turn out in the end. I don't have any preconceived ideas about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the controversy that would come with any decision to ban or 
restrict shooting, the Forest Service is taking a cautious, inclusive approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step, Riddle said, is to study the impacts of shooting and off-road 
vehicles in Cherry Canyon and in the larger watershed that feeds into Sespe 
Creek. Specific funding has not been set aside for such a study, but it has 
been cited as a priority project. 
</P>
<P>
 The second step involves determining whether target shooting can be done 
safely in three-mile-long Cherry Canyon. To get an answer, rangers will study 
shooting locations in other mountainous areas, consult with gun clubs and meet 
with other members of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that will take time, Riddle said. Consequently, rangers are 
concentrating now on winning public cooperation to limit the damage to riparian 
and wildlife areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't act responsibly, we have to act responsibly for them," Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While litter and abandoned, rusting appliances are the most visible sign of 
the canyon's abuse, it is the dirt paths carved by motorcycles and four-wheel 
drive pickups that have prompted the Forest Service's plans to close the canyon 
before the winter storms soften the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 In past winters, the rain-swollen creek has proved a favorite spot for drivers 
of four-wheelers careening through the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Their tracks have turned the entrance to Cherry Creek Road into a wide, barren 
bowl devoid of vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 And along the bed of the seasonal creek, clumps of reddish buckwheat, great 
basin sage, wild rose and willow bushes lay trampled or uprooted, leaving bare 
patches of land. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of vegetation, Garcia said, could lead to more soil runoff into the 
creek, choking the path of steelhead trout swimming upstream to spawn. "It 
could be interrupting the reproduction of the species," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, Forest Service officials are installing a gate at the California 
33 turnoff that they hope will end winter traffic to Cherry Canyon and minimize 
the hillside erosion and silt buildup in Sespe Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers are also concerned about pollution from lead ammunition and toxic 
chemicals leaching into stream beds. Cans of paint, antifreeze and other 
chemicals are used as targets. Once plugged with holes, their contents seep 
into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, a Forest Service employee spotted a sheen on a hillside just inside 
the canyon's entrance. A five-gallon bucket of motor oil was found riddled with 
bullet holes, triggering an $1,800 cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a mile down Cherry Creek Road, the canyon walls narrow next to a stand of 
big cone Douglas firs. From there, the road winds uphill, and the evidence of 
shooting is more scattered. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent tour of the canyon, Garcia stopped his green Forest Service truck 
near a cluster of alder trees beside the creek for which the canyon is named. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at that," Garcia said, pointing to bark on an alder tree shredded by 
hundreds of shotgun pellets and larger lead slugs. "When the bark starts 
falling off, the trees are more susceptible to insects and disease." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to live for a while, but it's eventually going to die off." 
</P>
<P>
 It has only been in the past decade that Cherry Canyon emerged as the county's 
proving ground for would-be sharpshooters. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1984, shooting was permitted at the entrance to the Rose Valley 
Recreation Area, 10 miles south of Cherry Canyon. Cars would park along the 
paved road, with shooters blasting away at bottles and other targets. The 
legacy of that era is "Sparkle Mountain," a low hillside embedded with so much 
glass that it reflects sunlight like a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that area was closed to guns, shooters moved several miles up Maricopa 
Highway to a wide, grassy clearing. The spot remained popular for several years 
until plinkers began taking aim at a large California Department of 
Transportation storage shed to one side of the clearing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Caltrans, the Forest Service banned shooting there, pushing 
the activity farther up the highway until it reached the mouth of Cherry 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the canyon is clearly the hub of target shooting, rangers 
occasionally find trash and other evidence of activity in smaller, nearby 
canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Service personnel fear that if they try to restrict gun activity in one 
area, such as Cherry Canyon, target shooters will simply move up the highway or 
spread to neighboring canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one controlled range in Ventura County's backcountry. A few miles 
inside Rose Valley, the Ojai Valley Gun Club features a series of targets at 
measured distances, regular tournaments and classes on shooting safety. Each 
dues-paying member is provided with a key to the locked gate, and the club is 
open to the public for contests and once a month target practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're shooting enthusiasts and we try to make it as safe as possible," club 
president Jim Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of those who flock to Cherry Canyon bristle at the thought of paying 
money to shoot outdoors. And they say they prefer the freedom of Cherry Canyon, 
where there in no one to tell them what kind of weapons they can fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware that the Forest Service considers Cherry Canyon a problem, the shooters 
said they fear that guns will someday be banned in the area. Many expressed 
frustration with the trash and said they do their part to keep it clean. Some 
have participated with other volunteers in organized cleanup days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever we bring, we take back," said John Schlossman, 26, of Newbury Park, 
who works for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he acknowledged it can be a losing battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff just keeps getting bullet-riddled and before you know, there's too 
much to pick up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent weekend, despite a chilling wind, about two dozen people had 
staked out spots along the road that bisects the canyon. Few people described 
themselves as hunters. Instead, they said they were there for target practice 
and and to sharpen their skills for self-protection. 
</P>
<P>
 They fired an array of weapons ranging from small, palm-sized pistols to 
sawed-off 12-gauge shotguns and Russian AK-47s. Others, who considered 
themselves collectors, had brought World War II-era guns and replicas of older 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hobby," said Richard Brandt, 29, a communications engineer from 
Thousand Oaks, who was firing a replica of a rifle from the 1880s. "You like to 
come up here and see if you can hit stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, outings to Cherry Canyon are family affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 While the shooting is done almost exclusively by men, often they are 
accompanied by wives and children. 
</P>
<P>
 After making a trip to the top of the canyon to see a dusting of snow, Todd 
Raymond and several friends stopped to test their skills at skeet shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond blasted away with a .12-gauge shotgun, as his 4-year-old daughter, 
Ashley, and 6-year-old son, James, watched nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daddy, can I shoot? Can I shoot?" Ashley pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, honey, this one is too big for you," Raymond replied. 
</P>
<P>
 A short distance away, another father and his son were firing two homemade 
canons filled with black gunpowder. The booms echoed off the sandstone below 
Pine Mountain ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Azevedo, 46, said his son Brian had asked to go to Cherry Canyon for his 
birthday rather than hosting a party for his friends. The two had made the 
canons together during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Azevedo then taught his son to load the canon with black powder, tamp it with 
a rod, insert a metal ball, light the fuse and quickly back away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a single dad and I enjoy every minute of it," Azevedo said. "This is just 
kind of a thing we do."

 As he, his wife and two children ate platefuls of turkey, potatoes and 
stuffing in the Thousand Oaks High School cafeteria, catered to by a stream of 
peppy teen-age volunteers, the unemployed computer engineer felt like a king. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of our poorest Christmases," Lange said. "I'm not working and 
neither is my wife. But this is one of our better Christmases. It's nice what 
these people have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange was among more than 100 needy Ventura County residents who showed up in 
Thousand Oaks for a free Christmas Day dinner hosted by three Conejo Valley 
Jewish congregations -- Adat Elohim, Etz Chaim and Beth Haverim -- to boost 
holiday spirit and enforce community togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
 Adat Elohim incurred more than $25,000 in damages from an arson fire in 1991, 
and organizers said the Christian community showed congregation members such 
remarkable support that they felt they had to give something back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hoped to attract more people," said Donn Delson, who along with his wife 
Joyce was the chief organizer of the event. "But what's important is that 
everybody heard what we were doing today, and they have a better feeling about 
their community." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the Rescue Mission in Oxnard, about 75 homeless people attended 
a free Christmas dinner of sweet potatoes, ham, turkey and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very grateful -- I literally thank God -- that there are people like that 
who are willing to share their own resources with those who are less 
fortunate," said 50-year-old Charles Lee, sitting with a pocketful of candy 
canes after his meal. "It was absolutely delicious, and the price was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Robinson, a 38-year-old transient who lives "here or there" hopping 
freight trains throughout Southern California, said the meal was the only 
Christmas present he would get this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh man, for those of us who don't have a place to eat or live, no Christmas, 
at least we get a belly full," Robinson said. "The volunteers are very good to 
us. They did it very nicely." 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, where about 200 volunteers helped cook enough food for 2,500 
people and incessantly served those who attended, the surprised guests said 
they could not have bought better service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been overwhelmed," Lange said. "They have more volunteers than they 
have guests, and they are all looking for someone to serve. It's great." 
</P>
<P>
 Some attended because they were hungry and short of money. Others simply 
wanted to avoid spending the holiday alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe so many people donated their heart," Doris Nathaniel of 
Thousand Oaks said. "It really does your heart good." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the volunteers were students from Newbury Park, Westlake, Agoura 
Hills, Oak Park, and Thousand Oaks high schools who were looking to do some 
good on their vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've done this and I really feel good about it," said 
16-year-old Pamela Wisse, a junior at Westlake High. "We're helping other 
people make their Christmas better." 
</P>
<P>
 For Delson and others, who said they are fortunate to live in comfort, meeting 
some of their area's less-fortunate residents and bettering their Christmas was 
a touching experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "One young lady shared with us that she had been abandoned by her mother when 
she was 13," Delson said. "She's 26 now, living in a low-income housing project 
here in Thousand Oaks, and she said this is the nicest Christmas she's ever 
had." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Cab Co. gave free rides to and from the dinner. And Delson 
said the extra food will be donated to Manna food bank in Thousand Oaks, the 
Rescue Mission in Oxnard and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, only about 15 volunteers prepared the food and served the homeless, 
most of whom were regulars from the city's downtown. Although they had worked 
hard to cook the $4,000 worth of food and keep everyone's plate full, the 
volunteers believed they had spent their vacation well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people just throw food out there, but we want to be proud of what we 
do," said 43-year-old Eddie Williams, who cooked much of the food. "Whether 200 
people show up or it's just one, we want them to eat a great meal on 
Christmas."

ROOMMATES CAN OFFER SENIORS A BRIGHTER WORLD; HOUSING: HOME-SHARING PROGRAM'S 
DIRECTOR SCREENS APPLICANTS AND INTRODUCES COMPATIBLE SOULS. ARRANGEMENT CAN BE 
A BLESSING, WITH SOME RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At age 85, Lois Dawley feared the night. 
</P>
<P>
 She dreaded sleeping alone in a too-big house on a too-quiet street. She was 
sad. She was lonely. She was scared. 
</P>
<P>
 Then someone mentioned Senior Home Sharing. And Dawley's world brightened. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a decade, Senior Home Sharing has matched elderly Ventura County 
residents with roommates. Director Muriel Steiger screens all applicants, 
checks their backgrounds and visits their homes. She then finds compatible 
souls and introduces them to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Dawley met a much younger Eileen Rust nearly two years ago. The two 
women hit it off and agreed to share Dawley's three-bedroom tract home in 
Camarillo. They have been roommates -- and friends -- ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly am pleased," Dawley said, watching with a grin as her shaggy 
white dog, Li'l Bit, played on Rust's lap. "We haven't had any problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by the Area Housing Authority on a tight annual budget of $50,000, 
Senior Home Sharing matches about 100 pairs of roommates each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the renters are lower-income residents who take rooms while they wait 
for scarce subsidized housing. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, they may be reluctant to move into a stranger's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "But on second thought, a lot of them say it's better than staying in a really 
run-down place or living out of a car or camping out," said Caroline Briggs, 
executive director of the Area Housing Authority. "It's a safe, fairly 
comfortable and inexpensive option." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Dailey realized those benefits soon after she moved into Bernice 
Cangelosi's house in Thousand Oaks. In her mid-20s, she wanted independence 
from her family but could not afford her own apartment. She found Home Sharing 
a perfect solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, Dailey said: "Everything's just great here." 
</P>
<P>
 Home sharing can also be a blessing for the hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some senior citizens need younger, stronger roommates to help with the 
housework. Others rely on monthly rent checks to meet their mortgage payments. 
Still others depend on companionship to keep them lively and alert. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they get a good roommate, it can keep them in their homes a lot longer," 
Steiger said. "Otherwise, they would just wind up in nursing homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, home sharing does carry a measure of risk as well. College students 
may be willing to step over a roommate's dirty socks or devour cold pizza for 
breakfast, but senior citizens may not be that flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're moving into someone's home, it's their territory, and the whole 
arrangement can turn out to be awkward," said Jon Pynoos, a professor of 
gerontology at the University of Southern California. "I'm married with three 
kids and I know it's hard enough to live with someone you've made a commitment 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of such stresses, up to half of all home-sharing arrangements 
break up within the first eight months, Pynoos said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Ventura County, Steiger has seen her share of disastrous -- and 
short-lived -- matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the time she unknowingly sent an alcoholic man to room with another 
alcoholic man. "They drank themselves into insensibility," Steiger recalled. 
Since then, she has tightened her screening process and now interviews friends 
and relatives of each client. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the more intense scrutiny, some of her matches suffer, due to 
personality clashes or territorial spats: fights over who drank the last glass 
of milk or who should take out the garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Dawley and Rust worried about such quarrels when they agreed to share the 
Camarillo home. As a former boardinghouse owner, Dawley knew that tenants could 
look perfectly nice and then steal jewelry, or seem wonderfully conscientious 
and then stumble in rip-roaring drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't reluctant to share my house with someone -- I was just nervous about 
who it might be," Dawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know either," Rust added. "It's scary for both people." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the two women have become so comfortable together that Rust boasts 
about Dawley's grandchildren. They watched the Camarillo Christmas parade 
together, and they delight in the musical doorbell that plinks out "Silent 
Night." 
</P>
<P>
 And Dawley no longer fears the night.

STREET SMART: DESPITE LIGHT TRAFFIC, SAFETY CONCERNS WARRANT STOP SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to call your attention to some unnecessary stop signs at a T-shaped 
intersection in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about Petit Avenue and North Bank Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years I have driven through that intersection several 
hundred times at rush hour and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 In all that time, I have seen just four vehicles using North Bank Drive east 
of the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line here is that there will never be enough traffic coming from 
North Bank Drive east of the intersection to warrant this three-way stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever planned these stop signs obviously never visited this location. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs are a waste of money and a nuisance to drivers because they are 
totally unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 If whoever designed this plan needs to justify his work, let him change the 
sign for westbound North Bank Drive to a yield sign and get rid of the other 
two stop signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Elmer Ferber, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Though the signs may seem unnecessary now, they are part of a larger, more 
traffic-filled vision for that intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 A subdivision now under construction at Petit and North Bank will eventually 
consist of 153 homes generating an estimated 2,000 vehicle trips per day, says 
Ventura traffic engineer Nazir Lalani. This is ample traffic to justify a 
three-way stop, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more importantly, the city decided to install the stop signs to 
improve safety at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the signs were installed, cars turning from Petit onto North Bank 
tended to squeal around from one street to the other without stopping or 
checking for oncoming traffic, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs force drivers to come to a stop before turning. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion the westbound Lynn Road off-ramp from the Ventura Freeway is 
extremely dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 I have used it almost daily for a year and a half and have the same feeling 
each time I come to the Lynn Road overpass, preparing to turn left and go 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 As one comes to Lynn Road there are several traffic lights that are all 
visible at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 If one comes to a stop at Lynn Road, the two lights that actually control the 
off-ramp are red, but in the same direction one can plainly see a green light 
that controls Lynn Road traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 I have quite often started to go onto Lynn Road because this third light is 
green, when in fact the lights controlling my lane are red. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this confusion could be cured by merely putting longer sleeves on the 
light controlling Lynn Road traffic so it cannot be seen from the off ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 William G. Israel, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is indeed a dangerous and confusing one, says Caltrans traffic 
engineer Luu Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 After investigating the problem you pointed out, Caltrans workers have tilted 
the traffic light on Lynn Road so that cars coming from the freeway off-ramp do 
not simultaneously see green and red. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this will solve the problem," Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Often when I'm driving I notice large eighteen-wheeler tractor trucks trying 
to unsuccessfully navigate tight curves and steep grades in Grimes Canyon on 
California 23 and on Dennison Grade on California 150. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the trucks are so long they cannot make turns without their wheels 
going three or four feet into oncoming traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems physically impossible for these trucks not to cross the double yellow 
line on these dangerous, curving roads. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a lethal accident waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are they not banned? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Smith, Fillmore 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 It is, as you say, physically impossible for some large trucks to make narrow 
highway turns without crossing into oncoming traffic lanes, says Caltrans 
traffic engineer Luu Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 The California vehicle code does not allow Caltrans to ban trucks on state 
highways, except where the road cannot support the weight of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the code doesn't mention width or length. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as part of a statewide project to improve highway safety, Caltrans is 
installing signs discouraging large trucks from traveling on narrow, curving 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, signs will be installed on highways 23, 33 and 150.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MUSEUM GROUP GETS NONPROFIT STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The committee seeking to bring a children's science museum to Thousand Oaks 
has been awarded nonprofit status and can now accept tax deductible donations 
to raise money for its proposed hands-on science center. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the proposed Ventura County Discovery Center said receiving 
nonprofit status from the state and federal governments was a major hurdle in 
achieving their long-term goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we've been born," said Linda Parks, a member of the committee's 
board of directors. Nonprofit status is essential in generating the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars the group needs to bring a science museum to the Conejo 
Valley, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting the ball rolling," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters want to use the former city hall on Hillcrest Drive as a possible 
museum site, but city officials have said the group must first raise $600,000 
to renovate the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has already received a donation of $10,000 from Amgen 
Foundation, and museum supporters hope other Ventura County businesses will 
contribute to the project. Supporters also plan to seek federal science and 
technology grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really gives us the green light to go ahead and seek funding," committee 
Vice President Hope Colt Mette said of the group's new status. "It gives us a 
lot of validation to go forward." TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; WATER RATES WILL CLIMB 38% JAN. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ELIAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new year will bring with it higher water bills for 7,000 customers of 
Santa Paula Water Works. 
</P>
<P>
 The average household can expect to pay $10.45 more a month when rates jump 
38% Jan. 1, said Kyle DeVine of the California Public Utilities Commission, 
which approves all utility rate hikes in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the highest rate increases approved this year" in the state, 
DeVine said. The average residential customer will pay about $35.72 a month, 
DeVine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Water company officials had asked for a 55% increase in 1995, 11% in 1996 and 
10% in 1997. The commission instead approved increases of 38%, 4.8% and 4.2% 
respectively for those years. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller hike was big enough for some officials. "That's kind of a sharp 
increase in this day and age," Santa Paula Mayor Alfonso C. Urias said. 
</P>
<P>
 Water works Manager Dave Warner said the increase was needed in part to pay 
for an $850,000 water-treatment plant mandated by state health laws. The 
company also spent $400,000 to replace 34,000 feet of pipes and $200,000 to 
restore water wells. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our system is old and we have to start to invest a little more in capital 
improvements," Warner said. He also said customers used 20% less water than 
expected over the last three years, cutting expected revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula now ranks with Thousand Oaks as having the highest water bills in 
the county. Santa Paula Water Works is a privately held utility. PAUL ELIAS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MOORPARK; MEDICAL CLINIC TO OPEN TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County officials Tuesday will officially open Moorpark's new medical clinic, 
though its first patients will not be seen until next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The new clinic will replace a dilapidated facility on High Street that was 
closed 14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Moorpark area residents who receive Medi-Cal or who lack health 
insurance have had to go to Simi Valley for subsidized care. Officials estimate 
that the Simi Valley clinic has treated 700 to 800 Moorpark residents this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The new clinic, at 6559 Princeton Ave. near Moorpark College, will include 
examining rooms, a records room and a reception area. It will open for patients 
Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has spent about $220,000 renovating the privately owned building. 
Rent for the 4,400-square-foot storefront is $5,000 a month, Health Care Agency 
officials said. SCOTT HADLY

<P>
 Motorists speeding along the winding streets of Thousand Oaks will soon be 
confronted with their crimes in foot-high numbers on a roadside display, 
according to Thousand Oaks police. 
</P>
<P>
 The department recently acquired two $8,000 radar trailers.Parked at roadside, 
they will display the speed of approaching cars along with the posted speed 
limit for the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Craig Smith said that beginning Thursday, the trailers will be placed 
at accident-prone locations and at places where residents complain about 
speeders. 
</P>
<P>
 The trailers do not automatically issue speeding tickets to violators, but 
Smith said officers may be posted near the trailers to nab the worst offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he thinks the new equipment will make motorists more aware of their 
driving habits. It will also help drivers check the accuracy of their own 
speedometers, he said. IRA E. STOLL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MOORPARK; HOWARD TO HONOR LIBRARY DONORS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard on Tuesday will unveil a plaque at the Moorpark 
Library in appreciation of the dozens of people who donated money to pay for 
the library's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign to expand the library is still about $10,000 short of its 
$421,000 goal, said Barbara Loczi, a Howard aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard made getting money for the library one of her last goals before leaving 
office at the end of the year, Loczi said. The supervisor helped set up the 
Moorpark telethon that raised $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Due in part to Howard's efforts, last spring Ventura County pledged to pay 
$260,000 for the expansion and the city of Moorpark contributed $65,000. In 
addition, a bequest of about $5,000 from a former librarian, a pledge of 
$18,000 in services from the city and $28,000 in time and money from local 
businesses brought the amount raised to about $410,000, Loczi said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's ceremony, scheduled for 11:30 a.m., Howard will present the 
plaque, which names about 30 donors who gave $250 or more for the expansion 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 A list of all the donors will be provided at the ceremony. SCOTT HADLY

 After driving 1,764 miles in two days with the two children he had been 
searching for since August, James Moats returned home to Camarillo just in time 
for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Moats said he and his children, James, 5, and Jessica, 9, were taken by 
surprise by the Christmas decorations and presents left inside the house by 
friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We drove up and saw all the decorations and figured that was it. Then we went 
inside and we were just like -- whoa! We were real surprised," Moats said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family was reunited Thursday, when Moats found the children living with 
their mother in Missouri. Sherry Kay Moats, 35, was arrested on child abduction 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the children were riding bicycles and playing outside their house in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just having a great time. They're happy to be home," Moats said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his mother, friends and Deputy Dist. Atty. Pam Grossman, who helped 
find the children, were among his Christmas visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Moats said that while he was pleased with his family reunion, his holiday joy 
was tempered because of his knowledge of other parents searching for children 
who are still missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there's a lot of other kids out there who aren't as lucky," he 
said. IRA E. STOLL

<P>
 The Ventura County Commission for Women is accepting nominations for its 12th 
and final annual Salute to Women of Achievement Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination deadline is Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen women will receive awards in 11 categories: arts, business, community 
service, education, entrepreneur, legal, media, public service, science/health, 
sports and outstanding young women. Two women will receive community service 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners will be announced during a banquet in Camarillo on March 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the awards will be discontinued after the banquet so that the

becoming economically self-sufficient."

 Nomination forms, invitations to the banquet and additional information can be 
obtained by calling Loma Siegel at 388-9587 or Celeste Weingardt at 658-1351.

<P>
 A 17-year-old from Santa Paula died late Christmas Eve after her car spun out 
on rain-slicked California 126, veered onto the dirt shoulder and struck a 
tree, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marisol Rodriguez was driving east on California 126 near Briggs Road with her 
21-year-old sister Maribell about 3:35 p.m. Saturday when she lost control of 
her car and crashed.No other vehicles were involved in the accident, California 
Highway Patrol officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Marisol Rodriguez nor her sister were wearing seat belts, authorities 
said, and emergency equipment was needed to remove them from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sisters suffered internal injuries and were taken to Santa Paula 
Hospital. Marisol Rodriguez was transferred later to Ventura County Medical 
Center, where she was pronounced dead about 9 p.m. Saturday, said Dale Zentzis 
of the Ventura County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past five years, 29 people have died along the winding stretch of 
California 126 between Ventura and the Los Angeles County line east of 
Fillmore. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

 Weather permitting, the sixth aerial spraying of malathion will be conducted 
Tuesday over a 16-square-mile section of eastern Camarillo, state and federal 
agriculture officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three helicopters are scheduled to lift off from Camarillo Airport at 10 
p.m. for what is expected to be a four-hour mission, said Larry Hawkins, a 
spokesman for the Cooperative Medfly Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next month, Hawkins said, the helicopters will resume their normal 9 
p.m. takeoff time. Agriculture officials pushed back the departure time one 
hour this month to accommodate late-night holiday shoppers. J.E. MITCHELL

VALLEY CHRONICLE: THE GOOSE LADY LAYS A GOLDEN EGG FOR PIERCE'S AG DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The efforts of the Goose Lady of Woodland Hills have added about $2,000 to the 
coffers of the Pierce College agricultural department. 
</P>
<P>
 This Goose Lady is not to be confused with the Goose Girl, who used to dress 
up in twee costumes and be chased around by goosey ganders at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 She's Mary Lee, the Pierce College president, who's on a mission to preserve 
the school's agrarian sod. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee was the impetus behind the college's first Goose Walk. The recent 
early-morning event was aimed at familiarizing the community with the 
fascinations of farming while helping to alleviate the ag department's 
underfunding woes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 people joined Lee in the birding adventure, many contributing $1 
or more for the experience of walking around the grounds and looking at 
visiting geese. The money is earmarked for reseeding pastures and maintenance 
of the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 What the visitors saw was about 1,000 hungry Canada geese who dropped in for 
breakfast, foraging through the school's tender grasses and picking up whatever 
succulent seeds they could find. 
</P>
<P>
 These geese rate an American passport because they actually come from Utah or 
Colorado, according to Pierce biologist Ralph Kinchloe. 
</P>
<P>
 The geese, who winter in reservoirs and lakes in the San Fernando Valley, 
started coming to Pierce once the pastures in the West Valley were developed 
into housing and what is now Warner Center, Kinchloe says. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lee, their annual visit is a ritual she has appreciated since she first 
came to Pierce College as an administrator in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember being interested in the geese from those years during the '70s, as 
well as the agricultural program, which is unique in the Los Angeles Community 
College system," Lee says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came back as president this year and saw how underfunded the 
agricultural program is, I thought that maybe there would be a way to turn the 
visiting geese into financial aid for the agricultural department." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuffing and roasting them was definitely not on her mind. However, starting 
with this first Goose Walk, and at least once a year from now on, the geese 
will be on display and earning what amounts to their daily bread, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a resident of Chatsworth, says she's always had animals around her, so 
it's natural to put her energies into saving the agricultural program at 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been said before, but the farm is not just a place where students who 
want to go into the agriculture programs at Cal Poly or UC Davis can get 
started," Lee says. "It is a resource for schoolchildren who can come and see 
that their food does not grow in the market, as well as a place for all of us 
to remember our agricultural heritage in the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 The next of Lee's quarterly open houses at the farm will be a walk through the 
citrus orchards during springtime, when the blossoms will be perfuming the air 
the way they used to throughout the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's hard now to remember that the Valley used to smell like one big 
citrus orchard, along with some other less aromatic odors caused by the 
handsome horses that used to be bred and raised around these parts. It's Boxing 
Day, So Everyone Into the Ring 
</P>
<P>
 No. No. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing Day is not when people bloody each other while thrashing about in some 
sweaty arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 26 is the old English holiday where people like the queen used to box up 
all the stuff they got but didn't want for Christmas and foist it off on poor 
people like the palace help. 
</P>
<P>
 In England, now, the royals don't do that kind of thing. 
</P>
<P>
 It would cause a scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Another scandal for the Windsors would redefine the concept of overkill. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the royals and others spend the day flopping about with the family. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids run around like maniacs breaking up all the toys they got for 
Christmas, while the adults fall on any couch or floor that's handy after 
scarfing up all the caloric remains of the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, there used to be a Boxing Day tradition among the ink-stained 
wretches. These media types would go to Laurel Canyon Park and try to remember 
how to play soccer. Since most of them hadn't run any farther than to the 
telephone in more than a decade, it was often a pitiful sight to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 This same gang would then motor down to the North Hollywood home of one David 
Gritten, a reporter at the former Herald Examiner, to see how much holiday 
cheer they could imbibe before falling on the nearest couch or floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gritten -- in an effort to distance himself from this debacle -- moved back to 
his native England, where his endeavors now include writing entertainment 
pieces for the Calendar section of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year since his departure, one or more of the remaining motley crew makes 
noises about reviving the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 This year plans were actually made to hold the soccer game in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But then someone pointed out that whomever now lives in Gritten's home would 
probably not appreciate being invaded with dirty, bruised people demanding 
holiday bubbly. 
</P>
<P>
 All is forgiven, David: Please come back. Thank-You Notes 
</P>
<P>
 This seems like a good time to send a blanket thank you to all the folks who 
have written or called to suggest items for Valley Chronicle. You know who you 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of you have suggested writing about neighbors or people who are out there 
doing good deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the purpose of the column is to spotlight the praiseworthy adventures 
and occasionally funny misadventures of folks in our valleys, having this 
friendly spy system is helpful indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks should also go out to those who have taken the time to be interviewed 
and are then often kind enough to write or call to say what they thought about 
seeing themselves in print. 
</P>
<P>
 Most particularly, thanks should go to Cheryl Crooks, who is the newspaper 
adviser at Calahan Street Elementary School in Reseda, for passing along the 
remarks of her students after their paper was profiled in this column. 
</P>
<P>
 Many thanks, also, to teacher Holly Dye at Pinecrest School in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye not only sent along a thank-you card in response to an item about her 
class' pet program but had her pupils sign it and include their own remarks. 
Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait for 1995. It's going to be the best year ever, with the 
possibility of the baseball and hockey season being canceled. That should give 
my husband time to get acquainted with our kids."

 New Challenge: British institutions have until Feb. 1 to raise about $805,000 
to prevent an early painting by Lucian Freud from going out of the country. It 
is the first work by a contemporary artist to be subject to a British export 
license. "The Painter's Room," a 1943 painting bought by an anonymous collector 
at Sotheby's in June, depicts a stuffed zebra head, a shabby sofa and a wilting 
potted palm. The artist, a modern master whose studies of the human figure 
dissect both bodies and minds, has joined the list of Old Masters whose works 
are deemed so important that their export is delayed or stopped. Britain 
recently raised funds to keep Canova's "Three Graces" from being exported to 
Malibu's J. Paul Getty Museum. The government has already deferred the export 
license decision once on Freud's work and could extend it until April 1 if 
there is a serious intention shown to raise the funds. MUSIC

head off, right in front of him." Love said she was despondent over Cobain's

 Vive le Sax: A century after the death of Adolphe Sax, France is celebrating 
his invention, the saxophone. Concerts, radio broadcasts and discussions about 
the future of saxophone teaching are being held by the French National 
Conservatory of Music and the Army Museum. Sax, who died Feb. 7, 1894, in 
Paris, unveiled the revolutionary new instrument in 1844 to great critical 
acclaim. Music critics said its rich sounds captured the emotional inflections 
of the human voice better than any other instrument. The saxophone has been a 
favorite of jazz buffs, including President Clinton, an amateur saxophonist who 
visited Sax's birthplace in Dinant, Belgium, three days after D-Day 
celebrations last June. QUOTABLE

 Earth, Wind & Fire, like many of you, read the pop music review in the Dec. 7 
Los Angeles Times ("Revamped Earth, Wind & Fire Returns"). As one of the 
original members of the group with more than 20 years in the music industry, I 
know one constant in our philosophy remains true -- give the people what they 
want.

<P>
 Although tunes such as, "Reasons," "That's the Way of the World," and "Shining

encompass the very essence of Earth, Wind & Fire.

 Our eight "brothers" who have joined the group since the late '80s are an 
immensely talented group of musicians who the crowds have responded to 
overwhelmingly, while on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 While the shows from the '70s and '80s displayed a blend of R&B, pop and jazz 
with trend-setting special effects, Earth, Wind & Fire has never depended on 
special effects wizardry to carry a show. We are, and always have been, about 
real music and the love and respect of people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We are not just an oldies act -- or a "nostalgia act," as reviewer Dennis Hunt 
called us -- nor do we consider ourselves a bare-bones version of the shows 
from the '70s and '80s. All of the artists in Earth, Wind & Fire have a common 
goal to inspire and enlighten people, and to continue to have the utmost 
compassion for our audience. 
</P>
<P>
 We are the real Earth, Wind & Fire, bonded together by genuine musicianship, 
unity and love. 
</P>
<P>
 We are the real Earth, Wind & Fire, and judging from the crowds' reaction in 
Los Angeles (and around the world), we are, and always have been, exactly what 
the people came to see.

COUNTERPUNCH: TV FINALLY FINDS RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLWOOD E. KIESER, Paulist Father Ellwood E. Kieser produced the TV series 
Insight, the movie of the week We Are the Children and the feature film Romero. 
He is working on a feature film about Catholic social activist Dorothy Day.

<TEXT>
<P>
 From the pilgrims to the present, religion has always been an important part 
of American life. Throughout our history, most Americans have made religious 
faith a crucial ingredient in their search for fulfillment; they have tried to 
root their lives in a transcendent ground. When it worked, religious faith 
enabled them to tap into a source of energy that empowered them to take charge 
of their lives and exercise their freedom in a responsible way. It supplied the 
meaning in their lives, helped them discover who they are, choose the values by 
which they would live and reach out in love to their fellow human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Which may explain why 94% of the American people say they believe in God, why 
41% attend church or synagogue on any given weekend, why religious books are 
perennials on the bestseller lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, if religion is central to American culture, it has been curiously absent 
from broadcast television in the United States. It is not that commercial 
television has attacked the spiritual dimension of the human personality. It 
has done what is much worse. It has ignored this most important part of the 
human psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, it has shied away from that part of us which is most essentially 
human, that intimate place where we talk to ourselves and to all those other 
people who live within us. This is where we do all kinds of important things: 
fantasize, intuit, create, make commitments, grapple with mystery, struggle for 
meaning, perceive the sacred, respond to the holy, feel awe and wonder, reach 
for that which is above and beyond ourselves and enter into communion with the 
ground of our being. 
</P>
<P>
 Freud called this portion of the human personality the unconscious because it 
is shrouded in mystery and can neither be weighed nor measured. The Greeks 
called it the soul because it is pre-eminently spiritual. And the Bible calls 
it heart because it is where love resides and commitments are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for most of its history, American television has acted as if this part of 
us -- let's call it the human soul -- did not exist. "If religion is boring," 
asks Howard Rosenberg perceptively, "why is it important to so many people?" 
("TV Needs Its Own Contract With America," Calendar, Nov. 21). And if it is so 
important, why hasn't it been reflected in our televised entertainment? Why 
until recently has God been taboo in prime time? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it because, as some critics have maintained, the people of the 
entertainment community are more stridently secular, less godly than the rest 
of the country? (Could anyone who lives in this community and knows its people 
responsibly maintain that?) 
</P>
<P>
 Is it because the human soul and the God in whose image it is made are 
mysteries. We can grasp much about them. But we cannot grasp everything about 
them. Nor can we program them. Are they just too much for our boxed-in minds to 
handle? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it because many people, in the entertainment community as well as in the 
viewing public, have confused God with their own super egos, pushing the 
tenderness and compassion of God into eclipse, leaving only a vindicative and 
fearsome tyrant that has nothing in common with the God of the Old and New 
Testaments? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a feeling that entertainment is escapist and spiritual experience is 
concerned with the realest of the real and that the two, like oil and water, do 
not mix? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a reluctance, born of spiritual sensitivity to take God's name in vain, 
to involve Him in the selling of soap? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are no easy answers to these questions. But I do think there are now 
indications the old walls may be coming down. The times, they are a-changin'. 
Many contemporary series, especially those in the hour category, are delving 
into the hunger of their characters for spiritual connectedness and they are 
dramatizing their search for a transcendent ground and a spiritual center. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are discovering what Sophocles and Aeschylus, Shakespeare and George 
Bernard Shaw, Robert Bolt and Paddy Chayefsky learned before them: The search 
for God is the great drama of every human life; and because it is, stories that 
chronicle that search are intensely involving. They speak to us on some deep 
level and activate things inside of us that we did not know existed. Jeopardy, 
surprise, humor, high stakes, emotional accessibility -- these stories have it 
all. Which is just another way of saying: There is nothing more exciting, more 
theatrical than God. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because God is the loving mystery in whom we live and move and have our 
being. More than that, God is the beginning and the end, the meaning, the 
purpose, the ground and the horizon of all human life.

COUNTERPUNCH: NOT A SHINING CHAPTER IN ACLU HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL B. PEARLSTON JR., Carl B. Pearlston Jr., an attorney in Torrance, was 
on the board of directors of the Southern California ACLU from 1966 to 1975. He 
has been a member of the Southern Regional Board of the Anti-Defamation League 
since 1975 and serves on its executive committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dec. 1 Morning Report noted the American Civil Liberties Union new 
fund-raising lithograph -- which "will also be plastered on dozens" of bus 
shelters -- depicting notable cases from the ACLU files. One of the four scenes 
represents the Japanese Americans interned during WWII, as though the ACLU had 
done something to prevent such internment of American citizens. The actual 
historical record is quite to the contrary, and is well set forth in the book 
"In Defense of American Liberties: A History of the ACLU" by Prof. Samuel 
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 19, 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing 
the Secretary of War to designate military zones from which any person could be 
excluded. On June 22, 1942, the ACLU National Committee, by a vote of 52 to 26, 
accepted that order in principle, although it urged restraint and protection of 
individuals in its implementation.  
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU statement read: "The government has the right in the present war to 
establish military zones and to remove persons, either citizens or aliens, from 
such zones where their presence may endanger national security, even in the 
absence of a declaration of martial law." The Northern California ACLU voted 
119 to 65 to approve the Presidential Order, and 100 to 91 not to challenge its 
constitutionality. There was a great deal of infighting in the ACLU between the 
liberals, conservatives and extreme leftists, on the one hand, and the 
pacifists on the other, over the whole question of ACLU involvement in this 
matter. It was not a shining moment for the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
 There were four test cases of the order and its implementation, and the ACLU 
was involved in only two of them, one from Seattle (Hirabuyashi) and one from 
San Francisco (Korematsu), despite the vote of the Northern California ACLU 
board. There was no case from Southern California. Both cases eventually lost 
in the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Lincoln Wirin, my friend of blessed memory did, however, achieve a 
notable victory in 1948 in two cases before the Supreme Court, in which the 
California Alien Land Law and a law denying fishing licenses to resident 
immigrants were struck down (Oyama and Takahashi). That was the only 
significant contribution that the ACLU made regarding Japanese Americans, and 
the self-aggrandizement and puffery of the lithograph is certainly not 
warranted on the internment issue.

DANCE REVIEW; JOFFREY 'NUTCRACKER' TESTS LIMITS WITH CAST CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As senior ballerina of the Joffrey Ballet, Beatriz Rodriguez has danced more 
than her share of cowgirls, warrior women, sacrificial virgins and embodiments 
of profane love. She has been memorable as a 300-year-old crone and on Friday 
afternoon appeared at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in the role of little 
Clara, child-heroine of the company's "Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
 It was, as they say, a stretch. Looking sweet and shy in her ringlets, 
Rodriguez created a stylized and somewhat sentimental characterization that 
sometimes clashed with the approach of the real children in the production. 
And, without significant dancing opportunities, the role depended on credible 
interaction with others. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Joffrey colleagues were not much help in this particular cast. Todd 
Stickney always seemed a short grown-up, rather than a tall kid, as her brother 
Fritz. (He looked more comfortable impersonating a Russian nougat in Act 2). 
And Tyler Walters remained coolly aloof from both this Clara and his Sugar Plum 
Fairy (Deborah Dawn) as the Nutcracker Prince. He also ran into major 
partnering problems in the Grand Pas de Deux. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez did establish a warm rapport with the Drosselmeyer of Adam Sklute -- 
another artist less-than-ideally cast on Friday afternoon. But the most 
satisfying casting innovations involved other dancers. As the Snow Queen, for 
example, Jenny Sandler demonstrated a command of classical style strong enough 
to triumph over the effortful dancing of David Kierce as her King. 
</P>
<P>
 Maia Wilkins looked fresh and forceful in the Spanish dance and, thanks to the 
teamwork of Kim Sagami and Joseph Schnell, the Chinese dance looked like a 
collaborative duet rather than the usual cutthroat competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, Ryuji Yamamoto brought his distinctive classical purity to the 
Snow Prince choreography. On Wednesday, Calvin Kitten had danced this 
assignment as a virtuoso's showpiece, but Yamamoto somehow transformed it into 
a danseur noble's meditation -- an imaginative conception beautifully executed.

'SMITHSONIAN'S GREAT BATTLES' LOSES CIVIL WAR BUFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Had the 13-episode "Smithsonian's Great Battles of the Civil War" existed in 
some era before Ken Burns' landmark epic, it might have been a perfectly 
suitable television aid for understanding America's most dramatic event. 
</P>
<P>
 But producer-writer-director Jay Wertz's haphazard approach, focusing on key 
Civil War battles at the expense of a cogent narrative flow covering the war's 
developments, places this "Civil War" wanna-be far down the list of essential 
viewing for buffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertz injects one innovation here, but it's typically handled in a clumsy 
manner. Key battles are introduced with a detailed, computer-generated map 
indicating Northern and Southern lines, the local topography and a map legend 
-- all of it resembling a screen image in a CD-ROM program. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike CD-ROM, however, the maps flash past with no time to study details. In 
such complex battles as Shiloh (described in the second episode, airing Jan. 5 
on The Learning Channel) or even in an elementary shoot-'em-out like First Bull 
Run (airing in tonight's opening episode), the strategic subtleties employed by 
generals in the field are thus glossed over. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrator Richard Dreyfuss sounds urgent about his business, but he never 
really makes any of these battles come alive. Dreyfuss has to carry the series 
on his own (with occasional visits by other actors such as Charlton Heston as 
Lincoln), since the series' extremely conventional use of period paintings, 
photos and film of re-created battles makes this the most visually dull of all 
TV Civil War projects. 
</P>
<P>
 An exception occurs in the second episode, which surveys the war's early naval 
campaigns, highlighted by the standoff between the Union ironclad ship Monitor 
and its Confederate opponent, the Merrimack (which Wertz calls "The Virginia"). 
For the first time in the series, we get a sense of the war as these two ships 
fire at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the rest of this history (or, at least, the two episodes reviewed) 
were as dynamic. Even the reliable historian James McPherson's commentaries 
aren't enough to guide us through the program, which often grinds to a halt 
with such dull passages as -- believe it -- the technology of guns in the 
1860s.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; VOICE IS ALL FOR SOLOMON BURKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Show-biz pageantry certainly has its place, but why bother when it only 
obscures the massive vocal talent of a veteran soul man like Solomon Burke? 
</P>
<P>
 At the second of two shows Friday at the House of Blues, Burke shared a 
crowded stage with no fewer than 40 people (musicians, singers, dancers, two 
sons and a daughter to wipe his sweaty brow), when all that really mattered was 
the voice . 
</P>
<P>
 That Burke isn't as much a household name as Otis Redding or Al Green isn't 
for lack of ability. He was among the originators of soul in the early 1960s, 
with a voice that moved elegantly from real tenderness to roaring passion. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that old theatrical flair was missing at the House of Blues, at either 
the Christmas-themed opening set or the soul show that followed. Burke shouted 
and cried, pounding his chest in agony while singing of a broken heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing behind him was a powerful R&B orchestra that included a nine-piece 
horn section and strings. But the second set began with no sign of Burke 
himself for nearly an hour as the band pursued solos aplenty, and was joined by 
a succession of guest vocalists of varied abilities: a James Brown sound-alike, 
a pair of child rappers, a female pop crooner, and Burke's youngest son -- King 
Haile Selasse Burke -- singing a Big Band tune. 
</P>
<P>
 When the headliner finally arrived, bearing roses for the audience, it was a 
welcome sight. STEVE APPLEFORD

ANN CONWAY: CHARITY SCENE SEEKS TO HELP VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over benefit luncheons, dinners, teas, the subject keeps coming up: child 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports of murders, beatings and neglect have left members of the charity 
scene asking: "What can we do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty, say directors of the Orangewood Children's Foundation, Olive Crest and 
the Child Abuse Prevention Council of Orange County. They expect more than 
35,000 reports of emotional and physical abuse and sexual molestation will be 
filed this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But volunteers are hard to come by, says Lois Verleur, who, with her husband, 
Don, founded Olive Crest in 1973 to provide a full range of services for 
victims of child abuse and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Child abuse is too painful for most people to think about," she says. "In the 
areas of the arts, or cancer research, people can relate, get something back. 
They are uplifted by an artistic experience, lightened by helping a cancer 
patient because they've lost a loved one to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we don't get alumni. They're not capable. The parents are often 
incarcerated. It takes the children years to pull it all together (after they 
have been abused)." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer opportunities at Olive Crest include the support groups Los 
Compadres (for young professionals), Olive Crest Women's Guild and its Town, 
Gown & Apron. 
</P>
<P>
 Each group raises funds to provide Olive Crest services, which include the 
operation of 20 residential homes and more than 150 certified foster family 
homes in Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are also needed in Olive Crest's Special Friends program. "A 
special friend is someone who stands by the side of a child on a non-counseling 
basis," Verleur says, "and with no questions asked, listens to the child, takes 
him to the park, plays games with him. They commit to one year of service." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates for the Special Friends program are carefully screened and receive 
training on how to mentor children. (For information on volunteer opportunities 
at Olive Crest, call (714) 543-5437.) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If you want to do something right now to make life less stressful for kids, be 
kinder to your children, grandchildren or nieces and nephews when you cart them 
to the mall for after-Christmas sales, says Barbara Oliver, executive director 
of the Child Abuse Prevention Center of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone we talk to has a story about seeing a child abused in a store. You 
may not think of it as abuse in the classic sense, but it is , just the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have all seen parents yelling at their children, slapping their hands, 
shaming them, saying things like, 'You don't deserve to be here. I'll never 
take you shopping again.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The children may be tired, hungry, frustrated," Oliver explains. "The parents 
don't have the tools to cope. What they needed to do was set up the shopping 
experience beforehand so it would be a positive one." 
</P>
<P>
 To this end, the center has created a bookmark with tips on how to shop with 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose a time when both you and your child are rested, dressed comfortably 
and not hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your child is under 3, shopping time should not exceed 45 minutes (age 3 
to 5, one hour; age 5 to 8, one to two 2 hours). 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage positive behavior by agreeing upon a reward, such as stopping at 
the park, on the way home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Praise good behavior with statements such as, "I'm so glad I brought you!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Discuss family rules for shopping before you leave. "Remember to stay close 
to me," is one example. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take along your child's favorite blanket, toy, book or nutritious snack. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents, says Oliver -- who was abused as a child -- never mean to hurt 
their children. "In many cases, parents don't have the tools or knowledge on 
how to raise children in a way that doesn't hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents need to learn nonviolent responses to their children. They need to 
establish agreements and consequences. Skills such as these will enable them to 
not "just blow off steam and hurt their children because they don't know any 
other way," Oliver says. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of March, the council will launch its annual blue-ribbon campaign 
to promote child abuse prevention awareness. (April is Child Abuse Prevention 
Month.) People will be encouraged to wear blue ribbons to show their support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blue-ribbon campaign was founded in Norfolk by a grandmother who lost her 
grandson to child abuse," Oliver says. "She tied a blue ribbon to the antenna 
of her van -- blue for the bruises on her grandson." 
</P>
<P>
 The council needs volunteers to help assemble and distribute the ribbons and 
bookmarks. (To help, call (714) 768-5655.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer opportunities for the Orangewood Children's Foundation include its 
Respite Care Program, a support service for foster families, grandparents 
raising their children's children and families at risk for child abuse or 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 "A donation of less than $200 per month buys two weekends of respite care -- a 
loving substitute for the care-giver," says foundation director Judy Nelson. 
"We have a single mom with a disabled child and another child who, if it were 
not for respite care, wouldn't be able to keep her disabled child. Her 
responsibility and work are incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the foundation's Orangeblossoms support group operate the 
Orangewood Boutique in Corona del Mar, a recycled clothing store which, this 
year, will rake in about $50,000 for children's services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need volunteers and used clothing," Nelson says. 
</P>
<P>
 To volunteer for the foundation, call (714) 385-8110.

JACK SMITH: GETTING INTO THE SPIRIT, KICKING AND SCREAMING 
</P>

By JACK SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year I try to avoid being swept up in the spirit of the Christmas 
season, but it's a losing battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should I resent it? Maybe because I feel like a sucker being hooked by 
commercial lures. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day after Christmas, houses all over the city are still decorated with 
festive lights. Through the 25th, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" or some 
equally banal Christmas song blares into the street from stores and cars. Then, 
just when you are about fed up with it, you hear some lovely soprano voice 
singing "Adeste Fideles" or some other Christmas hymn and find yourself humming 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 I half know the words to most carols because I sang them in Sunday school as a 
boy. They are indeed beautiful and they never get old. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course everybody beyond the age of 8 knows there isn't any Santa Claus. The 
old blowhard is a myth that parents routinely thrust on their children.  
</P>
<P>
 Even an 8-year-old can readily see the logistics are impossible. How could the 
old gentleman visit millions of homes in one night, delivering toys for the 
children of every household by climbing down the chimneys? 
</P>
<P>
 Can't you just see the fat old fellow climbing down a chimney with his bag of 
presents? He'd get stuck in the very first one and the family would have to 
call 911 and tell them, "Santa's stuck in our chimney." Multiply that by 
several million and you'll see the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the matter of that sled. How could a sled manage the macadam 
streets of Los Angeles? Not even the most modern machines, including 
helicopters, could get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course everybody has heard of that airhead New York Sun editorial writer 
who answered a little girl's question "Is there a Santa Claus?" with the 
maudlin reassurance, "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." 
</P>
<P>
 That is probably the best remembered and often quoted of editorials. As an old 
rewrite man, I know it was just an idle staffer doodling on his typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spirit is pervasive. It gets to you sooner or later. My wife and I 
went to a Christmas party before the holiday at the Pasadena home of Mireya and 
Larry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an annual event, and we have gone for several years. When we walked in, 
the house was bursting with Christmas carols. Everybody was singing, loudly. A 
pianist was pounding out the beat, accompanied by several other professionals 
on assorted instruments including the violin, a trombone, saxophone and cello. 
</P>
<P>
 They sang with enthusiasm, reading the words from booklets: "It came upon a 
midnight clear." . . . "Deck the halls with boughs of holly" . . . and "Silent 
night, holy night." Is there anyone who doesn't know the words to "Silent 
Night"? 
</P>
<P>
 Then they went into "The Twelve Days of Christmas," that charming round in 
which designated groups of singers sing the name of one of the 12 gifts -- two 
turtledoves, three French hens, four calling birds and five golden rings. After 
each gift is named the group sings "and a partridge in a pear tree.' 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Mathies, a man of great voice, sang "five golden rings" for each round, 
slowing the tempo and bringing it out loud and clear. This feat invariably 
brought applause. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time I ever heard "The Twelve Days of Christmas" was when our 
younger son was about 9 years old. He sang it, verse by verse, as he stood in 
front of the fireplace at a neighbor's house. It was charming. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Joneses' house, we all sang "Silent Night," which is better known to 
most of us than "The Star-Spangled Banner." 
</P>
<P>
 I won't say I believe in that old fraud Santa Claus, any more than I believe 
in heaven, but after the last "sleep in heavenly peace" I was drugged again -- 
thoroughly immersed in the Christmas spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew I'd be looking in my stocking to see if old St. Nick remembered me 
again.  
</P>
<P>
 We used to be told that Santa kept a list of every child's behavior during the 
year before Christmas, and left them gifts according to their virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll say this. I've never had a more virtuous year. Who knows, maybe I'll even 
go to heaven.

FIRST PERSON: OF DICE AND FRIENDS: BONDING WITH LADY LUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN ALPERSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What has long been common behavior in male friendships -- escaping, for 
example, for a weekend of fishing, politically incorrect jokes and unseemly 
beard growth -- since the '80s has been referred to as "male bonding." 
</P>
<P>
 Most women, meanwhile, have continued to communicate and recreate with each 
other as usual, bereft of sociologically meaningful descriptions of their 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Females have been bonded since prehistory, and this primal behavior, I submit, 
is rooted in the instinct to survive. When the guy has the clicker and Eastwood 
is just about to make his day, or there are 12 seconds left in the fourth 
quarter and his team's down by four, distaff members of the family would have 
more luck bonding with the guy who cashes checks at Pavilion's. 
</P>
<P>
 My friends and I don't "bond" -- we gamble. We go to Las Vegas. Certainly, we 
enjoy one another's company, but Mary, J.M., Ann, Rae and I have found the 
warmth of mutual affection sometimes overwhelmed by our absolute adoration for 
a pair of hot dice. 
</P>
<P>
 Utterly unhip friends like to joke about our need to sow wild oats. Hardly. In 
Vegas, we are women who, in search of the perfect hand or the longest roll, 
generally keep our distance from husbands, boyfriends, children, pets and other 
mammalian distractions. (Occasionally we have brought the men along, only to 
find ourselves behaving oddly -- attending stage shows, rubbernecking at Hoover 
Dam, eating balanced meals . . .) 
</P>
<P>
 Even among Las Vegans, who should know better, there's a residual mistrust of 
women unleashed. On one Vegas sojourn we sat down to play blackjack, with Mary 
sporting a black eye she'd earned a few days prior in a heated basketball game. 
The dealer kissed the green felt with her cards and casually inquired if Mary's 
boyfriend were responsible. Such comments no longer funny (like they ever 
were!), Mary seethingly replied, "No, it was another woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The dealer was rattled, but the deck was not. We lost 20 bucks in five 
minutes. J.M., Ann and Rae were bonding nicely with Lady Luck, but Mary and I, 
clearly estranged, left them to their good fortune and returned to our hotel 
for a nap. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel's casino was jammed with delegates to a Soldier of Fortune magazine 
convention. We fought, uh, elbowed our way through a battalion of fatigue-clad, 
square-jawed soldiers selling "God, Guts, Guns" T-shirts. A healthy contingent 
of soldier women wore blue eye shadow and fingered the knives lashed to their 
ammo belts. 
</P>
<P>
 Convention delegates were notably adept in their mission to search and destroy 
an afternoon's repose. Once inside our room, Mary and I fell asleep only to be 
awakened shortly by an enormous explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 We sat upright in bed, clutching the sheets, terrified that Las Vegas was in 
the grip of a pathologically bad loser. We peeked outside and saw two soldiers 
engaged in hand-to-hand combat on a specially constructed walkway over the 
pool. With what looked like padded broomsticks, they tried to whack each other 
into the deep end they presumably wished was infested with crocodiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another warrior was loading a bazooka. I braced for another blast while Mary 
dialed the front desk to complain about the noise. The assistant manager 
apologized and assured her that "no live ammunition is being used at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Rae, who likes machines that clink and beep, we prefer to play 
games that involve more than dumb luck. Look for us hunkered down over a craps 
table. That Las Vegas is the planetary capital of dice manufacture (really -- I 
looked it up) is hardly surprising. That more of them don't roll my way should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 On one trip we stayed at the Imperial Palace and found good luck shooting 
dice. We would have slept on the craps table if they'd let us, which would have 
spared us the commute to our room, whose five-digit number was indicative of 
its location halfway between the casino and the Arizona state line. 
</P>
<P>
 We visit the IP a lot. One night we merrily rolled along for hours, yelling 
stuff like, "Yo, eleven, come to mama," and "Four the hard way for the boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Craps is the most exciting and complex game in town. If only I'd studied 
algebra with a fraction of the concentration I have devoted to computing the 
odds in craps. My tutor in this regard is J.M., a superior student of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 She can tell you, for example, that casino dice measure three-fourths of an 
inch on a side and are accurate to within 1/10,000th of an inch -- the same as 
a head hair split 20 times. I think J.M. financed her house with her winnings, 
but I am not sure about this. I do know that she and Ann, co-owners of a 
mortgage brokerage, fill idle moments of their workday shooting dice in the 
back office. 
</P>
<P>
 Craps is also a game of ultimate humanity. Nothing better demonstrates your 
love of mankind. Where else but a craps table would you bet money on the 
abilities of an open-shirted, gold-chained, cigar-smoking loudmouth you would 
otherwise cross the street to avoid? 
</P>
<P>
 We also like to play blackjack. J.M demonstrates consistent aplomb here as 
well, except when her tablemates insist on splitting 10s, in which case she 
seeks more enlightened company. When the cards don't fall for Ann, she 
gravitates to the slots, for which I have no patience, standing there trying to 
align pictures of produce in the little window of a noisy, coin-gulping 
electronic shill. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ann has been known to establish a close relationship -- bond, even -- with 
these cheerful friends. Once I found her dropping dollars into their hungry 
little mouths with alarming alacrity. She seemed to be ahead by a hundred or 
so, and I queried her strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pick only machines," she said, "whose fruit is out of season." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, with its theme parks and highest-of-tech arcade diversions, 
there's more to Las Vegas than gambling. But we don't care. We come to play. 
That we don't always win just isn't the point. To the semi-bonded men in our 
lives, the point is that we have managed to pay our hotel bill and stay out of 
jail.

 In the newt: Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich's 
$4.5-million book deal with a company controlled by Rupert Murdoch: "Murdoch, a 
foreigner, wants Congress to lift a ban against foreign ownership of TV 
stations. The GOP message is clear. The Contract With America was actually a 
book contract with Murdoch." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Paul Ryan says now we know what Newt meant by the GOP's Contract 
With America: "$500 for us, $4.5 million for him."

compassion, sharing and human charity is selling in the millions. Just think 
how well the rebuttal will do." 
</P>

 Comedy writer Bob Mills, on big money contracts: "First Stallone gets $20 
million and now Newt gets $4.5 million. This is remarkable when you consider 
that neither one plays basketball."

 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on the Clintons' holidays: "Bill was visited by a 
ghost from Christmas past: Mr. President, Paula Jones on line 1. " 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, on the President inviting schoolchildren to the White House last 
week to read them a story: "The kids laughed and laughed. Not even 4-year-olds 
will buy his version of the Whitewater scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, on political pundits saying Clinton's aides are trying to Reaganize him: 
"It's working -- Clinton's already forgotten everything he's promised." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Marc A. Holmes, on the Kenosha, Wis., man who built a 6-foot-4 
Christmas tree from 100,000 beer bottle caps: "He said it would have been 
bigger, but he kept having to run to the bathroom." 
</P>

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; CAUSTIC BIT OF WRITING, OLD CHAP; THE HIPPOPOTAMUS BY 
STEPHEN FRY ; RANDOM HOUSE $21, 290 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Isay, Jeeves! The chap who wrote this new novel you're reading -- he couldn't 
be that actor fellow, could he? The same Stephen Fry who played you in 'Jeeves 
and Wooster' on 'Masterpiece Theatre'? Did jolly well at it, too, I must say. 
Though that Hugh Laurie made me look like a twit." 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite so, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I can't help wondering why a chap who excels in one field should feel 
compelled to sprawl out into another one. Better he minds his own wicket, don't 
you think, Jeeves? I do hope Mr. Fry hasn't committed one of those dreadful 
Hollywood kiss-and-tell things." 
</P>
<P>
 "Indeed not, sir. Mr. Fry is an author of some renown, in addition to his 
accomplishments on stage and screen. His first novel, 'The Liar,' was a runaway 
best-seller, I believe the phrase is, and 'The Hippopotamus' seems destined to 
follow it." 
</P>
<P>
 "My word! An animal story?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, sir. Only the human animal, prone as ever to folly and self-deception. 
Though, come to think of it, there is a horse here . . . a horse with 
commendable taste in Scotch . . . who rebuts the philosophy of Peter Shaffer's 
play 'Equus.' You must recall how Shaffer mythologized the youth who blinded 
horses and condescended to the ordinary chap who tried to cure him." 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophy? Surely, Jeeves, a best-seller can't rely on that , can it? Not 
without a little romance along the way, what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Never fear, sir. Mr. Fry may be fearsomely learned and famously celibate, but 
on the printed page he can be as dirty-minded as any Hollywood person -- and a 
great deal wittier." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what I meant." 
</P>
<P>
 "Alas, sir. Best-sellerdom has changed since our creator P. G. Wodehouse's 
day. Sex is in, I fear, for good. Romance is sold strictly to the ladies, like 
a feminine hygiene product. Not that Mr. Wodehouse wasted much time with 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally confused, Jeeves. Where does this . . . this hippopotamus come 
in?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The narrator, sir. It's his nickname. Ted Wallace. A once-promising poet and 
sacked drama critic, now 66 years old and pickled with whiskey, still 
scratching his libido and various other itches, but slowly sinking into 
bitterness. His voice is what makes the thing go." 
</P>
<P>
 "How?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's such a deliciously caustic and debunking voice -- sort of a 
warlock's brew of Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis, with a pinch of Malcolm 
Muggeridge thrown in. For all Mr. Wallace's spleen, he's a fresh breeze 
dispelling the sickly vapors of New Age claptrap that have gathered in just 
such a grand country house as Mr. Wodehouse used to allow us to visit." 
</P>
<P>
 "See here, Jeeves. New Age? In a country house? It can't be." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not, sir?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Because this is . . . dash it all, this is England. " 
</P>
<P>
 "The yearning for miracles is universal, sir. Especially when one is a 
15-year-old boy long on poetic fantasy but short on talent, or when one is a 
practical person with a squishy and sentimental core -- which most practical 
people have. The boy is believed to have cured a strangling baby, a young woman 
with leukemia, a gay litterateur with angina and the horse. More would-be 
beneficiaries of his magic are arriving every day." 
</P>
<P>
 "And the boy himself?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, he believes it too, caught up in such hysteria. And the others are most 
put out with Mr. Wallace when he fails to abandon his skepticism." 
</P>
<P>
 "Extraordinary, Jeeves. You'd think a poet would be the first to believe in 
miracles." 
</P>
<P>
 "But a poet knows something that a practical person doesn't: where poetry 
comes from. It comes from words, not ideas; it comes, as Mr. Wallace says, from 
mucking about down in the mine for ore rather than waiting for gold to rain on 
us from heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, it seems a bit . . . heavy, somehow. Too much like an idea . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir. Mr. Fry falls into the same snare he so eloquently points out to 
others. In the drawing-room scene at the end, Mr. Wallace is roused from his 
funk and made to impersonate Sherlock Holmes or Inspector Poirot, unraveling 
the mystery. A bit much, I think. The story loses its life whenever we stop 
hearing it through the old reprobate's voice. In bare summary it becomes almost 
grotesque. Words, indeed, are what count -- but how entertaining most of Mr. 
Fry's are!"

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MANIC HISPANIC HAS HOLIDAY FUN ROASTING SOME PUNK CHESTNUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Punk parody still awaits the coming of a Weird Alberto. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Manic Hispanic has taken on the kitschy mission of filtering punk 
classics through a vato's perspective peppered with Chicano slang, Spanglish 
mangling of lyrics, and fun-poking, not-politically-correct references to 
stereotypes about barrio life. But the all-Latino band from Orange County, 
whose key players are moonlighting members from three earnest, ethnically 
integrated punk-pop contenders -- Cadillac Tramps, Joyride and the Grabbers -- 
were far less concerned with incisive satire or parodic musical transformation 
than with having a good, rowdy, no-brainer time with songs they grew up loving. 
</P>
<P>
 Manic Hispanic's 70-minute set Friday night at the Foothill featured songs 
from Punk Rushmore -- classics by the Damned, Sex Pistols, the Clash, the 
Ramones and Iggy Pop -- along with choice selections from Wire, Sham 69, Dead 
Boys, Eddie and the Subtitles and others that would reside in a connoisseur's 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexi-fied modifications were modest. "Borstal Breakout," from Sham 69, 
became "Barrio Breakout," "Police on My Back" turned into "Migra on My Back," 
with the Clash song's "Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday" count-out refrain rendered in 
Spanish rather than English. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lyrics that Mike (Gabby) Gaborno delivered in his wry, authoritative 
bark -- or at least those that could be made out clearly amid the band's 
properly brawny attack -- didn't indicate much thought or effort given to 
reshaping these oldies into something distinctly new, or especially funny. The 
songs had not been fully rewritten from a Manic or a Hispanic point of view; 
they had merely been given comically intended dashes of homeboy attitude and 
street talk. Gaborno, who fronts Cadillac Tramps, didn't try to create a new 
persona for his parody, a la El Vez, the "Mexican Elvis" who has an all-Presley 
repertoire. He was more or less his usual big-bellied, arm-flapping, crudely 
Falstaffian self, except with a bit more Spanglish talk and a thicker accent 
than you would get at a typical Tramps show. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanking him were supporting singers Steve Acevedo, who works the business and 
touring end of punk, and Cadillac Tramps road manager Sonny Lujan, a bearded, 
bald fellow with an even more expansive belly than Gabby. The players were 
rhythm guitarist Maurice Torres and drummer Ruben Rivera, two Grabbers who are 
regular members of Manic Hispanic, and a couple of highly qualified Anglo 
substitutes deputized into La Raza for the occasion. Lead guitarist Jonny 
Wickersham of Cadillac Tramps and bassist Randy Bradbury of One Hit Wonder 
filled in, respectively, for regulars Steve Soto of Joyride and Warren Renfrow 
of Cadillac Tramps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The band brought to the punk archive the bite, enthusiasm and firepower it 
needs. But if you're fooling around with the lyrics to old songs, why not try 
to revise a bit of the music as well? When Gaborno introduced a number as "A 
traditional ranchero song . . . so be ready to throw down your hats and do the 
dance," he was just being facetious. But it would have been something to have 
heard a Mexican-folk rendition of the song that followed, Johnny Thunders' 
"Chinese Rocks" (which was transformed, with a characteristic flash of 
imagination, to "Mexican Rocks"). 
</P>
<P>
 The set's only departure from the punk canon was a closing rendition of "Feliz 
Navidad," a Jose Feliciano song Manic Hispanic covers on the new Doctor Dream 
Records Christmas compilation, "Santa & Satan: One and the Same?" It began 
gently, but soon had the pit denizens "doing the dance" -- the slam dance -- to 
the unlikely refrain, "I want to wish you a merry Christmas from the bottom of 
my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe more satiric wit will be evident when Manic Hispanic delivers the 
all-covers album that is planned for next year on Doctor Dream. For now, one 
large onlooker in the audience who said his name was Lip had it just right when 
he poked your reviewer and offered his own approving analysis: "A bunch of 
Mexicans playing fun songs -- that's all it is, man." 
</P>
<P>
 They are fun songs, and Manic Hispanic plays them con gusto .

 An Air France plane commandeered by Muslim extremists flew from Algeria to the 
southern French city of Marseilles early today, hours after the gunmen killed 
an employee of the French Embassy. Authorities were negotiating for the release 
of about 170 hostages still on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Saturday, when the plane was seized in the Algerian capital of Algiers, 
three passengers have been killed by the five hijackers in the most dramatic 
act yet in the bloody, 3-year-old guerrilla war against Algeria's 
military-installed government. 
</P>
<P>
 By allowing the plane, an Airbus A300, to leave Algiers for France, the 
Algerian government had met one of the hijackers' demands. But, beyond that, it 
wasn't clear what the five men, armed with two Kalashnikov rifles and two 
handguns, wanted. An earlier demand for the release of two Muslim extremist 
leaders imprisoned in Algeria apparently had been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane arrived early today at Marignane Airport, 25 miles north of 
Marseilles, a major Mediterranean port about a two-hour flight from Algeria. It 
taxied to a remote corner of the tarmac, where firefighting teams were standing 
by, and negotiations began between French authorities and the hijackers. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of the plane on French soil changed the situation. For one thing, 
the government of France, which had earlier offered to dispatch one of its 
crack, anti-terrorist units to help the Algerian authorities, was now 
completely in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and his foreign minister had spent most of 
Christmas Day meeting about the hijacking and trying to talk the Algerians into 
letting the plane come to France. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijackers, who would most certainly face execution in Algeria if 
apprehended there, may have been hoping for an easier exit from the drama in 
France, where there is no death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 And France's record on handling terrorist cases, especially those involving 
Algerian guerrillas, is mixed. Some suspects have been tried and sent to 
prison, but many others have been expelled to Iran or other neutral countries 
in West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, France has a history of dealing decisively, and often with 
deadly force, in hostage situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Algerian radio said Algeria had allowed the plane to leave to "safeguard human 
lives and avoid material losses." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the hijackers had killed two passengers and freed about 60 
hostages, mostly women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of the third victim, Yannick Beugnet, who was a cook at the French 
Embassy in Algiers, was dumped from the plane late Sunday. He was the 23rd 
French citizen killed by the extremists in the past three years. French news 
reports said he was killed when a departure deadline, fixed by the hijackers, 
had passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The French Foreign Ministry indicated Sunday that it had been pressuring 
Algeria to let the plane take off because the hijackers had threatened to kill 
a French hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hostages are our primary concern," French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
told French television Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The jet had 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard when it was taken over shortly 
before takeoff for France on Saturday. (Air France earlier had said 271 
passengers were aboard.) Authorities said the hijackers may have posed as 
baggage handlers. It was initially reported that there were four hijackers, but 
officials said Sunday that there were five. 
</P>
<P>
 All the female passengers had been released, though female flight attendants 
remained, Air France said. 
</P>
<P>
 A freed hostage described how one passenger, an Algerian police officer, 
pleaded for his life before he was shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "He screamed, 'Don't kill me! I am married! I have a child!' " said the woman, 
who spoke to news agencies on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen also killed a Vietnamese passenger. Both bodies were dumped on the 
ramp outside the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Algerian authorities said they had identified four of the five gunmen, and all 
were from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), the most radical of several extremist 
groups fighting the Algerian government. The GIA has frequently targeted French 
nationals in its terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Air France declined to give the passengers' nationalities, the 
authorities said most were Algerian. U.S. officials said there was no word of 
any Americans aboard. Juppe said 40 French nationals remained on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijacking came two days before the third anniversary of the last round of 
Algerian elections, which the government had canceled when it appeared a Muslim 
group, the Islamic Salvation Front, would win. The military installed its own 
leaders in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the hijackers reportedly had demanded the release of Abassi Madani 
and Ali Belhadj, the top two leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front. 
Government officials later said that demand had been dropped.

POLITICS LEAVES LAWMAKERS IN JAPAN OUT OF POLICY LOOP; ASIA: CRITICS SAY THE 
NEED FOR NATIONAL CHANGE MEANS BUREAUCRATS MUST STEP ASIDE. BUT THAT MAY NOT BE 
EASY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 You think Masahisa Aoki had time to wrestle arrogant bureaucrats and dream up 
grand policy visions during his 26 years as a Liberal Democratic politician in 
Japan? 
</P>
<P>
 Give him a break. Aoki was busy juggling visits to 90 bereaved families in 
three days, 17 weddings in one day and 124 New Year's parties in one season -- 
typical tasks for a Japanese politician. 
</P>
<P>
 In a society that values concrete displays of personal concern over abstract 
policy, politicians ignore rituals at their peril. Aoki once lost a major 
supporter because he did not know a voter's father had died and he failed to 
send funeral money and a condolence telegram. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say you can earn votes by making new schools or bridges, but that's an 
old story," said Aoki, who represented Tokyo's neighboring prefecture of 
Saitama until losing a reelection bid last year. "Funerals are the most 
important way to earn votes." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-Japan trade frictions? Aoki was more consumed by rumors last year that 
his political rivals were handing out rice balls stuffed with $100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's global leadership role? Let bureaucrats drone on about that. Aoki has 
more colorful tales to tell about the shifty character who slithered into his 
office one day and tried to sell 30,000 votes for $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Japan's political trenches, it's no contest: The grunt work of getting 
votes is far more pressing than crafting national policies. That, however, is 
precisely the problem, a growing number of critics say. As a rapidly changing 
world buffets Japan, raising fears that decades of prosperity may begin to 
decline, politicians must head off a looming crisis with wide-ranging reforms, 
they assert. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Aoki's experience illustrates, that may not be so easy. Compared with 
Japan's elite and experienced bureaucracy, politicians are not particularly 
expected -- or equipped -- to provide policy leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do possess expert knowledge are said to use it more to benefit 
special interests. Indeed, such legislators, who are almost exclusively Liberal 
Democrats, are tagged with the withering title zoku giin -- literally, tribal 
lawmakers, who rule clans of special interests that compete to carve up the 
public purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, came back to power in June in 
a coalition with the Socialists and the New Party Harbinger, the tribes are 
said to have run amok. The LDP's powerful agricultural tribe, for instance, 
recently won a whopping bailout of $60 billion over six years to compensate 
farmers for the pain of Japan's decision to open its rice market. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of national elections under a new redistricting plan also has 
created tumult in Japanese politics. Consumed with electoral survival, most 
politicians have little mind for dreaming up new national directions, leaving 
Japan in the bureaucrats' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this uncertain political situation, if the bureaucratic apparatus goes 
bad, Japan's economic and social systems will stop functioning," warned Takashi 
Imai, Nippon Steel president. "It is better not to criticize bureaucrats so 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet critics such as Karel van Wolferen, author of a piercing study of who 
governs Japan, argue that this nation has little choice but to turn to its 
elected leaders. Unless Japan rewrites its bureaucratic blueprint of relentless 
economic expansion, it risks alienating the world and cheating its own people 
of the best possible future, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bureaucrats have helped Japan amass great national wealth. But the strategy to 
produce and sell ever more goods abroad while suppressing the Japanese consumer 
appetite at home has also led to huge trade surpluses, a soaring yen and skimpy 
public services. Japan must share more of its national wealth by opening 
markets further and must shoulder more of the world's problems, Van Wolferen 
and others argue. Only political leadership, they say, can shake the status quo 
preventing such policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without political direction, you won't have significant changes and Japan 
will go on forever doing what it is doing," Van Wolferen says. "Some people 
think that is wonderful and Japan will become the strongest industrial power on 
Earth. But many people, myself included, think many things could go wrong. . . 
. In the long run, it will undermine Japanese security by alienating the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 But paradoxically, Japan's political culture tends to suppress what analysts 
say the nation most needs today: strong, visionary leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, for instance, blazed a trail by 
trying to transform the weak premier's post into a launch pad for 
presidential-style leadership. Hailed as Japan's last truly effective prime 
minister, Nakasone beefed up defense spending, privatized railway, tobacco and 
telephone monopolies and presided over a peak in U.S.-Japan relations. 
</P>
<P>
 International Trade and Industry Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, a rising star in 
the LDP, and Ichiro Ozawa, who masterminded the LDP's ouster from power last 
year and helped form the New Frontier Party, are also regarded as leaders with 
intelligence, political experience and policy knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such strong leaders push the nation ahead, they are unpopular in a 
political culture that values consensus, says Tomoaki Iwai, a Tokiwa University 
political science professor. They may draw public support -- Nakasone and the 
Ozawa-backed former coalition government of Morihiro Hosokawa enjoyed the 
highest popularity ratings in recent history. But in Japan's political world, 
Iwai says, they end up making too many enemies, limiting their grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's history has also suppressed the emergence of statesmanlike leaders, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians enjoyed a brief heyday of genuine power just after World War II, 
when the Allied Occupation reforms broke the back of the bureaucracy and put 
power in the hands of the people's elected representatives, said political 
analyst Minoru Morita. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outbreak of the Korean War, along with China's Communist regime, made 
Asia a top Cold War concern for the United States. U.S. officials pressured 
Japan to follow the American lead, effectively neutering Japanese policy-making 
power and instead encouraging economic development led by bureaucrats, Morita 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Left with a reduced role to play, Japanese politicians focused on doling out 
public works pork and other parochial interests, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Korean War and Cold War in Asia stopped Japan's democratic reforms . . . 
and led to today's system of a parliamentary Cabinet in name only, with 
bureaucrats holding actual power," Morita said. To restore the balance, he 
said, would take "50 to 100" years. Others say changing the status quo will 
take changes in government structure and even more sweeping shifts in the 
mentality of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, Fukushima prefecture, a picturesque resort area of hot 
springs and mountain peaks in northern Japan. There, as in other areas of 
Japan, voters value elected officials blessed with three political assets: 
jiban, kaban and kanban (local connections, money and a family name). 
</P>
<P>
 Hiroyuki Arai has none of these advantages -- which is why his election to 
Parliament's lower house in the summer on his second try was considered 
extraordinary. At 36, the energetic Liberal Democrat says he represents the 
silent mass of salaried workers who, like himself, lack family wealth or an 
illustrious lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 But a visit to his district found many of the old attitudes remain deeply 
embedded; personal ties still often outweigh policies in moving voters. 
</P>
<P>
 What does Kenya Yabe, one of Arai's main supporters, want from politicians? 
"Someone who will stand up to the United States," he growls. "We're made fools 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 But ask if Arai's U.S.-Japan policy attracted his support and the medical 
doctor blinks blankly. "No. He went to high school with my son, and I thought 
it was pitiful that he lost in his first try," Yabe said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the strength of that personal tie -- and the urging of his wife -- Yabe 
activated his network of 3,500 doctors, who in turn urged their thousands of 
patients to vote for Arai. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukushima business executives describe what they want from politicians in two 
words -- "a pipe" -- one that will run from Tokyo to their local towns and will 
be wide enough to funnel back a piece of the nation's public works. Recently, 
for instance, one executive said he asked a politician to introduce him to a 
bureaucrat in order to prod a contractor to give his firm a piece of a public 
works contract for waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In a society where introductions are still required for entree into closed 
groups, the businessman said "politicians who know how to get this work are 
best for us" -- and his firm has prepared more than $200,000 to hand out to 
those willing to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
 To dodge the donor limits of $10,000 per candidate in the new political reform 
law, he said, they plan to funnel the money through several different 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for introductions, mediators and fixers is pervasive in Japanese 
society -- and politicians, for better or worse, end up filling it. That is one 
reason why a web of local connections -- along with the family name and money 
that enhance them -- has been so important for successful politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, fully half of the current LDP legislators are sons or daughters of 
politicians. Despite occasional cries of nepotism and criticism that Parliament 
is losing its political diversity, inherited connections and a family name 
offer an overwhelming advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 So does money. "People are lustful creatures, and, in reality, politics is 
activated by money," said Aoki, the former LDP legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 He said voters often expect everything from cash to free lunches to gift 
coupons for beer or gas. Politicians must constantly shell out funeral 
condolence money, wedding gifts and party fees at a minimum of $50 a pop. And 
to secure a post in the political party, huge sums are passed around. Aoki said 
he was once approached by three different candidates for the LDP party 
presidency and offered $20,000 by each of them for his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians need so much cash on hand that many instruct their tailors to sew 
inner pockets into their clothing -- "passport size" and capable of carrying 
$60,000 in bills worth $100 each, said Aoki, who has written a book about his 
experiences. He added that it is virtually impossible to run a successful 
campaign without breaking election laws -- though he declined, in an interview, 
to say whether he was guilty of doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of such political demands, many legislators are consumed not with 
brilliant policy vision but with the sheer work of raising cash. 
</P>
<P>
 One time-tested way has been to join a party faction and pledge loyalty to the 
leader, who will in turn support followers with money and political posts. The 
late Kakuei Tanaka, Japan's dynamic former premier sullied by a bribery scandal 
in the mid-1970s involving Lockheed Corp., is said to have invented the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way is to join a political tribe and milk its related industry for 
contributions. The construction and transportation tribes are the most 
desirable because of the enormous sums said to flow between those industries 
and their political benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all tribal leaders, of course, are so craven. Sadanori Yamanaka, for 
instance, is the highly respected chief of the LDP financial tribe. A gruff man 
with graying sideburns, he is said to have mastered his field so thoroughly 
that, unlike most legislators, he can answer committee questions on any aspect 
of fiscal policy without relying on written materials from bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also demonstrated considerable political courage. In 1989, he played a 
key role as head of the LDP's tax council in pushing the 3% consumption levy -- 
and paid the price for it by suffering electoral defeat that year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yamanaka, who was subsequently reelected, says that fewer than five of his 
fellow legislators in the 511-seat lower house have mastery to rival 
bureaucrats in a given policy area. And more often than not, political tribes 
use their knowledge to benefit narrow interests rather than the greater 
national good, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent rice bailout was "pork barrel politics run amok," a Japan Economic 
Institute analysis said. It estimated that only $2.3 billion of the $60 billion 
allotted will go to make Japanese rice farmers more competitive, the presumed 
policy rationale. "Unless we can clarify the policy," fretted Tomomitsu 
Iwakura, the LDP's top agricultural staff specialist, "we will invite further 
public distrust." 
</P>
<P>
 Such realities prompt many opinion leaders here to question whether the 
nation's elected officials can forge a new direction. "With respect to 
neutrality and fairness in implementing crucial policies, politicians can't be 
a good match for bureaucrats," says Kojiro Shiraishi, a Yomiuri Shimbun 
editorial writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Those politicians with a genuine interest in policy get few resources. Each 
national legislator, regardless of seniority, long received just two staff 
members, although the number was increased this year to three. The annual 
public salary and office budget amounts to $320,000, which Aoki said was not 
even enough to pay for regular mailings to his 1 million constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, members of the House of Representatives have $557,000 
each to hire as many as 22 staff members for offices in Washington and in their 
home districts. American legislators also have aides who work for them on their 
House committees. Further, House members receive at least an additional 
$122,500 a year to pay for travel to and from their districts and for rent 
while they are in Washington. Official mailings to constituents are free. 
</P>
<P>
 And while congressional aides in the United States are typically young, with 
little political experience, about the only breeding ground for political 
policy specialists in Japan is the LDP. The party's policy research council 
employs 30 senior staff members. It is organized into policy committees 
corresponding to each government ministry -- a structure that encourages 
specialization but has also produced the notorious political tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Koichi Kato, chief of the LDP policy research council, has been outspoken in 
urging legislators to take greater political control. The three-party coalition 
has an ironclad rule not to divulge information on policy debate until there is 
clear agreement, preventing bureaucrats from trying to divide and conquer. 
</P>
<P>
 But ultimately, legislators must vote themselves a bigger budget and staff to 
create their own, independent policies, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Some politicians, such as Ozawa, argue that Japan also should vastly increase 
the number of political appointees sent to direct the bureaucracy, as in the 
American system. While the President may appoint more than 3,000 people, 
Japan's prime minister is empowered to select fewer than 30. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan, however, raises protests from ministry officials. "To have large 
numbers of politicians working in the ministries may damage the objectivity of 
judgment and continuation of foreign policy," said Kunihiko Saito, the vice 
minister of foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the younger generation is producing politicians better equipped to 
battle the bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasuhisa Shiozaki, for instance, is as pedigreed as the most elite public 
official: Tokyo University, Harvard graduate school, Bank of Japan. His 
intellectual confidence allows him to dress down bureaucrats when others might 
not dare; he is less reliant on them for information, thanks to an independent 
network of banking and financial contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 He succeeded his father in politics but entered of his own volition last July 
as an LDP lower house member -- in part, he says, to help raise Japan's 
standard of living to levels he enjoyed as a high school exchange student in 
Marin County in 1967. Although he attends weddings and performs other expected 
constituent services, his passion is policy debate -- from tax reform to 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese politicians have to become more capable and intelligent. . . ," 
Shiozaki says. "But things are changing. Younger politicians are more 
interested in policy-making than staying in the district and going to 
funerals." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fukushima, Arai is trying to offer a new political style, involving voters 
in choices about their future. He returns to his district every weekend, 
working crowds and appealing for help in tackling big issues. Using a 
blackboard and colorful props, he explains such tedious topics as the Uruguay 
Round trade talks in terms the sunbaked farmers and their reticent wives can 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 His campaign seems to be paying off. "No one has ever explained these things 
to us in such a concrete way," beamed 60-year-old farmer Murakosu Hatsura 
recently after one such talk. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether Japan's elected officials can make the leap to genuine policy 
leadership is still a question among those who know the country well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan has no history of politicians taking charge," argues Chalmers Johnson, 
president of the Japan Policy Research Institute and author of the classic 
study on the role of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in 
engineering the nation's economic miracle. "The best hope is to redirect the 
bureaucrats into a new national role." 
</P>
<P>
 With no easy solution in sight, some analysts say that only crisis or foreign 
pressure will move Japan to produce the leadership needed to make critical 
policy changes. It was the Gulf War, for instance, that pushed Japan to break a 
political taboo and dispatch peacekeepers to aid U.N. efforts in Cambodia and 
other hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where there is no fire, the Japanese won't go and put it out," said Gerald 
Curtis, a Columbia University political science professor.

TREASURERS TRY TO CATCH UP TO CHANGING TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 The Charles County treasurer's job did not look all that difficult in 1974 
when Thelma Bowie first considered running for the office, so she took a shot 
at it. To no one's surprise, she won. 
</P>
<P>
 With a high school diploma -- and 24 years of experience as a staffer for 
retiring Treasurer Franklin Winkler -- Bowie was reasonably familiar with the 
basic routine: Collect the taxes that people send in and then put the money in 
the bank -- into "safe" certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a political office -- you went to all the weddings and funerals," 
recalls retired state Sen. Jim Simpson, who was a county official at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, after five consecutive terms, Bowie retired amid a scandal over 
$1.3 million in losses racked up when her deputy invested county funds in 
"derivatives" -- the same high-risk financial instruments that have wrought 
havoc in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowie's travail -- she is undergoing medical treatment for heart problems -- 
reflects some of the stunning changes that have overtaken the once-staid world 
of municipal and county fiscal officers over the past few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 From onetime financial backwaters that could be run by almost anyone, local 
government finance departments have been quietly evolving into complex 
operations that often require special investment acumen as well as knowledge of 
the latest innovations in financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every jurisdiction has kept pace with these demands, and some -- possibly 
including Charles County and others where the job is still a part of the 
county's courthouse political legacy -- are struggling with the consequences 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 One major factor behind the painful transition is a drastic increase in the 
pressures on treasurers to earn more with their constituents' money. Slumping 
local economies exacerbated by taxpayer revolts have seriously squeezed many 
cities and counties, prodding fiscal officers to seek every ounce of 
"investment profit" they can get to replace forbidden tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates on the more traditional "safe" investments, such as Treasury 
bills and bank CDs, have steadily declined almost to a pittance, creating 
temptations to move toward higher-paying -- and decidedly riskier -- bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wall Street's new high-visibility investment houses have been 
coming up with creative financial mutants that salesmen have hawked 
aggressively to often unsophisticated fiscal officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure is on these people to have maximum performance, and the people 
who supervise them don't care how they get there," said Robert Sobel, a Hofstra 
University financial expert. "Six months ago (Orange County Treasurer Robert 
L.) Citron was a hero. Now, look." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the latest debacles in places such as Orange County and Maryland's 
Charles County are hardly the first time that a city, county or state 
government has found itself in financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 John Peterson, president of the Government Finance Group, a Virginia-based 
investment firm, points out that in the nation's earliest days states routinely 
defaulted on big construction bonds for canal-building and the like, often 
soaking foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations reports that in the 
late 1870s, about one-fourth of the total debt incurred by cities and counties 
across America was in default -- primarily because of carpetbagging governments 
and bad railroad bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big economic recovery after World War II -- and a spate of financial 
crackdowns by states -- stabilized the situation. Through the early 1970s, 
there were only a handful of big defaults -- New York, Cleveland and the 
Washington Public Power Supply System among them. 
</P>
<P>
 And financial crises stemming from bad investments by local officials -- 
rather than just defaults -- have been even rarer. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that for the most part, counties and cities were restricted by 
state law from investing in anything much riskier than a Treasury bill or bank 
CD. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie Mae Griffin, treasurer of Pittsburg County, Okla., says her county's 
investment portfolio -- which ranges between $5 million and $7 million at its 
peak -- goes entirely into local bank accounts. "You have to live in your own 
world," she said. "Here, we are much slower-paced." 
</P>
<P>
 But quite a few jurisdictions now have no real limitations, and the lure of 
greater investment returns is tempting. 
</P>
<P>
 In Auburn, Maine, population 24,000, where losses from investments in 
derivatives cost the city about $6.5 million last summer, acting City Manager 
Patricia A. Finnigan says the government did not even have an investment 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no way to prosecute anyone after the debacle because there were no 
rules to violate, Finnigan said. "It was just that (the city's treasurer then) 
felt that that would be appropriate," she said. "We're developing a policy now, 
and should have it out soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Charles County's big financial blowup last summer came despite 
tight restrictions on permissible investments. County officials decline to 
explain how their money wound up in high-risk instruments, but they have filed 
a series of lawsuits trying to void the transactions on grounds that they were 
made illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the qualifications of individual city and county treasurers seem to 
vary as widely as the laws that regulate them. That is particularly the case in 
the 34 states where the position is elected by voters rather than appointed 
based on credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, financial expertise would have been almost irrelevant for a 
treasurer. In the 1800s, they were not expected to invest money -- just keep 
it. Taxes were paid in gold, and all the treasurer needed "was a great big 
vault," said Bill Finck, who served briefly as a treasurer of Bexar County, 
Tex. "There was no intention of reinvesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Until relatively recently, many jurisdictions deposited their collections in 
local banks. The banks provided some free services but nothing else. Interest 
earnings "simply weren't expected," Maryland's Simpson recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1970s, the entire financial picture began to change. Taxpayer revolts 
were limiting the ability of local governments to raise taxes to cover their 
increasing costs. Federal programs were being cut back. And Congress was 
requiring localities to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most counties were earning interest on their investments by then, the 
abrupt end to the inflation surge in the 1980s sent interest rates on Treasury 
securities and bank CDs plunging, depriving local governments of one of their 
few additional sources of income. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, deregulation tore away many of the restrictions that had 
limited the scope of the investments available on the financial markets, 
spawning a plethora of hybrids that offered far higher yields -- at a far 
higher risk. 
</P>
<P>
 One major development was the expansion of the so-called government securities 
market to include investments offered by quasi-federal agencies such as the 
Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fannie Mae, as the FNMA is popularly known, and other such entities 
are not backed by the "full faith and credit" of the federal government, they 
are considered so by the markets and thus fall within the limits of many local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many local fiscal officers found them attractive places to put 
their money. And despite a few mishaps in the late-1980s savings and loan 
debacle, few thought them very risky. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wall Street came up with the idea of offering derivatives, some 
localities were poised to take the next step. And the salesmen were poised to 
make a kill. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Bauer, treasurer of Ada County, Ida., said she gets calls about once a 
week from salesmen trying to persuade her to invest in one fund or another, 
including some firms as far away as New York, Florida, Texas, Chicago "and a 
lot of California types." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Buckler, the treasurer of Marion County, Ind., which includes 
Indianapolis, says derivatives salesmen have been pulling out all the stops, 
holding out promises of high yields and even going to lengths to find out her 
nickname to help endear themselves to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who present this mask it in mystery (and) try to brainwash away 
your common sense," Buckler said. "But you get beyond all the packaging and 
marketing and . . . what you see is short-term money attached to a long-term 
yield. I don't think so!" 
</P>
<P>
 Philip M. Dearborn, a government finance expert, says most localities did not 
succumb to such sales pitches, but the fact that even a minority did is 
disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us have come to realize that there's a lot going on out there that 
wasn't apparent," Dearborn said. Using derivatives judiciously to offset other 
developments in the market is one thing, he says. But "trying to get greedy is 
just crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to now, reform has come relatively slowly. One state that has moved to 
tighten its rules is Texas, which five years ago began requiring that county 
treasurers be formally "recertified" by passing courses on the latest bond 
market developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a program of continuing education because so much changes 
every year," said Bill Melton, the Dallas County treasurer. "We have all sorts 
of various and sundry instruments to be invested in." 
</P>
<P>
 But most analysts believe that broader reforms will be slow in coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Norris, a former LaPlata businessman who has replaced Thelma Bowie as 
Charles County treasurer, is determined to avoid a repeat of last summer's 
debacle. "We hold no derivatives, and we're not going to hold any," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hofstra's Sobel is not so sanguine. "Sure, we can expect to see more 
conservative financing in the next few years," he said, "but 15 years from now 
there'll be problems all over again."

CLOSE LOOK SUGGESTS ROLE OF ORPHANAGE A COMPLEX ONE; CHILDREN: POLITICIANS SEE

 A soft-spoken teen-ager sat on the couch in the group home where he has lived 
for three years and described why sometimes, despite all the attention he 
receives from the staff, he cannot control his temper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can be very nice one minute, and the next minute I can blow off the 
handle," said Terrence, 16, who has lived in foster homes and residential care 
facilities since he was a toddler. "It happens when I think about my past. Why 
did it have to be me going to a group home? Why aren't I going home every night 
to see my mama, like the other kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 Seven hundred miles away, at Atlanta's Carrie Steele-Pitts Home, young 
residents had similar thoughts. Sure, said 8-year-old Lakeisha, she'd love some 
toys and dolls and pretty new clothes for Christmas. But what she really wanted 
was to be living back at home with her mother, brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I like this place. It's fine," she said. "But I'd rather be home." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, for Terrence and Lakeisha and tens of thousands of others like 
them across the country, home is not an option. Neglected, abused or abandoned 
by their parents, they are what experts call "social orphans," and many live in 
the modern-day equivalent of old-fashioned orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, both the children and the institutions are being thrust into the 
spotlight as a result of the growing national debate over welfare reform. And a 
close look at the evidence suggests that the question of what role orphanages 
-- and similar forms of group foster care -- can or should play in dealing with 
the children of poverty is far more complicated than politicians of all stripes 
make it sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly orphanages don't seem promising as a device for making welfare 
cheaper. At an average annual cost of $36,000 per child, group homes are more 
costly than a year at an elite college. And experts are in agreement that under 
normal circumstances the best place for children is with their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, crack cocaine, random violence, street gangs, runaway 
fathers, teen-age mothers and other factors are pushing so many children into 
acutely dangerous situations that something akin to orphanages may be their 
only hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Expensive as they may be, in the long run group homes may prove cheaper than 
the alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Political conservatives started the argument by suggesting that orphanages 
could be the answer for children whose parents are cut off the dole by welfare 
reform and cannot support them. Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) 
fanned the rhetorical flames by suggesting that if First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton was appalled by the notion of bringing back orphanages, she should 
watch the 1938 Spencer Tracy-Mickey Rooney film "Boys Town." 
</P>
<P>
 Indignant liberals declared that separating parents and children would be 
unconscionable in all but the most extreme situations. Policy experts added 
that institutional care is prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie Melton, who directs two group homes in Chicago, fiercely defends the 
institutions but says they are no place for a child with loving parents. "To 
remove a child from a family -- no matter how poor -- a child feels it has been 
punished. We've created more problems than we've solved," she said. "There's 
all this talk about family values and now they're talking about splitting up 
families. It's very contradictory." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have calculated I'd have to take 10 families off welfare to fund one child 
in the lowest-cost institution," said Gary Stangler, human services director of 
the American Public Welfare Assn. "We decided some years ago that what we 
really have to talk about is strengthening families. It's so much cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of this counterattack, many conservatives have edged away from the 
orphanage idea. "I think the states aren't going to go that route," said Rep. 
James M. Talent (R-Mo.), who drafted several sections of the GOP plan for 
welfare reform, which lists the construction and operation of orphanages as one 
way states can use funds that would otherwise go to teen-age mothers. The GOP 
plan would deny teen-age mothers cash benefits in an attempt to discourage 
out-of-wedlock births. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a non-issue," said Doug Besharov, a former child-welfare official and 
now a senior policy analyst at the conservative Enterprise Foundation research 
center. "For some kids it works. But it's a perversion of a good idea to use it 
broadly." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the number of children who meet the experts' definition of those who 
might be helped by institutional care is rising at an alarming rate. 
</P>
<P>
 According to government studies and independent analysts, the number of 
children suffering from severe parental abuse and neglect has swollen by more 
than 50% nationwide since the late 1980s. According to the House Ways and Means 
Committee, there were 273,000 such children nationwide in 1986. Now there are 
between 480,000 and 490,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In Illinois, the "social orphan" population has more than doubled in size 
since 1990, to 45,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I attribute those big figures to narcotics," said the Rev. John P. Smyth, a 
priest who runs the Maryville Academy, a 98-acre institution outside Chicago. 
"We've always had the poor. We've always had dysfunctional families. But I've 
been here 32 years and I've never seen the neglect and violence and harm that 
parents today do to kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster care, the living arrangement for the majority of "social orphans," is 
much less expensive. But each year more and more children are placed in group 
homes because their problems are too severe to be dealt with in conventional 
foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why in 1989, sociologist Joyce Ladner, now the interim president of 
Howard University, proposed "an institution that many had hoped would never be 
needed again: the orphanage," as an alternative to a child-welfare system that 
she called "woefully out of touch with the sorry realities that confront many 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many group homes occupy the space of former orphanages, but there the 
similarity ends. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, adult-to-child ratios are far smaller than in the orphanages of 
the past and services, such as psychiatric treatment, are plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those who live in group homes are victims of parents who are substance 
abusers. Many have suffered multiple forms of physical and sexual abuse. As a 
result, most distrust adults, many are accustomed to stealing to meet their 
needs and almost all require round-the-clock supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of these children long to be with their parents -- or perhaps 
more accurately, with the people they wish their parents really were -- 
institutional care is far better than the situations they leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrence, for instance, worries about his younger brothers who stayed home 
with their mother and are now growing up surrounded by drugs and gangs. 
(Because Terrence and the other children quoted in this story are legally wards 
of the state, only first names or pseudonyms can be used.) 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to fall into it. You step out of the house and someone is 
selling drugs or trying to get you to sell stuff for them," said Terrence, 
whose group home is located in a middle-class Chicago residential neighborhood. 
"Here I have a better outlook of what I need to do to become somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 He is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Chicago suburb of Des Plains, Jennifer, 12, lives in the Maryville 
Academy, a facility that for decades looked a lot like the orphanages of old 
but today is a model of the modern approach to residential child care. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Jennifer was watching a television program on incest and realized 
that she had to talk to someone about her own life. "My dad abused me and my 
brother for a long time -- longer than I can remember," she said recently. A 
gangly girl whose easy smile disappeared when she spoke of her family, Jennifer 
recalled the turning point: "After what (TV talk show host) Oprah (Winfrey) 
said, I decided to tell my best friend." 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryville Academy, Jennifer said, is far better than living with her 
alcoholic, abusive parents. The foster situation she was in for several months 
after leaving home did not give her the regular therapy sessions or the other 
support that she receives now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Done for the right reasons and by the right people," said David Blankenhorn, 
president of the Institute for American Values, "it may be an act of charity 
and mercy for some children to put them in institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts contend that some states' child-welfare systems put too high a 
priority on keeping children with their biological parents -- sometimes to the 
detriment of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at outcome data to see if the children are more or less abused, 
do better or worse in school, you can find very little data to show that 
working hard to keep the kids with their parents helps," said James Q. Wilson, 
a UCLA professor of management and public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Wilson said, the word orphanage is so loaded that it 
reverberates "like a hand grenade at a dinner party." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional orphanages, where dozens of children slept in one room, were 
established in the United States in the late 19th Century as an alternative to 
so-called poorhouses, where abandoned children were warehoused with adults. But 
in time, orphanages also proved unsatisfactory. And by the end of the 1970s, 
traditional orphanages had become all but extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not appropriate places for children to develop mentally," said 
Barbara Bloom, whose job in the late 1960s and 1970s was to close down 
orphanages in New York state. "The evidence was so blatant (that) we assumed 
we'd never revisit the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Boys Town, for instance, no longer looks anything like the images in the movie 
Gingrich cited. For two decades it has been a campus of group homes where 
children receive individual care. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Boys Town's lead, in the mid-1970s, the Maryville Academy replaced 
its huge 30-bed dormitories and massive cafeteria with a cluster of group 
homes. Nine boys or girls are matched up with house parents, who live 
round-the-clock with the children. The house parents are aided in raising the 
children by staff and mental health specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Such intensive staffing is necessary because three-quarters of the girls and 
half of the boys have been sexually abused. Most have been physically abused 
and neglected as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to helping such children emerge from their emotional trauma is 
creating an environment where they can learn to form bonds with individual 
adults, whom they can gradually learn to trust and depend on for security and 
affection, according to Smyth and child-welfare experts around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls who live with Christina Diaz, one of the surrogate parents at the 
Maryville Academy, do not hesitate when asked what she means to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a mother," several preteen girls answered as they sat around a long 
dining room table doing homework, writing Christmas lists and passing notes 
about boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It teaches us what a family is," Dawn, an eighth-grader, said about the 
household where she lives with eight other girls and Diaz. "I didn't know what 
a family is. Having a family is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn, who was abused by her parents and then bounced around to various foster 
homes before she landed in the Maryville Academy five years ago, said she is 
not leaving until she goes to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "It teaches us a lot about how to live, and that's one of the things kids 
need," she said. "There's also a lot of loving and caring, and that's the other 
thing kids need." 
</P>
<P>
 This is where the orphanages of old failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we fell short on the psychological end," Smyth said. "We didn't know 
any better. But now we do." 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Methodist Children's Home in Decatur, Ga., administrator Beverly 
O. Cochran boasts that in 26 years, he has never turned a child away. But the 
needs that send young people to the 100-acre campus near Emory University have 
changed -- and consequently, so has the 123-year-old institution, which was 
first established to care for the children of those killed in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to keep siblings together, for example, a co-ed cottage now 
houses brothers and sisters. An independent-living cluster allows some 
18-year-olds to try out autonomy while under supervision. Four townhouse 
apartments provide interim shelter for homeless families, even offering storage 
of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for official functions, the large communal dining room goes unused. 
Instead, in a further attempt to simulate traditional family life, meals are 
prepared and eaten in individual cottages, each of which houses eight to 15 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a week, residents of all the cottages meet to voice grievances and share 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
 All the coziness in the world cannot entirely mask the fact that these are 
troubled children living in an institutional setting. Children who fail to 
respond to a four-tiered system of privileges and punishments are placed in 
lockup -- the children's equivalent of solitary confinement -- though for no 
longer than a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday morning cottage cleanups are followed by careful inspections, with 
rewards and reprimands handed out in equal measure. And every Wednesday, 
psychiatrists come to call -- hardly the routine at the surrounding houses in 
the comfortable residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of size and funding, the Methodist home is on a par with the best 
such institutions nationwide. It spends $36,000 a year for each of the 65 to 70 
boys and girls ages 6 to 18 who live at the facility, one of three 
Methodist-sponsored homes in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the growing demand for care outside the home, "we're looking at two 
issues here," Cochran said. "One, what is best for the children? And two, how 
are you going to pay for it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Across town, in Atlanta's predominantly African American Adamsville district, 
the question of money weighs even more heavily at the Carrie Steele-Pitts Home, 
which must make do on a considerably leaner budget. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the 85 to 90 boys and girls are all wards of the county or state, which 
provides per diem expenses of $25.89 for each child. Additional funds come from 
charitable contributions, primarily United Way. But the small allotment puts 
the institution at the low end of the economic spectrum among group homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the 5- to 18-year-olds, who live here for average stays of 18 months to 
three years, appear robust and well cared for. Most are African American, and 
virtually all come from abusive homes. Along with large quantities of hugs from 
the staff, all children receive some form of psychotherapy. The hearty repasts 
in the big dining room are so legendary that neighborhood children sometimes 
show up at mealtime, asking if they can live at the home too. 
</P>
<P>
 The home is named for an African American maid who scrubbed floors at the 
Atlanta train station after the Civil War. As foundlings began to appear on 
benches during Reconstruction, Steele took them into her own home. Her will 
provided the funds for what began as a traditional orphanage -- dozens of 
parentless children and a few starchly attired matrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, despite the bare-bones budget, great care is taken to provide a homey 
environment in what is unquestionably a crowded facility. As many as 20 
children reside in each of the low brick cottages dotting the facility's 17 
pine-filled acres. Cared for by house parents who rotate in four-day shifts, 
the children live clustered by age and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Filled with such items as stuffed animals for the youngest children and rock 
music posters for teen-agers, the neat little houses are pink and green and 
smell of disinfectant. Cleanliness and order are top priorities, and even the 
youngest residents must participate in a carefully structured task system. 
</P>
<P>
 No one escapes the chores. "Unless you are ill, you get up and you work," said 
Olivette Allison, the home's 70-year-old administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The four bunks in each bedroom are made up each day with near-military 
precision. The children are expected to maintain equally high standards of 
personal hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make sure that everyone is neatly groomed and bathed every day, because 
when you smell good, you act good," Allison said. "We believe in beautiful 
manners and self-control and self-respect." 
</P>
<P>
 An ample woman who stretched her arms out expansively as she described her 
facility's mission, Allison came to the Carrie Steele-Pitts Home nearly 60 
years ago when her family came apart during the Great Depression. She said she 
has worked with 10,000 children in the course of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 The institution, she argued, is a crucial component of the social welfare 
system. "You've got to have a neutral setting that is built on warmth, love, 
God and respect."

<P>
 A weary Pope John Paul II tempered the Roman Catholic Church's joy at 
Christmas on Sunday with a mournful litany of conflicts that have bloodied much 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul opened his traditional "Urbi et Orbi" message -- Latin for "to the 
city (of Rome) and the world" -- with a tribute to families as the church nears 
the end of its Year of the Family. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as has been his custom throughout his 16-year papacy, he turned the end 
of his message from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica into a lament for 
places without peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I look at families in the light of Christmas, I cannot but turn my 
thoughts to the greater human family, unfortunately torn by persistent forms of 
selfishness and violence," the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we to say of the Sudan with its 'forgotten' war and of Algeria, 
where murderous violence holds the whole people hostage? And the very land 
where Jesus was born, does it not continue to be a theater of conflicts and a 
place of division?" the pontiff asked. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul's speech was prepared in advance, but violent events of the day 
seemed to make his words ring louder. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the main entrance to Jerusalem, an Islamic militant blew himself up, 
wounding 12 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In Algiers, passengers on a French jetliner were hostages of Muslim militants, 
who killed at least three people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope also mentioned the fighting in the former Yugoslavia, "tearing apart 
the Balkans," as well as civil war or tensions in southern Russia, Angola, 
Rwanda and Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
 He also singled out "new centers of tension," including the Caucasus 
Mountains. Grozny, the capital of the Russian Caucasus region of Chechnya, was 
in ruins Sunday after nearly a week of Russian aerial attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 74-year-old pontiff appeared tired Sunday after midnight Mass in the 
basilica, a private Mass at dawn in his chapel, and a public service in the 
basilica late Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul shuffled down the main aisle of the basilica, which is about the 
length of a football field. He has had problems walking since surgery to repair 
a broken thigh bone earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the basilica, the Pope stopped to shake hands with children along 
the aisle and waved with his right hand, its pinkie bandaged. He injured the 
finger when it was caught in a car door last month. 
</P>
<P>
 At the late morning Mass, the Pope invoked the baby Jesus to "move men to lay 
down their arms and to draw close in a universal embrace of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 A prayer for peace was offered in Tamil, a language of Sri Lanka, an island 
nation torn by civil strife that the Pope will visit in January. 
</P>
<P>
 To the 40,000 or so people gathered in St. Peter's Square, the Pope offered 
Christmas wishes in 54 languages.

DOUBLE STANDARD FOR SIMPSON AT JAIL CHARGED; CUSTODY: LAWYERS FOR OTHER INMATES 
COMPLAIN ABOUT APPARENT SPECIAL TREATMENT. SHAPIRO DEFENDS DECISIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Inside the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail, both of them were on the 
books as K-10s -- "keep-aways" -- inmates considered too dangerous or 
vulnerable to mix with the general population. Both were locked into one-man 
cells. Both had their movements restricted, their actions closely watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a jail that operates with such anonymity that guards refer to their 
jobs as "grabbing bodies" for the next scheduled activity, Derrick Nelson, 22, 
onetime gang member of Pasadena, had quite a different life in custody than his 
famous jail mate: Orenthal James Simpson, 47, former football great of 
Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a combination of court orders and administrative decisions, Simpson is 
receiving benefits that Nelson and most other inmates could only dream of, 
interviews and court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is allowed to shower more often, sleep later before going to court and 
make use of more than 10 additional hours outside his cell each week to stretch 
his legs, ride an exercise bike provided for his use, talk on the phone or 
watch TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest difference is in the area that prisoners care about the most 
-- contact with outsiders. As he left the jail recently after charges were 
dropped, Nelson said that as a keep-away he was allowed only an hour a week in 
the regular jail visiting room, where he was locked in a cage in the midst of 
as many as 240 other inmates talking to friends and relatives across a glass 
barrier and over phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, meanwhile, has been allowed unlimited non-contact visits with 
girlfriend Paula Barbieri and others while sitting at a desk in a private glass 
booth located in the jail's less crowded attorney visiting room. Not only has 
Simpson recently been given exclusive use of the attorney visiting area on 
weekends, his arrangements also allowed him to see outsiders on Christmas, when 
jailhouse visiting was suspended for all other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 What appears to be a double standard has some in the criminal justice system 
grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rules have been bent beyond recognition in O.J.'s case," complained one 
defense attorney, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The deference shown to Simpson, he added, even extends to the attitude of the 
guards, who he said are normally aggressive with other inmates but are "very 
solicitous of O.J. . . . almost to the point of toadying to him." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Sheriff Sherman Block said any apparent favoritism 
actually is geared to making the jail run more smoothly. "Those things we are 
doing that seem to give O.J. special treatment are being done for our benefit," 
Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting Simpson into the general population would create chaos because of his 
celebrity status, he said, and would open him to attacks by any inmate with 
designs of grabbing a piece of the spotlight in the highly publicized case. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Block acknowledged that Simpson's incarceration has been a "great 
inconvenience," complicating the administrative routine at a 6,000-inmate 
facility that transports a third of its inhabitants every weekday to courts 
throughout the county. And records show that keeping Simpson in jail just 
through October has cost Block's department more than $232,000, much of it for 
deputy overtime at the jail and courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get letters all the time from citizens out there who complain and ask why 
he is getting special treatment," Block said. "Now, everything else he gets 
outside of these visits is what everybody else gets, but in his case it's a 
one-on-one basis. He eats the same food as the rest of the inmates eat but 
instead of going to the dining room, it's brought to him on a tray." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys, bristles at the suggestion 
that his client is getting favored treatment. Shapiro said he has asked for and 
been granted after-hours visitation rights because of the extraordinary 
complexity of the fast-moving trial, which has Simpson and his defense team 
tied up in court during the normal visiting time for attorneys at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Simpson may be worse off than other high-security inmates 
because he is being kept in isolation -- where he is monitored via video 
camera, has little contact with guards and prisoners and is not taken to the 
jail roof for exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Simpson is the only occupant in a seven-cell wing of the 1750 unit, which 
is reserved for high-security inmates such as accused drug dealers, bad cops 
and ranking gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep hearing this bull---- of 'special treatment, special treatment, 
special treatment," Shapiro said. "The whole place sucks." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who has pleaded not guilty to murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown 
Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman, is not the first inmate to receive 
individual attention in the jail. Mass murder mastermind Charles Manson and 
1970s revolutionaries-turned-kidnapers William and Emily Harris were isolated, 
as was Sirhan Sirhan, Robert Kennedy's assassin. But in Sirhan's case, jail 
officials were so worried that someone would poison him that they built a 
kitchen next to his cell to prepare his meals, Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in isolation, Simpson is not immune from discipline. Deputy George 
Ducoulombier, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, said Simpson had his privileges 
taken away for three days when guards once discovered contraband -- a yellow 
high-lighter used to mark documents -- in his cell. 
</P>
<P>
 However, interviews and records indicate that in general Simpson is enjoying 
some important benefits afforded to few, if any, inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Ducoulombier said Block decided to give Simpson additional 
"freeway time" -- the period during which an inmate can roam the corridor 
outside his cell -- based on complaints from the former athlete about an 
undisclosed medical problem. With that extra time, about 14 hours a week 
compared to up to four hours for most inmates, comes more opportunities to 
watch TV, talk on the phone or take a shower, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Block allowed an exception to jail policy against contraband when he permitted 
Simpson to have football cards in his cell, Ducoulombier said. Simpson was 
honoring a pre-existing contract calling for him to autograph 5,000 cards as 
part of a profit-making venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some attorneys say they admire Simpson and his lawyers for their 
gumption in extracting more "civilized" treatment from the jail, they lament 
the fact that their less wealthy and less prominent clients cannot do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole point is not whether O.J. should be getting the treatment he gets," 
said Deputy Public Defender Casey Lilienfeld. "I think he should. I think it's 
good that he's getting a shower every day. The point is other guys should get 
the other benefits as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be an inequity in the fact that he gets certain things that my 
clients don't get," he said. "They're poor, they don't have money to hire a 
lawyer, and they're treated differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: Simpson won a court order guaranteeing him a hot meal when he 
returns from court after dinner is served in jail, authorities said. Shapiro 
asked Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito and the Sheriff's Department for the 
accommodation after complaining that his client was served "mystery meat" 
sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our clients made that complaint, the sheriff would . . . tell them to shut 
up," said Deputy Public Defender Russell Griffith, who works in the county's 
Compton office. 
</P>
<P>
 Private defense attorney Barry Tarlow noted how quickly jail authorities 
complied with a June court order giving Simpson sleep medication and a cervical 
pillow, which fits around his neck. Shapiro said the pillow was needed because 
the hard mat that his client slept on aggravated an old football injury. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Tarlow said it took him three court orders between May and August 
before deputies at the Wayside Honor Ranch in Santa Clarita gave a tube of skin 
cream to one of his clients with a severe infection near his groin. Sheriff's 
spokesman Ducoulombier said he never heard of Tarlow's case but added that jail 
authorities routinely comply with a multitude of court orders ranging from 
special medication to telephone access for inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet what really sets Simpson apart -- and sticks most in the craws of many 
attorneys as well as the sheriff himself -- are the extra visiting privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail policy gives lawyers Monday through Thursday to confer with inmates in 
the attorney visiting room, an area off the main entrance where lawyers and 
their clients can either address each other across long tables or at desks in 
one of eight private glass booths along the back wall. Sometimes the inmates 
are chained to the floor, but the only thing separating them from visitors are 
short, teller-like windows, over which lawyers can pass legal documents after 
they are inspected by a deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 When that room is closed, attorneys must stand in line with inmates' wives, 
girlfriends and children to use the regular visiting room, a less private area 
open Thursday through Sunday where visitors face each other through a glass 
divider and use telephones to talk. There are no time limits on attorney 
visits, but inmates can only speak to friends or relatives for two half-hour 
sessions a week in the regular visiting room. 
</P>
<P>
 From the earliest stages of his case, Simpson's attorneys have pressed for 
special arrangements. They have asked for exclusive use of the attorney room 
when it is otherwise closed on weekends and sought approval of a long list of 
"material witnesses," people the defense say could attest to the former 
athlete's character and may need to confer with him in jail to prepare 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Because these witnesses are accompanied by an attorney, their visits do not 
fall within the half-hour limits for friends and relatives, jail officials say. 
And that loophole has allowed Simpson private, unlimited visits with girlfriend 
Barbieri, teammate Al Cowlings, his grown children and others, according to 
jail officials and attorneys on other cases who have witnessed the visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it looks like, to an attorney who goes down (to the jail) to see a lot 
of clients, is a scam," said John Meyers, a Century City defense attorney for 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 At most, he said, defense attorneys will identify five or six material 
witnesses for an unusual case. Simpson's list includes 52 people -- more than 
any in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're representing a man who is unjustly accused of two counts of 
first-degree, premeditated murder. We have asked for our constitutional right 
for a speedy trial," Shapiro said, defending the special requests. "Since we're 
in court Monday through Thursday till about 5 p.m. or 5:30 p.m., it is 
virtually impossible to prepare with our client under those conditions as would 
be with any other lawyer. If we had a man who was allowed bail, we'd be able to 
meet with him seven days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said he filed a comprehensive material witness list because "we have a 
situation where at one point in time, some of the issues may involve character, 
may involve reputation, may involve life history. And I'm not going to take any 
chances in doing anything other than being totally prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 The county has consistently opposed these defense requests, for reasons of 
cost and preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Block successfully fought a Municipal Court order requiring him to 
follow the list and open the attorney room for eight hours on a specific 
weekend, court records show. Block filed papers arguing that the material 
witnesses were friends and relatives and warned that the order would give 
Simpson "more rights than like inmates committed to the County Jail awaiting 
trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Block prevailed in that specific case, Simpson's defense team has 
since won a succession of sealed court orders from Ito approving the witness 
list and forcing the Sheriff's Department to compromise on visiting 
arrangements by making available a rarely used third-floor infirmary visiting 
room, said James M. Owens, principal deputy county counsel. To accommodate 
Simpson, the department had to widen one of the booths and install a new 
telephone system that allowed four people to talk at one time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in this room that a guard said he overheard comments that an emotional 
Simpson made to football defensive lineman-turned-evangelist Rosey Grier on 
Nov. 13, a report that brought the struggle over visitation into public view 
during court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed concerns over privacy prompted Ito to sign orders opening the 
first-floor attorney room to Simpson and his lawyers during recent weekends, 
Owens said. It also spurred the Sheriff's Department recently to make $20,000 
in improvements to the infirmary visiting area by adding plexiglass, drywall 
and sound-dampening carpet, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cumulative effect of court orders and administrative decisions has been to 
make life easier for Simpson than for fellow keep-away Nelson, a self-described 
reformed gang member arrested Aug. 26 on suspicion of a parole violation -- 
possessing a gun. Nelson was held on $65,000 bail but was released Dec. 14 
after the weapons charge was dropped, according to records and interviews with 
his public defender attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a living hell in there," Nelson said moments after he walked out, 
his possessions in two plastic bags and the red K-10 classification band still 
on his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said he earned the keep-away status after he got into a fight with a 
gang member; he was placed in a one-man cell in the 3100 section starting Sept. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just messed me over, man," he said. "But once you get in there, there's 
nothing you can do but accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, Nelson and Simpson were treated alike. Both had their meals 
brought to them on a tray because their keep-away status made it impossible for 
them to go to the prisoners' mess call. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the former gang member described a very different existence on several 
points. Jail officials said the average inmate gets two to four hours a week in 
freeway time and keep-aways average 30 minutes every other day. Nelson said it 
was less in his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're lucky, it's three times a week. . . . It's supposed to be a 
half-hour, but they give us 20, 25 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Simpson gets two hours of freeway time a day -- one in the 
morning and one later in the day -- outside his 9-by-7-foot cell, Ducoulombier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation for all inmates, Ducoulombier said, is supposed to be two hours a 
week on the jail rooftop, an open area secured by wire mesh where they can play 
basketball or volleyball. Keep-aways get the same but are usually locked into 
64-square-foot steel cages. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said he never came close to getting his allotted time. "We went once a 
month -- God knows, I'm not lying," he said, adding that the guards used to 
wake up six prisoners at a time at 4:30 or 5 a.m. for the excursion. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is not taken to the roof; instead, the jail has provided him an 
exercise bike, which he can use during his freeway time each day. Shapiro said 
the lack of outdoor exposure is a hardship on his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no roof time and hasn't seen the sun since June," Shapiro said. "We've 
asked for him to have exercise with the sun out, and they woke him up one 
morning at 6:30 a.m. and said it was time to go up." 
</P>
<P>
 But Simpson declined. "He felt that his rest was more important so he could 
concentrate on the case," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson was allowed to shower every other day, locked in a steel cage. "If I 
had to go to court when they ran the showers, I didn't get a shower," he said. 
"They don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 For their court dates, ordinary inmates are roused at 5 a.m. and are waiting 
at a downstairs holding area by 6 a.m. for their bus ride to court. Those who 
are considered the highest security risks are put in steel cages in the buses. 
All inmates get dinner in a sack -- two sandwiches, fruit and two cookies -- 
when they arrive back too late for the evening meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, meanwhile, has the opportunity to take a shower every day, 
Ducoulombier said. He is awakened at 6 a.m. for his private van ride to the 
Criminal Courts Building a few blocks away. When he returns late, he eats a 
regular prison meal kept warm from dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear whether other inmates know about Simpson's favored treatment. 
But Block said it has not dimmed an obvious admiration that prisoners have 
expressed whenever the former football great, accompanied by a special guard, 
walks through the general jail population on his way to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's taken on pretty much of a hero status," Block said. "It's not 
unusual when he is moved through part of the facility where there are other 
inmates, they will cheer him and things like that."

FUND CRISIS PUTS MERRILL LYNCH'S IMAGE ON LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While scandals rocked one Wall Street giant after another in recent years, the 
biggest securities firm of them all, Merrill Lynch, came through it all without 
suffering any major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 It dodged such traumas as the insider trading junk bond debacle that destroyed 
Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Treasury bond crisis that nearly sank Salomon Bros. 
and the disastrous high-risk limited partnerships that have cost Prudential 
Securities more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch, in fact, has boasted of having one of the biggest and toughest 
compliance divisions on Wall Street. That unit is credited with discovering and 
turning over to the Securities and Exchange Commission the initial key evidence 
that broke open the big 1980s insider trading scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, Merrill Lynch finds itself under uncharacteristic scrutiny. As 
regulators explore its involvement in the Orange County bankruptcy, and while 
separate federal probes investigate Merrill Lynch's municipal finance dealings 
in Massachusetts and New Jersey, the firm's envied reputation is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, securities industry veterans express confidence that the Wall Street 
powerhouse will continue to play a dominant role in the nation's municipal 
finance business, as well as in other key securities markets. During the first 
nine months of 1994, it was the No. 1 municipal bond underwriter with volume 
totaling $14 billion. The experts reason that Merrill Lynch will keep on 
rolling because of its enormous financial muscle, unparalleled sales network 
and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some in the industry also question privately whether Merrill was too 
aggressive in pushing the rapid growth of its municipal finance business over 
the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch has not been charged with any crime in the Orange County bond 
crisis or in the East Coast cases. Company spokesman James R. Wiggins said 
Merrill Lynch denies any wrongdoing and has responded promptly to "any 
questions that arise." 
</P>
<P>
 What may be at stake for Merrill Lynch is the lucrative estimated 5% to 10% of 
its annual revenues coming from municipal finance. In addition to underwriting 
bonds, that area includes such activities as trading securities, managing 
investment funds and making loans for local government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Merrill Lynch now leads Wall Street in municipal finance 
underwriting, it has plenty of tough competition in a business exceeding $175 
billion this year. Goldman, Sachs & Co. was right behind in municipal 
underwriting during the first three quarters of 1994, with volume totaling 
$13.1 billion. Lehman Brothers and Smith Barney together accounted for nearly 
$20 billion more. 
</P>
<P>
 A large part of Merrill Lynch's success stems from the firm's size and 
diversity. The firm easily sells off the municipal bonds it underwrites through 
its own bond mutual funds and its vast network of retail stockbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are able to move bonds on a larger scale than any of their competitors," 
said Robert Lamb, a New York University professor who has written six books on 
municipal finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investigators are looking into whether Merrill Lynch also built up 
its municipal finance business by breaking securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In connection with Orange County's financial collapse, the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers, an industry regulatory group, is exploring whether three 
Merrill Lynch brokers made improper campaign contributions to former County 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission is seeking to determine whether the firm provided kickbacks or 
campaign contributions in exchange for securities trading business, although it 
is unclear whether Merrill Lynch is an official target of that investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County also is widely expected to sue Merrill Lynch, the county's top 
bond underwriter, to recover at least some of the more than $2 billion in 
losses absorbed by its investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill spokesman Wiggins said the company has always responded swiftly to any 
sign of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have 43,000 employees, there's always the potential for someone to 
step over the line. The question is, how does management deal with it, and 
we're proud of how our management has dealt with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiggins cited the company's actions in New Jersey, where federal authorities 
are investigating whether Merrill Lynch employees made sweetheart deals to gain 
underwriting business from the state Turnpike Authority. Merrill Lynch alerted 
authorities about the issue last year, and put three municipal finance 
employees on paid leave in connection with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm said it discovered that the employees in question were doing business 
with a securities firm half-owned by Joseph C. Salema, former chief of staff to 
then-Gov. Jim Florio. The company also said it found "apparent irregularities" 
in a joint trading account it maintained with Salema's firm, but would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Merrill Lynch apparently was caught off guard by the other major East 
Coast controversy, in Massachusetts. Federal investigators are following up on 
a report released a year ago by the Massachusetts inspector general that found 
that the firm obtained confidential information enabling it to become lead 
underwriter for bond issues by the state's Water Resources Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also found that an independent adviser to the state agency, Mark 
Ferber, turned over the information to Merrill Lynch in exchange for bond 
business. Merrill Lynch denies receiving any inside information, and called the 
inspector general's report "substantially inaccurate." 
</P>
<P>
 If Merrill Lynch is encountering more controversy in municipal finance than 
its big competitors, it may be a function of the company's size. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a broad swath of the municipal finance industry has been tainted in 
recent years by the "pay for play" issue, involving investment firms that make 
political contributions to state and local officials to win government 
business. The controversy prompted the adoption of tighter campaign 
contribution rules late last year and early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the controversies in its dealings with states and municipalities, 
Merrill Lynch has suffered little financial fallout. Many experts believe that 
the same will hold true in the aftermath of the Orange County bankruptcy. Last 
week the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority removed Merrill 
Lynch for an indefinite period from its list of underwriters, but that was an 
isolated action. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about the company's legal liability pushed down Merrill Lynch's stock 
price from $38 before the Orange County news began breaking on Dec. 1 to a low 
of $33.25 in mid-December, but it has since bounced back, closing at $36 on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 One securities lawyer who asked not to be identified said that although 
grandstanding politicians may urge agencies to temporarily hold off dealing 
with the firm, "the sophisticated investment professionals . . . will do 
business where you get the best price and execution." 
</P>
<P>
 In Massachusetts, despite the federal investigations, officials have kept 
Merrill Lynch on their exclusive list of five Wall Street firms that are the 
only ones allowed to be lead underwriters on state bond issues. The only 
sanction against Merrill Lynch is that it is barred from being a lead 
underwriter on bond issues that are not competitively bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for that mild sanction, state officials are almost apologetic. "We 
realize that we may be treating the firm unfairly and risk losing its superior 
capabilities, but we felt there was a higher standard of public trust we had to 
follow," said Eric Fehrnstrom, assistant state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, Treasurer Tom Gallagher has decided to continue doing bond 
business with Merrill Lynch, even though his department is suing the firm over 
its role in an alleged insurance company fraud. Gallagher said he wanted the 
state "to have the option of doing business with them when, in fact, they may 
have the best deals in the marketplace. It wasn't to our advantage, as large as 
they are, to not have them . . . available as a vendor to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The story was similar in the city of San Jose, which sued Merrill Lynch and 
other brokerage firms in the mid-1980s after losing $60 million in securities 
trading. After reaching a settlement with Merrill Lynch, the city resumed doing 
business with the firm -- although not with its previous broker, Michael G. 
Stamenson, who also was Merrill Lynch's lead broker with Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "People's memories are short in this country," said Perrin H. Long Jr., a 
veteran analyst who has long followed the nation's big Wall Street firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Merrill Lynch's activities in municipal finance create a lasting stain 
on its reputation depends on more than just whether in the final analysis it is 
found that some employees broke the law, said a securities industry official 
who declined to be identified. The other key issue is whether Merrill Lynch is 
found to have "a corporate culture" that fosters abuses or whether any possible 
wrongdoing emerged "only in a couple of places in a far-flung operation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern Methodist University in 
Dallas, said that if damaging revelations emerge from Orange County, it could 
cost Merrill Lynch some municipal finance business in the short term. But given 
the firm's prowess in the field, he said, "if they behave themselves, they'll 
get it all back within two or three years."

 Red-haired Ariel Weiss embarrassed his young friends as they debated about 
Israelis making peace with their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mean to sound racist," he told his classmates, setting his jaw 
defiantly. "But even if I grow up in a generation of peace, I won't tell my 
children that an Arab is like a Jew. I think we should treat the Arabs like 
humans, but don't trust them too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Ariel's comments brought groans from his fellow 14-year-olds. But some 
sympathized. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who are opposed to peace," said Inbar Kalmonovitch. "Some 
people think it is good that we get to know the Arabs, but for others it is 
frightening, because there are still murders, there are still wars." 
</P>
<P>
 Hadar Gonen nodded. "It is confusing," she agreed. "On the one hand, we're 
signing peace agreements. Then, on the other hand, people are getting killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ariel, Inbar and Hadar are part of an experiment under way in every grade of 
Israel's public schools: More than a year after the Israelis signed their 
historic accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Ministry of 
Education is trying to teach young people what peace will mean for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials, principals, teachers and students are finding the task complex and 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of preparation, including special workshops for teachers and 
pilot programs in handpicked schools, it has become clear that explaining 
Israel's efforts to make peace is, in some ways, more difficult than explaining 
the need to go to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the experience here at Alumim middle school in Ramat Hasharon, a 
wealthy Tel Aviv suburb. It is an airy, well-appointed school; the parents of 
many students are highly educated professionals. But the Arab-Israeli conflict 
has deeply scarred even these relatively privileged, pampered Israelis, said 
Principal Ilana Dan. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must understand," she said. "All our lives, we were taught that we have 
enemies and that Arabs were our enemies. During the Gulf War, Scud missiles 
fell in this neighborhood. Houses were destroyed. People were hurt. Our 
children were frightened. For months after the war, many of them were afraid to 
go home after school." 
</P>
<P>
 And when it comes to discussing peace, "everybody in Israel, including the 
students, has . . . very set opinions," said Sara Harel, one of the ministry 
officials who helped to develop the half-million-dollar education program. "We 
think that the role of the schools, in this instance, will be to help children 
form their opinion from knowledge and to confront other opinions which are 
different from theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Even that seemingly modest goal has raised a storm of criticism from Israel's 
political right, which views the peace education program as a dangerous 
propaganda exercise by the government. Opponents see it as an effort to prepare 
Israelis for the abandonment of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip and for the ceding of land to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue here is not teaching the values of peace. That is not what the 
government is doing," said Yechiel Leiter, a spokesman for the Yesha Council, 
an organization of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Settlers support 
peacemaking as a value rooted in the Bible, Leiter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what they are teaching in the schools is this particular government's 
vision of peace, when more than half the country believes that what they are 
pursuing will lead to war," he said. "This is done in the worst Bolshevik 
fashion. It is an almost Soviet-type re-education of the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of the sensitivities involved, Education Minister Amnon Rubinstein chose 
to make the teaching of peace voluntary. He decided to do this through the 
"theme of the year" -- an annual program that each school is encouraged to 
teach in addition to the routine curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the program has tackled less explosive issues, such as the 
environment or democracy. The theme for 1994-95 was industrialization, until 
Rubinstein replaced it in January with "The Peace Process: Israel in the Middle 
East." 
</P>
<P>
 But no sooner was the new theme announced than a Jewish settler in the West 
Bank filed a petition with Israel's Supreme Court to block the program. The 
petition argued that the peace program would actually teach schoolchildren to 
hate Jewish settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 That suspicion was bolstered because Rubinstein, a member of the left-wing 
Meretz Party in the coalition government, is an ardent supporter of making 
peace with Israel's neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The court threw out the petition and upheld the ministry's right to teach the 
subject. "The court examined the material that we had prepared for the schools 
and praised us for being evenhanded and balanced," Rubinstein said. "We include 
the whole spectrum of political opinion in our presentation." 
</P>
<P>
 He was determined to tackle the sensitive issue inside the nation's 
classrooms, Rubinstein said, because he believes that "we couldn't turn a blind 
eye to what was happening. We don't want the schools to be excluded from public 
debate. Controversy is not harmful to our education system." 
</P>
<P>
 But some school administrators acted as if the ministry had tossed a grenade 
into their laps, Harel observed. "There are schools which prefer to deal with 
industrialization," she said dryly. "It is easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Harel said that some religious schools -- the state runs both secular and 
religious schools -- have refused to teach the subject. Others teach it but are 
supplementing government materials with materials written by settlers groups 
criticizing official peacemaking efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Harel defended the ministry's cautious approach to the issue, noting that 
Israel at least is trying to educate its children for the new world that seems 
to be emerging in the Middle East. "I wonder what the Jordanians and the 
Palestinians are doing about this issue?" she asked pointedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, at the moment, is nothing, Jordanian and Palestinian officials 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian Authority, which is governing the Gaza Strip and the West Bank 
town of Jericho, only this fall took over responsibility for education 
throughout the West Bank. Officials of the authority must deal with myriad 
problems, ranging from school overcrowding to a shortage of textbooks -- and 
they have little money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians so far have not addressed the problem of how to teach the 
benefits of making peace to pupils raised on the fiery rhetoric of resistance 
against the Israelis and the occupation, said Naim abu Hoummus, minister of 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jordan, Minister of Information Jawad Anani said the government has not yet 
begun to deal with changing the curriculum, which still identifies Israel as 
the "Zionist Enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, in Israel, "most schools are teaching the theme in one way or 
another," Harel said. "Many of the religious schools add the subjects of love 
of the country and the dignity of man, and de-emphasize the political process 
that is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 At Kol Mevassert, an Orthodox high school for boys outside Jerusalem, 
Principal Yaacov Kruger is proud of his school's decision to participate in the 
discussions of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "On all issues, there is a deep divide here in this country," Kruger said. 
"Most of our students come with a very set idea about peace. They have been 
indoctrinated in their homes and in their youth movements. So we felt here in 
the yeshiva that it was very important to let students hear all the sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty percent of his students, most of whom live on campus during the week, 
come from Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Kruger said. They feel directly 
affected by the government negotiations with onetime enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of peace remains so sensitive that it was not left to classroom 
teachers to deal with, Kruger said. Instead, Amos Kliger, the head of the 
yeshiva, conducts a freewheeling discussion with students about the peace 
process once or twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Education Ministry has allowed great leeway to schools to teach the topic 
as they see fit, said Dalia Goren, who has directed the theme projects for four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt about it, this subject is very, very controversial," Goren said. 
"The reaction we got from the field initially was, 'Why don't you wait until we 
see if the peace process works?' We replied that if we don't deal with it in 
the school system, the children will be left with what they see on television." 
</P>
<P>
 Goren said the ministry issued three guidelines, which it insisted must be 
followed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Much of the information must be based on actual texts of agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 * All opinions across the Israeli political spectrum should be discussed 
openly in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * The principle of observing the rule of law in protest and debate must be 
kept. 
</P>
<P>
 "These issues are so emotional that we don't really expect objectivity from 
the teachers or the students," Goren said. "We are talking about being fair and 
about making the children aware of the options." 
</P>
<P>
 Programs range from elementary students pasting white paper doves on bulletin 
boards to Alumim students sponsoring sophisticated debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan said she is easing her school into the program. Workshops for teachers 
came first. Then a small program was launched with the 15-year-olds. Only next 
month will the program be expanded to the whole school. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily lives of her 610 pupils, ages 12 to 15, require a go-slow approach, 
Dan insisted. For many children, the Scud missiles that Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein rained down on Tel Aviv and its surrounding suburbs in the 1991 Gulf 
War were only the most horrible manifestation of Arab hatred for Israel that 
they had experienced, Dan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born into a nation treated as a pariah by all its neighbors -- where one 
popular folk song is "The Whole World Is Against Us" -- the children who are 
teen-agers now grew up regarding the conflict between Arabs and Israel as 
inevitable and unending, educators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The peace treaty signed with Egypt in 1979 was seen as an anomaly that 
produced only a "cold peace," not a reconciliation between peoples or true 
acceptance of Israel, they added. 
</P>
<P>
 But the signing of the accord with the Palestinians -- and the signing this 
year of a treaty with Jordan -- set off alarm bells for educators, Dan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that our children will live in a different Israel and that we have to 
prepare them. But it was difficult, we didn't know how we were going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry's program, which is being coordinated with the Van Leer Institute 
in Jerusalem, provided the framework the school needed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Leer Institute, a private think tank specializing in political and 
social issues, devised a program to provide high schools and middle schools 
with a weekly news service. An institute team combs Hebrew and English-language 
newspapers, then prepares packets of headlines, stories and political cartoons 
for hundreds of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The packets are divided into categories: on peace between Israel and the 
Palestinians, between Israel and Syria, between Israel and Jordan, and between 
Israel and Egypt, and on current events inside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools receiving the packets form committees of student editors. The young 
people decide which stories to display on portable bulletin boards designed by 
the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 At some schools, that is as far as it goes. Students are left to gather before 
the boards and argue among themselves about the contents. 
</P>
<P>
 At Alumim, the group that includes Ariel, Inbar, Hadar and a dozen other 
students supplements the boards with class lectures and debates. "If they hear 
(about the peace process) from fellow students, it is easier to take," Hadar 
said of her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that arguments sometimes erupt over materials posted on the bulletin 
boards. "But that's OK," she said. "Arguments make it more interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 And recently, the children noted, they were able to supplement their debates 
about peace with a living example of its benefits: A Jordanian student spent a 
day at their school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a boy who crossed from Aqaba with his mother on a foreign passport 
before the peace treaty was signed," Dan said. "He was interviewed on Israel 
Television, and they asked him what he would most like to do here. He said that 
he wanted to meet children his age. So we invited him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jordanian student visited Alumim on Oct. 20, one day after an Islamic 
suicide bomber killed 22 people on a Tel Aviv bus. The bombing was so traumatic 
that psychologists were called in to deal with students' fears that day. 
</P>
<P>
 But the visit went on as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children were very excited," Dan recalled. "They said: 'It was such an 
awful day yesterday, but we are ready. We have to do this. We have to start 
getting to know each other.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She paused for a moment and shook her head in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very proud of them," she said softly.

SOGGY CHRISTMAS FOR SOME, WHITE ONE FOR SKIERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Skiers got their wish for a white one, but everyone else was stuck with a wet 
Christmas as a slow-moving storm dropped just over an inch of rain on Southern 
California on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder, lightning and scattered power outages hit the area, along with a 
small funnel cloud off Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The overnight precipitation meant that chains were needed above 4,000 feet in 
the mountains. Ski resorts reported eight to 10 inches of fresh snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Several accidents were reported on rain-slicked freeways over the weekend, 
including a 10-car accident on the San Bernardino Freeway near Alhambra on 
Saturday night, said California Highway Patrol Officer Karen Faciane. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that evening, a Greyhound bus carrying 26 people, including an infant, 
collided with a van and two other vehicles on the northbound Hollywood Freeway 
near Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries in either accident. 
</P>
<P>
 A flash flood warning was issued for western Los Angeles County after more 
than an inch of rain fell in some regions. Residents of Malibu and other areas 
denuded by wildfires were urged to watch for mudslides, but county fire 
officials reported no problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A cold front moving eastward from the central Pacific Ocean was responsible 
for the statewide inclement weather, said Bruce Rockwell of the National 
Weather Service regional center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 As the storm system ambled into Nevada, showers and partly cloudy skies 
persisted throughout Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts from WeatherData Inc., which provides weather information to The 
Times, predicted mostly sunny days ahead, with highs in the low 60s and a 
slight chance of showers Wednesday.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; S.F. TARGETS ANTI-TRANSGENDER BIAS; CITY IS ON VERGE OF 
ENACTING A LAW TO PROTECT TRANSSEXUALS AND CROSS-DRESSERS. BUT SOME BUSINESS 
OWNERS ARE OUTRAGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Dunne tried hard to live like a man. He got a job in heavy construction 
and became a skilled sheet-metal worker. He got married -- three times. But for 
nearly 30 years, he knew he wasn't being true to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he decided to have a sex change operation, but when word leaked out 
at his workplace, he found himself without a job. Now Robert has become 
Roberta, and the onetime hermit has blossomed into an activist fighting 
discrimination against transsexuals and cross-dressers. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the efforts of Dunne and others such as her, San Francisco is on the 
verge of enacting the toughest law in the nation aimed at protecting the city's 
transgender community from discrimination in employment and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Approved by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors this month, the ordinance 
would add "gender identity" to the list of categories such as race, age and HIV 
status already protected from discrimination under city law. Mayor Frank Jordan 
is expected to sign the measure this week, and its euphoric supporters say that 
the idea soon will spread nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a San Francisco thing," Dunne said. "This is an extremely 
important problem we're presenting to the whole country. We are educating 
people that we are like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco, with a long tradition of tolerance, was among the first in the 
nation to outlaw discrimination against homosexuals and people with AIDS. But 
transsexuals and cross-dressers say they have continued to suffer harassment -- 
some of it violent. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law would embrace a wide variety of people: transsexuals (whether or 
not they have had sex change surgery), cross-dressers (the preferred term for 
transvestites) and hermaphrodites (people born with both male and female sexual 
organs). 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters estimate that the ordinance will cover about 6,000 of San 
Francisco's 724,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are calling for an end to hatred, to abuse, to disrespect," said Jamison 
Green, director of FTM International, an association of transsexuals. "We are 
calling for the right to define ourselves, to say for ourselves who we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce has taken no stand on the 
measure, some business owners are outraged. They worry that it will force them 
to employ workers they consider undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am just amazed this city can create new rights for cross-dressers," said 
Adam Sparks, owner and manager of the Pacific Bay Hotel. "If someone comes in 
with a beard and a miniskirt, do I have to hire them? This town has gone nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, employers still will be able to reject applicants based on 
personal appearance, but they will not be allowed to discriminate against 
workers if the real reason is gender identity, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst penalty a private employer could face is a formal city finding of 
discrimination, which then could be used by the employee in a civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Three cities -- Santa Cruz, Seattle and Minneapolis -- have adopted similar 
measures, but San Francisco's will be the toughest because it also will apply 
to any company doing business with the city. Companies violating the law could 
face revocation of their contracts or be banned from city contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Human Rights Commission, which is expected to vigorously enforce the law, 
is drafting another ordinance to spell out how the discrimination ban will 
work, particularly in the area of bathrooms and shower facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The second ordinance, city officials say, will allow transsexuals and 
cross-dressers to choose which public restroom or dressing room they use, as 
long as the facilities offer privacy. But in cases where nudity is involved, 
such as a communal shower or a workplace locker room, a person's sex organs 
must match the facility's sex designation. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the law say it is designed, in part, to help educate the public 
about the transgender community, a group not well understood. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, they say, transgendered people believe that their gender identity 
does not match their biological characteristics. Gender identity -- one's 
perception of oneself -- should not be confused with sexual orientation -- the 
kind of person one wishes to be intimate with. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been culturally conditioned to believe that gender and sex are the 
same thing," wrote Green in an essay published by the city's Human Rights 
Commission. "The terms are used interchangeably, but in fact they are very 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 People who believe that they are the opposite gender have been a part of 
almost every society throughout history, their advocates say. In modern 
America, two basic groups come under the umbrella of transgender. 
</P>
<P>
 Transsexuals are men and women so unhappy with their biological gender that 
they have had a sex-change operation or want to have one. Some call the 
operation "gender confirmation surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross-dressers are people who relieve "gender discomfort" by occasionally 
dressing in clothes of the opposite sex. Cross-dressers often are men who seek 
to pass as women, but they also can be "gender-benders," who do not care 
whether they appear convincing. 
</P>

 Michelle worked as an emergency medical technician for a San Francisco 
ambulance company when she began her transition from male to female. Her 
employer, who was very religious, called her a sinner and a pervert, then fired 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle appealed to the Human Rights Commission for help. Although her status 
was not covered by existing laws, the commission staff began investigating. But 
before the inquiry was finished, Michelle killed herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found she committed suicide as a result of the stress," commission 
representative Cynthia G. Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle's case was one of about 40 discrimination complaints filed with the 
commission in the past six years. Convinced that the problem was serious, the 
commission held a public hearing on the issue last spring and began drafting 
the ordinance to protect transgendered people. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have unfortunate situations arising in their lives from gender 
identity," said county Supervisor Terrence Hallinan, who carried the measure 
before the board. "Some people are using that as an excuse to discriminate 
against them. We said, 'Stop that. They are human beings too.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It will no longer be politically correct to make fun of transgender people," 
the supervisor added. 
</P>
<P>
 Many transsexuals say they knew from an early age that they were different 
from other people and have experienced discrimination all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunne, the sheet-metal worker, recalls going to school at the age of 6 wearing 
his sister's clothes. When he tried to get in the sandbox with other boys, they 
began fighting and ended up tearing off his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still fighting over the sandbox," Dunne said. "This law will protect 
people like myself. People are going to see it's OK to include us."

LUCKY TIMING HELPS SCIENTISTS UNLOCK SECRETS OF MIGRAINE; RESEARCH: A WOMAN'S 
HEADACHE BEGAN WHILE HOOKED UP TO MONITORS, ENABLING DOCTORS TO WATCH A THEORY 
PLAY ITSELF OUT. AS A RESULT, NEW TREATMENTS MAY BE POSSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fortuitous onset of a migraine in a research subject who was already in 
the brain imaging laboratory has provided UCLA researchers with a sharp new 
insight into the initiation of migraine headaches and may lead to the 
development of new ways to treat and prevent the disabling disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists discovered that the headache began when blood flow to a small 
region at the rear of the brain was reduced about 30% by constriction of blood 
vessels. The decrease in blood flow then spread across the surface of the brain 
like a wave washing over a small pond, they reported in last week's New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The results confirm the so-called "spreading depression" theory about migraine 
onset, a relatively new theory that so far has been validated only in mice. 
Until recently, researchers had believed that migraines were the result of 
reduced blood flow in a localized area of the brain, but the new theory, not 
yet widely accepted, suggests that migraines are a result of low blood flow 
throughout the entire brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers termed the phenomenon spreading depression because it was 
originally detected as a depression in electrical output of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA study "documents beyond any reasonable doubt that spreading 
(depression) is a real phenomenon," said Dr. Jes Olesen of the University of 
Copenhagen. And that knowledge could lead to new treatments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a class of drugs known as NMDA receptor antagonists that show great 
promise in mice in stopping spreading depression," said Dr. Roger Woods of 
UCLA. "Now we have more confidence that these drugs will work in humans as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those receptor antagonists are being tested in humans as a treatment 
to limit brain damage in strokes, he said, and their safety has been 
demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods noted, however, that the spreading depression theory may apply only to 
the so-called classical migraine headaches in which the victim perceives an 
"aura" -- a combination of visual, sensory and movement sensations -- at the 
onset of the headache. Some evidence suggests that migraine headaches not 
accompanied by an aura, about 40% of the total, may have a different mechanism, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although migraines are not life-threatening, they are severely disabling for 
about 23 million Americans who suffer them regularly. In addition to extreme 
pain, the symptoms typically include nausea and an aversion to light and sound. 
The symptoms can last from two hours to two days, and most victims are unable 
to work or carry out other activities while suffering from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods and his colleagues have been studying the normal functions of the brain 
using a technique called positron emission tomography. In PET, a harmless 
radioactive gas is injected into the bloodstream and tracked with a sensitive 
detector as it flows through blood vessels. Relatively high levels of 
radioactivity in a particular blood vessel in the brain represent a high blood 
flow and thus, presumably, increased activity by brain cells in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Woods' subjects, who had previously reported headaches triggered by 
exposure to a flickering television screen, was placed in the PET scanner with 
a TV screen in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
 More than an hour into the test, she felt a sharp pain in the center of the 
back of her head that she said was "as if someone had hit me there." The 
headache worsened into a full-blown migraine with an aura, but she continued to 
stare at the screen while doctors took more brain scans. They were able to 
monitor the progression of the headache from start to finish -- a first because 
previous studies involved subjects who came to a clinic only after a migraine 
had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Their observation is important, Woods said, because it validates the animal 
model of migraines that many researchers have begun using. In the model, the 
rat's brain is pricked with a pin or a small amount of potassium or an amino 
acid is applied to a specific spot, triggering the wave of reduced blood flow 
known as spreading depression. 
</P>
<P>
 But researchers could not know if the animals were suffering headaches, Woods 
said. The new study, he said, "shows that the animal model really is mimicking 
the human condition." 
</P>
<P>
 That knowledge will make researchers more confident in extrapolating results 
from the animal model to humans, he added. It also suggests that experimental 
drugs that prevent or halt the process in animals can do so in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Olesen added that the results should finally persuade many physicians who have 
remained doubters that migraines are a biological problem and not a 
psychological one. More on Medicine

STATE COLLEGE ENROLLMENTS FALL SLIGHTLY; EDUCATION: FIGURES FOLLOW NATIONAL 
TRENDS AND SHOW A STRONG COMEBACK FROM LAST YEAR. OFFICIALS PARTIALLY CREDIT 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mirroring nationwide trends, California's two largest public higher education 
systems experienced only slight enrollment declines this fall, a strong 
reversal to the sharp drops of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollments in California's community colleges fell 1.4% to about 1.36 million 
students, compared to a 9% loss in 1993, a spokesman said. California State 
University enrollments declined 1.9% to 319,394 students this fall, from a 6.3% 
drop the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The results mirror those of a national report to be released today by the 
American Council on Education, the nation's main higher education lobby. The 
council suggests that a similar pattern of moderation in enrollment losses has 
occurred this fall in their survey of selected states. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nationally, I think it's slowing," said David Merkowitz, a council spokesman. 
This fall, 11 of the 17 states with the most complete survey data reported 
overall enrollment declines, slightly fewer states than a year ago. Private 
school enrollments have increased in 12 of 18 states surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Merkowitz said the tallies released today account for about 40% of nationwide 
enrollment. Earlier this fall, however, the U.S. Department of Education, based 
on a sampling of actual institutions rather than selected states, forecast a 
new high of 14.7 million students, a slight increase over 1993. The department 
couched the numbers for both years as estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in California said the end to steep public enrollment losses this 
fall reflects the state's economic recovery. Also, the state's public higher 
education systems fared better financially this year after deep budget cuts 
earlier in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The enrollment declines had alarmed college and university educators, who 
feared that students were being shut out of the systems because of cutbacks in 
classes and higher fees. Historically, California has prided itself in 
providing some level of post-secondary education to any student who sought it. 
</P>
<P>
 The $390 per year in fees charged a full-time community college student is 
nearly four times the price of 1990. Cal State's annual $1,584 fee is more than 
double 1990's charge. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, total enrollments in California's three public higher education 
systems -- community colleges, Cal State and the University of California -- 
fell 8% to 1.87 million, the largest drop in the nation, one study found. This 
fall, the total loss will probably be less than 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the enrollment news is not as bad as in previous years, the new 
figures still mark the third consecutive year of enrollment declines for the 
107-campus community college system, and the fourth straight year for the 
20-campus Cal State system. 
</P>
<P>
 California's community college enrollment hit its lowest level this fall since 
1988, with about 1.33 million students. The Cal State system's enrollment hit 
its lowest mark since 1984, when fall enrollment stood at 316,000, records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Cal State campuses in the region, Northridge suffered the largest loss, 
10.9%, because of the January earthquake. The Long Beach, Fullerton, Pomona and 
San Bernardino campuses had small declines. The Los Angeles, Dominguez Hills 
and San Diego campuses had small gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the nine-campus UC system, which has also been hit with 
enrollment losses for the past three years, could not be reached to provide 
their fall enrollment figures.

JESSE JACKSON COMPETES WITH QUEEN ON TV; BRITAIN: AS SHE HAILS N. IRELAND 
PROGRESS ON BBC, AMERICAN ASSAILS TORIES ON ANOTHER CHANNEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While Queen Elizabeth II sent Christmas greetings paying tribute to those 
seeking peace in Northern Ireland, Jesse Jackson created a controversy here 
Sunday with his alternative holiday message in which he compared the 
Conservative government and party with racism and fascism. 
</P>
<P>
 The speeches by the queen and by Jackson, a civil rights leader and onetime 
American presidential candidate, aired at the same time, on separate television 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks on independent Channel 4, which specializes in minority programs 
and views, Jackson said that living conditions for the poor in Britain were 
deteriorating under the Tories. He said the poor also suffered in America under 
conservative leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must no longer allow the clock to be turned back on human rights or put up 
with political systems which are content to maintain the status quo," he said. 
"In South Africa, the status quo was called racism. We rebelled against it. In 
Germany, it was called fascism. Now in Britain and the U.S., it is called 
conservatism." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Bottomley, a Conservative member of Parliament, assailed Jackson's 
comments and accused the network of "stereotypical ignorance in allowing or 
telling their distinguished contributor to say something untrue to a national 
or international audience." He said Channel 4 could have asked a black British 
leader to speak, instead, if it was seriously interested in providing a 
minority view about conditions in Britain this Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Secretary Michael Howard, and Ivan Lawrence, chairman of the 
Parliamentary Home Affairs Committee, said Britain has nothing to learn from 
Jackson on race relations issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the queen, in her annual address on the BBC, said peace is 
"gradually taking root" in Northern Ireland. She added that there is "real hope 
of a permanent end to the bitterness of recent years." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she would pray for global tranquillity, and apparently referring to 
the conflict between Moscow and the rebellious republic of Chechnya, she said 
she also hopes for peace, "not the least in Russia itself." 
</P>
<P>
 "The sight of happy faces of children and young people in Russia, in South 
Africa, where so much has changed with such extraordinary speed in the last 
year, and in Northern Ireland, where there is real hope of a permanent end to 
the bitterness of recent years, should be enough to convince even the most 
hard-hearted that peace is worth striving for," the queen said.

 A German mother and her 20-month-old daughter burned to death when their 
Christmas tree caught fire so fast that it virtually exploded, firefighters 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree and decorations were set alight by sparkler candles on Christmas Eve 
and blazed so suddenly that the eruption blasted out the windows of the 
family's small flat in the western city of Duesseldorf. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old father suffered severe burns but escaped over the balcony 
along with an uninjured friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters found the bodies of the daughter and 30-year-old wife inside.

BUREAUCRACY; REPUBLICANS MOVE TO CLOSE 2 BUILDINGS USED BY CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON NATHANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Republican "less is better" revolution now has GOP lawmakers looking to 
put some of their new home up for sale. Republicans say they will sell off one 
of five House of Representatives office buildings and terminate the lease of 
one of the House's two warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no need for as much space in a slimmed-down Congress as there was in 
the bloated bureaucracy of the old Congress," said Rep. Robert D. Franks 
(R-N.J.), a member of the GOP transition team put in place after the November 
elections thrust the party to majority control of the House and Senate. The 
team is conducting a survey of office space. 
</P>
<P>
 The two buildings that are candidates for closing, House Republicans say, are 
House Annex No. 1, named for the late House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill 
(D-Mass.), and House Annex No. 2, named for former President Gerald R. Ford, 
who also served as a House minority leader. 
</P>
<P>
 While many Capitol Hill visitors are familiar with the stately Rayburn, Cannon 
and Longworth House office buildings because they contain the offices of 
lawmakers, no members are housed at the Ford or O'Neill structures and they are 
little-known outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is home to many of the congressional caucuses, such as the Black Caucus 
and the Hispanic Caucus, which both face the loss of public funding if the 
Republicans have their way. It also houses congressional subcommittees, some of 
which are on the GOP chopping block for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-story, two-wing Ford building is a fortress compared to the smaller 
and frailer, but more centrally located O'Neill. The latter was converted from 
a hotel in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 While the proposed Republican cuts would empty much of the Ford building, 
closing it wouldn't be that easy. The Ford also houses the Congressional Budget 
Office, the House computer systems headquarters and the printing and documents 
storage room. 
</P>
<P>
 It also wouldn't be cheap. Franks said it would cost $3 million to move 
computer hardware out of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The concrete-and-brick building is a five-minute walk from the Rayburn House 
Office Building, far from the path beaten by tourists. But many who work there 
find the space convenient and practical. Some fear that closing the building 
may throw office structures into disarray, spreading departments among several 
floors in a less spacious building. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office sits near the top of the building on the sixth 
floor. "Having the CBO on one floor has allowed us to operate much more 
effectively than if it was on separate floors," said CBO Director Robert D. 
Reischauer. "People run into each other, and know each other by first names." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ford building was constructed in 1939, designed originally to hold the 
FBI's fingerprint division. The concrete floors, which can hold up to 250 
pounds per square foot, were created to accommodate heavy file cabinets. The 
building began a long renovation process when the House took it over in the 
mid-1970s. To date, renovations have totaled $30 million, including a new 
fiber-optic telecommunications system. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, the O'Neill building is not as beefy. Erected as a hotel in 1947 , 
it was designed with a maximum floor load of only 40 pounds per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 File cabinets higher than two drawers are not permitted. However, one staff 
member of the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment confessed "everyone 
violates that." 
</P>
<P>
 As another cost-cutting measure, the Republicans are looking into terminating 
the lease of one of its warehouses. The House presently leases the old 
Washington Star newspaper warehouse, which costs taxpayers about $215,000 per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The other storage space is the P Street Warehouse, which costs $504,000 per 
year. Franks said old materials in both warehouses are piling up. He points, as 
an example, to the 25,900 copies of the 1988 Agricultural Yearbook sitting in 
storage, unclaimed.

POLITICS; NEW GOVERNOR MAKING WAVES IN HONOLULU; BEN CAYETANO'S CABINET 
APPOINTMENTS HAVE ALREADY RUFFLED FEATHERS. HIS STYLE GIVES FITS TO THE 
ESTABLISHMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ben Cayetano remembers standing on the sidewalk, peering into campaign 
headquarters as his candidate, the lanky Jack Burns, leaped on a table to 
celebrate his election as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1962, after Cayetano had cast his first vote. Born in Hawaii, the 
son of an immigrant waiter from the Philippines, he was working in a dead-end 
job after nearly flunking out of high school. "In those days," he recalls, "I 
never met a Caucasian who wasn't a boss." He could not imagine that one day it 
would be his turn to leap on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawaii has just handed the reins to the feisty Cayetano, the nation's 
first Filipino American governor, and to Lt. Gov. Mazie Hirono, who immigrated 
from Japan at age 7. Both were raised by single parents and had tough 
childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mazie and I have come a long way," Cayetano, 55, said in an interview. "It 
shows that there are enough people in this state who are still committed to the 
American dream, to equal opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Their inauguration earlier this month runs counter to the surge of 
anti-immigrant sentiment on the U.S. mainland, as well as the recent tendency 
to elect Republicans. Cayetano is the latest in an unbroken chain of Democratic 
governors in Hawaii stretching back to Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 He has made his name, however, as a dissident Democrat, and his election was 
no sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
 After two terms as lieutenant governor, Cayetano trailed Republican Patricia 
Saiki badly in early polls, and also faced a strong challenge from longtime 
Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi, a populist who formed his own party to run for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, buoyed by mainstream Democratic and near-universal union backing, 
Cayetano won with 37% of the vote. The sizable vote for the other candidates 
reflects dissatisfaction with state government, which has been criticized for 
overspending and cronyism. Cayetano says voters are saying "shape up or ship 
out," and he promises to shake things up. 
</P>
<P>
 His background suggests that he could do just that. As a teen-ager, he was not 
afraid to jump into fights. As a state legislator, some called him combative. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a legislator with an attitude, and he may well end up being a governor 
with an attitude," said Dan Boylan, a political columnist and history professor 
at the University of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may hold a lot of people accountable who have never been held accountable 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Cayetano lined up with a group of dissident senators who "caused the 
Establishment fits and were constantly raising hell," notes Boylan. In a "go 
along, get along" society, Cayetano pushed his way up by speaking out and 
challenging the status quo. How that will play as governor is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to be an occasionally effective advocate," said Jared Jossem, 
who recently stepped down as chairman of the state Republican Party. "It's 
another to be able to pull diverse points of view together to develop a working 
consensus. A lot of people are waiting to see whether he has the leadership 
skills to accomplish that." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Cayetano's Cabinet appointments have ruffled feathers. He shocked the 
business Establishment by choosing an environmental activist to head the 
Department of Land and Natural Resources. He bypassed the unions when he 
selected a corporate lawyer with no labor background to head the Department of 
Labor and Industrial Relations. He picked an independent attorney general with 
no political ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Cayetano says he wants to shift gears on tourism as well, pushing to diversify 
the economy rather than build hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Cayetano and his wife, Lorraine, struck out for Los Angeles in 1963 with two 
children and no jobs. They worked his way through UCLA and Loyola Law School. 
Cayetano graduated with honors in 1971. He won election to the Statehouse in 
1974, and has not lost an election since. 
</P>
<P>
 Cayetano's "damn-the-torpedoes" approach showed during his tenure as 
lieutenant governor, when he hammered through the bureaucracy to create the 
state's After-School Plus (A+) program within six months. It now provides care 
after school for 27,000 elementary students who otherwise would be latchkey 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Toguchi, then-school superintendent and now the governor's chief of 
staff, says he had advised Cayetano to start with a pilot program and go slow, 
but was rebuffed. "If he had gone the traditional route, it probably would 
still be a pilot project," he said.

BOATLOAD OF KURDISH, AFGHAN REFUGEES WILL BE RETURNED TO LATVIA

 About 150 Kurdish and Afghan refugees will be returned to Latvia after their 
boat ran aground on the way to Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat was heading from Latvia to Sweden when it ran aground Saturday near 
Saaremaa Island off the coast of Estonia, a former Soviet republic, the 
Itar-Tass news agency reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The borders of the former Soviet Union remain porous three years after the 
Communist empire's collapse. Many refugees from Asia, Africa and the Middle 
East illegally enter the former republics in hopes of later making it to the 
West.

COPTER PILOT STILL IN NORTH KOREAN HANDS; U.S. SEEKS HIGH-LEVEL TALKS; ASIA: 
ADMINISTRATION EARLIER EXPRESSED REGRET FOR VIOLATING AIRSPACE. WASHINGTON TO 
REASSESS SITUATION TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Christmas Day came and went in North Korea with Chief Warrant Officer Bobby 
Hall still in captivity and the Clinton Administration seeking a high-level 
meeting today with North Korean military officers before deciding whether to 
increase American pressure to gain the downed aviator's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 With few attractive alternatives available to it eight days after Hall's 
helicopter was shot down three miles into North Korean territory, the 
Administration deliberately took a low-key approach Sunday as it sought a 
response from Pyongyang to a letter delivered over the weekend to North Korean 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, the United States expressed regret for the incident and 
attributed the intrusion to a navigation error. 
</P>
<P>
 But, a senior Administration official suggested, the passage of the holiday 
with no movement by the North Koreans would put more pressure on Washington to 
up the ante. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Defense William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, conferred Saturday evening, but no meetings were 
held in Washington on Sunday, the senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that, if there is no sign of progress by this morning -- the end of 
the business day in Korea -- the Administration will probably reassess the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Monday, we'll have to decide," he said, while adding that no meetings were 
scheduled and no specific steps had been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Washington expressed guarded hopes that the North Korean military 
would dispatch a ranking officer to meet with a senior U.S. military officer in 
Panmunjom, the truce village between North and South Korea, and present an 
official response to the apologetic letter, written by Gen. Gary E. Luck, 
supreme commander of the 37,000 U.S. troops in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Sunday afternoon, officials in Washington had no word from U.S. 
officials in Seoul on whether such a meeting would take place. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States had made clear that it wanted Hall released by Christmas, 
and the North Koreans now may feel free to release the downed flier without 
appearing to give in to an informal but symbolically important American 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials had hoped that the three-paragraph letter, delivered during a 
low-level military meeting Sunday in Panmunjom, would break the stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall and his co-pilot, David Hilemon, were shot down Dec. 17 when their OH-58 
reconnaissance helicopter, which U.S. officials say was unarmed, strayed across 
the demilitarized zone. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have said that heavy snow, which obscured navigational signs 
and other landmarks on the ground, may have disoriented the pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has said the helicopter was on a training mission; North 
Korea has said it was on a spying mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilemon's body was turned over to American officials Thursday. Nothing has 
been heard from Hall, believed to be at a North Korean military base. But North 
Korean officials have said he is in good health. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall is from Brooksville, Fla., where local residents have decorated trees 
with yellow ribbons to call for his safe and speedy return.

 Fights broke out among 1,500 children waiting for refreshments at a Christmas 
Day party thrown by Jean-Bertrand Aristide at the Presidential Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 The children grew restless as they waited for the president, who was scheduled 
to greet them at 3 p.m. but didn't emerge from the palace until 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide appeared at the top of the palace steps and spoke briefly using a 
microphone before returning inside. 
</P>
<P>
 A band played Haitian Christmas music and Prime Minister Smarck Michel and 
others handed out candy, cake, snow cones and fruit-juice packets. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted a melee. The children grabbed the snacks and fought over pieces 
of ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of other hungry youngsters and adults who had gathered outside the 
palace gates began screaming. As U.S. troops stood guard, Michel handed snacks 
through the bars to hundreds of grasping hands. 
</P>
<P>
 After the frenzy, adult chaperons tried to regroup children in the dark, aided 
by U.S. Army floodlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials gave no explanation for Aristide's delay.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's Cabinet, struggling with a 3-year-old recession, approved a 1995 
budget Sunday that would reduce spending for the first time in 40 years while 
expanding public works and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget, which needs Parliament's approval, totals $710 billion for the 
fiscal year starting April 1, down almost 3% from the fiscal 1994 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be the first decline from year-earlier spending since a cut of 0.8% 
in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 Parliament is expected to convene in mid-January to consider the budget.

DISGRACED FORMER PREMIER IS BACK IN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Noboru Takeshita, the former Japanese prime minister, admits he has no grand 
world vision. But his encyclopedic knowledge may count for more in Japan's 
political world. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeshita has memorized who represents every political district in Japan. He 
can recite the birthdays and phone numbers of far-flung contacts. He knows 
which academic cliques the leading bureaucrats belong to and when they entered 
Japan's ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 Such strategic attention to detail -- along with a reputation for keeping 
promises, listening well and shunning political showmanship -- helps explain 
why Takeshita is regarded as the current government's single most influential 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Takeshita, according to Japanese news reports, who masterminded the LDP 
return to power in June by forming a startling coalition with the party's 
historical rivals, the Socialists, and with the New Party Harbinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Takeshita resigned the premiership in disgrace over the Recruit Co. 
bribery scandal in 1989, the Liberal Democrat has more than rebounded. Today, 
eclipsing more visionary and forceful politicians such as Ichiro Ozawa of the 
New Frontier Party, Takeshita represents classic Japanese-style leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Takeshita's style, using consensus and the strength in numbers of his 
political faction, is better suited to Japan, and his successes last longer," 
said Tomoaki Iwai, a political science professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeshita, asked in a written interview to compare his leadership style to 
that of American politicians, responded in a characteristically soft manner: "I 
wonder if it isn't a fundamental thing for politicians in a democracy to 
communicate their ideas to as many people as possible and obtain their 
understanding. In that sense, I think attentiveness to people and building 
consensus are necessary things, not only for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Such fuzzy phrasing is a Takeshita hallmark. He once confessed, "I know that 
people say of me: 'His words are clear, his meaning unclear.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also one element of his success. "Everyone who talks to him comes 
away thinking he agrees with them," said one political reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 When Takeshita was anointed prime minister in 1987 to succeed the dynamic 
Yasuhiro Nakasone, he drew withering press. People picked at his bland 
personality and parochial mind-set. His grand political platform -- "The 
Japanese Archipelago Hometown Theory" -- never quite made a splash. 
</P>
<P>
 But after one year, the reviews had reversed. Takeshita opened Japanese 
markets for beef, oranges and construction. He raised Japan's financial 
contributions for American troops stationed here. He sealed a pact to supply 
more technological information to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 His actions wiped the slate clean of all outstanding U.S.-Japan issues for the 
first time in memory, according to then-Ambassador Mike Mansfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestically, Takeshita's greatest triumph was achieving what Nakasone had 
failed to do: break through enormous public opposition and introduce a 
consumption tax in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeshita, whose father was a sake brewer, was born in 1924 and, after a stint 
in the army, graduated from Waseda University. He was drawn to politics in 
college during his nation's postwar turmoil and helped organize young former 
soldiers to participate in the newfound democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951, at age 27, he was elected to the Shimane Prefectural Assembly, and he 
moved on to Parliament seven years later. He held the posts of chief Cabinet 
secretary, finance minister and construction minister before winning the 
premiership in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 A mainstream conservative, Takeshita quickly established himself as a master 
of the human relationship. He forged ties with the Socialists -- one reason he 
was able to pull off the recent power grab with them. He is known to endear 
himself to bureaucrats by finding them post-retirement jobs. He even builds 
ties through marriage: His daughter married former political don Shin 
Kanemaru's son. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with Nikkei Business magazine, Takeshita said his 
political style was forged by history -- by his coming of age when his nation 
was forced to throw out its values and adjust to foreign democratic ones. 
"Although we lack a grand picture of the world, we can adjust to reality 
because we survived in the middle of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his style may be more fitting to today's post-Cold War world. "Rather 
than tell people 'Follow me,' the leadership of the new era is to find rough 
consensus among nations and people," he said.

JAPAN'S MEDIA BLOW A CLARION FOR CHANGE; JOURNALISM: REPORTERS AND EDITORS WERE 
ONCE DERIDED AS ESTABLISHMENT MOUTHPIECES. NOW THEY TAKE ON TABOOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month, 10 million readers of Japan's largest newspaper woke up to 
shocking headlines: The Yomiuri Shimbun was breaking a 50-year taboo and urging 
a revision of the nation's pacifist constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, viewers of TV Asahi's top-rated political talk show watched host 
Soichiro Tahara goad a finance bureaucrat and Liberal Democratic politician 
into verbal fireworks over who should run Japan -- an exchange unprecedented on 
live television. 
</P>
<P>
 And before that, readers of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun saw the underside of 
Japan's bureaucracy and how it effectively controls everything from prices to 
market access, in the mass media's first extensive look at the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on? Long criticized as mere mouthpieces for the Establishment, 
Japan's media are singing their own tunes. They are emerging, analysts say, as 
Japan's loudest voice for change. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the end of the Cold War liberated Japan's politicians to form new 
alliances regardless of past ideological stripes, journalists say they've also 
been freed to take on taboos. Attacking the Establishment was one of them: They 
no longer had to worry that aggressive reporting would bring down the Liberal 
Democratic Party and usher in a Soviet-aligned Socialist government. 
</P>
<P>
 The liberal Asahi Shimbun led the charge. Last year, it broke a series of 
stories on political corruption in the construction industry. The stories 
followed earlier exclusives on the Recruit Co. bribery scandal and helped 
create a public revulsion toward the LDP that eventually led to its loss of 
power the summer before last. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Tahara had started "Sunday Project," the nation's first political 
news show, on Asahi's affiliated television network. An intense man with the 
pit-bull personality of American newscaster Sam Donaldson, Tahara says Japanese 
politicians "needed no words" during the Cold War because they merely followed 
the American line. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Cold War, he said, they had to learn to articulate their own 
ideas -- the main reason he decided to start the show. 
</P>
<P>
 TV Asahi was so aggressive that executive Sadayoshi Tsubaki resigned for 
inviting suspicions that he actively encouraged anti-LDP reporting. The company 
subsequently cleared him but still accepted his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end of the political spectrum, the conservative Yomiuri set off a 
storm by calling for an end to the constitutional ban on military forces -- 
although it reaffirmed their use for defensive purposes only. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bureaucrats don't want to change anything, and politicians don't know what to 
do," said one senior Yomiuri editor. "Therefore, the only ones urging people to 
think about this taboo are the mass media." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nihon Keizai series on bureaucrats won the top prize in Japan's National 
Press Club awards this year. The work reflected the newspaper's feeling that, 
perhaps, bureaucrats had grown too strong, said Kenji Nagano, who headed the 
project and now is deputy editor for Nikkei Business magazine. They also felt 
bureaucrats were impeding Japan from introducing a clearer, more open market in 
line with global standards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of Japan's "bubble economy" -- a period in which everything the 
Japanese touched seemed to make them richer and more powerful -- was changing 
industry, and the Cold War's end was transforming politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only place not changing was the bureaucracy," Nagano said. 
</P>
<P>
 He confessed that the series provoked sharp criticism, with some asserting 
that the media ought to investigate themselves as a fourth element -- along 
with politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen -- of Japan's conspiratorial 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
 But now they are beginning to do even that. A new book by Nikkei journalist 
Yasuhiro Tase attacks himself and his colleagues for protecting the interests 
of political sources over the public good. The book, "Sin and Punishment of 
Political Journalism," ran through eight printings in three months after it hit 
the stores in March.

LATIN AMERICAN ECONOMIES FLOURISHING, ACCORDING TO U.N. REPORT; ECONOMICS: FOR 
FOURTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR, GROWTH REACHES 3% IN THE REGION AND IMPORTS SURGE BY 
15%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With steady economic growth and reduced inflation in 1994, Latin America 
enhanced its significance as a flourishing market for foreign goods and 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 An annual report issued here this week by the U.N. Economic Commission for 
Latin America and the Caribbean said the region's economies grew by an average 
of 3.7% in 1994, while its imports surged by 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for 
International Economics, said the report reinforces upbeat assessments of Latin 
America's increasing economic importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be a dynamic region in the next decade and beyond, so it's an 
interesting region to ensure that the U.S. has the best possible terms of 
trade," Cline said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recent Summit of the Americas in Miami, President Clinton and 33 other 
leaders agreed to complete negotiations for a hemispheric free trade area by 
the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the fourth consecutive year that Latin American economic growth 
reached 3% and the 1994 rate was the highest of the four. Total growth in the 
four years was 14%, more than in the previous 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The countries with the highest 1994 growth rates were Peru with 11%, Guyana 
with 8% and Argentina with 6%, according to preliminary estimates by the U.N. 
agency. It estimated growth of 3% for Mexico and 4.5% for Brazil, the region's 
two biggest countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The economies of three countries contracted: Haiti by 11%, Venezuela by 4% and 
Honduras by 1.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 No 1994 figure was available for Cuba's economy, which shrank by 10% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Latin America's 1994 inflation rate -- excluding Brazil -- was an estimated 
16%, down from 19% in 1993 and 49% in 1991. And though Brazilian inflation 
exploded at 30% to 50% a month in the first half of 1994, it subsided to 
monthly rates of 2% to 3% after a new stabilization plan took effect in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Latin American exports grew by 14% in 1994, partly because world prices for 
major export commodities rose but also because the region's exporters have 
learned to compete more efficiently on world markets, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last eight to 10 years, Latin America has made a great effort to 
become more competitive internationally," said Gert Rosenthal, executive 
secretary of the U.N. agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's exports in 1994 were worth an estimated $152.8 billion, nearly 
double the 1986 value. 
</P>
<P>
 Imports grew to $171 billion this year from $59.7 billion in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of Latin America's imports come from the United States; U.S. exports 
to the region grew by 63% between 1989 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal said an important part of Latin American imports were capital goods, 
a sign of increased investment to improve production capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investment capital, loans and revenue from bond sales continued to 
flow into Latin America in 1994. The net increase in foreign capital of $57 
billion was below the 1993 net of $65 billion -- but 10 times more than in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Latin American foreign debt increased in 1994 by almost 6% to 
$534 billion, due largely to bond sales, Rosenthal observed that export growth 
makes the debt level manageable for most countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Exports were the main motor of economic growth "in a context characterized by 
increasing price stability, a firm grip on economic policy, and abundant 
foreign capital," the U.N. agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the growth, unemployment has increased in many countries. In rapidly 
growing Argentina, for example, urban unemployment has grown to 11.2% from 9.6% 
in 1993 and 5.6% in 1986. "It is evident that, in general, growth rates under 
4% in Latin America and the Caribbean are not high enough to allow major 
inroads in the battle against poverty or to prevent unemployment and 
underemployment from remaining unacceptably high," the U.N. report said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; CITRON LAWYER SAYS COUNTY MUST PAY BILL; 
LIABILITY: ATTORNEY SAYS OFFICIALS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EX-TREASURER'S LEGAL 
COSTS. IN A STATEMENT, CITRON SAYS HE FEELS 'TOTALLY BETRAYED' BY THE 
SUPERVISORS AND ADMINISTRATORS.

<P>
 Orange County is required to pay for Robert L. Citron's defense in connection 
with the county's investment debacle, and efforts to make him shoulder such 
expenses are politically motivated, his attorney said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wiechert -- who is defending Citron in several class-action lawsuits as 
well as a host of governmental investigations -- said he agreed Friday to 
extend the deadline for the county to decide whether to pay for Citron's 
defense only to spare his client the pain of hearing more bad news just before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wiechert said that by the new deadline, Jan. 5, he will prove that 
Orange County must provide Citron's defense because the accusations concern 
activities the longtime treasurer-tax collector performed as part of his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob is a man of limited means who's led a modest lifestyle. The defense of 
these actions would devour his entire life savings," said Wiechert, a former 
federal prosecutor who earns $240 an hour. "(He's) just totally devastated. And 
who wouldn't be? How many millions of dollars did he generate for them over the 
years? He's just sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron resigned the post he had held for 24 years just before Orange County 
became the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy Dec. 6. 
On Sunday, he told Wiechert he was too depressed to attend Christmas dinner at 
Wiechert's Capistrano Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released by Wiechert, Citron said: "During my years of public 
service for the county of Orange, I have worked closely, honestly and 
diligently with the Board of Supervisors and the county administration. I feel 
totally betrayed by the board and their administrators, who have done a 
complete about-face after all these years. They were certainly supportive when 
the county's investments were yielding a substantial return." 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires the county to defend Citron in lawsuits stemming from 
things he did in the "course and scope" of his job, unless he is convicted of 
fraud or if paying for his defense would create a conflict of interest for the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has 20 days to respond to Citron's request, made earlier this 
month, for payment of his legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiechert said that County Counsel Terry C. Andrus called him late Friday 
afternoon and said he had prepared a letter rejecting Citron's request but that 
he would prefer not to rush to a decision. The two men agreed to consider 
Wiechert's formal, written request for payment -- dated Dec. 16 -- rather than 
Citron's verbal request of Dec. 4, as a way to give both sides more time to 
hash things out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my hope that reasonable minds would prevail because I don't think 
there's any reasonable person who could believe that they don't owe Bob a 
defense," Wiechert said Sunday. "It's a political decision . . . not a decision 
based in fact or law. . . . Some supervisor, or someone in the county counsel's 
office, believes the public would not support paying for Bob's defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus said Sunday the rejection letter he prepared focused on the conflict of 
interest question, and mentioned nothing about fraud, misrepresentation or 
deception. But sources said those issues were discussed during the drafting of 
the letter, which was not sent because the deadline was extended. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus added that he felt "no political pressure" and that the Board of 
Supervisors has not made a decision on whether to pay Wiechert. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors reached at home on Christmas Day admitted that agreeing to pay for 
Citron's attorney would be politically unpopular, but said they would make 
their decision based on the facts and the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'm very upset about it. I do not want to spend taxpayer money to 
defend him. I'm sick to my stomach for the families that are having a miserable 
Christmas because of this man," said Jim Silva, who will join the board in 
January. "But if that's the law, I'll stand by the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he planned to rely on Andrus' advice in 
making the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who will step down in January, said: "What we 
ought to do is what's right. I hope we're not going to do anything because the 
press (or the public) might object." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who will take Riley's place on 
the board, also acknowledged that the decision "has tremendous political 
implications." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is always the case, where the public is outraged by a particular 
incident or individual and then under the provisions of the law there is a 
requirement that the public entity pay for the legal costs," Bergeson said. 
"Everything is political . . . but the decision should be made on substantive 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 Other supervisors could not be reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 While most people involved in the case took the holiday off, the Orange County 
Employees Assn. convened an emergency board meeting Sunday afternoon and voted 
to pursue immediate legal action against the county in response to last week's 
announcement of widespread budget cuts and probable layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 General manager John H. Sawyer said the association, which represents 11,000 
workers, would file a lawsuit "as soon as our attorneys can sort out the legal 
remedies available." The association's board is scheduled to meet again today 
at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the action of the Board of Supervisors was pretty disastrous," 
Sawyer said. "A lot of hostility is developing among our members toward the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's investment portfolio plunged at least $2.02 billion -- 27% -- in 
value this year, and Citron faces legal challenges from several directions. He 
is one of several county employees subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, targeted for investigation by the Orange County district attorney's 
office, and named in several lawsuits by bondholders who say they were deceived 
about the potential risk of the investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiechert was angered at the potential singling out of his client. "Why don't 
you go ask the supervisors who's paying their legal bills? Ask the auditors. 
Ask the lawyers who approved the disclosure statements" on the investments, 
Wiechert said. "If the county decides to defend certain individuals and not 
Bob, they're selectively discriminating against him." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus said no decisions have been made about whether to pay for the defense 
of other county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wiechert and Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, agreed that 
state law outlines a higher obligation for the county to defend Citron in 
lawsuits than in the SEC probe. 
</P>
<P>
 That the county has filed for bankruptcy protection makes the situation even 
more complicated, Bennett said. If the county rejects Citron's request, but a 
court finds that the county is required to pay, Citron may have to line up 
behind other creditors staking a claim in the complex bankruptcy proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the county is determined to be liable under state law, (Citron's) 
claim may well be subordinated to the claims of other creditors," Bennett said. 
"As is true with many parts of this case, there are difficult and complex 
issues involved here. We are still in the process of gathering facts and 
performing the required analysis."

 As they respond to an unfolding financial crisis, city and school district 
leaders say they face a dilemma: How to deal swiftly and soberly with the 
situation without unduly alarming the public. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a balancing act that leaders say they must perform at public meetings, 
in their offices as they field phone calls from residents, and even at the 
supermarket as neighbors approach them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officials have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, wary of frightening 
residents even when the financial picture appears grim. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Santa Ana school board meeting in which officials announced that the bond 
debacle might mean larger classes, trustee Audrey Yamagata-Noji warned against 
publicizing a "hit list" of potential cutbacks until the district's losses are 
clear. "People freak out, and I don't blame them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials insist that the financial crisis must be met with tough 
talk and austere planning, even though its full effects probably won't be known 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, school board member Hank Adler suggested that officials immediately 
draw up a list of deep cutbacks, declaring that "the time for denial is over." 
Another board member then accused Adler of needlessly frightening residents and 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hank's approach is where you draw out the worst-case scenario in very large 
terms," board member Mike Regele said. "The scenario I want to follow is a 
little more conservative and incremental. Certainly we need to be thinking 
about worst-case scenarios, but we need to be careful of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials' efforts to address the crisis in any decisive way have been 
complicated by its fluid nature. With high-level meetings occurring 
continually, they said, it is often difficult to speak with certainty about 
what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, concern about the collapsed fund pool is more intense in 
cities with large investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, with $209 million in the pool, has held several emergency council 
meetings over the last month. The city has gone from twice-monthly meetings to 
weekly meetings. In Cypress, with only about $5 million in the pool, the crisis 
has not emerged as a major issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The county announced two weeks ago that the fund has lost about 27% of its 
value over the last year. But many local officials refuse to concede that their 
agencies will suffer any long-term losses, insisting instead that they are due 
back every penny of their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, cities and school districts have responded to the crisis by delaying 
capital projects, imposing hiring freezes and clamping down on spending. But 
many officials fear that the worst is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't have the full story. That makes it difficult," said Paula 
Werner, Irvine's mayor pro tem. "For now, I don't want to allude to cuts. . . . 
I want to know all the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they are cautious in part to spare city and school employees 
any needless panic. Many employees have experienced several rounds of belt 
tightening and layoffs as agencies adjusted to the statewide economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone through this recession. Restructuring government has changed 
people's lives," Werner said. "Staff morale is low. People are nervous to begin 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point is Cathy Ann Brooks, a newly elected trustee for the 
Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District. She proposed last week that an 
independent committee of residents be formed to advise the board on bond 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you believe in the tooth fairy, there is going to come a time when 
there will be cuts," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the board disagreed, saying that there may be no need for cuts. The 
district has more than $53 million in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar debate is going on in the Irvine Unified School District, with $102 
million frozen in the fund, the most of any Orange County school system. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler, a newly elected board member, said it is time for the district to act. 
He urged preparation for a $30-million loss and called on school board members 
to eliminate their $400-a-month stipends. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this situation, my philosophy is: Prepare for the worst and hope for the 
best," said Adler, an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 But a veteran board member said Adler is moving too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we really did have, as Mr. Adler suggested, a $30-million problem, we are 
bankrupt," Regele said. "It's not possible to cut $30 million out of a 
$100-million budget. But I don't believe that is the magnitude of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Adler's comment also could send the wrong message about how the board is 
responding to the crisis, Regele said. "The implication was made that we were 
not embracing the magnitude of the problem and we are not moving. That simply 
is not true," he said. "But we also need to get a realistic assessment of it."

<P>
 Another attempt to launch the first manned balloon flight around the world is 
scheduled Thursday, project organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earthwinds Hilton crew plans to begin preparations Tuesday for a Thursday 
morning launch from Reno Stead Airfield."We really have high hopes and 
confidence we're going to go a long ways," said crew member Dave Melton. 
</P>
<P>
 Fickle weather thwarted a Dec. 16 attempt just 18 hours before the scheduled 
liftoff. It marked the fourth time that weather has played a part in five 
failed efforts to achieve the most elusive goal in aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 The unique two-balloon craft requires a virtually windless day with no chance 
of precipitation just to get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthwinds has struggled for 2 1/2 years to find the perfect launch window 
between November and February when wind currents around the jet stream are 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 An apparently successful liftoff Jan. 12 ended seven hours and 200 miles later 
when the three-man crew ditched in a cotton field near Fresno.

CLINTON WILL BE REELECTED, MITCHELL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Retiring Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) predicted Sunday 
that President Clinton will be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm a minority, but I believe President Clinton will be reelected," 
Mitchell said on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," which was recorded Wednesday 
because of the Christmas holiday.Public opinion polls show the President's 
popularity lagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell will be replaced by Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), whose Republicans won a 
majority on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he believes that Texas billionaire Ross Perot will make another 
bid for the presidency in 1996, ultimately aiding Clinton. Perot captured 19% 
of the vote in 1992, and Clinton won the election with 43% to incumbent 
President George Bush's 38%. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said one of Clinton's difficulties now is that he has no particular 
opponent and is being measured against voters' abstract ideals of the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 When an opponent is nominated by the Republicans, Mitchell said, "You'll see a 
person against a person, and in that context I think Bill Clinton will win." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul E. Tsongas, among Clinton's 1992 primary opponents, is promoting the idea 
of a third party, led by the independent candidacy of Colin L. Powell, former 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell and departing House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), also appearing 
on "Meet the Press," said Powell could be a tough rival for Clinton.

AGENTS ARREST MAN FOUND SCALING WHITE HOUSE FENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unarmed man found clinging to a fence outside the White House on Christmas 
morning was taken into custody and questioned by the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and his family were inside the White House at the time, but 
were never in any danger in the latest attempt to breach security at the 
presidential residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody grabbed him hanging from the fence," a spokesman for the Secret 
Service said. "He was not armed and we don't know what he was up to." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the man scaled the spiked, iron fence in the rainy, 50-degree 
weather about 11 a.m. and was about to step over the top when he was surrounded 
by uniformed Secret Service police, who drew their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Secret Service said Lolanda Bello, 19, was charged with unlawful entry and 
making threats after allegedly arguing with police. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred shortly after the Clintons had returned to the White 
House after attending Christmas services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Secret Service handles about half a dozen cases of "fence-hoppers" trying 
to get onto the White House grounds each year, but the issue is particularly 
sensitive now because of a rash of recent incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a U.S. Park Police officer shot and killed a homeless man, when he 
brandished a large hunting knife in front of the White House and refused to 
surrender it to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Also last week, a man was arrested after claiming there was a bomb in his car; 
another was arrested and charged with carrying an unregistered firearm, and a 
man was arrested after he slipped onto the grounds through a gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, at least four bullets fired from a considerable distance 
reached the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 29, Francisco Martin Duran, 26, of Colorado was arrested and charged 
with firing more than two dozen bullets from a semiautomatic rifle at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks earlier, Frank Eugene Corder, 38, of Perry Point, Md., died when he 
crashed a small plane on the South Lawn of the White House.

CLINTONS GO TO CHURCH, HAVE WHITE HOUSE FAMILY GATHERING

<P>
 President Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, celebrated 
Christmas on Sunday by singing "Joy to the World" at Foundry United Methodist 
Church. The service also included a baptism and the lighting of a Christmas 
candle. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Marie Zgorski, daughter of Gary and Suzy Zgorski of Glassboro, N.J., 
will be able to boast that the President of the United States was at her 
baptism. 
</P>
<P>
 After church, the Clintons found their cat, Socks, sitting on a metal reindeer 
outside the White House, where the family was spending the rest of the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 They were joined for the holiday by the First Lady's mother, Dorothy Rodham; 
Clinton's stepfather, Richard Kelley, and Clinton's brother, Roger, his wife 
and their infant son. 
</P>
<P>
 By family tradition, Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea baked chocolate chip cookies on 
Christmas Eve, White House spokeswoman Dawn Alexander said, and they decorated 
the tree in the mansion's Yellow Room. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton completed his Christmas shopping Saturday during an outing that 
included a stop at a bookstore specializing in mysteries, and he telephoned 10 
members of the military on duty overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons also taped a Christmas message to the nation, saluting servicemen 
and women for their work "to a make the world a safer place for all of us."

STUDY LINKS GENETICS, MALE HOMOSEXUALITY; RESEARCH: CANADIAN SCIENTISTS SAY GAY 
MEN HAVE MORE RIDGES IN FINGERPRINTS. IT BOLSTERS THE THEORY THAT SEXUAL 
ORIENTATION IS DETERMINED BEFORE BIRTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Canadian researchers have found a link between the number of ridges in 
fingerprints and male homosexuality, adding to the theory that sexual 
orientation is determined before birth. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers, working at the University of Western Ontario, compared the 
number of tiny ridges on the fingertips of 66 homosexual men with the 
fingerprint patterns of 182 heterosexual men. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of the gay men showed more ridges on their left hands than their 
right, while only 14% of the heterosexual men showed the same pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Most men and women have more ridges in the fingerprints of their right hands. 
Fingerprints are completely developed in human fetuses by about the 16th week 
after conception and are largely genetically determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "This certainly suggests sexual orientation is somehow determined by prenatal 
events," said researcher Doreen Kimura. 
</P>
<P>
 The study appears in the December issue of Behavioral Neuroscience. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we found is a statistically significant difference between groups of 
heterosexual and homosexual men," Kimura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Gorski, a UCLA neurobiologist who has done extensive research on sexual 
differentiation, called the study "another suggestion that there's a biological 
component to sexuality." But he said he had some trouble with making the 
connection between ridges on fingers and sexual orientation.

FUNDS SOUGHT FOR DENVER AIRPORT PROBE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Colorado district attorney's office plans to seek $200,000 more to fund a 
growing investigation into shoddy construction and fraud at the city's new 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-of-the art airport was to open in October, 1993, but has been 
plagued by delays.The new target date is Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 For four months, prosecutors have investigated a wide range of allegations, 
including claims that contractors substituted sand or other cheap materials for 
some of the cement in concrete formulas. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Bill Ritter wants to hire another prosecutor, a financial analyst 
and other support staff to pursue the investigation, which he expects to reach 
into 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The $200,000 Ritter is seeking in his 1995 budget would come from the city's 
general operating fund, with the expectation that airport revenue would 
reimburse the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Briggs Gamblin, press secretary to Mayor Wellington Webb, said the mayor 
supports the request.

 The $4.2-billion Denver International Airport is supposed to replace Stapleton

PENTAGON SECRETLY BUYS PARTS OF RUSSIAN DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A huge Russian transport plane that mysteriously landed at Huntsville 
International Airport in Alabama last week carried an unusual cargo, government 
and industry sources said: parts of an advanced Russian air defense system that 
had been purchased by the Pentagon in a secret deal brokered by a Virginia 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 At the nearby Redstone Arsenal and other military facilities, technicians plan 
to assemble the system and test its ability to spot U.S. planes and 
missiles.That will help in the design of new U.S. air defense systems and of 
new aircraft meant to be able to evade Russian-built radar. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50-million deal that brought the system, known as the SA-10, to the 
United States is the latest chapter in an unusual, years-old intelligence 
operation that has outlasted the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 It was brokered by BDM International Inc. of McLean, Va., an information 
technology firm. The company scouts out and buys Russian weapons that the CIA 
and the Pentagon have for years wanted to test. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition among such companies has become more intense, industry and 
military sources said, as Russia and other former Soviet republics have slid 
into economic decline, and as more former Communist officials jump at the 
chance to sell their nations' high-tech equipment to foreign bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 The shipment that was headed for the Army's Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville was 
one of several in recent months containing high-tech components of the SA-10 
air defense network, government and industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parts -- including a truck stuffed with computers, radar and missiles -- 
will be assembled and studied to find ways the United States can improve its 
missiles, such as Raytheon's Patriot and Lockheed's Theater High-Altitude Area 
Defense missile.

ATTACKS FROM CROATIA THREATEN TRUCE, BOSNIA CHIEF SAYS; BALKANS: U.N. SEES NO 
VIOLATION BECAUSE SERBS FROM NEIGHBORING STATE ARE NOT A PARTY TO ACCORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Serbs from neighboring Croatia attacked Bosnian government troops Sunday, and 
the Bosnian president warned that a day-old truce would collapse unless the 
assaults stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations said the clashes were not violations of the truce, signed 
only by the Muslim-led government and Bosnian Serbs. But government leaders 
warned that the attacks by allies of the Bosnian Serbs could lead to wider 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those attacks don't stop, I am responsibly stating that there will be no 
cease-fire and that our army will respond on other fronts," President Alija 
Izetbegovic told state radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Croatian Serbs, who are not bound by the cease-fire brokered by former 
President Jimmy Carter, were attacking near Velika Kladusa, in the Bihac area 
in northwest Bosnia, U.N. officials reported. They were joined by Bosnian 
Muslim rebels who have been fighting the government for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In another threat to peace efforts, Serbs in western Bosnia-Herzegovina 
declared a general mobilization "because of danger of Croatian aggression," the 
Bosnian Serb news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian army soldiers have joined Bosnian Croats fighting Bosnian Serbs in 
west-central Bosnia. The Croats and the Bosnian Croatians -- allies of the 
Muslim-led Bosnian government -- are not part of the cease-fire, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Bosnia, however, was calm Christmas, a day after the cease-fire began, 
U.N. officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Alexander Ivanko said there were 73 violations by the government 
army and 13 by the Serbs, but all were assessed as "celebration firing" because 
of the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of the cease-fire lasts until Saturday and is meant to give 
time to work out a four-month truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Izetbegovic said the second phase couldn't begin until peace came to Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are warning that if there's no cease-fire, there will be no negotiations 
on the cessation of hostilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations for a lasting peace were already considered difficult because of 
disagreements over a multinational peace plan that the Serbs have repeatedly 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government has insisted the Serbs accept the peace plan before 
negotiations begin on a lasting peace. The Serbs want to start negotiating 
without accepting the international proposal.

ECONOMIC INDICATORS POINT TO O.C. GATHERING STRENGTH; COMMERCE: POSITIVE 
FORECASTS LOOK BEYOND MISERY OF JOB LOSSES IN MONTHS AHEAD DUE TO COUNTY 
BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite a year-end government financial crisis and news just four days before 
Christmas of $30 million in budget cuts and hundreds of layoffs, Orange 
County's economy is destined to expand in 1995, analysts and business leaders 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The general economic underpinnings are solid, experts say, although the coming 
months will bring misery to those who lose their jobs in the wake of the county 
government's $2.02-billion loss in the bond market and Dec. 6 bankruptcy 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will certainly be felt throughout the county in reduced services, 
especially in programs for the poor," said Anil Puri, chairman of the economics 
department at Cal State Fullerton. "But it just isn't enough to make the 
overall economy suffer a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly five years of recession, Orange County rides into 1995 on a wave 
of rising economic indicators. Taxable sales, housing construction and median 
family income are all increasing, and the latest employment figures show that 
local employers added 16,000 jobs to their payrolls from August through 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's economy benefited this year from increased foreign trade, thanks 
in part to the North American Free Trade Agreement's relaxing of rules on 
commerce with Mexico and Canada. Those gains are likely to increase, analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business in general will continue to thrive," said Larry Friend, president of 
the Irvine investment banking firm L.H. Friend, Weinress & Frankson Inc. "There 
is a lot of money out there, and while we will be held back a while, I don't 
see any long-term problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after factoring in damage from the county's financial crisis, economists 
at Cal State Fullerton, Chapman University, UCLA and First Interstate Bank 
stand by their earlier projections of slow, steady growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses blamed so far on county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's 
high-risk investment strategy, in fact, is about 10% of the $22-billion loss to 
falling housing prices in the past five years, said economist James Doti, 
president of Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 Layoffs and budget cuts could subtract as much as $100 million from taxable 
spending in Orange County next year and more than $500 million from the gross 
county product -- the value of all goods and services -- but "it's a dampening, 
not a death blow," Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1995, Doti is forecasting that employers will add 17,000 jobs to their 
payrolls; that the gross county product -- the value of all goods and services 
produced here -- will rise almost 6% to $81.9 billion; that median household 
income will increase about 2% to $55,500; and that work will begin on almost 
13,500 new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of that optimistic outlook, there are some worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Builder Larry Webb, president of Greystone Homes' South Coast division in 
Newport Beach, said his company will not move ahead with any new projects in 
Orange County until the long-term results of the bankruptcy filing become 
clearer. 
</P>
<P>
 One fear is that cities hurt by the investment losses will try to recoup money 
by raising the fees they charge developers for streets, sewers and other 
infrastructure improvements, he said. If that happens, the construction 
industry will pass the higher fees along to home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 One local developer, Irvine Apartment Communities, has already decided to 
postpone a planned $327-million debt refinancing because of uncertainty about 
how Wall Street will view Orange County investments in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect that, until this is explained, people are going to be 
apprehensive to invest in Orange County," said Philip S. Inglee, president of 
Liberty National Bank in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But Inglee said his bank still plans to open two branches next year, despite 
the county's fiscal troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 To gauge the outlook of the local business community for 1995, The Times 
Orange County spoke with leaders in various segments of the economy. Retail 
</P>
<P>
 Robert B. McKnight Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Quiksilver 
Inc., was jubilant as the holidays approached. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be a "great Christmas for my wife," he said, "because I'm 
compensated according to how well we do, and we're doing good." 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight said that the holiday shopping season has been the best in several 
years for Quiksilver, a Newport Beach maker of casual clothing and beachwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit for the year so far is up 61% to $7.1 million, he said, and sales are 
up 33.3% to $126.1 million. Even sweeter, he said, is that orders for the 
spring, which typically account for a third of annual sales, are up 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like it's going pretty good," said McKnight, a California native who 
has lived in Orange County for 20 years. Local shoppers this holiday season are 
spending freely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight said he is somewhat concerned about the county bankruptcy filing. 
"Once somebody figures out where the bottom of this thing is," he predicted, 
politicians "will try to hit everyone with a special assessment." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the long-term effect on the economy, he said, "it's like the 
earthquake. There's a trickle-down or ripple effect." Hotels 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Bodington, general manager of the 390-room Westin South Coast Plaza 
hotel in Costa Mesa, thinks economic growth for 1995 is much more than a wish. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our perspective, it is solidly underway. This year will represent the 
second-highest occupancy year ever," he said. The best was 1981, but figures 
for 1994 so far are "very, very close to that mark." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is business travel, said Bodington, who is a director of the 
Anaheim/Orange County Visitor & Convention Bureau and a 25-year veteran of the 
hotel industry. Companies spend money for travel, he said, only when they think 
the economy is on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 A fuller hotel needs a bigger staff to keep up with guests' needs, Bodington 
said, so he has been hiring room attendants recently, as well as restaurant, 
bar and banquet facility employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking forward to a continuation of the resurgence of the economy" in 
1995, he said. "We think next year will be as good as this year has been and 
even a little bit better." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the bankruptcy of the county will not affect our business in any 
way," Bodington said, although "it's just hard to know how people react to this 
kind of thing." High Technology 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Mercer, chief financial officer at Western Digital Corp. in Irvine, has 
been in Orange County for only 18 months, which affords him a different 
perspective from many of his counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Niguel resident said he finds the area to be "pretty friendly to 
business. The business community and the county have worked together in 
leadership roles." 
</P>
<P>
 The local economy, he said, seems to be "slowly building. There is a good, 
solid base in health care, and (business) start-up activity is good." 
</P>
<P>
 The county bankruptcy, he said, will have little effect on business in general 
and none at all on Western Digital, which makes computer disk drives and 
semiconductors for sale around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our industry is not dependent upon the health of Orange County. Half of our 
business comes from outside the United States," he said, "and the other half 
from all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other large companies with headquarters in Orange County, he said, 
Western Digital actually does "very little local business. If there is a major 
impact it will be on (our) employees . . . with the possibility of a tax 
raise." Real Estate 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach consultant Richard Gollis makes his living advising real estate 
developers, and right now he's telling them "not to make any sweeping 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the county's financial crisis on the ability of major land 
developers like Irvine Co. to sell bonds to finance the water, sewer and 
transportation systems is yet to be seen, Gollis said, until more information 
is available. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he said, he is advising his clients to "look at every 
possible deal as an individual deal, and examine it on its own strengths and 
weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
 He also expressed concern about the effect of the county's bankruptcy filing 
on the ability of private builders and public agencies to market bonds for 
construction of subsidized low-cost housing and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is convinced that business, especially the real estate industry, has 
the power to help resolve the situation by taking a leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are concerned about the future of the toll roads, for instance, then 
the business community needs to become involved with the banking consortium 
that is financing the toll road bonds," Gollis said. "Business needs to bolster 
investor confidence in the future of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he sees evidence that local developers have confidence in 
themselves, and because of that he is cautiously optimistic about 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the long-term trends are still in play for next year," Gollis said. 
"We still have strong job growth in the business services, medical technology 
and export services industries. We have a vibrant business economy, and there 
is a pent-up demand for housing." International Trade 
</P>
<P>
 Cecil Chee, who arranges deals with Chinese companies for American-Asian Trade 
Connection in Irvine, saw a definite increase this year in both the number of 
clients in China who want to sell their goods in the United States and in 
companies here that want to move into the Chinese market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot more positive year, and I believe 1995 is going to be better," 
said Chee, who joined American-Asian as a trader a year ago from Citibank Corp. 
in Singapore. "The whole economy is picking up." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's financial crisis is a shame, he said, but not likely to affect 
his business. In fact, he said, his company has increased its staff by 66% 
since it was founded in 1993. It has five employees now, up from three. Health 
and Fitness 
</P>
<P>
 The year ending has been a good one, and the year ahead stands to be even 
better, said Cynthia Graff, president of the medical weight control clinic 
chain Lindora Inc., which her father founded 23 years ago in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindora added three clinics and 20 employees in 1994, bringing its total to 31 
locations and 160 employees. A continued expansion is planned for 1995, said 
Graff, though, citing competitive factors, she would not be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately owned Lindora increased its revenue by 15% this year, Graff said, 
and especially toward year's end the clinics' clients seemed to be much more 
upbeat about the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grew because of aggressive marketing and because a lot of people who 
weren't spending money on new homes and cars and other big-ticket items decided 
to focus on themselves," Graff said. "For a lot of the year there still was a 
measurable sense of caution. But there has been a lot more optimism in the last 
few months." 
</P>
<P>
 The financial problems of Orange County governments "certainly can hurt 
overall confidence in the economy, if enough other municipalities around the 
country are in the same kind of trouble," Graff said. "But so far we don't 
expect much impact. It's really so complex that most people can't yet know 
exactly what it means." Temporary Employees 
</P>
<P>
 Kimco Staffing Solutions, founded in 1986 by Kim Megonigal, is ending its best 
year of the 1990s, with a 50% jump in placements. 
</P>
<P>
 Megonigal said the 10 offices of his Irvine-based company placed about 9,000 
temporary workers during the year, boosting annual revenue to $23 million from 
$14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That surge, he said, reflects the fact that companies typically add temporary 
workers at the start of a recovery until their business increases to the point 
that they can make permanent hires. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrepreneur expressed some concern about the effect of Orange County's 
bankruptcy on his business, especially if taxes rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line to my business is that, if costs go up, it's going to hurt 
us," he said. "It'll have the same effect as early in the recession. The 
question is: What is the magnitude? I'm not going to add any more overhead 
until I figure out which way we're going." 
</P>
<P>
 Megonigal said he is optimistic about the year ahead and projects that Kimco's 
revenue will grow by another 30% in 1995, "but I am much more cautious. And as 
soon as I see something happen, I'll adjust expenditures." Consulting Services 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Flamholtz is a widely published management specialist, a professor at 
UCLA's John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management and president of 
Management Systems Consulting Corp., a private firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Flamholtz, who has a number of clients in Orange County, maintains that the 
bankruptcy and related layoffs and budget cuts "could be viewed as a non-event 
for most business. It's like the 1987 stock market crash -- a lot of headlines 
and temporary disruption, but the economy went speeding on for two more years." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies he advises, Flamholtz said, "know the importance of strategic 
planning, and they will factor this in. I don't know of anyone scrambling 
around in a panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Flamholtz specializes in management training and development, his firm 
is hired by companies looking to grow. Thus his business serves as an early 
indicator of the economy, he said. He loses business before it is apparent that 
a recession is coming, and he gains clients before it is apparent that a 
recovery is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 1995 is going to be very strong," he said. "In the past year we are 
seeing the kind of business we saw in the rapid growth of 1986-1988." 
</P>
<P>
 The wild card for the economy, he said, is the Federal Reserve Board: "If the 
Fed keeps increasing interest rates, that could cool things off." Tax Advisers 
</P>
<P>
 Judee Slack still sees the ravages of the recession when she meets with her 
clients, most of which are small businesses trying to make up for losses of the 
past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifelong resident of Orange County, Slack said the past four years have been 
the roughest for small business in her experience, but the worst appears to be 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the economy is picking up, finally," said Slack, who owns her own tax 
consulting company, Slack & Associates in Westminster. "But not with the steam 
that we keep hearing the economists and politicians talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Very small businesses seem to be rebounding, she said, "but the businesses in 
the middle, with 10 to 20 employees, they're still pretty stagnant." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that people are still leery about spending money. I have clients with 
expansion ideas, but they say they're afraid to let loose of the cash they have 
saved because they are afraid of what will happen if the economy crashes 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 For those companies, Slack said, the county government's bankruptcy could 
magnify uncertainty that lingers after a five-year slump. The greatest concern 
among her clients, she said, is that local governments will impose fees on 
business to replace the lost money.

CITRON LAWYER SAYS O.C. LIABLE FOR DEFENSE COSTS; COURTS: ATTORNEY CONTENDS 
RESISTANCE IS MOTIVATED BY POLITICS. COUNTY EMPLOYEES TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION ON 
LAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's attorney said Sunday that 
Orange County is required to pay for his client's defense in connection with 
the county's investment debacle, and that efforts to stick Citron with those 
legal bills are politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wiechert -- the lawyer who is defending Citron in several class-action 
lawsuits as well as a host of governmental investigations -- said he agreed 
Friday to extend the deadline for the county to decide whether to pay for 
Citron's defense, only to spare his client the pain of hearing more bad news 
just before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 By the new deadline of Jan. 5, however, Wiechert said he will prove that 
Orange County must provide for Citron's defense because the accusations concern 
activities the longtime treasurer-tax collector performed as part of his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob is a man of limited means who's led a modest lifestyle. The defense of 
these actions would devour his entire life savings," said Wiechert, a former 
federal prosecutor who earns $240 an hour. "(He's) just totally devastated. And 
who wouldn't be? How many millions of dollars did he generate for them over the 
years? He's just sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron resigned the post he had held for 24 years just before Orange County 
became the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy Dec. 6. 
On Sunday, he told Wiechert he was too depressed to attend Christmas dinner at 
Wiechert's Capistrano Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Sunday, an equally distressed Orange County Employees Assn. held an 
emergency meeting and resolved to take immediate -- although unspecified -- 
legal action to prevent county officials from laying off workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released by Wiechert, Citron said: "During my years of public 
service for the county of Orange, I have worked closely, honestly and 
diligently with the Board of Supervisors and the county administration. I feel 
totally betrayed by the board and their administrators, who have done a 
complete about-face after all these years. They were certainly supportive when 
the county's investments were yielding a substantial return." 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires the county to defend Citron in civil lawsuits stemming from 
actions he took in the "course and scope" of his job, unless he is convicted of 
fraud or if paying for his defense would create a conflict of interest for the 
county. A conflict of interest could arise because both Citron and other county 
officials are targets of the same suits and investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has 20 days to respond to Citron's request for payment of his legal 
bills, which was made earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiechert said that County Counsel Terry A. Andrus called him late Friday 
afternoon and said he had prepared a letter rejecting Citron's request, but 
that he would prefer not to rush to a decision. The two men agreed to consider 
Wiechert's formal, written request for payment -- dated Dec. 16 -- rather than 
Citron's oral request of Dec. 4 as a way to give both sides more time to hash 
things out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my hope that reasonable minds would prevail because I don't think 
there's any reasonable person who could believe that they don't owe Bob a 
defense," Wiechert said Sunday. "It's a political decision . . . not a decision 
based in fact or law. . . . Some supervisor, or someone in the county counsel's 
office, believes the public would not support paying for Bob's defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus said Sunday that the rejection letter he prepared focused on the 
conflict-of-interest question, and mentioned nothing about fraud, 
misrepresentation or deception. Sources said all those issues were discussed 
during the drafting of the letter, which was not sent because the deadline was 
extended. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus added that he felt "no political pressure" and that the Board of 
Supervisors has not yet made a decision whether to pay Wiechert. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors, reached at home on Christmas Day, conceded that agreeing 
to pay for Citron's attorney would be politically unpopular, but said they 
would ultimately make their decision based on the facts and the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'm very upset about it. I do not want to spend taxpayer money to 
defend him. I'm sick to my stomach for the families that are having a miserable 
Christmas because of this man," said Jim Silva, who will join the board in 
January. "But if that's the law, I'll stand by the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said Sunday that he plans to rely on Andrus' 
advice in making the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who will step down in January, said: "What we 
ought to do is what's right. I hope we're not going to do anything because the 
press (or the public) might object." State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach), who will take Riley's place on the board, also acknowledged that the 
decision "has tremendous political implications." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is always the case, where the public is outraged by a particular 
incident or individual and then under the provisions of the law there is a 
requirement that the public entity pay for the legal costs," Bergeson said. 
"Everything is political . . . but the decision should be made on substantive 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 Other supervisors could not be reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 While most people involved in the case took the holiday off, the Orange County 
Employees Assn. convened an emergency board meeting Sunday afternoon and voted 
to pursue immediate legal action against the county in response to last week's 
announcement of widespread budget cuts and probable layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager John H. Sawyer said the OCEA, which represents 11,000 workers, 
would go on the offensive "as soon as our attorneys can sort out the legal 
remedies available. The OCEA board is scheduled to meet again today at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the action of the Board of Supervisors was pretty disastrous," 
Sawyer said Sunday. "A lot of hostility is developing among our members toward 
the county." 
</P>
<P>
 The investment portfolio plunged at least $2.02 billion -- 27% -- in value 
this year, and Citron faces legal challenges from several directions. He is one 
of several county employees subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, targeted for investigation by the Orange County district attorney's 
office, and named in several lawsuits by bondholders who say they were deceived 
about the potential risk of the investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiechert was angered at the potential singling out of his client. "Why don't 
you go ask the supervisors who's paying their legal bills? Ask the auditors. 
Ask the lawyers who approved the disclosure statements" on the investments, 
Wiechert suggested. "If the county decides to defend certain individuals and 
not Bob, they're selectively discriminating against him." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus said Sunday that no decisions have been made about whether to pay for 
the defense of other county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wiechert and Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, agreed that 
state law outlines a higher obligation for the county to defend Citron in the 
civil suits than in the SEC probe. 
</P>
<P>
 That the county has filed for bankruptcy protection makes the situation even 
more complicated, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the county is determined to be liable under state law, (Citron's) 
claim may well be subordinated to the claims of other creditors," Bennett said 
Sunday. "As is true with many parts of this case, there are difficult and 
complex issues involved here. We are still in the process of gathering facts 
and performing the required analysis."

VALLEY AREAS 'HOT SPOTS' FOR CAR BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite rising crime fears, only one serious offense actually went up in the 
San Fernando Valley during 1994. But it claimed more victims this year -- 
nearly 18,000 -- than any other. 
</P>
<P>
 With crooks targeting specific Valley neighborhoods, police this year report 
an increase in the number of thefts from cars -- whether parked on city 
streets, at shopping malls or in gated, underground garages. 
</P>
<P>
 In one Encino neighborhood, residents reported 238 car burglaries through 
November in a roughly 2.5-square-mile area bordered by Ventura Boulevard and 
the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the hottest spot going," said Los Angeles Police Detective Dexter 
Owens of the West Valley Division. "It is such a high-dollar area that a lot of 
criminals from outside areas come in to prey on victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Owens said the cluster of Encino apartment buildings between White Oak and 
Lindley avenues has become a special target of thieves shopping for leather 
jackets, car stereos, cellular phones or anything else of value left in autos 
tucked away in subterranean parking garages. 
</P>
<P>
 Police records show that criminals slowed the pace of attacks on people this 
year, turning their attention to cars instead. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of November, Los Angeles police had received 17,847 reports of car 
burglaries in the Valley, a 1.3% increase over the same period last year. The 
Valley was the only region in Los Angeles to experience a jump in car 
burglaries. Citywide, the rate fell 5.9% through the first 11 months of the 
year, compared with 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police detectives have identified several "hot spots" in the 
Valley, neighborhoods where thieves have broken into thousands of cars in 
search of loot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the East Valley, two neighborhoods of apartment buildings -- one in the 
Studio City and Valley Village area, the other in Sun Valley -- attract so many 
car burglars that police estimate they account for 75% of the entire North 
Hollywood division's 3,713 car break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Van Nuys Division, detectives report the bulk of auto burglaries 
take place along Ventura Boulevard, mostly in Sherman Oaks. Through the end of 
November, thieves had broken into 772 cars of shoppers and diners parked along 
the boulevard and its side streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're getting hit and it's not just nighttime; it's daytime too," said 
Detective Ernie Guzman of the Van Nuys Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Devonshire and Foothill station detectives say their auto burglaries are more 
spread out, making it more difficult for police to conduct undercover 
surveillance at known hot spots.

 The Foothill Division had the largest growth in car burglaries in the Valley 
this year, with a 9.3% increase. That was followed by a 7.3% increase in the 
West Valley Division and 5.5% jump in the Devonshire Division, according to 
LAPD statistics through Nov. 30. By comparison, the North Hollywood Division 
reported a 3.4% drop and there was a decrease of 7.1% in the Van Nuys Division. 
West Valley topped the list in volume, with 4,609 auto burglaries, followed by 
4,052 reported incidents in the Van Nuys Division, 3,713 in the North Hollywood 
Division, 3,209 in the Devonshire Division and 2,264 in Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say car burglaries can have an emotional impact on victims, 
particularly those who have been hit repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had people crying and screaming, 'Where are the police when you need 
them?' or 'How come you don't have an officer in front of my house 24 hours a 
day?' " said Detective Phil Toledo of the North Hollywood Division. "You can't 
blame them, but we can't cover every street corner. (Car burglaries) are going 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But detectives say a shortage of officers and other resources is making their 
fight difficult, especially when they are directed to pay closer attention to 
violent crimes such as murders, rapes or robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had a police officer on the corner of every street you wouldn't have a 
problem," Toledo said. "But we don't have the manpower to patrol these 
subterranean garages and apartment complexes, and they are the targets." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the rising numbers, police have conducted stakeouts, employed 
the help of community watch groups and increased the frequency of patrol cars 
driving through neighborhoods plagued by car burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say burglars are drawn to apartment buildings with underground 
garages because the concealed locations allow thieves to work without notice by 
pedestrians or passing traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Burglars gain access to the garages by simply waiting for a resident to open 
the gate and drive in. And since many apartment dwellers are not familiar with 
their neighbors, a burglar seen inside a garage can easily be mistaken for 
another resident, Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, car alarms fail to ward off burglaries because most people 
these days ignore them, detectives say. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Hollywood, Toledo said the bulk of car break-ins are committed by 
drug addicts stealing to support their habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys walk the streets, they walk the alleys and they walk the 
subterranean garages," Toledo said. "They see something they can sell and then 
they smash the windows and in a matter of seconds they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it is a crime in which a moment's worth of work can reap hundreds of 
dollars in profits. A video camera caught one burglar disarming an alarm and 
removing a stereo in less than 10 seconds, said Owens of the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Most detectives agree that the crimes are committed by many burglars, 
operating independently. 
</P>
<P>
 However, earlier this month, Owens said, detectives in his division arrested 
three men who are suspected of working as a team to burglarize seven cars. At 
the time of their arrests, two of the men had radios in their hands and a third 
man was caught with another radio inside a getaway car, which had been reported 
stolen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys were probably good for other robberies as well," Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that drug-addicted burglars are looking for items they can resell 
for cash. A leather jacket or a sports bag that may contain a wallet are likely 
to catch a crook's eye. And in addition to car stereos, even air bags are being 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellular phones appear to be emerging as the item of choice among burglars who 
smash in windows, grab the phones and are gone in seconds, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're averaging about 40 stolen a month," said Toledo of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping luxury items from view of potential thieves or out of unattended cars 
altogether are two ways residents can avoid car burglaries, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 But even then, said Guzman of the Van Nuys Division, "Any time you leave 
property in your car, you're making it a target."

<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Tips on Avoiding Auto Burglaries 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police detectives suggest these precautions to avoid being a 
victim of auto burglary: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove from view any property that a thief may find attractive. Thieves walk 
along city streets and through parking garages seeking out valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 * Know your neighbors. If you see a stranger behaving suspiciously, call 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 * Park under a street light or near a bright area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get involved in community volunteer programs. Learn how to act as an extra 
set of eyes and ears in your neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider installing a car alarm. Police warn that skilled thieves can disarm 
an alarm in a matter of seconds. But the alarm may deter the less-skilled 
criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your car is burglarized, file a police report. Such reports help police 
spot problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mark your cellular phone or stereo with a driver's license number. Record 
the serial numbers of car phones and radios.

CHRISTMAS STORM LEAVES UP TO AN INCH OF RAINFALL IN O.C.

<P>
 Skiers got their wish for a white one, but everyone else was stuck with a wet 
Christmas as a slow-moving storm dropped just over an inch of rain on Southern 
California on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder, lightning and scattered power outages hit the area, along with a 
small funnel cloud off Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainfall in Orange County ranged from 1.09 of an inch in Lake Forest to .04 of 
an inch in Anaheim. San Juan Capistrano reported .91 of an inch; Santa Ana, .53 
of an inch; and .42 of an inch fell in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday temperatures in the county ranged from 63 in San Juan Capistrano and 57 
in Lake Forest to lows in the upper 40s to 50 elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain should be gone for a while, according to Curtis Brack, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only a slight chance of that the showers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, WeatherData says it will be partly cloudy in Orange County and a bit 
warmer, with highs in the upper 50s and 60s. The skies should clear by tonight 
and into Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The overnight precipitation on Christmas meant that tire chains were needed 
above 4,000 feet in the mountains. Ski resorts reported eight to 10 inches of 
fresh snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Several accidents were reported on rain-slicked freeways over the weekend, 
including a 10-car accident on the San Bernardino Freeway near Alhambra on 
Saturday night and a six-vehicle fender-bender on the Riverside Freeway in 
Yorba Linda on Sunday, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 A flash-flood warning was issued for western Los Angeles County after more 
than an inch of rain fell in some regions. Residents of Malibu and other areas 
denuded by wildfires were urged to watch for mudslides, but county fire 
officials reported no problems.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; OFFICIALS SEEK TO REACT BUT NOT SCARE THE PUBLIC; 
CRISIS: MANY CITY AND SCHOOL DISTRICT LEADERS ADOPT A WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE. 
BUT A FEW INSIST ON TOUGH TALK AND CALL FOR IMMEDIATE STUDY OF POTENTIAL CUTS. 
</P>

<P>
 As they respond to an unfolding financial crisis, city and school district 
leaders say they face a dilemma: how to deal swiftly and soberly with the 
situation without unduly alarming the public before all the facts are in. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a balancing act leaders said they must perform at public meetings, in 
their offices as they field phone calls from residents, and even at the 
supermarket as neighbors approach them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officials have adopted a conservative wait-and-see attitude, wary of 
frightening residents even when the financial picture appears grim. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Santa Ana school board meeting in which officials announced that the bond 
debacle might mean larger classes, trustee Audrey Yamagata-Noji warned against 
publicizing a "hit list" of potential cutbacks until the district's losses are 
clear. "People freak out and I don't blame them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials insist that the financial crisis must be met with tough 
talk and austere planning, even though its full effects probably won't be known 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, school board member Hank Adler last week suggested that officials 
immediately draw up a list of deep cutbacks, declaring that "the time for 
denial is over." Another board member then accused Adler of needlessly 
frightening residents and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hank's approach is where you draw out the worst case scenario in very large 
terms," board member Mike Regele said. "The scenario I want to follow is a 
little more conservative and incremental. Certainly we need to be thinking 
about worst-case scenarios, but we need to be careful of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials' efforts to address to the crisis in any decisive way have been 
complicated by its fluid nature. With high-level meetings occurring throughout 
the day and night, they said, it is often difficult to speak with certainty 
about what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, concern about the collapsed pool is more intense in cities 
with large investments than those with smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, with $209 million in the pool, has held several emergency council 
meetings over the past month. The city has gone from twice monthly meetings to 
weekly meetings. In Cypress, with only about $5 million in the pool, the crisis 
has not emerged as a major issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The county announced two weeks ago that the fund has lost roughly 27% of its 
value over the past year. But many local officials refuse to concede that their 
agencies will suffer any long-term losses, insisting instead that they are due 
back every penny of their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, cities and school districts have responded to the crisis by delaying 
capital projects, imposing hiring freezes and clamping down on spending. But 
most officials interviewed fear the worst is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't have the full story. That makes it difficult," said Paula 
Werner, Irvine's mayor pro tem. "For now, I don't want to allude to cuts. . . . 
Instead of throwing up a trial balloon, I want to know all the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they are being cautious in part to spare city and school 
employees any needless panic, especially around the holidays. Many employees 
already have experienced several rounds of belt-tightenings and layoffs as 
agencies adjusted to the statewide economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone though this recession. Restructuring government has changed 
people's lives," Werner said. "Staff morale is low. People are nervous to begin 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 In many cities and school districts, leaders said they've tried to avoid 
squabbling in an effort to approach the crisis with a united front. 
</P>
<P>
 But elsewhere, differences in the way elected officials approach to the 
situation are showing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Ann Brooks, a newly elected trustee for the Placentia-Yorba Linda 
Unified School District, proposed last week that an independent committee of 
residents be formed to advise the board on bond matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you believe in the tooth fairy, there is going to come a time when 
there will be cuts," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others on the board expressed doubts about her proposal, saying they don't 
need advice from a committee and aren't even sure cuts will be necessary. 
"There may not be any problems down the road," trustee Jerry Brakebill said. 
"We don't know what we may have to cut, if anything at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has more than $53 million in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar debate is going on in the Irvine Unified School District, with $102 
million frozen in the fund, the most of any Orange County school system. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler, a newly elected board member, said it is time for the district to act. 
He urged the district to prepare for a $30-million loss and called on school 
board members to eliminate their $400-a-month stipends. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this situation, my philosophy is: Prepare for the worst and hope for the 
best," said Adler, an accountant. "People have told me, don't sugarcoat it, we 
want to know everything." 
</P>
<P>
 But a veteran board member said Alder is moving too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we really did have, as Mr. Adler suggested, a $30-million problem, we are 
bankrupt," Regele said. "It's not possible to cut $30 million out of a 
$100-million budget. But I don't believe that is the magnitude of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Adler's comment could also send the wrong message about how the board is 
responding to the crisis, Regele said. "The implication was made that we were 
not embracing the magnitude of the problem and we are not moving. That simply 
is not true," he said. "We need to be moving quickly to assess the extent of 
the damage. But we also need to get a realistic assessment of it."

VOLUNTEERS TAKE YULETIDE CHEER TO THE STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Amid the drizzling rain, about 70 homeless people lined up along a sidewalk 
here Sunday, awaiting a Christmas meal trimmed with noodles, egg rolls and 
fried rice -- and just as important, the chance of winning a sleeping bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The small line, fed by a group of Vietnamese American volunteers, seemed like 
just a drop of water in an ocean of homelessness in the county. But for the 
handful of social service providers, and recipients, it was the best way to 
spend the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the happiest way I could spend Christmas," said program organizer 
Khoi Vu, passing out Christmas cards to the homeless. Squinting through 
eyeglasses speckled with raindrops, he added, "It makes me happy to help 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the outdoor program in the heart of Santa Ana couldn't compare to 
larger programs, such as the one at the Rescue Mission, it was a heartfelt 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is beneficial for people. It's such a selfless thing, it makes me feel a 
way I can't describe," said John Devereaux, who has been living on and off the 
streets for the past five years.  
</P>
<P>
 Stationed just across from the mission, the makeshift buffet was supplied with 
sodas, food bags bulging with fruit, and boxes of new sleeping bags and 
blankets. There was a drawing for the coveted bags. Volunteers young and old 
endured the rain with smiles as flute music played in the background. Despite 
the language barriers, the volunteers communicated with patrons through the 
process of giving and receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here today because I have received a lot of good things from American 
people when I immigrated here. It's time for us to do something in return," 
said Vu, who started the food program five months ago. "It's about giving 
equally from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaplin Jim Womack, with the Rescue Mission, said community charity groups 
frequently appear on that same street corner. Citing greater awareness of 
homelessness, he attributed the mission's success in their Christmas dinner 
this year to more community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "These small groups come at least twice a week. People come out and give from 
the heart," Womack said. "When you're talking about homeless people, you're 
talking about people who are down and out, with no glimmer of hope. But by the 
act of giving, no matter how small or big, they are the hope giver." 
</P>
<P>
 The mission's annual Christmas Day dinner this year was an unexpected success. 
As waves of men, women and children were shepherded out of the rain and into 
the dry and warm shelter, an estimated 2,000 meals were served and 300 food 
boxes and toys were passed out. 
</P>
<P>
 After fearing the worst, the mission was actually deluged with donations of 
food, clothing and goods, and a relieved and elated Womack said the surplus 
would tide them over for events in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 "The harvest is truly plentiful. You would think donations would decrease with 
the bad economy, but no, it's increasing," Womack said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that wasn't the case everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Just several blocks away, the Southwest Community Center opened its doors to 
almost 200 people during its four-hour Christmas meal program. Although the 
turnout was as successful as anticipated, the center has faced severe cutbacks 
because of the lack of donations and a growing need for social services, said 
Tyrone Tripp, the center's president.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst year we've ever had. We're facing a $30,000 deficit. In 
previous years, we were able to serve up to 800 people. Now we're down to 200," 
Tripp said.  
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to maintain services, Tripp said the sporadic success stories he 
has seen through a lifetime of service makes him hopeful that the program will 
continue. At times, he said, former homeless clients would return with jobs, a 
new home and a willingness to volunteer.  
</P>
<P>
 One example is Gerald Williams, 40, who came with nothing from Louisiana. Now 
he holds two odd jobs waiting tables and lives out of a van he purchased. When 
not working, he returns to the center to receive help and assist others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything to give, so I try to give back by volunteering my 
services," Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 For many without homes, Christmas can be a hard and lonely time. Rex Rodriguez 
was released from jail just two months ago, only to end up on the cold streets 
of Santa Ana. Although freedom was the best gift this season, he said the 
struggle to find a job can be discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to turn his life around, he left the Southwest Community Center 
with a word of hope, "Leaving jail was like Christmas. But the past few months 
I never slept in so many back seats in my life. This is no way to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice feeling to get a bite to eat from people helping us like this. 
Makes me realize I need to get a car and find a roof over my head every day. 
It's going to be tough but it's worse on the streets," he said.

LAGUNA TOLLWAY FOES LAMENTING LACK OF SUPPORT; ENVIRONMENT: ACTIVISTS SAY THEY 
HAVE CALLED HUNDREDS -- AND GOTTEN EXCUSES. AN INJUNCTION HAS HALTED WORK UNTIL 
JAN. 5.

 There were supposed to be hundreds of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the afternoon lengthened during the first full day of demonstrations 
against construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway in Laguna Canyon, only 
eight protesters held their ground. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, the bulldozers had cleared about 40 acres of oak trees and 
shrubbery and were gnawing at the hillsides themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "And nobody out here to help us, after all the telephoning we had to do," said 
Laguna Beach resident Eleanor Henry, her voice thick with anguish. "They said 
they would be here." 
</P>
<P>
 But after the courts dissolved an injunction Tuesday, allowing grading to 
begin, and until a second injunction halted the bulldozers again Friday until 
Jan. 5, a paltry number of demonstrators actually appeared along Laguna Canyon 
Road each day to protest. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, tollway foes say, they have been compiling a list of more than 400 
people who asked to be called if the bulldozers rolled in the canyon. They even 
gave civil disobedience training to those who might risk arrest to block earth 
movers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so disappointed so few people showed up," said Imke Bomer, a Costa Mesa 
resident who attended a candlelight vigil in the canyon Friday evening that 
eventually drew 60 demonstrators as news of the latest injunction spread. "Yet 
the ones here are so determined, so committed, it's almost like their lives 
depend on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who did protest during the past week have been hearty, arriving in the 
chilly morning darkness and often staying through dusk. They skipped work and 
Christmas shopping. By Friday, 21 people had been arrested, at least four of 
whom locked their necks to bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
 But they fought discouragement when their numbers, which at best swelled to 
60, at times thinned to single digits. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills resident Max Brown, 36, who spent five hours in jail Wednesday 
and returned to the picket line that afternoon, said he called recruits Tuesday 
night but many begged off, saying they had doctor appointments or that 6 a.m. 
was just too early. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed," Brown said. "You should have heard the lame excuses I 
was getting." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Alexis Penn who attends college in Santa Cruz but was home in 
Tustin for the holidays, took her place with about two dozen protesters. Penn 
said she read about the grading in the morning newspaper and hurried to the 
canyon but was shocked by how few others had responded.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's disturbing. I thought there would be a lot more people out here," said 
Penn, 19. "If this was Santa Cruz up north, there would be hundreds, but 
Southern Californians are just lazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have fought for years to keep development out of Laguna 
Canyon. In 1989, between 7,000 and 8,000 people converged on the canyon to 
protest a planned housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest battle centers on construction of the 17-mile toll road, which 
would slice through the middle of some 175 acres of open space, including the 
Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, as it links Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano. 
A demonstration earlier this year against the corridor attracted roughly 1,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 While construction at opposite ends of the roadway has proceeded steadily, a 
court injunction had halted work between El Toro Road and Newport Coast Drive 
for the past 15 months, except for 12 hours in June when the injunction was 
briefly lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 When the courts dissolved the initial injunction Tuesday, the Transportation 
Corridor Agencies, which is building the roadway, moved swiftly. The agency got 
the green light at 9:30 a.m., and the bulldozers were revved by 11. By Friday, 
workers had finished "clearing and grubbing" all but about 25 acres, agency 
spokeswoman Lisa Telles said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we probably caught them off guard," corridor manager Gene Foster said 
Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some opponents bemoan the agency's decision to unleash earth movers the week 
before Christmas, when many who vowed to demonstrate were gone for the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are people doing the week before Christmas?" asked Dana Point resident 
Diane Valentino, 41, at Friday's vigil. "It's been a real chore for all of us 
who've managed to get out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that timing, combined with a sense of powerlessness and the fatigue 
that accompanies long-term battles, was simply too much for many who love this 
gently sloping landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just feel totally disempowered at this point," said Marion Pack, 
executive director of Orange County Alliance for Survival, who drove 55 miles 
from her home in Norco to the protest Thursday morning after being arrested 
during a demonstration the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 But those with fight left in them say they won't give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our opinion that until there's concrete down on this and people driving 
on it, it's reparable," said Patrick Mitchell, a Garden Grove resident and 
member of the activist group Earth First!  
</P>
<P>
 And some think the new injunction will draw fresh recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got time now," Valentino said. "We can get our calls out." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach resident Patti Ripley, whose daughter Kelly was one of those 
arrested Thursday morning, said she and another daughter are willing to lock 
themselves to a bulldozer, if necessary, to halt the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at it this way, we don't know how much we can do, but to sit and do 
nothing is worse," she said.

THE SPORT IS TAKING OFF AGAIN; SKATEBOARDING'S RESURGENCE IS VISIBLE IN PARKS, 
ON TV -- AND AT CASH REGISTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Skateboarding, considered just as hip as surfing in some circles and born long 
before in-line skating, is enjoying another boom in Surf City and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs, like the sound of a smooth ride on blacktop, are unmistakable: Two 
public skateboard parks have been built here and are packed with kids daily. 
Advertisers and a multitude of businesses are beginning to embrace the sport in 
an effort to attract the younger market. Two professional skateboarders have 
endorsed tennis shoes specifically designed with the board in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 And a skateboard contest held before 1,000 spectators in Santa Ana two months 
ago attracted 50 contestants from as far away as Australia and Europe. If 
that's not enough evidence, just tune in ESPN in January and watch "Athletes in 
Motion," which will feature the contest that was organized by Costa Mesa 
resident Chris May, a 29-year-old skateboard fanatic who lives and breathes the 
sport. May is trying to get more skateboard parks built in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a while since skateboarding has been on television," May said. "But 
skateboarding is just like anything, it goes in and out of the favor of the 
public eye. But it's making a resurgence, it's making a comeback, and you can 
see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Schmitt, a skateboard manufacturer in Costa Mesa, agrees. Sales are 
strong now, but Schmitt predicts they're going to get even stronger in the next 
five years, when he believes the popularity of the sport will hit a peak last 
seen in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The popularity goes in population cycles," said the 31-year-old Schmitt. 
"Kids who do the most skating these days generally fall in the 10-to-15 age 
group, but right now there are a lot of kids between the ages of 5 and 10. 
They'll grow into it. Some will skate for a week, some will skate for a month, 
some for a year and some for the rest of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the sport must overcome numerous obstacles. Born in Southern California 
beach towns, it has carried a rebel image that participants say is a bad rap. 
Many cities, for example, have passed ordinances banning skateboarding on 
streets and sidewalks, forcing skaters to either break the law or search 
out-of-the-way places. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my experiences, most skateboarders were people who I don't want in the 
area I live," said Lloyd Helm, 53, of Huntington Beach, who successfully 
opposed the building of a skateboard park across the street from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of real sleazy guys hanging around. They have little respect 
for other people's property. There's a little doughnut shop where I live and 
there's a 'No Skateboarding' sign, but they still do it. They destroy the 
planters and the tiles there." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits and liability fears have spelled doom for many skateboard parks that 
once existed across the state. May likens the now-vacant rinks to "extinct 
dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more progressive cities like Huntington Beach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Huttenberger, the project manager for Huntington Beach's Public Works 
Department, said the two new skateboard parks have been a smashing success. One 
was just completed across from City Hall, at the intersection of Main Street 
and Yorktown Avenue, and the other is in Murdy Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get too many more kids in there without a shoehorn," Huttenberger 
said. "But it's good. It keeps them off the streets and gives them something to 
do. Hopefully, they'll stay there if the rinks can take a beating." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the parks are so popular that the city is thinking of building a 
third, if that's what it takes to keep skateboarders off Main Street and the 
pier, where pedestrians have complained about them. 
</P>
<P>
 May is hoping to open a skateboard park in Irvine and possibly set up a ramp 
-- a U-shaped track that enthusiasts use to practice trick maneuvers -- in 
Costa Mesa. He said he has talked to the Boy Scouts about the latter idea and 
they have expressed an interest in helping out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skateboarding is not going to stop," he said. "It's here to stay now."

DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS; MISSING: LYNN SHARDLOW'S HUSBAND HAS 
VANISHED, AND THEIR DISABILITY INCOME HAS DISAPPEARED UNTIL HIS FATE IS 
LEARNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynn Shardlow exists in a world in limbo.  
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband, Dr. W. Basil Shardlow, had lived on federal workers' 
compensation checks since he contracted chronic hepatitis while operating at 
the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital in 1971. For the rest of his life, 
Basil Shardlow would receive two-thirds of his salary. And if he should die 
because of the disease, his wife would receive half of his salary. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the 63-year-old surgeon disappeared May 28, he has been, to the 
federal government, neither dead nor alive, leaving Lynn Shardlow with no 
husband and no money. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not right," said Lynn Shardlow, 47. "I have taken care of this man 
for the last 19 years. I have been there for him as a nurse, a friend, a 
lover." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government stopped sending his monthly checks in September, saying 
Basil Shardlow no longer resides at his Laguna Beach address. Yet until a body 
is found, his wife cannot receive widow's benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case has left us disconcerted as well," said Frank Faragasso, a federal 
supervisor in charge of the case, which is the first of its kind he has 
experienced in 22 years on the job. "But we have lots of other people to take 
care of. We have no obligation to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Shardlow last saw her husband when she left home to run an errand that 
May morning. In the last few years the couple had never spent more than a few 
hours apart, she said, especially since his liver transplant operation a few 
weeks earlier. But that day, she came home to an empty condominium. She has not 
heard from her husband since. 
</P>
<P>
 Basil Shardlow apparently left the condominium wearing gray sweat pants, a 
turquoise long-sleeve T-shirt and green baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Detective Jason Kravetz said the case is the most heart-wrenching in 
the years he has worked missing persons cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, the first thing they teach you in training is not to get personally 
involved" Kravetz said. "Well, I've broken that rule in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Kravetz said he has looked at every body found in California that has any 
resemblance to the 6-foot-2 surgeon who had brown hair and blue eyes and 
weighed 175 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
 The case has taken Kravetz all over Southern California, chasing leads that 
might put to rest the nagging question that often keeps the detective awake at 
night: Where is Basil Shardlow? 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to give her an answer," Kravetz said. "Things are just tough all 
over for her right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the U.S. Department of Labor said they would like to help Lynn 
Shardlow, but their hands are legally tied until she can produce a death 
certificate. Under California law, a missing person cannot be presumed dead 
until five years after the day a disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 So this holiday season, Lynn Shardlow will mourn not only for "the love of her 
life," she will also be near broke and looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, she joined police and more than 100 volunteers in combing the 
coastal cities from San Clemente to Laguna Beach. The search party scoured the 
hills and beaches where Basil Shardlow went for walks, Kravetz said. Dozens of 
divers scanned the ocean floor and underwater caves for signs that he might 
have drowned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of copies of Basil Shardlow's photo were distributed throughout the 
state, Kravetz said. Several people called, but none of the leads panned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just walked off the face of the Earth," Kravetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 A cashier at a supermarket six blocks away from his house said the doctor was 
seen on the same day he was reported missing, Kravetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 And about two months later, two people called the Police Department to report 
that a person matching Basil Shardlow's description was seen walking across a 
golf course. The callers told Kravetz that the man she saw seemed disoriented, 
which was consistent with his medical condition at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The drugs that kept Shardlow alive after his liver transplant were left on the 
counter of his house. Without them, Lynn Shardlow said, he would have been "a 
bit out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at UCLA Medical Center, where the operation was performed, said the 
chances are not likely that someone in his condition would survive more than 
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Shardlow says she believes her husband died. She recalled a strange 
incident three days after he disappeared when a morning dove walked into her 
condominium from the patio door, which faces the ocean. As she sat on the couch 
with a friend, the dove came up to her, then flew to eye level. Then it turned 
and flew away. She looked at the television, which was broadcasting Memorial 
Day events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw thousands of doves being released in the air," Lynn Shardlow said. "At 
that moment, I knew somehow that he's gone. He's not in pain anymore. I closed 
my eyes, then I hugged myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The Shardlows were married in 1976, about a year after their first date in 
which they shared a pizza after a Cary Grant movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell in love with him," she said. "Besides the fact that he was so cute, I 
knew that he could do anything he wanted."  
</P>
<P>
 William Lawson, a doctor at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York who met 
Basil Shardlow in 1965 as a fellow resident, said patients loved the convivial 
Englishman. Basil Shardlow was born in Liverpool and had served as captain in 
the British 16th Parachute Brigade, Lawson said. He later had a practice on 
Park Avenue as an ear, nose and throat specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemarie Accardi-Mangione, who is married to jazz musician and composer Chuck 
Mangione, met Basil Shardlow in 1977 after the Shardlows moved to California 
from New York. Accardi-Mangione and Lynn Shardlow had been friends years 
earlier, and when Accardi-Mangione underwent an operation following a heart 
attack, her old friend's husband visited her at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sat in a chair by my bedside and listened to my problems until I saw 
myself through it," she said. "It was like he came to me as a saint and took 
care of me." 
</P>
<P>
 The two had stayed in touch since. She last spoke to him when he was in the 
hospital last winter anticipating a liver transplant, which was later canceled 
when the wrong organ was shipped, Lynn Shardlow said. A heart valve was 
supposed to be shipped to Atlanta while a liver was meant to go to UCLA. 
Somehow, the orders got swapped. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Accardi-Mangione said, she was recovering from open-heart 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were joking about having to replace our parts," she said. "He sounded very 
upbeat, very funny, but I also felt a tone of fear in his voice." 
</P>
<P>
 That fear manifested in suicidal tendencies after the liver transplant in the 
spring, Lynn Shardlow said. He had been taking "mood elevation" pills, but 
stopped days before he left home, she said. It is unclear whether he was 
suicidal when he disappeared, but Lynn Shardlow said given his condition, it is 
a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 She organized a memorial service on his birthday, Dec. 3, but canceled because 
she "couldn't go through with it." 
</P>
<P>
 She now is looking for a job teaching, which she once did for the L.A. Unified 
School District, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her battle for disability payments seems all but lost. Even after 
Basil Shardlow is declared legally dead, his widow will have to prove that he 
died from the hepatitis that he contracted when he pricked his finger while 
handling commercial blood, which then was not screened for viruses.  
</P>
<P>
 Without a body, it isn't likely that she can do that, said Max Gest, an 
attorney who specializes in federal workers' compensation laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Faragasso said, "We don't want to leave anybody out in the cold, but until we 
know what has happened to him, we're in limbo."

STATE COLLEGE ENROLLMENTS DROP SLIGHTLY; EDUCATION: FIGURES FOLLOW NATIONAL 
TRENDS AND SHOW A STRONG COMEBACK FROM LAST YEAR'S STEEP DECLINES. OFFICIALS 
PARTIALLY CREDIT ECONOMIC RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mirroring nationwide trends, California's two largest public higher education 
systems experienced only slight enrollment declines this fall, a strong 
reversal to the sharp drops of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollments in California's community colleges fell 1.4% to about 1.36 million 
students, compared to a 9% loss in 1993, a spokesman said. California State 
University enrollments declined 1.9% to 319,394 students this fall, from a 6.3% 
drop the year before, with Cal State Fullerton among the schools to experience 
a small drop. 
</P>
<P>
 The results mirror those of a national report to be released today by the 
American Council on Education, the nation's main higher education lobby. The 
council suggests that a similar pattern of moderation in enrollment losses has 
occurred this fall in their survey of selected states. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nationally, I think it's slowing," said David Merkowitz, a council spokesman. 
This fall, 11 of the 17 states with the most complete survey data reported 
overall enrollment declines, slightly fewer states than a year ago. Private 
school enrollments have increased in 12 of 18 states surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Merkowitz said the tallies released today account for about 40% of nationwide 
enrollment. Earlier this fall, however, the U.S. Department of Education, based 
on a sampling of actual institutions rather than selected states, forecast a 
new high of 14.7 million students, a slight increase over 1993. The department 
couched the numbers for both years as estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in California said the end to steep public enrollment losses this 
fall reflects the state's economic recovery. Also, the state's public higher 
education systems fared better financially this year after deep budget cuts 
earlier in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The enrollment declines had alarmed college and university educators, who 
feared that students were being shut out of the systems because of cutbacks in 
classes and higher fees. Historically, California has prided itself in 
providing some level of post-secondary education to any student who sought it. 
</P>
<P>
 The $390 per year in fees charged a full-time community college student is 
nearly four times the price of 1990. Cal State's annual $1,584 fee is more than 
double 1990's charge. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, total enrollments in California's three public higher education 
systems -- community colleges, Cal State and the University of California -- 
fell 8% to 1.87 million, the largest drop in the nation, one study found. This 
fall, the total loss will probably be less than 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the enrollment news is not as bad as in previous years, the new 
figures still mark the third consecutive year of enrollment declines for the 
107-campus community college system, and the fourth straight year for the 
20-campus Cal State system. 
</P>
<P>
 California's community college enrollment hit its lowest level this fall since 
1988, with about 1.33 million students. The Cal State system's enrollment hit 
its lowest mark since 1984, when fall enrollment stood at 316,000, records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Cal State campuses in the region, Northridge suffered the largest loss, 
10.9%, because of the January earthquake. The Long Beach, Fullerton, Pomona and 
San Bernardino campuses had small declines. The Los Angeles, Dominguez Hills 
and San Diego campuses had small gains.

MAN SHOT IN DEC. 3 AMBUSH DIES OF WOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 35-year-old man ambushed in front of his home Dec. 3 died of his wounds 
Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter I. Montano was shot twice in front of his home in the 1800 block of 
Moorpark Drive, and had been in critical condition since being airlifted to UCI 
Medical Center, where he died Sunday at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no new leads in the continuing investigation, according to Lt. Cliff 
Trimble. 
</P>
<P>
 Montano, who managed an auto parts store in Los Angeles, told neighbors after 
being hit that his two male attackers knew him. As many as 10 shots might have 
been fired, police said. The attackers fled in a maroon car. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew the people involved" in the shooting, said Sgt. Ed McDonald, but the 
nature of the relationship was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said that Montano's home had been burglarized several weeks before 
the shooting. McDonald said he didn't know if the shooting was related to the 
burglary.

 CRUISE CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For generations, a rumbling ritual of courtship has been performed every 
weekend in the San Fernando Valley, transforming dull strips of asphalt into 
enchanted avenues of adolescent amore . 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after sunset, young men roll out their four-wheeled finery before an 
admiring audience, flexing their hydraulic muscles and inviting a few young 
women to join them in the customized interiors of these hand-polished vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the Latino cruisers -- or lowriders -- a subculture built on 
hydraulic lifts, thousand-dollar wheel rims and a simple philosophy handed down 
from generation to generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls like cars and guys like girls, that's why we're here," said Leo 
Rodriguez, 24, of North Hollywood, one of hundreds of cruisers who occasionally 
roam Sepulveda and Laurel Canyon boulevards in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 From Sun Valley to North Hollywood, each cruising strip in the Valley has its 
own history, adherents and codes of conduct. While some Valley roadways draw 
drag racers, it is the slow-circling parade of steel on wheels that has lured 
generations of the Lopez family to Sepulveda Boulevard and "The Canyon," as 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Mission Hills is sometimes called. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Canyon used to be farmland when I was little," said Margaret Lopez, 54, 
of Pacoima. "We used to cruise it and the Mission in a '55 Chevy. We had 
boyfriends, but we used to go anyway. It's been going on for years -- from 
generation to generation. But it's changed so much." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, cruisers drove Detroit's finest, men wore zoot suits and car 
radios blared Big Band medleys. During the '70s, cruisers tuned into disco, 
hydraulic lifts were only $200 and El Caminos ruled the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Japanese roadsters compete for the street with American models, 
compact-disc players generate oldies music and the latest fashion rave for 
women is baggy pants over bodysuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The current social climate suits Lopez's daughter, 19-year-old Deanna, just 
fine. A former gang member, Deanna Lopez turned to cruising as a social outlet 
when Latino gangs in the Valley signed a peace treaty last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Deanna now spends Sunday nights honking her horn at cute guys in her ivory 
1985 Cadillac, which she sometimes loads up with nine girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we used to hang around in Paxton Park, drink and get high," she said. 
"Sometimes we would go fight in other people's neighborhoods. Since there's 
been this gang treaty, we go cruising and stay out of trouble. It's like 
exciting, meeting other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Latino cruisers are dedicated not to gangs, but to car clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranging from high school students with afternoon jobs to white-collar workers, 
club members from as far away as Santa Monica roll the valued vehicles out of 
their garages each weekend for the drive to the Valley. Often it is the only 
time of the week the prized possessions leave home. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruising clubs range from Colors of Success, for truck owners only, to Neu 
Exposure, which features lowriders of the four- and three-wheeled variety, 
including the 66-inch Schwinn tricycle owned by Peps Noguera of North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what I'm doing with all the money I save," said Peps, 17, who 
sometimes works at Magic Mountain to earn the cash to customize his tricycle -- 
a $1,500 investment so far. 
</P>
<P>
 When he isn't working to pay for improvements, Peps is polishing his treasure 
at home. Like many cruisers, he will not hit the streets until the last speck 
of dirt is wiped from the chrome fender. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take it apart and polish every little piece," Peps said. "It takes two to 
three hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, however, cruisers have encountered an even greater threat than grime 
-- neighborhood opposition. Since August, concerns about cruiser noise and 
vandalism have prompted police to gate off La Rinda Plaza in Mission Hills, a 
popular cruising hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 To adapt, cruisers have switched their gathering hours in Mission Hills or 
migrated to other secret hangouts. But there will be no end of the road for 
cruising. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Anita Smith, 20, of Pacoima: "It's like our second home."

ARMORY GIVES WARMTH TO THE HOMELESS; SERVICES: NATIONAL GUARD SHELTER OFFERS 
REFUGE FROM THE CHILL AS WELL AS DANGER OF THE STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 With daytime temperatures in the mid-70s so far this winter, a cold-weather 
shelter for the homeless might seem unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the people who would otherwise spend their nights on the streets of 
the San Fernando Valley -- braving temperatures that can drop 20 to 30 degrees 
despite balmy afternoons -- the temporary shelter at the National Guard Armory 
in Encino is a welcome alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safer here. You never know (what will happen) when you are on the 
streets," said Toni Knapp, 19, who has spent every night at the shelter since 
it opened on Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the back wall of the armory, Knapp has set up a makeshift bedroom for 
herself and her husband Peter, 36 -- two cots pushed together, two blankets, a 
small television and some fishing rods they found while looking in dumpsters. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be their home until the end of February, when the shelter closes for 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Every winter, for the past five years, the Los Angeles Homeless Services 
Authority has overseen emergency cold-weather shelters throughout the county 
with beds for 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelters are open every day between Dec. 13 and Feb. 28. During November 
and after Feb. 28, the shelters are open if there is a 50% or greater chance of 
rain or if the temperature drops below 40 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter at the Encino armory is run by the L.A. Family Housing Corp. in 
North Hollywood, which also operates the Valley's only year-round homeless 
shelter. Joe Zuniga, the program's coordinator, said there is a definite need 
for additional beds in winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, it starts out slow but it steadily increases," Zuniga said. 
"We'll fill up all 155 spots." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are just over 100 people at the armory every night. Families 
who come seeking a place to stay are given a meal and a voucher to stay at a 
motel for up to three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Family Housing has also arranged a shuttle that stops in five Valley locations 
-- from Canoga Park to Hansen Dam -- to pick up potential clients. Robert 
Archibeque, who works the 5:30 p.m. to midnight shift at the armory, said the 
shelter gets about half its users from the shuttle service. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest come on their own, waiting until the shelter opens each evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We open the doors at 5:30 p.m., sign them in, give them an identification 
card, have them sign up for a shower, give them a bunk and a blanket and they 
eat, watch TV or go to sleep," Archibeque said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the same folks show up nightly, shelter workers said. Many 
are only recently homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Vartan Sarkissian, 38, grew up in Los Angeles, has family in the Valley and 
had been living with his parents. He said he has been forced to periodically 
live on the streets or in shelters for the past year, ever since his mother's 
death threw the family into turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, 43, is a recent parolee who has yet to re-establish himself in 
society. Curtis, who declined to give his full name, said he completed a 
four-year prison term for robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 He was released to the Valley, where he was living with his girlfriend before 
his arrest, and is required to report to a parole officer here, he said. But 
his girlfriend has since left the area, said Curtis, whose roots are in his 
hometown of Richmond in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I'm homeless," he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuniga said most shelter clients defy stereotypes of the homeless as 
chronically helpless people. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these people are very aware," Zuniga said. "They are mostly down on 
their luck -- lost their job, got divorced. . . . Maybe 20% to 30% of them are 
long-term homeless."

TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS TAKE TWO LIVES ON CHRISTMAS EVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two people were killed in automobile-related accidents on Christmas Eve in 
separate parts of Orange County, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first incident, a pedestrian was killed at 6:10 p.m. when a suspected 
drunk driver careened through a Huntington Beach intersection at an estimated 
80 m.p.h., said a Huntington Beach Police Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Garcia-Adame, 22, of Huntington Beach was walking in an unmarked 
crosswalk on Ellis Avenue at Delaware Street when he was hit by a car driven by 
Paul J. Gronley of Huntington Beach and thrown about 200 feet, said Sgt. Ed 
Deuel. Garcia-Adame was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Gronley, 41, ran a stop sign, according to Deuel. He was 
arrested at the scene on suspicion of felony drunk driving and vehicular 
manslaughter and his bail was set at $50,000, Deuel said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 11 p.m. in Dana Point, a Redlands woman was killed when her car veered 
off the road and hit a light pole, said a deputy county coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Benson, 54, was alone in her car when it left the road at the 
intersection of Stonehill Drive and Niguel Road and hit the pole, said Christy 
Wurster, deputy coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson had been visiting her son in the Dana Point area, Wurster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wurster said there were no witnesses to the accident and it was not known if 
Benson was wearing a seat belt.

CRIMES AGAINST ANIMALS: SOMETIMES HORRIFIC, SOMETIMES JUST STRANGE; PETS: THE 
YEAR'S INCIDENTS INCLUDED DOGNAPING, ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT AND CRUELTY TOWARD 
1,000 TURTLES. 
</P>

<P>
 The victims were named Bubu and Maude. 
</P>
<P>
 One had been sexually assaulted, the other kidnaped. Brutal crimes by any 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But what set them apart from other victims in the San Fernando Valley is that 
Bubu and Maude are dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from being a year marked by a citywide drop in violence, 1994 may be 
remembered as a year in which Valley authorities reported a host of bizarre and 
horrifying animal crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The year began with the stealing of Maude, a 7-year-old Boston terrier, who 
was snatched from the fenced yard of her Woodland Hills home in mid-January. 
Maude's owner, Sandy Kemp, received a message on her answering machine 
demanding a $500 ransom for her beloved pet. 
</P>
<P>
 Panicked and desperate for their pooch's safe return, Kemp and her husband, 
Henri, arranged a clandestine meeting with Maude's captors at a Ventura 
Boulevard parking lot. In a telephone conversation prior to the meeting, Henri 
Kemp tried to negotiate with the dognapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I offered him $200 and he said he would shoot her, get rid of her or keep her 
for his own child," Kemp recalled. The men finally agreed on $450 and the 
meeting was set. 
</P>
<P>
 Henri also invited Los Angeles police, who brought 15 officers and a 
helicopter to the meeting spot. They arrested Damani Grey, a 19-year-old 
Northridge man, and Maude was safely returned to the Kemps. Grey got 120 days 
in jail after pleading guilty to attempted extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the canine crimes had such happy endings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubu, a German shepherd from Van Nuys, was caught on videotape being sexually 
assaulted by his owner's gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 The story unfolded after Bubu's owner was apparently tipped off by a 
housemate, who said he had witnessed encounters between Bubu and the gardener, 
said city prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner watched as Arturo Methias, a Northridge gardener who worked at the 
apartment house on Mondays, allegedly assaulted Bubu for five weeks in a row, 
prosecutors said. The owner videotaped the final incident, which he turned over 
to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Methias pleaded not guilty in November to five counts of animal abuse and five 
counts of sexually assaulting an animal. The case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most gruesome reptile-related crime this year, the putrid smell coming 
from a van led authorities in May to 1,112 turtles, more than 100 of which died 
after being baked, crushed and starved inside burlap bags. Another 979 were 
found severely dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the worst case of animal cruelty that I've ever seen," said 
Deputy City Atty. Don Cocek, after filing animal cruelty and neglect charges in 
September against Mark Rommel Osterholt, the 28-year-old operator of a Canoga 
Park seafood company. 
</P>
<P>
 A tip led authorities to a refrigerator Osterholt had allegedly rented in 
Orange County, where authorities uncovered another 1,367 turtles inside five 
plastic containers. Nearly half were dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the Valley Christmas tree mogul and his son who are currently on 
trial in connection with the death of a European deer that they displayed at a 
tree lot. 
</P>
<P>
 One of a herd of eight deer died this summer at a Granada Hills house where 
Stuart Miller and his son, William, kept the animals, city prosecutors said. 
City animal control officers said that the deer that died had chicken wire and 
coat hangers tangled in its antlers and around its neck. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a charge of animal cruelty, the Millers were charged in 
September with possessing a wild animal without a license. They have denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days ago, a defense attorney for the Millers complained in court that the 
timing of the trial -- in the week before Christmas -- was an attempt to 
portray his clients as the Grinches who killed Rudolph. The judge refused to 
delay the trial.

EDUCATOR RETURNS TO NATIVE LAND TO SHARE HER CLASSROOM EXPERTISE; VAN NUYS: 
LENI JACKSEN, FOUNDER OF LOCAL PRIVATE SCHOOL, SPENT TWO MONTHS IN EAST GERMAN 
TOWNS SHOWING TEACHERS HOW TO ENGAGE YOUNGSTERS IN CREATIVE ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leni Jacksen was bright, energetic and eager to help educate her country's 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also Jewish, which, in the Germany of the late 1930s, meant she could 
die or flee. She fled. 
</P>
<P>
 She came to America and spent the next half-century building a family and a 
teaching career. But, at 75, Jacksen, who founded the private Children's 
Community School in Van Nuys, still longed to help her native land. This fall, 
she got her chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacksen was asked by the Free University of Berlin to show teachers in former 
Communist territory how to introduce a democratic curriculum into the country's 
Kitas -- child care centers for youngsters under 12. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent two months in towns that used to comprise East Germany. She found 
that the Berlin Wall may have come down in 1989, but the barricades to a new, 
more enlightened post-Cold War Germany aren't quite ready to tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take 10 or 20 years before things change," said Jacksen, who returned 
last month to her home in Beverly Hills. "Teachers don't really know what to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacksen was shocked to find teachers merely supervised youngsters, never 
engaging them in creative activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no painting, no playing with blocks, and no animals," she said. 
"All they're doing is making sure the kids don't get hurt or kill each other." 
</P>
<P>
 She believes she did get through to a few instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I got five, that's a lot," she said. "But those five will get another 
five, and so on." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest reason for the lack of creativity, Jacksen said, is that the 
former East German territory has no recent experience with democracy, whose 
educational emphasis is on thinking and interaction rather than obedience. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two generations brought up by Communism, and, before that, it was 
fascism," she said. "The idea was to educate the child for the state." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, Jacksen served as a school principal in Berlin, "but that was just 
another job. It could have been Paris or Milan." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, she had an opportunity to make a difference, and whatever may 
develop in Germany's future, Jacksen knows she did her best. She says she has 
no interest in hanging on to hatred for the nation that put Adolf Hitler in 
power. She also says she experienced no anti-Semitism during her visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, all that was over with," said Jacksen. "I only saw that you had 
people who needed help in a field I am familiar with. There is something in me 
that hasn't forgotten Germany."

INDIA'S TURNING 'ASIAN KOOL' INTO VERY HOT SOUNDS; POP MUSIC: RECORD CHIEFS BET 
THE NEXT GLOBAL HITS WILL BE RAP MONOLOGUES TINGED WITH A PUNJABI FOLK GENRE 
KNOWN AS BHANGRA .

 They come in all sorts of fancy packages, colors and catchy names. Many are 
imports. They're not the latest detergents to hit India, but in a way they, 
too, are products of its liberalized market and changing society. 
</P>
<P>
 For anybody who thinks Indian music means the twanging sitar strings of Ravi 
Shankar or the booming tabla drums of Zakir Hussain, the new generation of 
popular singers here is as unnervingly shocking as Luciano Pavarotti doing the 
moonwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Check out these lyrics to one recent hit, "Stop That": 
</P>
<P>
 My grandpa wears diapers, on his specs he has wipers  
</P>
<P>
 I have played football on Mt. Everest, pushed a train with both hands  
</P>
<P>
 I am a little kid 100 years old, too early to get married.  
</P>
<P>
 The Gita it isn't, admittedly. But such rap monologues, spun to an 
amalgamation of reggae, rap and pop music, with a tinge of the Punjabi folk 
genre known as bhangra, have become wildly popular among Indians at home and 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some record companies have been willing to bet millions that this new 
India-influenced sound, commonly known as "Asian Kool," is going to be the next 
big crossover success of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning -- that is, in 1992 -- there was Baba Sehgal, who sang 
"Thanda Thanda Paani" ("Cold, Cold Water") an unabashed copy of Vanilla Ice's 
single "Ice, Ice, Baby." This maiden endeavor sold a million cassettes, almost 
doubling the Indian sales of a typical Michael Jackson release, music industry 
insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lean and hungry, the newcomers have imitated Sehgal. All it takes is a recent 
Western song. The lyrics are erased and replaced with a generous helping of 
spicy words (often a mix of English and Hindi or Punjabi) and a dash of 
Indian-ness. And, voila! there's an Indian song of the '90s which, they hope, 
is set to rock the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who doesn't know how to sing can become famous by talking away," 
observed Jasmine Barucha, who reputedly is the first Indian musician to have 
her video beamed on MTV Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Time was, the lyricists of India's Tin Pan Alley penned verse inspired by the 
lips and flowing hair of a damsel or a glass of wine. In India's new brand of 
rap, the nymph is omnipresent, but the focus has shifted from her lips . . . 
downward, shall we say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The popularity of this kind of music is catching on," said Sunil Menghrajani, 
regional manager of Magnasound, a recording company that produces cassettes and 
videos for Baba Sehgal and a host of other artists. "One, because it is novel. 
And two, there is something familiar in spite of its being novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have at the moment albums of about a dozen artists in the market and all 
of them are doing quite well. Baba Sehgal was just the tip of the iceberg, the 
rest is yet to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Indian company, Crescendo, has released more than 30 titles of Punjabi 
bhangra rap. C.T. Philip, manager for North India, says they are selling well. 
</P>
<P>
 But the local artists face the same problem that foreign acts from Ace of Base 
to Bryan Adams experience in the Asian market: widespread bootlegging of video 
and audio recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 Easily available counterfeits have driven down the sales of Crescendo's 
offerings. "The pirated cassettes sell at half the price," Philip said. "There 
are bound to be better sales if we reduce the price of our cassettes, but this 
is one area we cannot compromise upon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 India's enthusiasm for Asian Kool makes him optimistic anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of the pirated cassettes, there is still a big market potential, and 
in the future we hope to sell even better than what Baba Sehgal did," said the 
Delhi-based Philip. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroes of India's new music range from college dropouts to dancers who 
just want to try out their voices. None seems to have had any formal training. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, newcomer Piyush Soni is said to have had a "revelation" that 
prompted him to take up music. Now he is due to release his first album, titled 
"Chokkra" ("Boy"). 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most successful of the Asian rappers is Apache Indian (real name 
Steve Kapur), who has become a cult figure. A native of Jalandhar in Punjab who 
now lives in Britain, his single "Arranged Marriage," with lyrics questioning 
the Indian institution set to melodies of bhangra and reggae, was an instant 
hit here. 
</P>
<P>
 When he visited India soon after the video version of the song was screened 
Asia-wide on MTV, he was mobbed by thousands of enthusiastic teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, two more imports from the United Kingdom -- one known as the "god 
of bhangra ," the other as the "king of disc jockeys" -- put on an Asian Kool 
show in a new discotheque on Delhi's outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Malkit Singh (the Punjabi-born "god") has already sold 9 million recordings. 
Also dubbed by his agents the "simple Sikh from Jalandhar," he says, " Bhangra 
is what I do best and that is what I plan to continue doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The "king," on the other hand, is a past master in remixing old Hindi film 
songs, adding a modern synthesizer and his voice-over in between the original 
words. Bally Sagoo has signed a $2.5-million, five-year deal with Sony Music, 
released his first album of remixes, and is climbing the British charts. He is 
working on a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent evening at the Oasis, a leading Delhi discotheque, the young crowd 
on the moat-encircled dance floor was unmistakably in favor of the new Indian 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cool, man!" one patron yelled happily as he and the others in denim or 
mini-skirts danced into the wee hours to the Asian Kool strains of Hindified 
rap and disco bhangra.

TV'S 'YOU LIKE ME, YOU REALLY LIKE ME' FACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The biggest new hit on television, "ER," does not have a single major 
household name in its regular cast. 
</P>
<P>
 TV's Tim Allen was a relative unknown before "Home Improvement," except on the 
comedy circuit. Same for Roseanne. Same for Jerry Seinfeld. Same for Brett 
Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Television has a history of creating its own stars, and coming from motion 
pictures is rarely a qualification. The few onetime film headliners succeeding 
in television today include Candice Bergen of "Murphy Brown," Angela Lansbury 
of "Murder, She Wrote," Chuck Norris of "Walker, Texas Ranger" and Sam 
Waterston of "Law & Order." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran executives and producers Aaron Spelling, Grant Tinker and Fred 
Silverman, say performer likability and comfort are all-important requirements 
for television stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 But several younger executives, ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert and 
his NBC counterpart, Warren Littlefield, think other significant factors have 
come into play. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne, for instance, may not be all that likable or a comfortable refuge to 
many viewers, but her outstanding series, Harbert notes, has "relatability. 
There's a ton of people out there she really talks to." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an edgier era, from sensational newscasts to tougher entertainment 
series. Even commercials, such as the slashing rivalry between AT&T and MCI, 
have that edge; and "Roseanne" fittingly broke ground in depicting blue-collar 
worries over money and other social matters. 
</P>
<P>
 While Harbert thinks "relatability" is critical for such current stars as 
Roseanne and Butler, Littlefield adds that the proliferation of TV alternatives 
also makes it important "to look for a uniqueness" in performers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to describe it," he says, "is a signature style, a presence, 
that makes performers stand out. Jerry Seinfeld brings that. So does Tim Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once upon a time, TV was thought of as a baby-sitter, and comfort was a key 
ingredient. Today, I think it's distinctiveness and originality (that make the 
difference) because of the many choices." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty of succeeding in today's TV competition, even if you're a top 
movie figure, was made apparent again Sunday when Woody Allen, whose new film 
"Bullets Over Broadway," is getting raves, appeared in an ABC remake of his 
play, "Don't Drink the Water," and it finished 85th among 96 network shows last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 While reality TV series and a loss of innocence -- this is hardly the age of 
"Father Knows Best" or even "The Cosby Show" -- have sharply changed the tone 
of TV, there are certain constants in the creation of television stars. 
</P>
<P>
 And those constants, which include likability perhaps above all, become 
obvious when you scan the ratings and network lineups and see all the 
home-grown headliners. Many, of course, including Robin Williams, Danny DeVito 
and Bruce Willis, have gone on to films, but the TV factory keeps churning out 
what it hopes are hot new faces with its special chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are aware of," says Littlefield, "is that an unknown is your biggest 
upside. You can fail, but I don't think there's anything as powerful for a TV 
audience as discovering an unknown and making him or her into a star. It's a 
very personal discovery, and you can't get that with established stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Spelling, whose company produces the "Beverly Hills, 90210" and "Melrose 
Place" series, says, "A TV star has to come into your bedroom, your kitchen. . 
. . Is the audience comfortable with that person in your bedroom? You're 
divorced when you go to a movie -- you see the stars and you like them or you 
don't. But seeing somebody in two movies a year is different from seeing 
somebody 26 or 34 weeks a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the research we do, we don't ask: 'Tell us if you liked him in the 
show.' We ask: 'Do you like him or her?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Says Tinker, former head of NBC and MTM Enterprises: "I think likability is 
very high up there. I remember when it came down to two finalists to host 'The 
Hollywood Squares.' Dan Rowan was one and Peter Marshall was the other. Rowan 
did it perfectly. Marshall made more mistakes, but he was just so likable and 
human making the mistakes that we gave him the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Tinker and Silverman -- who ran programming at ABC, CBS and NBC -- say that 
the number of movie stars who succeeded big in a television series is 
comparatively small. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the crossover is easier for TV stars than movie stars," says 
Spelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the latest to try are David Caruso, formerly of "NYPD Blue," and Rob 
Morrow of "Northern Exposure." However, Caruso's replacement in "NYPD Blue," 
Jimmy Smits, was a star in television's "L.A. Law" but didn't break through in 
a major way in his film attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie stars, Silverman maintains, are usually popular with an audience that is 
smaller than "what we think of (as large) in television. That's why a lot of 
movie stars don't draw flies (on TV). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's much easier for a broad-based TV star like Tim Allen (whose film 
'The Santa Clause' is a smash) to score in a movie than for a movie star to 
score in television. There are some exceptions. Clint Eastwood would probably 
draw a very large television audience. And probably Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks. 
But I don't know whether Charlie Sheen and his brother (Emilio Estevez) would 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arnold Schwarzenegger could be in the Top 10 (TV series) tomorrow in an 
action show. Danny DeVito (formerly of 'Taxi') could come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman adds that "Candice Bergen surprised a lot of people, but it was just 
the perfect marriage of performer and character." And he predicts that "Tim 
Allen in four or five years would never consider doing another television 
show," what with top movie stars getting astonishing multimillion-dollar 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. There's always someone waiting in the wings. Says Steve Warner, 
senior vice president of program planning for CBS: "What does attract people to 
television is the freshness of the faces." 
</P>
<P>
 True. That's certainly the case with shows like the freshly minted "ER." But, 
alas, there are those other fine TV attractions as well, like the creepy 
daytime talk shows where the human race seems to sink to its deepest depths, 
and where likability and comfort seem like words from a distant, civilized 
planet.

COMMENTARY; CAN 200 CRITICS BE WRONG? (MAYBE); MOVIES: 'PULP FICTION' IS A DARK 
COMEDY WHERE VIEWERS GASP, THEN LAUGH, THEN LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT SICK JOKE. 
ISN'T IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In its long and checkered history, Hollywood has been compared to some pretty 
odious institutions, but it took Quentin Tarantino's violent gangster comedy 
"Pulp Fiction," and its accompanying tidal wave of rave reviews, to inspire a 
comparison with the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like contemporary tobacco chiefs who deny any link between cigarettes and 
cancer, Hollywood executives will be sitting before congressional committees 10 
years from now in adamant denial," wrote USA Today columnist Joe Urschel, in a 
severe rebuke of "Pulp Fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 "They will continue to callously brush off the connections between their 
products and the violence in society -- despite an avalanche of scientific 
studies showing the connection." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not Hollywood, or even "Pulp Fiction," that has worked Urschel into 
such a lather. It's the critics who bought into the film's "brazen depravity," 
and in their four-star enthusiasm sent thousands of innocent lambs to their 
psychic slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike the tobacco industry," Urschel wrote, "Hollywood has a powerful 
coterie of sycophants and enablers in the press who wrap this craven 
merchandising in the cloak of artistic expression and try to elevate it to the 
level of something holy and good." 
</P>
<P>
 In a follow-up telephone conversation, Urschel pressed his attack on film 
critics even further, saying we take no moral responsibility for the antisocial 
movies we often praise, reviewing them instead as "distinct and isolated pieces 
of art that have no effect or afterlife outside the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 (Last week, the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. gave six Golden Globe Award 
nominations to "Pulp Fiction," including best film drama. Earlier this month, 
the Los Angeles Film Critics voted "Pulp Fiction" best picture of the year, the 
National Board of Review voted a tie between "Pulp" and "Forrest Gump," and the 
New York Film Critics Circle honored "Quiz Show.") 
</P>
<P>
 As one who stands accused -- I have been praising "Pulp Fiction" since its 
world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May -- I'd like to be able to 
dismiss Urschel's indictment for the Religious Right ideological hysteria it 
resembles. But I can't. 
</P>
<P>
 First, I've known Urschel for 16 years (before he became a pundit, he edited 
my reviews at both the Detroit Free Press and USA Today) and he's a perfectly 
bright and reasonable fellow. Second, he is far from alone in his outrage. I've 
received more letters from readers about "Pulp Fiction" than any other film 
this year, most of them condemning Newsday's sanguine critical coverage of it, 
and Hollywood insiders say its warped mix of humor and violence has taken it 
out of the running for the Oscar. Finally, though I believe Urschel badly 
misreads the appeal and potential harmfulness of "Pulp Fiction," he does raise 
some valid questions about the nature of reviewing movies in mass audience 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Do critics who see 150 or more movies a year go overboard in reviewing the 
stylistically fresh ones that come along, regardless of their content, morality 
or accessibility to general viewers? 
</P>
<P>
 And are we too inured to the extremes of sex and violence to be able to 
provide fair warnings to the occasional moviegoer? 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't take somebody who hasn't been to a movie in two years and plop them 
in front of this one," Urschel says. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the nearly 100 "Pulp Fiction" reviews from around the country that I 
just read, the answer to the first question is "yes." Most of us probably do 
get a little giddy over the arrival of a new talent like Tarantino, and 
exaggerate his importance. But did critics fail, as a group, to adequately 
characterize the violence, profanity and drug use in the film? No. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't just offend some audiences," wrote the Chicago Tribune's Michael 
Wilmington in a tone echoed by many of his colleagues. "It will offend the 
living hell out of them." 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't seen the movie or been caught in the cross-fire of water-cooler 
debate over it, "Pulp Fiction" is a series of cleverly interwoven stories set 
in a film-noirish Los Angeles underworld. It stars a pair of amiably chatty mob 
assassins (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), a double-crossing boxer (Bruce 
Willis), a pair of Bonnie-and-Clyde wanna-bes (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), 
and an array of mob bosses, molls, girlfriends, drug dealers and redneck 
crazies who fill out its twisted human landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, people are riddled with bullets, a victim's brains are 
splattered like pureed mango all over the inside of a car, a drug-overdosed 
woman has a six-inch hypodermic needle rammed into her heart, a man is tied up 
and sodomized. All in good fun, Tarantino-style. 
</P>
<P>
 Many critics made a game effort to put a moral spin on its outlandishness -- 
themes of redemption and loyalty do wend their way through the material. But it 
would be preposterous to suggest "Pulp Fiction" contains any serious social 
commentary, and few critics claimed it did. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Pulp Fiction' is rubbish about scum," wrote M.V. Moorhead, of the Phoenix, 
Ariz., New Times, quickly adding, "It's also very funny and entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino himself has never described "Pulp Fiction" as anything other than a 
'90s movie version of a '30s pulp novel, Raymond Chandler on smack, and after 
two films ("Pulp" and "Reservoir Dogs") and four produced screenplays ("True 
Romance" was directed by Tony Scott, and Oliver Stone rewrote and directed 
"Natural Born Killers"), all we really know about him is that he has a 
brilliant ear for dialogue, a gift for story structure, an irrepressible 
passion for actors, movies and big scenes, and the daring of a daylight 
pickpocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the 31-year-old high-school dropout and video-store guru has the 
native intellect and social vision to go the distance as an auteur -- whether 
he has anything, after all, to say -- remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, his audacious use of the medium, his ability to 
simultaneously shock and amuse, has, indeed, been catnip to the bored legions 
of American movie critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Being surprised, seeing things done in different ways, discovering new talent 
-- these are the all-too-rare events that restore and invigorate the faith of 
full-time moviegoers. They are also the things that often drive a wedge between 
reviewers, at least of general-circulation publications, and those readers 
merely looking for advice for an evening's entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream moviegoers are generally skeptical of a film that critics agree on; 
experience tells them it is bound to be artsy-fartsy and boring. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Pulp Fiction" is, from all indications (reviews, advertising, 
word-of-mouth), a mainstream Hollywood movie with major stars, beautiful sets, 
lots of action and big laughs. If it is also contains extremes of profanity and 
violence, so what? Sounds like "Lethal Weapon" to me. 
</P>
<P>
 All those elements are present, but perverted. Tarantino uses John Travolta 
against expectations; he's Vinny Barbarino gone to middle-age seed, a bloated, 
dewy-eyed assassin who kills people between fixes of heroin and fast foods. The 
action sequences play like balloons with their knots untied, spinning off in 
crazily unpredictable directions. You've heard all the swear words before, but 
never sewn together in such colorful patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 And the individual acts of violence, while never as grueling or inhumane as 
the torture scene in "Reservoir Dogs," have elements of surprise that demand a 
response, either laughter or stupefying moral outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 For viewers who went in expecting a conventional movie, it must have been like 
walking into a club where everyone knew the password and secret handshake but 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 In a column that appeared as a counterpoint to critic Jack Garner's four-star 
review in the Rochester, N.Y., Democrat & Chronicle, Lee Krenis More warned 
readers to be wary of critics' praise of "Pulp Fiction" because "the movie 
they're bubbling over may not be the same one you end up fidgeting through . . 
. 2 1/2 hours of gangster Angst in which the only moral law is the law of the 
jungle and style is the only value that counts." 
</P>
<P>
 True. The movie is a tour de force of personal style. Tarantino is to 
hard-boiled crime fiction what Charlie Parker was to jazz -- a raw talent 
putting new riffs on old tunes, and it definitely narrows the audiences. 
Tarantino has scavenged his memory bank for favorite bits from other films, 
seasoned them with pop-culture references and molded it all into something 
simultaneously familiar and original. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing those hip references is part of the fun, if you care , and part of 
the confusion if you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a common flaw in the reviews of "Pulp Fiction," it was that 
critics fashioned their analyses for the most knowledgeable fans. How many 
people would know what's so funny about having a "Douglas Sirk steak" appear on 
the menu at a '50s Hollywood-motif restaurant? A half-dozen critics chuckled at 
the reference in their reviews; none explained it. (Sirk was a director whose 
films were often laced with subtle ironies about American culture.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, people shocked at the content of "Pulp Fiction" have to take some of 
the responsibility. There were warning signs in virtually every review, but you 
do have to get all the way through them. Readers often glance at critics' 
ratings, scan a capsule, check the ad, and hop into the family car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guy called a few years ago madder than hell at me because he'd taken his 
wife and kids to see 'Blue Velvet,' " says the Democrat & Chronicle's Garner. 
"I said, 'Why did you do that?' He said, 'Well, you gave it four stars!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The acquired taste required to enjoy "Pulp Fiction" is dark comedy. It's the 
realm of Shuttle disaster and O.J. Simpson jokes, where you half-choke on 
laughs that begin with a gasp. No, no, no, you can't laugh at that . But you 
do, and then look forward to the next one. After every magnitude-10 national 
disaster, psychologists gently assure us that the inevitable sick jokes are OK, 
even healthy. They relieve tension, promote healing -- enjoy! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Movies have made light of just about every serious subject known -- war 
("MASH"), nuclear annihilation ("Dr. Strangelove"), death ("The Loved One"), 
divorce ("The War of the Roses"), suicidal compulsion ("Harold and Maude"), 
even Christ ("The Life of Brian") -- and audiences who enjoyed them incurred 
the temporary wrath of those who were offended. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pulp Fiction" has sounded a greater alarm for some people because urban 
violence seems such an unstoppable force, a growing sore on America's soul, and 
if you are able to laugh at the problem, you must be part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cultural anthropologists are going to look back on American society and look 
at the audiences' reaction to this movie," says Nina Easton, a Washington-based 
journalist who often writes about changing values for the Los Angeles Times 
magazine. "It's a sign of how casual violence has become." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what's made 'Pulp Fiction' such a flash point for people," says USA 
Today's Urschel. "It has no redeeming value in itself; it's just a joke on 
violence, on life . . . It's the absolute essence of amorality." 
</P>
<P>
 No, it isn't. It's just a movie, rubbish about scum, and very, very funny. It 
may be a milestone in Quentin Tarantino's career, but not in humanity's march 
to oblivion. If all we have to worry about is the great plague of movie 
criticism and the tastes of audiences who laugh at sick jokes, the future will 
take care of itself.

CBS STILL HAS 'HOPE' FOR A CURE; TELEVISION: DAVID E. KELLEY'S 'CHICAGO HOPE' 
WAS SQUASHED IN A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED SHOWDOWN OF MEDICAL SHOWS. A NEW TIME SLOT 
MAY BE JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two medical dramas set in the same town. Two prominent creators. One time 
period. One winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome: One show gets a clean bill of health. The other is disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how many television writers summed up the highly publicized showdown 
last September between NBC's "ER" and CBS' "Chicago Hope." To "ER," the victor 
of the Thursday at 10 p.m. conflict, went the spoils: huge ratings, tons of 
publicity and accolades to creator Michael Crichton. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting hit by a steamroller, "Chicago Hope" has been given a 
prescription that CBS hopes will cure its ratings ailments and turn it into a 
long-running hit too: a move to a proven time slot on one of the network's 
strongest nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Jan. 2, "Chicago Hope" will slip into the Monday schedule at 10 p.m., 
home for the past 3 1/2 years to "Northern Exposure" (which is moving to 
Wednesdays at 10 p.m.). In an effort to build interest and momentum for the 
change, CBS will repeat four episodes on four nights this week -- today, 
Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, all at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 For creator and executive producer David E. Kelley -- who is also the creator 
and executive producer for CBS' "Picket Fences," which has won the Emmy Award 
for best drama the past two years -- switching "Chicago Hope" to Mondays is 
just what the doctor ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "To be occupying that prime slot is a real strong demonstration on the 
network's part that they consider us to be their future," Kelley said in an 
interview at his 20th Century Fox office. "Obviously a lot of people watch CBS 
on Mondays." 
</P>
<P>
 (NBC is countering CBS' move with its own preventive medicine: a rerun of the 
two-hour "ER" pilot from 9 to 11 p.m. on Jan. 2.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicago Hope" stars Mandy Patinkin, Adam Arkin, E.G. Marshall, Roxanne Hart 
and Hector Elizondo as a group of skilled surgeons at fictional Chicago Hope 
Hospital. The character-driven series revolves around the stress of their 
professional and personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 2 episode, scripted by Kelley, is titled "Quarantine" and puts many 
of the characters together in a locked room after they are exposed to a 
potentially fatal virus. The tensions and complicated relations between the 
characters are exposed layer by layer, at first humorously but progressively 
more confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley said the episode is the culmination of several weeks of character 
development, which may be why viewers have not gravitated to "Chicago Hope" as 
quickly as to "ER": "This is a show that we knew from the onset would take a 
little bit of time. The audience needs to get to know the characters. Learning 
who and what they are is a slow process. Once you get a sense of who they are, 
it becomes a richer show." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley was philosophical and even gracious as he discussed the showdown 
between "ER" and "Chicago Hope," saying he has no bitterness about it nor about 
the attention his competitor has received. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us can sit here and fault the network for a 10 p.m. Thursday time 
slot," Kelley said. "CBS thought they were giving us a strong time slot, and 
it's not a bad one. We just ran into a real train, coupled with the strong NBC 
Thursday lineup, that prohibited us from succeeding there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley is not unfamiliar with time period woes. He has been frustrated for the 
last two seasons by the scheduling of "Picket Fences" on Fridays at 10 p.m., 
saying the show airs at a time "when most of the audience is out. There, we're 
competing with lifestyles, not other programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has hopes that "Picket Fences" will eventually be moved to another 
night, he said it probably won't happen this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As an Emmy winner for "Picket Fences" and, earlier, for "L.A. Law," doesn't he 
have the clout to insist on a better time period? 
</P>
<P>
 "For both 'Chicago Hope' and 'Picket Fences,' we have been arguing for the 
best time slots," he said. "A show deserves the clout, not the producer. A 
producer should not be able to demand and get time slots. If they deliver a 
show that is worthy of getting a better showcase, then they should get it. 
That's how I feel about 'Picket Fences.' But I wouldn't ever ask CBS to move 
'Picket Fences' for the sake of preserving my relationship with them."  
</P>
<P>
 He's grateful that "Chicago Hope" is getting another opportunity: "We still 
feel very proud of our product, and we like to think that our shows are getting 
better as we go along. I think our numbers will come up when we move to 
Mondays. But they will never be 'ER's' numbers. 'ER' is a phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS Entertainment President Peter Tortorici said he has the utmost confidence 
in "Chicago Hope's" ratings potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is too good a show for audiences to miss it," he said. "Monday night is 
our franchise night, and we have the kinds of viewers that will welcome 
'Chicago Hope' to the evening. We feel the move will help us get the audience 
that will make 'Chicago Hope' a hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the loss to "ER" on Thursdays, Tortorici said, "We went into a situation 
where there was a jump ball. We were up against a tradition of NBC's strong 10 
p.m. slot and a strong lead-in, and we gave it our best shot. Going into the 
season, we had confidence that we had the better show. As it turned out, they 
did a marvelous job, and we didn't get the attention we felt we should have. 
So, next." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley, asked about the differences in the two series, said: " 'Chicago Hope' 
is a show about relationships, with the medical arena as a backdrop."  
</P>
<P>
 " 'ER,' from what I've seen, really tries to capture the frenzy of that 
particular arena and deliver to its audience the tumult and adrenaline of a 
certain place."  
</P>
<P>
 Kelley said he was bothered by some of the commentary on "Chicago Hope's" 
ratings defeat: "What was frustrating was that a lot of those critics who did 
champion us in the beginning were suddenly writing articles 10 days later with 
analyses of why 'ER' won and why 'Chicago Hope' lost. Sometimes when you're the 
underdog, you rely on and hope for the media to point out that, even though the 
numbers aren't what we hoped for, the quality is still there." 
</P>
<P>
 He was particularly irked by criticism that "Chicago Hope" was more 
old-fashioned than "ER." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's typical of some of the stuff that came out after the numbers did," he 
said. "It was like, 'Since "ER" is new, let's characterize "Chicago Hope" as 
old.' I guess we are more conventional, but we try to tell stories that are 
rich in human drama and character. If those stories are old-fashioned, then 
I'll be obsolete very soon."

LOT OF PROJECTS THESE DAYS, BUT SHE'S PLENTY BUSY AT 70, APPEARING IN THE FILM 
'READY TO WEAR' AND DISCUSSING HER LATEST BOOK.

<P>
 If there's a heaven and Diana Vreeland made the cut, she's up there smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The legendary fashion editor "gave me my first break," says Lauren Bacall, 
herself alive and well with forearms dripping thin gold bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half a century after she modeled for the cover of Harper's Bazaar, 
thus launching a film career, Bacall is playing a character inspired by 
Vreeland in Robert Altman's "Ready to Wear," which opened Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 This time the editor's name is Slim Chrysler, but "the history is the same," 
Bacall says about the editor. Even the name has a history of sorts: Slim was 
the name of Bacall's character in that first movie, 1944's "To Have and Have 
Not." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond their larger-than-life personas, Vreeland and Bacall don't have much in 
common. The late editor bordered on the outlandish and was a bit of a 
screecher. The actress with the famous deep-throaty voice comes on cool and 
composed. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone still searching for signs of typecasting, Bacall is happy to recall 
her other assignment for Altman: In his ill-fated "Health," she played an 
83-year-old virgin. 
</P>
<P>
 Her dry baritone laugh rumples the air of the hotel suite where, dressed in a 
mahogany silk trouser suit, sitting on a French salon chair and separating a 
tangerine from its rind, the actress is conducting interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when young women practiced that voice, used those same 
immortal words, "You know how to whistle, don't you?" that Bacall delivered to 
Humphrey Bogart in "To Have and Have Not."  
</P>
<P>
 Her long legs dangling from the piano top, Bacall gave the pianist-President 
of the United States, Harry S. Truman -- The Look and it titillated the nation 
and infuriated the President's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put your chin on your chest to hold your head steady and then look up" is 
Bacall's clinical explanation of that look 50 years later. Not that you should 
try it: She says she thinks it would "look pretty silly" on today's rialto. 
</P>
<P>
 While the public's interest in Bacall has waned, her most enduring marketable 
asset remains her voice, currently heard in commercials for cat food and cruise 
ships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movies and plays don't start with me," Bacall says, assessing her 
professional status. "I'm just not offered a lot of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 When the focus is on her, it's often in the past tense. Lately, however, 
things have been buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last year I've been really working a lot. I'm certainly not complaining, 
but between this movie and the book, it's been quite unreal," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," published in the fall by Knopf, is described by Bacall as "a book about 
feelings and survival and absolutely not a part two" to her 1979 autobiography, 
"By Myself." That, she says, was all about "coming from nowhere to somewhere 
and what happens along the way": Betty Perske, a Jewish girl from Brooklyn who 
went to Hollywood before she was 20, made lots of movies (she says she's 
proudest of "The Fan" and "Designing Woman," in which she plays a fashion 
plate) and married two famous husbands (Jason Robards after Bogart's death). 
</P>
<P>
 She also had three children, was briefly engaged to Frank Sinatra, won two 
Tonys ("Applause" and "Woman of the Year"), a National Book Award ("By Myself") 
and a reputation as one of the last of the old-fashioned glamour queens. 
</P>
<P>
 But that said: How many lives do you have to write about? 
</P>
<P>
 This time, she says, she confined herself to "some things I felt strongly 
about, I wanted my children and friends to know. They were better expressed on 
paper than vocally." 
</P>
<P>
 Knopf printed 200,000 copies of "Now," but recently advised book stores to 
slash the price in half. Bacall professes not to know about this -- "it's done 
incredibly well wherever I've gone" -- and insists she has no regrets she 
didn't write yet "another gossipy book." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a pretty tacky way to live, and my life hasn't been about 
that," she says. "I love to make money the same as anyone else, but sure as 
hell not that way." 
</P>
<P>
 At 70, the actress lives in a rambling, memento-filled co-op at the Dakota, 
and appears fit and trim, her long frame folded comfortably into the chair, her 
still-thick blonde mane brushing her collar. A question about facial surgery, 
put to her by a member of the audience when she appeared at the 92nd Street Y 
in October, received only a withering stare. Now the suggestion that her social 
schedule might be daunting for someone half her age isn't treated as a 
compliment. "I am a social butterfly," she bristles, the famous blue-green eyes 
suddenly ice hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, she's frazzled, she says, from just having spent 2 1/2 days moving 
herself out of the house she sold in the Hamptons. After the holidays, she's 
off to France and Great Britain for her book's publication abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a basket case," she says, her aura of supreme self-confidence a 
misconception she discussed in her book. " Angst is a natural state for me," 
she wrote, but after having presented quite another picture to the public for 
so long it has become necessary for her to explain the image. "I think it's the 
voice," she supposes. "It gives people the impression that I'm formidable when 
I'm really quite vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "That idea that I'm always in control simply came out of my first movie. The 
minute people see you as something that clicks, you're pigeonholed. I get a lot 
of mail from people who are very generous in complimenting me as a role model 
of a strong woman who always speaks her mind, who's impervious to the frailties 
of life. But they couldn't be more wrong."

DESPITE DIP IN VALLEY CRIME, TRAGEDIES TAKE THEIR TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although statistically the San Fernando Valley was a safer place this year, 
there was no shortage of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to fears, the year began and ended with the killings of peace officers, 
the very professionals on whom residents depend to keep their communities safe. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, a rookie officer with the Los Angeles Police Department was 
gunned down outside a Northridge house by a teen-ager who also killed his 
father before killing himself. And this month, a fatal gun battle erupted 
between a robber and a Los Angeles County Safety Police officer in the parking 
lot of a Canoga Park shoe store. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite a number of high-profile crimes, 1994 statistics through Nov. 30 
-- the latest available -- show that homicides fell 44% from the same period 
last year, from 129 to 72. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, more people were killed in car accidents in the Valley than were 
slain. Rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults and all property crimes except 
auto burglaries also fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department attributes this year's drop in violent crime 
to the Northridge earthquake, a gang truce and the impact of community-based 
policing. It also happens to follow a nationwide trend. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the reductions in overall crime, the public's perception of 
violence has grown, in large part due to the random nature of many high-profile 
crimes and because many feel their middle-class Valley neighborhoods are no 
longer immune. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kenneth Brondell, a retired LAPD detective who has lived in the Valley for 
nearly four decades, 1994 was the year that random violence struck home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be there weren't as many guns, and people just weren't as 
violent," said Brondell, the father of slain LAPD Officer Christy Lynne 
Hamilton, who died in the line of duty this year. "But nowadays, if you just 
happen to be walking down the street, driving your car or shopping at a mall, 
you become a victim." 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying of Hamilton, a 45-year-old LAPD rookie, was one of the year's 
first murders. 
</P>
<P>
 A bullet tore through an opening in Hamilton's bulletproof vest and into her 
chest as she responded to a report of gunshots at the Northridge home of 
17-year-old Christopher Golly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton became a victim of Golly's plans to kill his father, 49-year-old 
Steven Golly, then ambush police officers responding to the crime, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Golly carried out his fantasy on Feb. 22, gunning down his father 
and shooting at three patrol cars with a military-style semiautomatic rifle. 
The gunfire struck Hamilton, who became only the second female LAPD officer to 
die in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubled youth, whom friends described as a drug user, added a twist to 
his plan by killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to last year, robberies fell 17.1%, rapes dropped 14.3%, followed by 
a slight decrease in aggravated assaults, according to LAPD statistics through 
November. All property crimes, with the exception of auto burglaries, also 
dropped this year, including a 16.2% decline in auto thefts and a 9.3% decrease 
in burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, LAPD officials gave residents a rare glimpse into some of the worst 
pockets of vice and violence in the Valley, releasing detailed reports on 
high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the crime zones were close to Sepulveda and Van Nuys boulevards, which 
have long been known as magnets for prostitution and drug traffic. Much of the 
violence was blamed on spreading gang activity, increased drug use and a 
growing pool of new victims -- illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the LAPD's five Valley divisions began for the first time to 
systematically track criminals and crime trends by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-tech help comes at an important juncture for the San Fernando Valley, 
where no neighborhood seemed safe this year: 
</P>
<P>
 * In August, three decomposed bodies were discovered sealed inside steamer 
trunks in a Northridge storage facility. This week, police identified the 
victims as Eri Tri Darmawan, Gina Sutan Aswar and Surish Michandani, each of 
whom had been beaten. Police have issued an arrest warrant for 30-year-old 
Harnoko Dewantono from Indonesia, suspected of committing the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 * In October, a gunman fatally shot Reuben Ortiz, 36, at a weekend softball 
game in Van Nuys. Ortiz and three other people had gone in search of a man who 
moments earlier had threatened to kill a group of their friends and family 
members inside a Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Park restroom. After spotting the man at 
a bus stop, Ortiz approached him armed with a baseball bat. The man fired a 
gun, killing Ortiz and wounding Andrew Reyes, 37. 
</P>
<P>
 * A house fire led police to the discovery in October of Berneda McMackin, 77, 
who had been beaten and stabbed inside her Van Nuys home. Her assailant 
apparently set the house on fire to hide the crime. A few days later and a few 
miles away, 72-year-old Aliza Levi died in a similar fashion after startling a 
burglar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earlier this month, Thaddeus Jackson, a popular North Hollywood 
middle-school teacher, was charged with murder in connection with the beating 
death of a man who accidentally drove into a parked truck outside Jackson's 
Reseda apartment. Jackson was one of six men charged with using pool cues, 
chunks of wood and their fists and feet to beat Julio Aguilar, 23, to death and 
injure his brother, Jose Aguilar, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, violence also broke out at Universal CityWalk, where eight people 
were arrested after authorities used pepper spray to break up a melee between 
rival gang members who fought with fists and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrities even joined the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar-winning actor Jack Nicholson was charged in February with misdemeanor 
vandalism and assault for allegedly using a golf club to smash the windshield 
of a Mercedes-Benz during a traffic dispute in North Hollywood, according to 
city prosecutors. The charges were later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor James Caan, famous for his role as a hotheaded gangster in "The 
Godfather," was released on his own recognizance in March after being arrested 
because a rap musician accused him of pulling a gun during an argument, police 
said. No charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a year of new crime trends. Thieves sought to get rich by stealing 
car air bags, cloning cellular telephones and hunting Valley residents with 
Rolex watches. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last two weeks, LAPD officials have reported as many as a dozen 
follow-home robberies. Thieves have targeted diners and holiday shoppers and 
followed them to their homes, where they have been robbed at gunpoint of their 
purses, gifts and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Other criminals chose simpler ways to make a quick buck this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, police arrested Richard Siddons, 33, of Tarzana, on suspicion of 
rigging his bicycle to fall apart upon impact in a series of staged accidents. 
Motorists began phoning in complaints to police that they had been involved in 
traffic accidents with a bicyclist who asked for money following the crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddons was convicted and sentenced to a year in jail after pleading no 
contest to theft charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, lawmakers cracked down on criminals with tough new methods. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Robert E. Hardy, a 29-year-old burglar with two prior convictions, 
became the first person in the San Fernando Valley to be convicted and 
sentenced to life in prison under the new "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 And just as it began, the year ended with the killing of a peace officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Worley was sitting inside his car parked outside a Canoga Park strip 
mall waiting for his wife to pick out a pair of shoes. Minutes later, he became 
the 11th peace officer to be gunned down in Southern California during the last 
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave his life," said Clifton Williams, president of the 400-member Los 
Angeles County Safety Police Assn. "Sometimes we don't know why the world is 
like it is." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Traffic Toll 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bloody year on the streets of the San Fernando Valley, where more 
people died in traffic accidents than were slain .  
</P>
<P>
 Traffic accidents in the Valley claimed the lives of 84 people from January 
through November, a 9% increase over the same period in 1993. Following are 
additional Valley traffic statistics for the first 11 months of the year: 
</P>
<P>
 * Driving under the influence of alcohol arrests: 4,285 
</P>
<P>
 * Traffic collisions: 15,555. Of those, 1,113 were alcohol-related 
</P>
<P>
 * Moving-traffic citations issued: 108,831

SAMSUNG PLAN RILES S. KOREAN AUTO MAKERS; INDUSTRY: THE TWO LARGEST PRODUCERS 
FOR THE COUNTRY THAT WANTS TO BE A TOP CAR EXPORTER HAVE U.S. HEADQUARTERS IN 
O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A recent government decision to let the powerful Samsung Business Group build 
passenger cars opens the door to a potentially painful battle among South 
Korea's auto makers, but analysts say it could also help the auto makers become 
formidable competitors in the world market. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision -- driven by South Korea's ambition to become a top auto exporter 
-- also marks a sharp break with traditions of close government guidance and of 
concentrating resources among a handful of key players in each major industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "No longer will the government be able to control industrial-sector decisions 
to launch into new business," said Lee Youn Ho, an analyst at the 
Lucky-Goldstar Economic Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short term, there will be some trouble among local automobile makers 
over scouting workers. But in the long run, Samsung's entry was inevitable, 
because they should compete with the world's big players in the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Samsung plans to make 65,000 vehicles in 1998, with capacity rising to 285,000 
units in 2000 and to 500,000 units in 2002. Samsung says it will export 30% of 
its output in the first year and aim for 55% exports by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea's two largest car makers, Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp., 
also are big exporters and both have U.S. headquarters in Orange County. A 
third manufacturer, Daewoo Motor Co., has begun exploring the option of direct 
sales in the United States -- the company now builds some cars sold by General 
Motors -- and has earmarked Orange County as a potential headquarters site. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Samsung, the largest of South Korea's business conglomerates, has contracted 
with Japan's Nissan Motor Co. for engine technology at a cost of $68 million, 
plus a royalty of 1.6% to 1.9% on each vehicle sold, according to the 
Tokyo-based Nikkei Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Samsung Heavy Industries Co., the unit going into passenger car production, 
already makes 1,200 trucks a year with Nissan's technical cooperation. Now 
Samsung is betting on automobiles over electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just another addition of business to Samsung," said Kim Moo, 
Samsung Heavy's senior managing director. "Samsung's major business activities 
are concentrated on home appliance electronics. We have come to the conclusion 
that the group will not grow . . . in the 21st Century on electronics. The 
future lies in cars." 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea turned out 2 million cars and trucks last year and exported nearly 
640,000 of them. It is already the sixth-largest auto-producing nation. Its 
four other major auto makers are planning dramatic increases in production 
capacity, with an eye to sharp boosts in exports. 
</P>
<P>
 These firms plan to invest about $10 billion to double their capacity in five 
years to more than 5 million cars, of which 3 million would be shipped abroad. 
Many in the field believe, however, that these goals are overly ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The companies' targets are always bigger than reality," said Chung Tae Seung, 
managing director for overseas planning at Kia Motors. "If you add up all the 
targets of Hyundai, Daewoo and Kia, it's too big. You have to discount it. . . 
. There's a limit. It's dangerous if we overexpand our capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 The Samsung decision, which had been pending for months, adds momentum to 
President Kim Young Sam's economic liberalization drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also has taken steps to ease currently tight restrictions on 
imported cars -- intensifying the domestic industry's fears that vigorous 
expansion may lead to a glutted domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Against this background, the auto makers bitterly protested the government's 
approval of Samsung's entry as a competitor. Workers at Daewoo Motor Co., 
Ssangyong Motor Co., Kia and its subsidiary Asia Motors Co. protested with 
strikes and rallies for nearly a week after the government announced the 
decision -- although at South Korea's largest auto maker, Hyundai Motor Co., 
workers remained on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The strikes fizzled on Dec. 12, after it became clear the government would not 
change course. When a delegation of auto company chief executives visited 
Deputy Trade Minister Park Un Suh to complain about the Samsung decision, he 
rebuffed them, Nikkei Weekly reported, with a blunt question: "What were you 
doing when the government was protecting you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Besides increased competition in the domestic market, an even greater concern 
of Samsung's rivals is that Samsung will hire workers and researchers away from 
them, thereby crippling their expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Samsung thus was required, as a condition of government permission to build 
cars, to pledge not to raid its competitors for staff members. It also promised 
to start exporting cars in its first year of production and to nurture its own 
parts suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivals, however, remain unconvinced. They say that Samsung will not be able to 
keep its promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Kia alone, we have 2,500 researchers. To train a researcher you need six 
or seven years of on-the-job experience," Chung said. "How can Samsung equip 
itself with researchers without hiring away employees from other firms?" 
</P>
<P>
 Samsung insists that enough personnel can be drawn from other group companies, 
together with researchers and technicians from abroad, to start up the 
passenger car business, said a Samsung Heavy official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have already run advertisements in the United States, including the Los 
Angeles area, to recruit overseas personnel," he said. "Samsung publicly 
submitted a memorandum to the government (saying) it would not scout personnel 
from existing local car makers. We will keep the promise on the good name of 
Samsung." 
</P>
<P>
 Samsung's entry will help to upgrade Korean cars, the executive added. "The 
car we will be introducing in three years will not be the same quality car that 
Korean customers are now used to driving," he said. "If we were to introduce a 
similar car, it would be meaningless and would not fit Samsung's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a better car, and that will benefit the customer." 
</P>
<P>

Seoul contributed to this story.

O.C. ENTERPRISE: FOCUS ON LEARNING IS PAYING OFF; BUSINESS PARTNERS IN ORANGE 
HAVE NOT ONLY FOUND A BOOMING MARKET FOR THEIR INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS, BUT THEY 
HAVE ALSO HAD A BLAST.

<P>
 There are some things you do for love, and others you do for money. Jimm Vest 
and Phil Giraldin are lucky enough to do both at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The former hobbyists are now professional videographers. Their company, ESI 
Video Productions in Orange, which Vest began in 1988, makes its money 
producing corporate training films. But the partners say they love the 
educational videos they make, which are a growing part of their business 
because "you get to learn a lot," said Vest, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to believe anyone could get terribly excited about woodcarving, 
but the partners enjoyed it enough to produce four videos on the subject, 
investing much of their own money in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to now, the ESI team has been filming instructional videos on subjects 
ranging from combat training to building walls. This month, however, they 
released their first video aimed at a general audience. "A Day at the Stable" 
is also ESI's first attempt at the children's audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Day at the Stable," which has a running time of 40 minutes, demonstrates 
equestrian techniques for riding and jumping as well as showing how to care for 
a horse. Giraldin, who handles marketing for ESI, said there is a general 
misconception that all children want is pure entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a whole bunch of kids at home who are tired of the 'Power Rangers,' " 
said Giraldin, 45, a father of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Cherbak, a retail analyst at the Costa Mesa office of Deloitte & Touche, 
said that as ESI focuses on making educational products that are entertaining, 
the company also is likely to stumble across some profits if it succeeds in the 
hobby video market. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a big market for these types of videos," said Cherbak. "And it can 
be fairly lucrative because they are fairly inexpensive to produce." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of making a video such as "A Day at the Stable" can range from about 
$6,000 to nearly $30,000 depending on factors such as the amount of video shot 
and whether or not talent is hired, Giraldin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But those costs come only after one takes the initial plunge to buy all the 
needed video equipment. A professional quality video camera, Giraldin said, can 
cost up to $20,000 and the equipment in the company's editing bay cost nearly 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orange residents Vest and Giraldin were both video hobbyists who picked up 
cameras and various pieces of editing equipment over the years. Vest learned 
about cameras and graphics while working in television production at Financial 
News Network and Telepictures, a television production company later bought by 
Lorimar Television. Giraldin worked in mortgage finance until 1992, when he 
decided to make his hobby a full-time occupation and joined forces with Vest at 
ESI. 
</P>
<P>
 Vest and Giraldin refused to reveal their annual revenues, but Giraldin said 
they are in a growth phase. Last year, sales more than doubled, and they are 
projecting additional growth in 1995. Vest and Giraldin are now ESI's only 
full-time employees, but next year they plan to hire their first employee to 
work with them in their studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the greatest production cost for ESI is the time it takes to make a 
video. A 15-minute corporate instructional video can take several weeks to 
produce working full time. Just like film and television, more time is spent 
doing work away from the camera than actually shooting. The partners both work 
on writing a script, editing the video and adding sound and graphics. But there 
is a guaranteed payment once the film is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other videographers charge up to $40,000 for a corporate training film, but 
ESI prides itself on its competitive pricing. Giraldin said ESI can produce 
something similar to a $40,000 model for less than $20,000 by using fewer 
graphics or by not employing actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Their hobby videos, by comparison, are more time-consuming to produce and may 
not be as lucrative. "A Day at the Stable," took the team about three months to 
complete. "A Day at the Stable" just hit the shelves last month and will appear 
in Miller's Harness Co., an equestrian catalogue, in the spring. ESI is also 
negotiating with several retail chains to bring the $19.95 video to a general 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than money, Vest said, he makes videos because it takes him back to his 
collegiate roots. The former broadcast journalism major at USC said making 
educational videos is a lot like making documentary films. "It's like 
journalism because you have to take a subject you know nothing about and get it 
right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after shooting three videos on balancing the chassis of racing vehicles, 
Vest can claim to be somewhat of an expert on the subject. The acquired 
knowledge is not a byproduct of the process, said Vest, adding that he has to 
understand a subject before he begins to shoot to ensure accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of accuracy was evident from the first instructional video 
project he took, for local race car guru Steve Smith, owner of Steve Smith 
Autosports in Orange. Smith is the author of several technical books on racing. 
When he decided to expand his product line to include videos, he hired ESI to 
make a video on automotive suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspension is the key to winning races, said Smith, because it guarantees a 
driver will be able to maintain top speeds on turns. But explaining how to 
adjust the suspension on a car is highly technical, said Smith, because ESI 
must be sure the correct auto parts are being videotaped and that the mechanic 
performs the right action to achieve the desired outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to accuracy, Vest and Giraldin win points for creativity, said 
Smith, who has used ESI to film three of his company's videos. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are really good with graphics and color and are always coming up with 
new ideas to try out to improve the look of it," Smith said. "It must be 
working because we get good response from the videos."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; MAKING A DIME ON STREET CRIME; GRAFFITI FINDS A 
LEGIT NICHE -- ON CLOTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERROL A. COCKFIELD Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He once took spray-paint cans and made the city of Los Angeles his 
imagination's canvas, but Ash Hudson has now turned a third-story Rampart 
Boulevard loft into a studio where L.A.'s biggest vandalism problem is a 
business success story. 
</P>
<P>
 A former graffiti vandal -- or tagger, in the vernacular of the streets -- 
Hudson turned entrepreneur in 1989 by founding a firm called Conart. He has 
turned it into a clothing distributor that designs graffiti images for T-shirts 
and caps and boasts of 1994 orders totaling $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Conart (convict and art) now employs half a dozen paint-can-wielding staff 
artists and provides free-lance work for others, helping to focus their 
creative energies into a lucrative business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're occupying so much of their time that they don't have time to go out on 
the street," said the 22-year-old Hudson, a native of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Taggers have been dreaded and hunted in major cities since urban teens began 
vandalizing buildings, subways and freeways in the late 1970s. The term refers 
to the vandals' tags, or personalized signatures, they attach to their 
handiwork around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But out of this illegal pastime have sprung legitimate graffiti artists, 
claiming a niche in the contemporary art world as well as in the clothing 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of graffiti clothing companies have started in big cities throughout 
the country, particularly in Los Angeles and New York and mostly by former 
taggers, said Robert Christofaro, a graphic designer for In Fashion, a trade 
magazine in New York City. Many of the companies have found it hard to stay 
afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them can't manage to stay open . . . it's a hard marketplace," 
Christofaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many, graffiti has become an avenue to opportunity. The clothing 
designs have attracted a large following of young adults who grew up fascinated 
by the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the people that are most successful in the graffiti scene have expanded 
but held on to their graffiti roots. . . . The whole thing is being 
innovative," said Kelly Gravao, another ex-tagger, who now owns Third Rail, an 
alternative clothing company in Boyle Heights. Third Rail also began by selling 
graffiti designed T-shirts and caps, but has since expanded its clothing line. 
</P>
<P>
 Gravao, 26, was arrested on many occasions and even shot in the leg when he 
tagged "in the wrong neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Third Rail has grown 300% in sales since it opened in 1990, not long after 
Conart, Gravao said. He has one retail clothing store, Crazy Life, and is about 
to open a second in Hollywood. He said his focus has shifted from graffiti to 
various other clothing designs, targeted at surfers, skateboarders and 
snowboard enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Conart, he said, is one of the survivors in the graffiti-clothing business, 
benefiting when many imitators fell by the wayside. Today it sells to 470 
accounts at specialty stores across the United States and as far away as Japan, 
where graffiti designs have become very popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Japan they're not doing Japanese letters, they're doing American letter 
schemes," Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conart does half of its business there, where its designs are sold out soon 
after they are sent out, he said. He has even heard of bootleg Conart T-shirts 
being sold around Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Graffiti) has become a big thing now with rap. . . . In one week everything 
(in stores) is sold out," said Ken Kitakaze, who has coordinated Conart's 
distribution to at least 50 stores throughout Japan for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Conart is "the original maker of the graffiti street-style T-shirt," said Paul 
Takahashi, a buyer for Extra-Large, whose clothing stores in Hollywood and New 
York were among the first to carry Conart's designs. The market was saturated 
with imitators as soon as Conart's designs hit stores, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We carry Conart because we try to keep the more original stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Irma Zandl, president of Zandl Group, New York marketing-trend consultants, 
said that recently clothing targeted to young adults has been dull. In the 
clothing industry the time is right for visually exciting pieces, like the ones 
graffiti artists design, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The T-shirt designs are colorful and mesmerizing, but at the same time they 
often touch on social issues -- and take a controversial point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Conart's depicts a Ku Klux Klan member holding his infant son, who is 
also dressed in the white garb of the organization. At the bottom it says: 
"Future Police Officer." Another shirt is a caricature of two black men, one 
holding a gun and the other waving a flag that says: "No Justice No Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson, an African American whose dreadlocks dangle to his chest, didn't 
expect any of this success. Big business snuck up on him and his "conartists," 
as he calls them. It snowballed when he began selling graffiti designed 
T-shirts in front of high schools at age 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Conart) was a hobby turned business," he said. "I saw the connection of 
putting the imagery on clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 After doing one-of-a-kind designs, he realized it would be more profitable to 
reproduce one design and sell it. That message that attracted many of his 
colleagues, making them realize there are job opportunities where their 
artistic talents can be utilized. 
</P>
<P>
 "It opened a lot of graffiti artists' eyes," Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Ariola, another former tagger, who began Third Rail with Gravao, left 
that company and opened Pawn Shop Press, a Santa Monica graphics design company 
that also uses graffiti images. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became disillusioned with the clothing business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, clothing has been a launching pad for other commercial forms of 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Ariola, a 24-year-old from New York City, said he lost interest in using 
graffiti on clothing after many companies started using the designs and the 
genre became trendy. Now he designs graffiti logos for music groups like 
Cypress Hill, and is also branching out to do art direction for music videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Conart is also expanding outside of its clothing line. Three comic books are 
in production and there are plans to do animation. "We want to see some of this 
stuff come to life and move off the walls," Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has also designed tour-shirts and album covers for musical groups 
such as A Tribe Called Quest, The Pharcyde and AC-DC, and has just completed an 
album cover for Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash, who is working on his own solo 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 "Graffiti artists can do other things than graffiti," said Pedro Balugo, 27, a 
conartist who has been with the company from its beginnings. He has also done 
art direction and managed his own graffiti art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson said the ability of graffiti artists to manipulate lighting schemes in 
their designs without any artistic training is characteristic of the raw talent 
on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You either have it or you don't," Balugo said.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Hudson: "The average Joe, when you say graffiti, thinks gangs. But there 
is a big difference between a tagger and a graffiti artist." 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-room studio, which Hudson began renting last year, is decorated wall 
to wall with graffiti paintings. A backdrop of a rioting city partly consumed 
by flames is one of the aerosol masterpieces that inspire conartists as they 
work. This is where they create, to the loud beats of the rap music that bred 
the graffiti genre along with break-dancing in the late '70s and early '80s. 
Even the speakers on one of the stereos are covered with graffiti.  
</P>
<P>
 In one corner is a white and red sign that has obviously been taken from some 
official place on the street. It says: "No Graffiti, Vandalism is prohibited, 
Violators will be prosecuted."

HUMANS JOIN THE TRAIL OF UDDER OINTMENT ENTHUSIASTS; COSMETICS: BAG BALM AND 
OTHER COW PRODUCTS ARE BIG SELLERS AMONG DRY-SKINNED BIPEDS. FIRMS RUMINATE ON 
THE REASONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Janice Qualkenbush coats her face each night with a product that promises to 
soothe chapped udders and windburned muzzles. The ointment is intended for 
cows. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualkenbush, a beautician, says Bag Balm softens dry skin and even appears to 
reduce wrinkles. She also uses it to smooth rough spots on her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a secret of farming families, Bag Balm and other bovine products are 
gaining a wider following. Much of the sales growth in the last three to four 
years has come from people buying balms to use on themselves, manufacturers and 
retailers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to go through a case of Bag Balm a month and now we go through one 
weekly," said Connie Murray, a clerk at Red Barn Feed in Tarzana. One customer 
uses udder balm to treat diaper rash, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ointments have long been used on dairy cows to ease or prevent irritation. 
They are rich in lanolin or petrolatum and often contain a mild antiseptic. 
</P>
<P>
 Dermatologists say the balms contain many of the same ingredients found in 
conventional skin creams and are safe for people. Beverly Hills dermatologist 
Dr. Peter Koppleman recommends that his patients using Acutane, an anti-acne 
drug, use udder balm to relieve dry lips, a side effect of the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first they look at me like I'm nuts," Koppleman said. But among patients 
who try the balm, he said, "the feedback is all positive."  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not regulate veterinary products, 
meaning the "agency can't vouch for their safety when applied to humans," FDA 
spokesman Brad Stone said. "That said, we are not getting a lot of complaints 
about these products." 
</P>
<P>
 The ointments are produced by a handful of companies, many of them privately 
held. Though sales figures aren't available, people in the industry say Bag 
Balm, manufactured by Dairy Assn. of Vermont Co., is the best-selling product. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers and distributors are hard-pressed to explain why overall demand 
is growing. The products are advertised mostly in farming magazines and labeled 
for animal use only. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Celente, editor of New York-based Trend Journal, attributed the 
popularity of the balms in part to a relentless "search for the fountain of 
youth." 
</P>
<P>
 "When people hear something has a cosmetic benefit, they'll try to get their 
hands on it quick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Celente said the balms also have a certain appeal as an old-time, natural 
remedy. "They are perceived as tried and true, unadulterated," he said. 
"They've withstood the test of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Though udder balms may cost twice as much as some private-label skin lotions, 
their price, about 48 cents an ounce, compares favorably to such better-known 
brands as Eucerin or Pacquin, which may cost $1 or more an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate the growing consumer market, manufacturers in the last four to 
five years have packaged udder balms in pocket-size containers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are handier to carry," said John Norris, president of Dairy Assn. of 
Vermont. The balms traditionally have been sold in tubes or tubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Udder balms aren't the only farmyard concoction to catch on with consumers. 
More and more people are using horse shampoos on their hair and hoof treatments 
on their fingernails, for example. One horse shampoo, Mane 'N Tail, is now 
widely available in drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is just this big demand for animal health products," said Phil Meyers, 
vice president of Georgia-based Summit Industries, a maker of ointments for 
cows and horses. Meyers said sales of those ointments have swelled by 20% this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Though sold mostly through feed stores, udder balms are also beginning to turn 
up in mainstream outlets, including Sav-on Drugs and Longs Drugs. The balms can 
also be purchased by mail order from such firms as the Vermont Country Store. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Hernandez sells Bag Balm to customers at her beauty salon in Helendale, 
north of San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some customers are like, 'My goodness!' But they try it," Hernandez says. "A 
little dab really softens cracked feet." 
</P>
<P>
 At USPC Wesco, a wholesaler in Los Angeles, sales of Bag Balm to Southern 
California drugstores have increased sevenfold since March. It now outsells 
some well-known brands distributed by Wesco, such as Pond's Cold Cream, says 
Mary Johnson, health and beauty aid buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unusual to see a product move like that," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such growth has prompted one company to concoct an udder balm for people only. 
Mike Guy, president of Crystal Springs Pharmaceuticals in Fredonia, Wis., said 
he based his Aunt Irma's Udder Balm on a bovine formula used by a local 
pharmaceutical cooperative in the early 1900s. The chief difference is that 
Aunt Irma's does not contain oxyquinoline, an antiseptic found in most udder 
balms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guy said his balm is registered with the FDA as a cosmetic and labeled for 
human use. He declined to give sales figures but said results from the first 
six months are promising. 
</P>
<P>
 The maker of Bag Balm took a similar tack about 20 years ago, packaging its 
bovine product as Vello Balm and selling it as a cosmetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't go, just like the Edsel car," said Norris, president of Dairy Assn. 
of Vermont. "People said they wanted Bag Balm. So we dropped it."

 More Good News for the Region: San Bernardino and Riverside counties, whose 
economic outlook was tabulated jointly, will see yet another year with a gain 
in employment -- this time 18,000 jobs. It is the only Southern California 
region surveyed that has not posted a loss in jobs during California's long 
downturn.But the jobless rate in the fast-growing area will remain high, 
dipping to 9.3% from 9.7%. The employment gains came from widespread 
development in the late 1980s that has since fallen off. The county will see an 
additional 600 housing permit requests in 1995, but the total of 13,970 will be 
just a quarter of the record total in 1986. Both total personal income and 
retail sales figures are projected to go up about 6%, to $56.2 billion and 
$15.9 billion, respectively. RAY DELGADO

 Foggy Days Are Here: The outlook for the county is clouded by its bankruptcy 
filing, which will delay public works projects, among other things.But the 
county will record an overall increase of 17,000 jobs and unemployment will 
remain low, dipping to 5.4% from 5.9%, despite the loss of another 6,000 
aerospace jobs. Big job gains are forecast for accountants, financial 
specialists, insurers and real estate brokers. Both total personal income and 
retail sales in 1995 will increase by roughly 6%, raising the figures to $70.6 
billion and $18.7 billion, respectively. Housing permits will fall 15% next 
year, however, from 11,670 this year to 10,000 in 1995. RAY DELGADO

 Not Much in the Way of Jobs: Sluggish employment growth will continue in 1995 
as only 3,000 new non-farm jobs are expected in a county with an employment 
base of more than 230,000 people.However, the jobless rate will decline for the 
second straight year, to 7.9% from 8.2%. Personal income is expected to rise by 
about $1 billion to $17.2 billion, while retail sales are expected to increase 
by $200 million to $4.3 billion. Only 200 new housing requests are expected, 
bringing the total to 2,500. RAY DELGADO

 The Direction Is Up: The county's employment level will continue its slow 
climb, with more than 45,000 new jobs are expected in the county in 1995, up 
from the 11,100 new jobs in 1994. Unemployment rates will decrease from 9.3% to 
8.5% in 1995.The aerospace industry will continue to take a hit, however, as 
another 18,000 jobs will be lost next year, a 12.8% drop from 1994. The 
economic recovery will boost total personal income in 1995 by $10 billion to 
$216 billion, and retail sales will increase by $2.2 billion to $51.9 billion. 
Housing permit requests are expected to increase nearly 15% to 8,500. 
Surprisingly, tourism increased 3.6% in 1994 despite the January earthquake, 
and a 2.2% increase is expected for 1995. RAY DELGADO

 Eastern Payout Plan OKd; Remaining Assets to Be Sold: Eastern Airlines' effort 
to resuscitate itself is officially dead with a federal bankruptcy judge's 
approval of the plan to sell the defunct carrier's remaining assets.Eastern 
trustee Martin Shugrue had sought to raise $100 million to use planes and other 
assets to restart Eastern. Among the assets to be sold is the Eastern name. The 
plan will pay creditors pennies on the dollar in addition to $1 billion already 
paid to Eastern retirees, employees and secured creditors. Creditors who had 
claims on Eastern assets, however, are to get 100% of their claims. Eastern 
stopped flying Jan. 18, 1991, nearly two years after entering bankruptcy 
proceedings.

 Denver Baggage System Passes Key Test: The success of the $61.7-million backup 
system at Denver International Airport gives engineers reason to believe the 
airport will be ready to open by the Feb. 28 target date, a project spokesman 
said. The system moved about 42 bags a minute in a test run Thursday; the 
system is designed to move 30 bags a minute.Denver Mayor Wellington Webb called 
for the backup system in May after the airport's opening was postponed a fourth 
time by problems with the automated baggage system. The test results signal a 
substantial completion of bag-moving machinery for part of the terminal. To 
make the target opening date, installation will have to go smoothly on the 
remainder of the project.

November, an industry group said in a report that suggested growing demand for 
manufactured goods.The Assn. for Manufacturing Technology reported that machine 
tool orders totaled $370.25 million in November, up from $359.80 million in 
October. Orders were up 59.38% over November, 1993. The latest results contrast 
with October, when orders plunged 30% to $359.80 million from a September peak 
of $514.55 million. Total machine tool orders for the first 11 months of the 
year rose 37.42% to $4.07 billion.

 Farmers Insurance Stunned by Size of Award: Company officials said they will 
immediately appeal the decision by a jury in Portland, Ore., to award $38.5 
million to a fired Farmers Insurance Co. district manager."This jury award is 
absolutely outrageous" and "wholly without foundation," said Daryl Hubard, 
president of Farmers Insurance Co. of Oregon. The Multnomah County jury reached 
its decision after a complicated eight-week trial. The company fired Darrell 
Bennett, 45, in August and demanded all his records and paperwork. Bennett 
claimed he had received verbal assurances that Farmers would fire him only in a 
case of fraud or theft.

WELCOME TO FLORIDA, THE GOLDFISH STATE; AQUACULTURE: IN THIS MECCA OF TROPICAL 
FISH FARMING, THE SMALL PLAYERS WHO ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE INDUSTRY ARE 
FINDING SMARTER WAYS TO MAKE FISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From inside the nation's fishbowl, watching all those goldfish, guppies and 
swordtails isn't always a relaxing pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tricky business," tropical fish farmer Tim Hennessy said as he stood 
in his pond-dotted pasture. "Anybody who's ever taken care of fish knows that 
if everything isn't just right, they can die." 
</P>
<P>
 Vulnerability aside, fish farming has thrived in Florida, which produces about 
95% of all tropical fish sold in North America. Sales have more than doubled in 
the past six years, to $46.7 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the industry remains largely a collection of small farmers who are 
just beginning to find smarter ways of making better fish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It all started in the 1940s amid the balmy weather and tropical breezes of 
Miami. Farmers found digging ponds in the coral rock too difficult and building 
above-ground ponds too expensive, so the industry gravitated to the Tampa Bay 
area, where the mild climate, high water table and sandy soil were perfect for 
building small tropical fish ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 One example of the area's success is Hennessy's EkkWill Water Life Resources, 
a 240-acre, 800-pond complex south of Tampa. It is a far cry from a 
run-of-the-mill fish farm. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry has traditionally been rooted in 20-acre-or-less, family-owned 
farms that rely on traditional methods, said Craig Watson, a University of 
Florida aquaculture specialist. It got a wake-up call, however, during a 1989 
Christmas freeze that wiped out 70% of tropical fish stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the losses occurred in ponds exposed to the cold; those covered by 
thick, plastic tents that warm the water suffered only a 2% loss. Watson said 
the industry faces a similar jolt as farmers deal with a five-year drought that 
has water managers pressuring them to conserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology," he said, "is going to have to be the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Technology is EkkWill's strength. A computer drives every aspect of the 
operation, from the harvesting of fish eggs to the packing of trucks. A complex 
water filtration system uses mechanical and biological filters to recycle 1.5 
million gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
 High-tech genetic engineering, covered ponds and aeration systems help fish 
grow even at high densities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken it to the next level," said Hennessy, whose business ships 6 
million fish a month and boasts sales of $10 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A tour of the main plant tells the story. It begins in a covered facility 
where breeder fish spawn in darkness and eggs are hatched. A hydraulic press 
splits the chromosomes in the eggs to yield fish that can't reproduce and 
therefore grow faster. It can also be used to clone specific traits. 
</P>
<P>
 Once hatchlings are strong enough, they are moved to a checkerboard layout of 
small rectangular ponds, where as many as 100,000 fish live for three to 18 
months. Every factor is regulated, from water temperature to the type of feed 
to the oxygen level in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fish reach market size, they are scooped out of the ponds and placed 
in holding tanks, where they are sorted for shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 An assembly-line crew keeps an eye on a posted computer printout that tells 
workers how quickly they must pack the fish to make scheduled airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
 EkkWill, which produces 140 types of fish but boosts its product line to more 
than 700 items by buying from smaller growers, sells exclusively to pet store 
suppliers. A typical molly goes for about 20 cents wholesale; it is marked up 
six to eight times by the time it is sold in a pet store. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a business of pennies, not a business of dollars," said Mike 
Hennessy, Tim's brother and the company's treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing easy about it," said David Boozer, executive director of 
Florida's Tropical Fish Farmer's Assn. "This is not like a citrus grove you can 
go out and check on every now and then. It's like any livestock -- a 
seven-day-a-week, 365-day-a-year job."

YOUR MONEY; HOW MUTUAL FUND LOSSES CAN SPELL TAX RELIEF; INVESTMENT: APPLYING 
LOST CAPITAL AGAINST GAINS CAN MEAN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. BUT YOU'D 
BETTER HURRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 During the next few days, mutual fund shareholders can make several moves that 
will save them hundreds or even thousands of dollars in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 If you own shares in one or more funds, you should move quickly to take 
advantage of the potential savings. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, look for ways to take advantage of capital losses you may have 
incurred this year in one or more mutual funds. The past 12 months or so have 
been difficult ones for funds of all stripes, including domestic stock and bond 
funds as well as funds that buy overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you have incurred losses in any of those funds, you can apply the losses 
against capital gains in other funds, or even against your income from work, to 
reduce your taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, say you earn $3,000 in capital gains this year. Come tax time, 
you will owe Uncle Sam $840 on that gain ($3,000 multiplied by the 28% capital 
gains tax rate). 
</P>
<P>
 But what if you also recorded a $3,000 loss in a long-term Treasury bond fund? 
In that case, you can sell the Treasury bond fund shares and realize the loss. 
Then you can apply the $3,000 loss against your $3,000 capital gain and cancel 
out the tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations: You just saved $840. 
</P>
<P>
 What if you have no capital gains? In that case, you can apply as much as 
$3,000 of losses in funds against your income. You can carry forward any 
leftover losses and use them in future years. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a couple of points to consider before you take your losses. First, 
you don't need to worry about any of this if your money is invested in 
tax-sheltered accounts such as IRAs, Keoghs or 401(k)s. In those accounts, your 
gains continue to compound tax-deferred, and losses are of no use to you even 
for tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, you can't sell a fund just to realize the loss and then reinvest in it 
immediately. Instead, you have to wait at least 30 days to get back into the 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like trouble, doesn't it? After all, you may want to keep your fund if 
it has been a long-term winner and there have been no major changes in its 
strategy: One bad year is no reason to dump a good fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But the IRS limitation is no problem in most cases. You can sell your shares 
and invest the proceeds in a similar fund for 31 days, then shift the money 
back into the original fund. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 5,000 funds out there, you should be able to find a fund that 
will do duty as a clone for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, say you invested $10,000 in T. Rowe Price New Asia on Jan. 1, 
1994. You sold the shares on Nov. 30, realizing a $1,700 capital loss and using 
that money to offset a $1,700 gain in another fund. Savings: $476.  
</P>
<P>
 Next you reinvested the money in Scudder Pacific Opportunities for 31 days. By 
Jan. 2, you can reinvest the money in T. Rowe Price New Asia. Meanwhile, you 
haven't missed much. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the strategy only works if you use no-load funds. Otherwise, you 
will need to pay a sales charge when you reinvest in the original fund. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, review your portfolio of funds to find those that have posted 
losses during 1994. Chances are you won't have much trouble finding one or two 
examples. Check volatile stock funds first, but don't forget your bond fund 
holdings: The average general bond fund tracked by Morningstar Mutual Funds 
lost 6.1% through November. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before you decide which funds to sell, you may want to consult with a 
professional tax adviser. He or she can help you take full advantage of the 
rules that are in your favor, while sidestepping potential problems.  
</P>
<P>
 But by all means, do it sooner rather than later. Cutting your tax bill won't 
make up for the losses you may have suffered in mutual funds during the past 
year or so, but it will reduce the sting considerably.

YOUR MONEY; MANAGE YOUR MONEY YOURSELF, BUFFETT ADVISES; INVESTING: THIS IS ONE 
FIELD WHERE LAYMEN CAN DO BETTER THAN PROFESSIONALS, THE FAMED INVESTOR SAYS. 
</P>

 Investors are better off managing their own money than turning it over to 
professionals, according to Warren Buffett, famed investor and chairman of 
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when individual investors have about $2.1 trillion in mutual funds, 
Buffett's opinion may fall into the minority. Still, investors who do their 
homework and limit their holdings to companies and industries they understand 
will come out ahead, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The professional in almost any field achieves a result which is significantly 
above what the layman in aggregate achieves. It's not true in money 
management," Buffett told a recent gathering of members of the New York Society 
of Securities Analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Professionals are handling a growing share of investments by individuals, and, 
as a result, their returns increasingly mirror the overall market's return. "By 
definition, money managers as a group are going to end up with average 
results," Buffett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 64-year-old native of Omaha, who has net worth of more than $9 billion and 
last year was named the richest American by Forbes magazine, said that when it 
comes to investing, bigger isn't better. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Buffett suggests owning lots of shares in a limited number of companies, 
rather than keeping small holdings in numerous companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you really analyze businesses, so you are buying into a business and 
making a conscious decision about what you think the future of that business 
is, I really think that if you can find six or eight (companies), then that's 
plenty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The core of Buffett's portfolio consists of stocks he has held for many years: 
Coca-Cola Co. (his largest holding), Gillette Co., Washington Post Co., Capital 
Cities/ABC Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and Geico Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, an investor's only strategy is to hold equities over 
time and count on some appreciation, you probably ought to own at least 20 
stocks, Buffett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The less you know, the more you have to own," he said. "Diversification is a 
protection against mistakes or ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffett hasn't avoided all the bumps in the road. He looked like any mortal 
investor last month when Berkshire Hathaway filed documents with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission saying it may write down the value of its investment in 
USAir Group Inc. this year -- if the airline doesn't implement a cost-cutting 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkshire holds 358,000 shares, or about 0.6%, of USAir. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mistake," he said of his investment in the Arlington, Va.-based 
airline, which has been dogged by fare wars and disruptions caused by crashes 
in Charlotte, N.C., and Pittsburgh. "We'll see how it comes out." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffett spoke at the NYSSA meeting commemorating the life and work of Benjamin 
Graham, who is considered the father of value investing. 
</P>
<P>
 Value investors select securities by focusing on a company's financial 
condition and its future earnings potential. They typically ignore price cycles 
of individual stocks or movements of the market as a whole. Buffett studied 
under Graham at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just try to buy businesses with good to superb underlying economics, run 
by honest and able people, and buy them at sensible prices," Buffett said. 
"That's all I'm trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffett likens himself to a college basketball coach, charged with the task of 
finding "seven-foot" sectors to use as the foundation for his investments. 
Investments, like a basketball dynasty, must be built around a strong center, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When "I see a seven-footer, I think, 'Is the guy coordinated, can I keep him 
in school, and all those things,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then some guy comes up to me and says, 'I'm 5-6, but you ought to see me 
handle the ball,' " Buffett said.  
</P>
<P>
 His response? "I'm not interested."

 Wood-Chip Exports to Drop: Prime Minister Paul Keating, moving to placate 
conservation groups, announced a timetable for phasing out the exports of wood 
chips by the turn of the century. The country's major wood-chip markets are 
Taiwan and Japan, the Department of Trade said.The action is aimed at reducing 
the cutting in native forests. Keating acted after an increase in wood-chip 
exports permitted for next year roused criticism from environmental groups that 
threatened to boycott the ruling Labor Party, which faces elections in early 
1996. Keating said the government will reduce the allowable amount of hardwood 
chip exports from 6.73 million metric tons in 1995 to 5 million tons in 1996, 
then reduce the amount by 1 million tons a year thereafter.

 Capital Investment Exceeds Forecast: The country's business sector expects 
that the government will substantially exceed its forecast for business 
investment growth of 14.5% in the year ending June 30.A survey by the Business 
Council of Australia, which covers the nation's major companies, said 
three-fifths of respondents now expect capital expenditure to grow by more than 
20%. The council's ninth half-yearly survey of current business conditions 
indicates that most businesses believe strong economic growth will continue. 
The economy grew 6.4% in the year ended Sept. 30, a nine-year high. However, 
respondents said they expect inflation will rise slightly over the next five 
years.

JAPANESE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY SEES 2% RISE IN PRODUCTION; MANUFACTURING: TRADE

<P>
 Production by Japan's electronics companies will rise by 2% next year as 
improving world economies spur demand for electronic products, an industry 
association said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Electronic Industries Assn. of Japan, which represents 600 Japanese 
electronics makers, said total electronics production in 1995 will likely reach 
$21.7 billion, up 2.2% on the year, led by strong demand for mobile 
communications systems and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the association said that increased imports, the shifting of 
production to overseas sites and slower economic growth rates in the United 
States and China will keep the recovery sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can only say this is a slight recovery for the electronics industry," said 
Tamotsu Harada, a spokesman for the EIAJ. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's 30-month recession, which forced companies and consumers to cut back 
on purchases of electronic equipment, as well the strength of the Japanese yen 
that has made Japan's products expensive overseas, have led many companies to 
locate production facilities overseas to keep costs down. Electronics 
production in Japan has fallen by about 20% since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The projected rise in production will be led by semiconductors and liquid 
crystal displays, EIAJ said. Production of LCDs, which are used as display 
screens in portable computers, will likely rise 29.5% next year on the year, 
following an increase this year of 38.4%. Semiconductor production will rise 
7.5% next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand in both Japan and the United States for computers and the semiconductor 
chips that make them work is soaring as economies recover and companies invest 
in new technology. This translates into increased business for companies like 
NEC Corp., Japan's top semiconductor maker and the nation's No. 2 computer 
manufacturer, and leading semiconductor fabrication equipment suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Production of home electronic appliances like videocassette recorders and 
audio equipment has been the hardest hit by the long recession in Japan. The 
EIAJ said output of these products will fall 5.3% next year, following a drop 
this year of 9.7% and a plunge last year of 14.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading electronics makers in Japan have recently raised their profit 
forecasts for the coming business year on the strength of improving world 
markets.

SOME SEE GOOD BUYS IN CHINA FIRMS IN WAKE OF WEAKNESS

 U.S. investors say China's fallen stock prices are encouraging them to jump 
into the country's equity markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would I begin buying now? Yes," said Michael Holland, a partner at the 
Blackstone Group and a director of the publicly traded China Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The Credit Lyonnais index of Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong fell 15% this 
year while the index of "B" shares, which are listed in China and can be traded 
by foreigners, has declined a sharp 37.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of Chinese stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange have also 
dropped. Minibus manufacturer Brilliance China Automotive's stock has fallen 
55% in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holland said inflation, concerns about the future of China after senior 
leader Deng Xiaoping dies, and accusations that some state companies have not 
honored debts are already reflected in the prices of Chinese equities. 
</P>
<P>
 Brilliance, for example, is trading at about a third of its price-earnings 
ratio of two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And Holland also sees increasing profits as the continued freeing of China's 
economy improves productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Other investors said that while the short-term investor may not want to tamper 
with Chinese equities right now, long-term potential is still a plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long-run, I think they'll have an economic explosion there. It's gonna 
be huge," said Joe Glossberg, senior managing director of Chicago-based money 
managers, Gofen & Glossberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Gofen & Glossberg owns 155,000 shares in the China Fund, and is buying more, 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But China's market could remain volatile, said some investors. They prefer to 
invest in China indirectly by buying Hong Kong or Southeast Asia companies with 
business in China.

 Central Bank Says Finance Sector to Open: China will open its financial 
industry to foreign bankers despite failing to secure entry to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the officials said.Their comments, reported in 
the official China Daily, came just days after China vowed to renege on all its 
market-opening commitments if it couldn't gain admission to GATT before the end 
of this year. The new, more powerful World Trade Organization will supplant 
GATT, and China has said it wants to be a founding member of the WTO. China has 
accused the United States of blocking its GATT ambitions, which were scuttled 
last week when negotiations broke off in Geneva.

 Nation to Buy Equipment From U.S. Firms: The Chinese government has placed a 
$157-million order for power equipment from Westinghouse Electric Corp. of 
Pittsburgh, according to a state-run newspaper.Westinghouse will supply a 
generator to the Yangzhou No. 2 Power Plant in Jiangsu province, the China 
Daily said. McDermott International Inc. of New Orleans announced that part of 
the order is a $155-million boiler system for the Yangzhou facility. The 
equipment will be used to build two coal-fired power generators, which are 
expected to begin operating in 1999 and 2000.

 Importers See 15% Rise in Car Sales: Sales of vehicles imported into Japan 
will rise to about 345,000 in 1995, an industry association predicted. Japan's 
auto imports have surged this year as the high yen has made imports cheaper and 
foreign makers have stepped up their marketing efforts.The Japan Automobile 
Importers Assn. said the country's economic recovery will help the trend 
continue in the new year by boosting personal consumption. The association said 
269,568 imported cars, trucks and buses were sold in the first 11 months of 
1994, up 48.8% from the same period last year. Imports held a 5.9% share of the 
total vehicle market, up from 4.1% last year. This year has already broken the 
1990 record, when 223,923 foreign-made vehicles were sold in Japan.

invest in building roads, telecommunications networks and other infrastructure 
in North Korea's first free economic zone on its border with Russia and China. 
Final details will be decided this spring, the company said. South Korea lifted 
its half-century ban on direct trade and investment with North Korea in

GOING FOR BROKE? NOT O.C.'S ARTS SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will Orange County's worst-ever financial crisis affect the local arts scene? 
</P>
<P>
 Will higher taxes, which many foresee being implemented to bail out the 
bankrupt county, make a night at the theater seem ridiculously unaffordable and 
unconscionably frivolous? 
</P>
<P>
 Will the mere fear of such measures make season-ticket holders scratch the 
words "renew subscription" off their to-do lists? Will donors forgo 
contributions? 
</P>
<P>
 Will cash-starved schools cancel every last art, music, dance or drama class 
they have left? 
</P>
<P>
 Or will we see none of the above? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what area arts leaders are wondering. With $198.1 million in the county 
investment fund, Irvine is the most heavily invested city, and Toni Pang, 
supervisor of the Irvine Fine Arts Center, is worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city is looking at cutting programs, it is something for us or any 
city program to be very concerned about," Pang says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, neither Pang nor anyone else has a firm idea of whether the early 
December nightmare that has kept public officials up nights will dim the lights 
on the arts as well. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as of this moment, the biggest blip on an otherwise news-lite year remains 
the Laguna Art Museum's surprise March 29 firing of Charles Desmarais, its 
director. The move blindsided many. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deeply surprised" was the way Michael Botwinick, director of the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum, characterized his reaction at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna museum trustees, who fired Desmarais without cause (as permitted by his 
contract) after he had been at the helm for 5 1/2 years, said only that they 
wanted "more help and energy to be put in administration." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile the board, which has steadfastly refused to elaborate, has three 
finalists in the search for Desmarais' replacement and expects to hire a new 
director next month. (Curator of exhibitions and acting director Susan M. 
Anderson didn't apply for the job.) 
</P>
<P>
 The county's most prominent arts administrator, Tom Tomlinson, in October 
marked his first anniversary as the Orange County Performing Arts Center's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlinson has won widespread praise for his performance and has begun to push 
the center's programming envelope, but has yet to veer dramatically from its 
four-pronged policy of booking musical theater, dance, opera and classical 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, however, he has shown a willingness to make the facility more 
accessible to a wider spectrum of the public and strengthen relations between 
the center and county performing arts groups that use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlinson and other center officials have been meeting with Orange County 
Together, a group sponsored by the United Way and the Orange County Human 
Relations Commission, to promote understanding among races and cultures. And, 
Tomlinson has made offers of collaborative programming to the center's three 
major users: the Pacific Symphony, the Orange County Philharmonic Society and 
Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have great cooperation" with the center, said Philharmonic Society 
executive director Dean Corey, who also celebrated his first year in a new 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Financially, 1994 didn't start off as a blockbuster year for the center. In 
January it announced that it had ended 1993 with the smallest surplus -- at 
$205,284, less than half of the previous year's -- since opening eight years 
ago. Tomlinson and other center officials, however, called the smaller surplus 
"inconsequential," especially in light of the recession gripping the country. 
We'll have to wait until year-end figures are released next month to know how 
the rest of '94 went.  
</P>
<P>
 In money matters elsewhere, no large or mid-size arts organizations went 
belly-up, as in bleak bygone years, but there wasn't much to grand jete about 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 The high point, perhaps, came in September when the California Arts Council 
awarded 11 county groups a total of $328,892 -- 50% more than it gave the same 
number of groups in 1993. That was due in part to fewer organizations applying 
for subsidies statewide, council officials said, but eight of the county's 11 
won larger grants nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, the Anaheim-based Leo Freedman Foundation, which has doled 
out millions to local arts groups since 1991, didn't award any new grants. The 
foundation, owner of the Celebrity Theatre, hasn't rented the theater for 
months and thus has had to shoulder the costs of its upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had less income with which to make grants," Ellis Stern, a foundation 
trustee, said last week. "We hope to have a lease signed in the next couple of 
weeks" and issue new grants again next December. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Newport Harbor Art Museum rearranged its office hours to save on 
utilities and security bills in the most recent move in a series of cutbacks. 
Staffers will work just as many hours but will no longer work on Mondays, when 
galleries are closed to visitors. Instead, they'll clock in every other 
Saturday and work an hour longer on weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum still has no date to begin its expansion into the vacated Newport 
Beach Public Library next door. It has, however, raised about $1 million in 
cash and pledges for the project. The total amount of money needed has been 
pegged at roughly $6 million, though plans may be revised this summer when 
officials have a better idea of "how successful we are" in raising the money, 
director Botwinick said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to strengthen its financial position, the Muckenthaler Cultural Center 
in Fullerton last month began weaning itself from city support. By 1997, 50% of 
its operational costs will be transferred to the private Muckenthaler Cultural 
Center Foundation. The theory is that donors will give more to an institution 
that lacks support from the city of Fullerton, which has cut the center's 
funding by about 30% during the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 One small organization, Costa Mesa's 3-year-old Backstage Theatre, did close 
its doors in '94, but not because of money woes, at least not directly. 
Producer Al Valletta wanted to stage shows in Los Angeles, and the company 
suffered poor attendance here. A new storefront drama troupe, the Theatre 
District, has opened at the Backstage's former site. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Grove Center Theatre company set up shop in Garden Grove's Gem Theatre 
and Festival Amphitheatre, former home of GroveShakespeare, which dissolved in 
1993. Officials at the new organization said they plan to produce an eclectic 
array of 175 performances a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Laguna Playhouse finally got the green light to turn an old South 
Laguna bank building into a 250-seat Second Stage theater, expected to open 
next year, and Santa Ana's Bowers Museum of Cultural Art last week welcomed 
inaugural visitors to Kidseum, a hands-on children's museum two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the Huntington Beach Art Center, which has been delayed 
repeatedly over the past four years, was put off yet again, although three key 
staffers were hired to run it. Late March is the revised debut date. 
</P>
<P>
 Further expanding the county's cultural offerings, Little Saigon strengthened 
its prominence on the arts scene when, in May, a group of Vietnamese Americans 
announced plans for Project 20, a series of cultural events here and around the 
country in 1995. The events celebrate next spring's 20th anniversary of the 
start of the largest wave of Vietnam War refugees to arrive in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the country's major arts organizations, such as the Smithsonian 
Institution, have staged or plan to stage exhibits containing works by county 
Vietnamese artists, who also have made major inroads in music, recording, 
literary and other industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the realm of popular culture provided some upbeat news. Fullerton 
Museum Center, the only local museum to break an attendance record this year, 
did so with its guitar-studded ode to native son Leo Fender. The exhibit, 
organized by the center, sought to illustrate how the pioneer electric-guitar 
designer created instruments that led to a new kind of rock music. It drew 
12,500 visitors, besting by 900 the 1991 "Titanic" show that also ran for 
nearly four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's punk-rock scene, which dates back to 1978, generated a huge 
national hit when The Offspring from Huntington Beach produced the 
biggest-selling album in the history of the independent-alternative rock 
movement. "Smash" has sold more than 3 million copies to date. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With top-price tickets at a record-setting $350 each, Barbra Streisand didn't 
sell out all her shows at The Pond of Anaheim, but fans, from as far away as 
Alaska, waxed rhapsodic and snatched up $25 Streisand T-shirts and $60 ties. 
Her half-dozen concerts in June and July were part of Streisand's first tour in 
nearly 30 years and the tour she said would be her last. 
</P>
<P>
 As concert-goer Susan Bratlein of North Dakota put it at the time: "I'm just 
so excited, I don't know what to say."  
</P>
<P>
 Managers of the Irvine Barclay Theatre knew exactly what to say when last 
month the widow of the theater's most prominent donor announced she wouldn't 
pay the remaining $600,000 of her late husband's $1-million pledge: Sue you. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard H. Barclay put the family name on the theater with his bequest, which 
helped complete construction of the facility. He paid the first two annual 
installments, totaling $400,000. After he died in 1992, however, the payments 
stopped. Operators sued the Barclay estate last month. The suit states that in 
exchange for the Barclay's $1-million gift, the theater agreed to bear their 
name.  
</P>
<P>
 The Barclay debacle didn't seem to faze other arts administrators, who said 
they are not fearful that Marjorie Barclay's action will give other donors and 
their heirs ideas, thereby threatening millions of promised dollars their 
groups have yet to receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, all that was before the County of Orange filed for protection under 
Chapter 9 Bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy New Year.

THE FACES OF 1994; FROM THE TWENTYSOMETHING MAYOR WHO STAYED HOME TO THE 
EIGHTYSOMETHING PHOTOGRAPHER WHO RETURNED THERE, WE CATCH UP WITH SOME OF THESE 
PAGES' MOST INTERESTING PERSONALITIES; FIDEL VARGAS; 'OUR HARD WORK IS STARTING

<P>
 He's the local boy made good, thrust into the national spotlight in Time and 
Newsweek magazines, on CNN and as a White House guest. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Fidel Vargas, the 26-year-old, baby-faced mayor of Baldwin Park -- and 
one of the youngest mayors in the country -- the attention the national acclaim 
has brought him continues to take a back seat to his growing family. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Melissa, are expecting their third child in February. One 
recent day, the mayor was at home caring for his wife and tending to sons Max, 
4, and Julian, 22 months, while managing to squeeze in the work of running his 
city of 72,000 residents, for which he is paid $3,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Since we last checked in with Vargas ("Coming Home," Aug. 28, Life & Style), 
Baldwin Park crime has continued to drop, he said, pointing out that "last year 
we had 10 homicides and this year we've had six." Gang-related and violent 
crimes are down, too, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic development is on the rise, Vargas said, citing a new coffeehouse, 
art gallery venue and a combination billiards parlor and grill as "the kinds of 
businesses we're trying to attract." Recently, Target announced plans to open a 
store in Baldwin Park -- another coup claimed by the mayor. "Our hard work is 
starting to pay off." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Vargas -- who works full time as a public-safety policy 
analyst for Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan -- appeared in Time as one of 
America's 50 most promising leaders 40 or younger. 
</P>
<P>
 This past summer, Vargas appeared in a Newsweek spread about the stereotyping 
of Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
 Requests and invitations have poured in -- from a ninth-grader in Florida 
wanting to interview Vargas for an essay, from colleges for speaking 
engagements, and from a Republican party official who beckoned Vargas to switch 
affiliations any time he tired of the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, a Harvard graduate, is quick to give credit to others who worked to 
improve Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really nice to be included in that (Time magazine) list, but I wouldn't 
be on it if it wasn't for the people who helped carry out the direction that 
the Baldwin Park City Council and staff set," said Vargas, whose term as mayor 
will end in March of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, "I want to be a successful entrepreneur, that is still my ultimate 
goal." Then, "I would consider going back to politics," he said, adding that 
his goal is to attain a seat in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, there's a city to run. "I'm still looking for graffiti every time 
I get behind my wheel," he said. "The big issue right now in Baldwin Park is 
abandoned shopping carts. So if that's the worst problem that we have, I feel 
pretty good." MICHAEL QUINTANILLA

 Going, going, going . . . gone! 
</P>
<P>
 First went the gray hair, then went the fat. And now, the pudgy Kathleen 
Sullivan of the baggy sweaters and the salt-and-pepper locks is -- dare we say 
it? -- gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
 In her place is a svelte, smart, raven-haired beauty with oh-so-many job 
offers and oh-so-much to share about losing weight "the healthy way" ("Winning 
for Losing," Feb. 24, View). 
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's Eve, the world will see what a year of Weight Watchers can do 
for a gal -- and, not coincidentally, for her career. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of the diet plan's commercials for 1995, we'll witness the 
sweet-faced, tart-tongued Sullivan in a black spandex cat suit bragging about 
how she lost 30 pounds. And brag she should. After all, wasn't it just a few 
seasons ago that she was unemployed, overweight, depressed and broke?

 Sullivan, 40, made her national debut as the first Olympic anchorwoman in 
1984. In 1987, she switched from ABC to CBS, where she woke us up to the fact 
that the early morning news shows weren't just for perky blondes. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics raved about her wit and her refreshingly natural (that is, slightly 
graying) good looks. But on Valentine's Day, 1990, when she was fired, some 
suggested that it was because she had grown too natural for her own good. 
</P>
<P>
 So imagine our surprise when another, considerably heftier Kathleen Sullivan 
made her debut a year ago as the spokeswoman for Weight Watchers. Again, the 
girl from Arcadia won us over. "One moment I'm a network anchor and the next, 
well, look at me," she told millions of viewers while patting her ample belly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now instead of a belly, Sullivan has her own TV pilot -- "The Kathleen 
Sullivan Show," which she described as a kind of "Queen for a Day for the '90s 
-- a show designed to make women's dreams come true." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan's own dreams continue to come true as she enters the second year of 
what has been called the most public diet in history. While most of her excess 
weight is history, Sullivan says her goal for 1995 is keeping it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the toughest thing," Sullivan said, "but with 2 million other people 
out there who've done it, I'm really inspired. This is going to be a great 
year!" PAMELA WARRICK

A NEW HOME, A NEW LIFE

<TEXT>
<P>
 It starts with the poppies. All of a sudden, here they are, part of the 
landscape I take for granted. Like the Bay Bridge view of San Francisco. Like 
earthquakes, fresh tortillas, crab season, like the Pacific Ocean itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes I can do without. But the other stuff? 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you folks going?" the mailman says, nodding at the "For Sale" sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virginia," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're -- leaving California?"  
</P>
<P>
 That's just what I think to myself a hundred times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not so much going to one place as we are leaving the other. We're 
uprooting, taking the things we own but leaving the things that made us. 
</P>
<P>
 We're going to a better job, safer streets, a place without 911 buttons on the 
automated teller machines. We're leaving aging parents, comfortable back roads 
and baseball teams, a lifetime of people we love, or know, or at least can call 
on if something goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 But America's migratory history tends to deny the idea of loss. To complain, 
to drag your feet, to be depressed, to achingly miss your friends and family, 
is somehow seen as the height of self-indulgence. It's anti-opportunity. And by 
extension, un-American. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't you excited?" someone inevitably asks when I describe our future home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great," I say. "Just great." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure my 4-year-old son understands what it all means. He knows about 
the boxes in the basement and the real estate people. He knows we'll be 
together again with his father, who has been back east for several months at 
his new job. But as far as he can see, Virginia is only 10 inches away from 
California in his "Child's Atlas of North America." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom," he says one day, "when we move to a new state, will our friends move 
with us?" 
</P>
<P>
 I should find solace in the massive group experience of it all, in the fact 
that each year, about one in six Americans moves somewhere -- across town, 
upstate, to a different region, another country, even to Virginia. But the 
numbers don't help. No matter how many other people move, I've always assumed I 
would live out my life on the West Coast, where my great grandparents came a 
century ago to find their own version of better jobs and 911-free banks, where 
I've been connected to the tiniest ripples of life since day one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thinking," I say one night to my husband. "If I die in Virginia, 
who will come to my funeral?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, people moved on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a deeply rooted tendency in American culture," says Peter Morrison, Rand 
Corp. demographer. "Our society is one built out of the migratory experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Canada and Australia. Scratch the surface of any of these three countries 
and you find millions of what California writer Bill Barich calls 
"Elsewherians." They strip the cupboards, stash the toys, grab the truck and 
ride off to the Promised Land, taking part in what Morrison describes as "a 
fundamentally healthy process, akin to the human circulatory system -- our way 
of maintaining the economic life of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 He's right. If we all stayed in one place forever, the country would have a 
monumental economic heart attack. So we go to Texas, Denver or Silicon Valley 
when they're booming. We go elsewhere when they slip. We leave California, in 
droves these days, with the same single-mindedness that Steinbeck's Joad family 
came here. We uproot for the good of the family, and in the end, for the good 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Outwardly, it makes perfect sense. But still, I know there must be hundreds of 
thousands of uprooters, my immigrant great-grandmother among them, who tape the 
boxes shut, say their last goodbys, and then begin to die inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "The diaries of women coming across the Great Plains, following their 
husbands, are filled with lament and regret," says John Bodner, professor of 
history at Indiana University. "They ask themselves, 'What am I doing . . .?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks after we arrive in Virginia, my son and I are watching his "Dumbo" 
video. Dumbo's mother gets locked away in the cage. My son crawls onto my lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think being in jail is better than being in a new state," he says. "When 
you're in jail, you just pay money and you can get out. But when you're in a 
new state, you have to wait till your mom or dad says you can go home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's similar to the grieving process," says Stephen V. Eliot, a Ridgefield, 
Conn., psychologist who for 12 years ran a relocation counseling service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the decision to move is made, people can have a profound sense of loss. 
It starts with the very basic things, the familiarity of the everyday. The 
sense of security you have from knowing a place. It moves to deeper 
relationships and support systems, to friends and family." 
</P>
<P>
 The people who recover, who can turn uprooting into transplanting, are the 
ones who feel the sadness to the bone, Eliot says. They accept it. They admit 
it. They acknowledge that losses have their own time frame, that you can't stop 
feeling them by willing them away. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, random moments of feeling connected turn into days. Then into 
months. And that's when the real new life takes hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who don't make it through just go through the motions. Moving? A cinch. 
Pack up the house, send out new-address mailers, sign up for some pottery 
classes, get new curtains, a few new friends, and, presto, you have a new life. 
</P>
<P>
 Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the separation is so painful, people block it out altogether," 
Eliot says. "They say things like, 'These friends weren't so great.' They also 
struggle with the unreasonableness of their sadness: How could I possibly feel 
this way if what we're doing is best for the family? They can withdraw. And 
then they're not able to make new connections." 
</P>
<P>
 At midnight I call a friend in California. "How did we get to know each 
other?" I say. "I don't even remember." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was just chemistry," she says. "When you have a lot of people in 
your life, you can afford the luxury of chemistry. It just happens. When you're 
desperate, it's like you're looking at everyone you meet, wondering, 'Is this 
the one?' It's a double bind. You can't just go up to people and say, 'Hi. I 
just moved here and feel terrible about it. Wanna be friends?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four months after we arrive in Virginia, my son announces that he loves his 
new state and wants to stay forever. He loves his school, his karate class, and 
most of all, Virginia's trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have any trees in California," he says. One day I pick him up at 
the home of a preschool friend. The friend's mother greets me at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole move must have been hard on you," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 I force a smile. "It's been OK. . . . To tell you the truth, it's been kind of 
awful." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what you mean," she says. "We came here from Boston two years ago. 
Coffee?"

 Michael Huffington's failed Senate campaign turned out to be a long, strange 
journey back to Santa Barbara for him and his wife, Arianna ("Eyes on a Cosmic 
Prize," Feb. 20, View). Along the way, Arianna may have been accused of 
courting the public eye, but the press attention wasn't that much fun, not with 
all those pesky critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unprecedented, the level of viciousness," she said. "But it's not a 
personal thing. It's not about Michael and me. It's about what we stood for. 
Because you see the same exact people attacking Newt Gingrich." 
</P>
<P>
 So Huffington is fighting media fire with fire. She's finishing a pilot for 
"Beat the Press," a TV show that would focus on "the media's sacrificial lamb 
of the moment" -- a new one each week -- and then "do an investigative package 
on who the reporters are and what are their motivations," noting any "left-wing 
alliances," according to her written treatment. First up is GOP chum Gingrich, 
the House Speaker-designate who's closely linked to the Progress & Freedom 
Foundation, a think tank that has enlisted Arianna as a senior fellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna is also writing a book based on a journal she kept during the 
campaign, in which the couple spent $28 million of their own money. She's 
toying with possible titles: "California on $25,000 a Day" or "Where Was Mary 
Poppins When I Needed Her?," a wry reference to the controversy over the 
Huffingtons' hiring of an illegal immigrant. She doesn't believe, however, that 
that issue did in her husband's stab at the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's ever any one thing, and I don't think it's accidental 
either. Everything happens for a purpose," said Arianna, whose spiritual 
experiments and alliances also aroused controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Michael, he's in Santa Barbara, mulling career moves that he'll 
announce in the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Santa Barbara . "Contrary to 3,000 stories, we're not selling our house 
in Santa Barbara," she said. "That's one of those undocumented, unsubstantiated 
things." IRENE LACHER

<P>
 Last May, the woman who specialized in helping others make dramatic life 
transitions was contemplating one of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Eve Madigan, founding director of the Los Angeles Trade Technical College's 
Equity Center, had created a unique program to show men and women how to weave 
their own career safety nets ("Mother of Reinvention," May 15, Life & Style). 
</P>
<P>
 Madigan, 65, said that as the program grew, her days had evolved into a steady 
stream of administrative tasks, cutting into her familiar hands-on classroom 
duties. With a successor in the wings, Madigan looked to a quieter future. "I'm 
trying to make a determination now about what I want to do. And I don't know 
yet . . . that's my next challenge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That challenge suddenly announced itself. Following The Times' article, 
Madigan's staff logged more than 500 calls from people seeking help -- a sure 
sign her work was far from complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "The article opened up all kinds of visibility for me. They came in saying: 
'Where is Eve? I want to see Eve.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Madigan and her staff analyzed the needs of every person who inquired about 
the center, then made next-step recommendations -- everything from basic-skill 
referrals to career assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of those who inquired were placed into Madigan's free Vocational 
Improvement Program, which as well as raising self-esteem, "develops a protocol 
of strengths and juxtaposes those strengths to the 22,000 careers that are out 
there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, though, a feared financial crunch became reality. She lost 
$200,000 in funding, which forced some staff cuts and changes in her duties. 
With her staff reduced from 37 to 15, Madigan found herself back in the 
classroom -- re-energized by the feedback and acute need. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate the overflow, she has since rented space in South Pasadena at 
Classes Unlimited to teach a 15-week evening program that costs attendees $40 
per class session. She augments that with an advanced VIP class, with plans to 
provide intensive four- to five-day retreat-style seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, after she "retires," Madigan plans to open an outplacement service. 
"To go out to companies that are terminating -- and counsel not only 
individuals but also the people who are doing the terminating. It is a very 
difficult, sensitive thing. I think it's going to be exciting . . ." Madigan 
said, laughing. "I'm really enjoying where I am right now . . . but here we go 
into another cycle." LYNELL GEORGE

 Woodworker Sam Maloof's meandering, organically designed Alta Loma home and 
workshop remains in the path of the Foothill Freeway. And Maloof, 78, and his 
wife, Freda, remain intent on preserving the place that many craft-movement 
cognoscenti consider a masterpiece ("A Man of the Woods," July 24, Life & 
Style). 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, supporters have created the nonprofit Sam and Freda Maloof 
Foundation for Arts and Crafts. The organization is discussing how best to work 
with government agencies to move the workshop and house -- and the Maloofs -- 
to an as-yet-undetermined location nearby, where Maloof will also design and 
build a new house, to serve as a gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the board members is Patrick Ela, who heads the Los Angeles Craft and 
Folk Art Museum, and history professor Nox Mellon, the director of Riverside's 
Mission Inn Foundation. The board is studying various models of house-based 
museums, including Pasadena's famous Gamble house. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses and craft collection will be donated to the foundation, with the 
understanding that Maloof's son and assistants eventually take over production 
of the furniture and be allowed to work there. Sam and Freda will have lifetime 
occupancy of the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Tentative plans for the project at its new site include weekly interpretive 
tours of the new house, which will serve as a gallery for the family's 
extensive collection of modern craft objects and furniture, and of the Maloofs' 
current house. 
</P>
<P>
 Maloof, widely regarded as one of America's greatest craftsmen, may also give 
seminars, funds from which would sponsor one- to three-month woodworking 
internships in the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Having put 30 years of labor into his current home, Maloof concedes that 
planning for the move has been traumatic. But, he added, "I'm not going to let 
it bother me. . . . This will be a renewal . . . an opportunity to try new 
ideas. . . . It's exciting, really." BOB SIPCHEN

<P>
 This past summer, 17-year-old Jennifer Espinoza went head to head with the 
Catholic church. She lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza got married without the church's nod last spring, and soon the nation 
knew about it ("They Say Love Conquers All -- Will It Now?" Aug. 8, Life & 
Style). Alemany High School in Mission Hills cited archdiocese rules and booted 
the button-nosed teen because she was married. She enlisted attorney Gloria 
Allred, who took the battle to TV talk-show land. Allred argued that the school 
rule book said nothing of holy vows -- and that the church should stay out of 
the Espinozas' private life anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the spotlight, the church agreed to allow Espinoza back into school if 
she and 25-year-old hubby Caesar got a priest's approval and wed in a Catholic 
church. Her other option, the church said, was to spend a year at public school 
and go back to Alemany at the end of the year for graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two said their assigned priest was unavailable. By summer's end, 
Espinoza enrolled at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. "By the time we actually got 
to meet the priest," Caesar Espinoza said recently, "it was already too late to 
go to school for the fall semester." School started Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Gregory Coiro, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, 
acknowledged the couple was a victim of vacation season. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides ended the standoff frustrated. "She will take the diploma, but she 
will not graduate with the class," Caesar Espinoza said. "She doesn't want 
anything to do with the school." Said Coiro: "It was very unfortunate that the 
whole thing was a public spectacle." 
</P>
<P>
 There is some good news. Jennifer Espinoza is confidently college-bound. And 
Alemany High added a rule to its rule book that might have prevented this whole 
mess in the first place: No married students. DENNIS ROMERO

<P>
 Even in the unpredictable, unfathomable, crap-shooting world of politics, 
Larry EchoHawk seemed a sure bet to become governor of Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 He held a double-digit lead over his opponents and enjoyed the blessing of the 
incumbent governor. He is Native American, a devoted family man, a respected 
lawyer and Idaho's current attorney general running against virtual nobodies. 
</P>
<P>
 And EchoHawk stumped with a message that no Idahoan could challenge: "Idaho is 
what America once was, and what America wants to be. Idaho is, simply, the last 
best place in America to live and raise a family. I want to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The media from Tokyo to Washington -- including The Times ("The Quiet Man," 
Nov. 2, Life & Style) -- followed EchoHawk's campaign as this 46-year-old 
Pawnee sought to become the nation's first Native American governor. 
</P>
<P>
 But as went America, so went Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 EchoHawk, despite his correctness, despite a huge dignity and his appeal as a 
man who had traveled from dirt floors to high public office, was buried by the 
GOP landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 He received only 44% of the vote in a three-way contest won by Republican Phil 
Batt, a 67-year-old farmer from Wilder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real surprise to the people of Idaho, myself included," he recalled 
last week. "But when you're running in the second most Republican state in 
America, when Republicans are running so strongly, it was bound to impact the 
Idaho election." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides say that EchoHawk was as gracious in defeat as when running with victory 
presumed. He congratulated his opponents, and said he respected and accepted 
the will of the people. For this was America and democracy working. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was certainly at peace because I felt we ran a very positive, strong 
campaign," he said. "I couldn't be very disappointed because in my life, I've 
realized the very best America has to offer. I was just thrilled by the 
opportunity to run for the office of governor and to serve as attorney 
general." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, EchoHawk packs his bags as attorney general. The next day, he unpacks 
his books as professor of criminal trial practice and federal Indian law at his 
alma mater, Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he will use that first semester to teach and recoup, to reflect and 
evaluate. There will soon be a U.S. Senate vacancy in Idaho. Congressional 
seats and a federal judgeship are opening up. 
</P>
<P>
 EchoHawk certainly is not selling his home in Boise. 
</P>
<P>
 Said a former campaign worker: "This nation has neither seen nor heard the 
last of Larry EchoHawk, Native American." PAUL DEAN

 Chaumanix Dutton had a good year at Berkshire School, the prep academy in 
western Massachusetts where she won a $21,000 annual scholarship ("A Shared 
Success," Jan. 4, View). 
</P>
<P>
 "She's opened up a little; she's not nearly as shy and it's working for her," 
said Melissa Livsey, head of the dorm where Dutton lives. "The kids like her 
and the faculty like her." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like everybody knows each other," Dutton said while home in 
South-Central Los Angeles for the holidays. "I'm friends with some of the 
faculty. I've pretty much always been on speaking terms with my teachers, but 
now I can talk to them about anything and they talk to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaumanix, a 15-year-old sophomore, has also participated in sports and 
discovered that she likes basketball and cross country. And despite a tough 
academic load, she's maintaining straight A's. 
</P>
<P>
 That performance pleases her mother to no end. 
</P>
<P>
 "She hasn't missed a step in terms of her academic achievements," says Sophia 
Berkley, an administrative assistant at a resource and referral agency for 
child care. ". . . And there have been no social problems. She's still able to 
mix with kids and people on all levels, and she's still not a snob. That's 
extremely important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Berkley misses her daughter. "Each day it becomes more and more 
evident that she's really left home. . . . She went to New York with a friend 
over Thanksgiving and didn't come home. That was very difficult. It was the 
first time the entire family (Dutton has two younger brothers) hadn't been 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Chaumanix -- a true Californian -- contends with what she calls one 
of her main problems: the snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walking all the way across campus in the snow isn't appealing," she said. ". 
. . It was cool at first, but after a while you get tired of it. . . . Where is 
the sun? Where is the warmth?" GARY LIBMAN

DOLPHINS STOP SANDERS, CLINCH DIVISION TITLE; INTERCONFERENCE: MIAMI LIMITS 
DETROIT RUNNING BACK TO 52 YARDS IN HIS QUEST FOR 2,000 AND WINS AFC EAST WITH 
27-20 VICTORY.

 The Miami Dolphins wrapped up Detroit's Barry Sanders and the AFC East title 
-- and gave scooter-bound Coach Don Shula another milestone victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular-season victory No. 319, surpassing the mark held by the late George 
Halas, was achieved as Dan Marino threw for 285 yards and Bernie Parmalee 
scored three touchdowns in a 27-20 victory over Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Shula, still wearing a cast following Achilles' tendon surgery, presided over 
the victory while roaming the sidelines on a motorized scooter. He'd used a 
golf cart the previous two weeks, but this time went with the scooter because 
it gave him more mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins teetered on blowing a 17-point first half lead until an 
interception of Dave Krieg's pass with 3:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami held Sanders, the NFL's leading rusher, to 52 yards in 12 carries. 
Sanders needed 169 yards to become the third 2,000-yard rusher in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami (10-6) shared first place in the AFC East with New England but got the 
division title by virtue of beating the Patriots twice during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gives the Dolphins some badly needed momentum going into the playoffs. 
The Dolphins had lost four of six going into Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami will play host to Kansas City for the second time this year at Joe 
Robbie Stadium in the first round of the playoffs next weekend. The Dolphins 
defeated the Chiefs, 45-28, on Dec. 12 in a game that Kansas City quarterback 
Joe Montana sat out because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions (9-7), who had won four in a row, missed a chance to win the NFC 
Central. They now must await the outcome of the Minnesota-San Francisco game 
tonight to see who they will play in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A Viking victory means the Lions will travel to Green Bay next weekend. A 
Minnesota loss means Detroit will visit the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either place we don't want to go to especially after our performance today," 
Lion Coach Wayne Fontes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 7-3, Miami scored 20 points in the second quarter, sparked by a 
swarming defense that notched five sacks in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami led at intermission, 27-10, on the strength of Parmalee's touchdown runs 
of one, one and six yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino passed for 222 yards in the half, spreading the ball around to eight 
receivers. He completed 26 of 35 passes for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions' first touchdown came in the second quarter when Johnnie Morton 
returned a kickoff 93 yards to cut Miami's lead to 24-10. It was the third 
touchdown Miami's special teams have allowed in as many games. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed as if it might be the only touchdown Detroit would muster until 
Krieg started moving the Lions in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieg, limited to five passing yards in the first half, led the Lions on an 
80-yard drive in the fourth quarter. He connected with Aubrey Matthews on 
five-yard pass play with 5:46 left in the game to cut Miami's lead to 27-20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions got the ball back with four minutes left, but Krieg's pass was 
picked off when Gene Atkins tipped a ball intended for Morton into the hands of 
Michael Stewart. The Dolphins ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>

 Detroit Lion running back Barry Sanders, with 52 yards rushing against the 
Miami Dolphins Sunday night, moved to the No. 4 spot on the NFL's all-time

PRO FOOTBALL: LOOKING BACK AT THE 1994 SEASON; BEATING A PATH TO LAST PLACE; 
RAM ANALYSIS: TEAM'S TROUBLES START AT THE TOP AND END IN THE SAME OLD PLACE -- 
BOTTOM OF THE NFC WEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three years under Coach Chuck Knox, and after the month of September, the Rams 
were always 2-2, pointing to improvement and in position to contend. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came October and there went the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Early season preparation gave way to midseason exasperation, and in the end -- 
each and every year -- the Rams dropped to the cellar in the NFC West Division, 
the gap with the champion San Francisco 49ers ever-widening. 
</P>
<P>
 This past season was going to be different after the banishment of Jim 
Everett, the signing of Chris Miller and Jimmie Jones and the drafting of Wayne 
Gandy. But poor personnel decisions, now a Ram tradition, once again sabotaged 
the master plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame it on the front office or blame it on Knox, but in the last three years 
the Rams allowed the departures of offensive linemen Duval Love and Gerald 
Perry, defensive end Kevin Greene, tight end Pat Carter, running back Cleveland 
Gary and wide receiver Henry Ellard. Good teams might be able to afford such 
defections; the Rams were left devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 The weaknesses along the offensive line were recognizable before the season 
and never corrected. Without blocking, runningback Jerome Bettis became a 
poor-man's Darryl Johnston a year after mimicking Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams counted on a Fearsome Foursome on defense to dictate results, and 
they did. After a flashy start with 12 sacks in the first five games, the Rams 
compiled 14 the rest of the way and allowed their opponents to roam freely. 
Greene, who couldn't find a home in the Rams' defensive scheme, led the league 
with 14 sacks for Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Flipper Anderson, who is now free to negotiate a deal elsewhere, led the 
team's wide receivers with 46 catches, putting him only 28 behind Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of Wayne Sevier, widely regarded as one of the league's top 
special-teams coordinators, was going to make the difference in two or three 
games. There was a difference, but the estimate was too low: Sevier's special 
teams led to losses against Green Bay, New Orleans, Washington and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams gave up 367 points a year ago; 365 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Four times a week assistant coach Joe Vitt slept at Rams Park to save time and 
better prepare the Rams for competition. Day after day the Rams practiced with 
vigor; the same cannot be said of every other NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
 Great intentions aside, the Rams still couldn't get it right. They did their 
homework, found a jewel in Miller after discovering Scott Mitchell's shoulder 
wasn't ready for combat, and put up $9 million to sign him. Miller responded 
with leadership, accuracy and the promise that his injury-prone days were 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, however, injured a stomach muscle in training camp, and then ribs in 
the regular-season opener. Two concussions and a separated shoulder followed. 
The loss in accuracy was understandable, but inexplicably Miller began faulting 
others for the team's inability to score consistently. Knox, a small-town 
Pennsylvania man's man, lost faith in Miller, and turned to Chris Chandler, a 
Dave Krieg-like quarterback, who didn't turn the ball over while allowing the 
running game and defense to dominate the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox's reluctance to embrace Chandler publicly at Miller's expense contributed 
to the team's leadership vacuum. While most teams fix their attention on their 
quarterback, the Rams did not know week-to-week who was going to be throwing 
the ball. Take a poll today, and still there is no clear-cut choice to lead the 
Rams in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' offensive team captain, Jackie Slater, was injured, and when healthy 
alternated with Darryl Ashmore early in the season. The Rams' defensive team 
captain, Anthony Newman, was benched in favor of rookie Toby Wright. Nice guys 
finish last, and the Rams had a whole bunch of them. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of individual heroics: Todd Lyght taking on every one of the 
game's top receivers and proving he is one of the game's top cornerbacks; Shane 
Conlan competing with Super Bowl fervor; Darryl Henley putting aside tremendous 
personal difficulties and performing with brilliance; Tom Newberry overcoming 
the knowledge that the coaching staff didn't want him playing; Newman accepting 
his demotion with class; Tony Zendejas making 19 of 23 field-goal attempts; 
Roman Phifer and Joe Kelly demonstrating that they have been taught well by one 
of the game's top assistant coaches, Dick Selcer; and Bettis handling 
misfortune with professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were a number of pleasant and promising surprises: Clarence Jones 
working overtime to become a proficient left tackle; Marquez Pope emerging as a 
personality and prime-time hitter; Wright making a head-on impact on special 
teams; Keith Loneker holding on and Isaac Bruce catching the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, there were too many letdowns: Sean Gilbert, hurt and 
ineffective; Todd Kinchen, exciting, but undependable; Gandy, a first-round 
draft choice in over his head; Steve Israel, a second-round pick with a bad 
knee; and David Lang, an explosive runner who couldn't hold onto the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows about Chris Brantley, Tommy Maddox and Keith Lyle? 
</P>
<P>
 There might never be a satisfactory explanation for the manner in which tight 
end Troy Drayton was employed, and unless the coaching staff had it in for 
Bettis, there is no reason for fullback Tim Lester's demotion as Bettis' lead 
blocker. Why was Ashmore kept inactive for the latter part of the season? How 
come Robert Young disappeared? What went wrong with Russell White, Sean 
LaChapelle, James Bostic, Brad Ottis and T.J. Rubley? 
</P>
<P>
 Six losses this season by seven or fewer points, and the Rams believe they 
were that close to making it to the playoffs. But seven consecutive losses, 
including a dead-in-the-water month of December, tell another story. 
</P>
<P>
 Half full or half empty? Does Knox get the fourth year of his contract and a 
chance to enhance his reputation as the coach who turns programs around? Does 
Miller return as the starting quarterback? Do Phifer and Anderson spurn 
free-agent offers elsewhere and return to the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, isn't that St. Louis' concern?

PRO FOOTBALL: LOOKING BACK AT THE 1994 SEASON; ALL THE PIECES, STILL A PUZZLE; 
RAIDER ANALYSIS: THEY HAD THE PERSONNEL BUT LACKED LEADERSHIP AND DISCIPLINE, 
FINISHING WITH 9-7 RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the first play of the first quarter of the first exhibition game in 
Barcelona, Spain, Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler threw a 75-yard touchdown 
pass to James Jett. 
</P>
<P>
 It was never that good again. Not for Hostetler. Not for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The bright promise of that summer day in Barcelona, the euphoric feelings 
heading into San Francisco for the season opener, were long forgotten in the 
depression and disillusionment of Christmas Eve at the Coliseum where the 
Raiders, a 10-6 playoff team a year ago, wound up 9-7, losing to the Kansas 
City Chiefs, 19-9, and failing to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to fault the Raiders' preparations for this year. The Raiders 
retained prime receiver Tim Brown, who had signed an offer sheet with the 
Denver Broncos. They signed Harvey Williams, who was 17 yards shy of 1,000 and 
became the tailback the Raiders needed. They added offensive lineman Kevin 
Gogan to the weak right side. They got Jerry Ball to fill the hole left in the 
defensive line when Howie Long retired and Scott Davis' comeback attempt proved 
a bust. They drafted Rob Fredrickson, who kept getting better with experience 
and became one of the league's top defensive rookies, shoring up the 
linebacking corps, a weakness going into the season. They made second-year 
player Greg Biekert the starting middle linebacker and he was even more solid 
and dependable than Joe Kelly, the man Biekert replaced. They even strengthened 
an already strong area by bringing in veteran cornerback Albert Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a lot of new ingredients, but the mixture resulted in a sour season. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the additions, the Raiders lacked: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An effective offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A strong arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Good leaders make good decisions. The Raiders started the season with a 
disastrous one, choosing Ty Montgomery, the first to admit he is not a natural 
tailback, as the starter over Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders stubbornly stuck with Montgomery for six games, losing four times 
before turning to Williams, who then became what he never was in Kansas City, a 
back who can carry an offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Al Davis and Coach Art Shell have to take responsibility for that 
decision and for the lack of leadership that produced a season-long controversy 
over play-calling. When your coach and quarterback get into a heated, public 
argument on the sideline in Miami; when Shell, offensive coordinator Tom Walsh, 
Hostetler and receiver Tim Brown engage in long debates, some public, some 
private, over offensive philosophy; when another assistant coach, Fred 
Biletnikoff, is forced to serve as a buffer between all these forces, what kind 
of a message does that send to the rest of the players? 
</P>
<P>
 This is no way to run a team. 
</P>
<P>
 If Shell is to remain the coach, he must assert his authority or lose the 
team's respect. He must raise his voice and tell all the others to lower theirs 
or he won't be able to function effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell must also take responsibility for the lack of discipline. When a team 
commits 156 penalties, highest total in league history, the final whistle has 
to be blown at the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell can fine players for personal fouls as he ultimately did. He can lecture 
and teach and extend practices. All of those he did and still the flags flew. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors of Shell's firing will begin, but that doesn't figure to happen. 
Davis wants a coach he is comfortable with, someone with whom he can continue 
to have great influence and offer much input. He wouldn't be able to do that 
with Jimmy Johnson or Mike Ditka. And besides, Davis' experience with Mike 
Shanahan as head coach soured Davis on going outside the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 So look for Shell to stay. But if he doesn't take charge, set the tone and 
establish the overall offensive philosophy, look for the problems to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to lack of leadership and discipline, the defense has to take 
some of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the Raiders didn't give up more than 21 points in any game after their 
fourth. But they also collapsed in several crucial games at the end, showing a 
lack of commitment. That's when players such as Lewis, Winston Moss, Terry 
McDaniel, Anthony Smith, Nolan Harrison and Chester McGlockton have to step 
forward and provide leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive line was a mystery. It included perennial Pro Bowl pick Steve 
Wisniewski, solid Gerald Perry, unshakable Don Mosebar and the highly touted 
Gogan. What it didn't include was an impressive performance. Hostetler spent as 
much time in the trainer's room as the locker room. He was sacked 42 times and 
pummeled and pounded countless others. Where was the protection? Were all these 
guys overrated? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is Hostetler. He came to Los Angles two years ago with a 
reputation as a master of a ball-control, high-percentage offense who had 
thrown only 20 interceptions in five years. He threw 16 this season, including 
the one Saturday that sunk the Raiders' last hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he denied it, Hostetler showed all the signs of having an arm injury 
in the first two games and never was able to consistently throw long, to take 
advantage of the fastest receiving corps in the league, to avoid the 
ill-advised throws, to find receivers other than Brown often enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler did it last season. He did it in Barcelona. He'll have to do it 
again if the Raiders are to improve on this season's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 It's simple. The coach must get tougher. The players must be more disciplined. 
The offensive line must get better. And the quarterback must throw deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the team will go nowhere.

LEAVING 'EM IN STITCHES; MALIK SEALY MAKES STATEMENT WITH FASHION DESIGN AS 
WELL AS LOOKING GOOD FOR CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Clipper guard Malik Sealy has a big name to live up to. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy's father, Sidney, a bodyguard for Malcolm X, named his youngest son 
after the late Muslim leader, who was assassinated in 1965, six years before 
his son was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malik (Mah-LEEK) was one of Brother Minister Malcolm X's Muslim names 
(El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz)," the elder Sealy explained. "Do you know what it 
means? It means king. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of brothers are named after him. He was very smart and self-taught." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sealy's mother, Ann, "Malik wasn't aware of the whole story until someone 
blessed him (for his name) and he asked his father, 'How did I get this name?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney Sealy, whose Muslim name is Suliaman, which means wise man, became a 
Muslim after he was introduced to Malcolm X and attended his mosque in Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be a Muslim till I die," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Golden Gloves boxer, Sealy became one of Malcolm X's bodyguards. 
Although he was present when Malcolm X was slain at Harlem's Audubon Ballroom 
on Feb. 18, 1965, Sealy wasn't helping with security. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very horrible day," Sealy recalled. "To see someone that you respect 
go down like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't on the stage (protecting Malcolm X) because he didn't want anyone on 
stage. The (police) that were supposed to be there weren't there. The 
bodyguards were there, but the police weren't on guard. They were downstairs. 
It was like it was a setup." 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy, 61, a New York City cab driver, instilled Muslim values, among them 
self-reliance, in his four children, Sydney, 31; Dessalines, 30; Amir, 25, and 
Malik, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Malik Sealy formed his own clothing company -- Malik Sealy XXI -- after 
signing a reported $6-million, five-year contract with the Indiana Pacers in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before sports I was sewing," Sealy said. "When basketball came along, that's 
when I moved away from sewing. But my mother taught me how to sew at a young 
age. It was something my grandmother did. Everybody in the family learned to 
sew. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother never just wanted us to do one thing. She had a saying that's it's 
an awfully poor rabbit that just has one hole. That's true about life. You have 
to have other avenues." 
</P>
<P>
 The business is run in New York by Sealy's mother, a graduate of the Fashion 
Institute of Technology, and his brother, Dessalines. Sealy says it is 
thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy, who designed the uniforms worn by the Pacers' women's dance team last 
year, designed a neckwear collection and a line of suspenders that are sold in 
about 250 upscale stores such as Bloomingdale's and Barney's. He eventually 
hopes to expand the line to include men's dress shirts and suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has a design team, Sealy comes up with most of the concepts for 
his products and takes an active role in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother has been a seamstress all her life and she's been in the fashion 
business all her life," he said. "We always used to have unique clothes. People 
would go, 'Wow, where did you get that?' And my mother made them." 
</P>
<P>
 He wears expensive designer watches on both wrists so that he can keep up with 
his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a West Coast watch and an East Coast watch," he said. "The right wrist 
is the right time and the left wrist is East Coast time. It's just a little 
fashion thing. Also for my business, it's easier to just look at this hand and 
see what time it is rather than look at it and subtract three hours. And I 
haven't seen a watch with two separate faces that I like." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the Clippers' best dressed player, Sealy has had teammates seek him 
out for fashion advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy has looked just as good on the court this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy, who was acquired from the Pacers along with point guard Pooh Richardson 
and the rights to Nebraska swingman Eric Piatkowski for disgruntled point guard 
Mark Jackson and the rights to Greg Minor in a draft-day trade last June, 
averaged 20.3 points in his first six games as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who opened the season with 16 consecutive losses, played their 
best two games after Sealy moved into the starting lineup in place of guard 
Terry Dehere, who suffered a sprained right ankle in the Clippers' first 
victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dehere is sound, he hasn't been able to dislodge Sealy, who averaged 
27.5 points in his first two starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy scored 25 points in his first start as the Clippers defeated the Lakers 
by 25 points on Dec. 9 at the Forum. He had a career-high 28 points the next 
night as the Clippers forced the Seattle SuperSonics into double overtime 
before losing, 132-127. 
</P>
<P>
 A small forward for the first two years of his NBA career, Sealy has been more 
productive since Coach Bill Fitch switched him to shooting guard this season. 
Fitch even used Sealy at point guard in the exhibition season to improve his 
court awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got a much better chance of being a player in this league 
playing guard," Fitch said. "He's a guard. If he had to play small forward he 
would end up being a lesser role or a guy that's a mistake, drafted high and 
didn't play." 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy seems comfortable playing guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to make the adjustment if you want to play," Sealy said. "I'm trying 
to make the best of it and play as well as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy's success seems to have improved his self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say I'm surprised," he said. "I'm pleased, because this is the 
type of position you work to get to. Although things aren't going as well as I 
would like them to go, there are positive things coming out of this season, as 
far as me playing consistent minutesand being confident that I can go out there 
and make mistakes and not have to look over my shoulder every three or four 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy spent his first two seasons in the NBA looking over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers' No. 1 draft pick in 1992, Sealy found himself at odds with Coach 
Bob Hill after reporting to camp out of shape. He played in only 58 games as a 
rookie, averaging 5.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Given new life last season after the Pacers hired Coach Larry Brown, Sealy was 
expected to play a key role for the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
 He started well, averaging 12.4 points in his first 12 games after Derrick 
McKey was injured, but his season fell apart after he was sidelined for 13 
games because of a sprained right ankle last December. Sealy never worked his 
way back into the rotation and played in only 43 games, averaging 6.6 points, 
2.7 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 14.5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But what hurt more than the injury was being left off the playoff roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first round I didn't want to see any games," he said. "I didn't 
travel and I didn't see any of the (home games). I just stayed in my house. I 
thought about just going home, but sometimes your initial reaction isn't the 
best reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 But his attitude changed as the Pacers came within a game of reaching the NBA 
Finals, losing to the New York Knicks in the seventh game of the Eastern 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point the only thing I was thinking about was my playoff share," he 
said. "I was hoping we would keep winning because my playoff share would 
increase." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't ask to be traded when the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe players have control over it," he said. "Basically, this is 
the type of league where you're like a piece of meat, and if they want to cook 
you they'll cook you and if not, you'll just have to sit and rot." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Sealy wouldn't have started for the Pacers this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malik didn't want to be traded, but he knew he wasn't going to beat out 
Derrick and he knew he was going to play behind Reggie (Miller) and Byron 
(Scott)," Brown said. "And he's entering his third year and he wants to play. I 
can understand that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Malik is terrific. I always felt he was a quality player in this 
league. He started out very well and then he got hurt and then we traded for 
Derrick and he got hurt. It was very, very tough on Malik because he went from 
a starter to the bench. And then we (signed) Byron and that gave him no 
opportunity to be a backup off guard and he was limited inminutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy wasn't disappointed after he was traded to the Clippers because he 
realized he'd get more playing time than in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 He has adapted well to living in Los Angeles, renting a three-level house in 
Venice, seven blocks from the boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people here are more fake than they are in New York," he said. 
"Everybody's a star in L.A. I don't think I've met a person yet who works a 
regular job. Everyone's an actor or actress. Sure you are. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people go out there looking for stardom and never find it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Malik Sealy has found stardom with the Clippers.

By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As far as I am concerned, at least 10 good things happened in sports in the 
year 1994, at least 10 bad things happened and a whole lot of goofy things 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: THE GOOD 1. Dan Jansen lost his favorite race in the Olympics 
again, then skated the 1,000 meters, won and carried his child on a victory 
lap. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Tabasco Cat ran down its trainer, nearly killed him, then won the Preakness 
and Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 3. George Foreman got punched in his 45-year-old kisser for nine rounds, then 
decked Michael Moorer. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Team USA won a game in the World Cup, defeating Colombia to the delight of 
even those who hate soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Martina Navratilova nearly pulled a Foreman, making the final at Wimbledon 
on her farewell tour. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Representing a town ravaged by earthquake, the Little League baseball team 
from Northridge reached the World Series championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Days after a Sports Illustrated Winter Olympic preview that said 
Switzerland's cows could out-ski ours, Tommy Moe of the United States won the 
men's downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Oksana Baiul, 16, overcoming personal loss in Ukraine and an accident just 
before thefinals, won the Olympic women's figure skating gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Bonnie Blair won in speedskating -- again. 
</P>
<P>
 10. And Oregon got to the Rose Bowl, turning its conference temporarily into 
the Quack-10. THE BAD 
</P>
<P>
 1. Baseball struck out. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Tonya & accomplices knee-capped Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Hockey locked out. 
</P>
<P>
 4. After costing his team the U.S. game, a Colombian soccer player was 
murdered when he got home. (Upon reflection, this should be No. 1.) 
</P>
<P>
 5. The owner of the Kings bilked banks out of hundreds of millions. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Tennis teen Jennifer Capriati was found in a motel room full of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Days after his father signed to pitch for the Angels, Mark Leiter's 
three-year-old son died of spinal muscular atrophy. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Darryl Strawberry was a no-show for the exhibition finale, relapsed into 
rehab, got his release as a Dodger and was indicted as a tax dodger. 
</P>
<P>
 9. The Rams went 4-12, drew as few as 25,705 and bought maps of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 10. ESPN's nightly sportscast began for weeks with a murder trial. THE GOOFY 
</P>
<P>
 In no particular order: 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Murray was asked to stay away from the pro golf tour, which is trying to 
be serious. . . . Oprah Winfrey opened the World Cup by introducing Diana Ross, 
who's job was to kick a soccer ball into a net. Oprah fell down and Diana 
missed the net. . . . The President of the United States wept while hugging the 
coach as the University of Arkansas won in college basketball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding became a movie star: Three films about her and two films 
starring her, one of them from her honeymoon. . . . Brazil's World Cup 
champions brought home hundreds of thousands of dollars in merchandise from 
America but refused to pay duty at customs. . . . Reggie Miller scored 25 
points in one quarter, turned to Knick fan Spike Lee and made the "choke" sign. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 George Foreman won the heavyweight title, then said: "If happy little 
bluebirds fly, then why oh, why oh, why can't I?". . . . A potential O.J. juror 
begged off because she drew No. 32, Simpson's jersey number, and didn't want 
the publicity. . . . Scottie Pippen sat out the final seconds of a Chicago 
playoff game, because he felt like it. . . . A shoe commercial featured Dennis 
Rodman roughing up Santa Claus. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Marge Schott, after her team signed Neon Deion Sanders, said, "Only fruits 
wear earrings.". . . . Shaquille O'Neal, asked if he had visited the Parthenon 
while in Greece, said, "I can't remember which clubs we went to.". . . Tom 
Watson led a movement to get Gary McCord removed from CBS-TV's telecast of the 
Masters, partly because McCord said the greens were so slick, someone "must 
have used bikini wax." AND FINALLY 
</P>
<P>
 Rest in peace, Jimmie Reese. . . . and you, Heather Farr. . . . get well, 
Ernie Irvan. . . . you, too, Paul Azinger. . . . and you, Bob Chandler. . . . 
and likewise, George Raveling. . . . stay strong, Earvin Johnson. . . . keep 
swinging, Michael Jordan. . . . thanks for the memories, James Worthy. . . . 
you, too, Dave Taylor. . . . and remember, the opera ain't over until the fat 
dudes at Dodger Stadium sing.

MORNING BRIEFING: OPEN YOUR EYES AND SAY HELLO TO PICABO STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Picabo Street, the bubbly American downhill skier who won a silver medal in 
the Albertville Olympics, has dreams of being a country-western singer or a 
broadcaster, and drives like an Indianapolis 500 participant, according to 
Outside magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 How else has Street enjoyed her post-Olympic celebrity? 
</P>
<P>
 She was able to attend a charity benefit and got to meet Jack Nicholson and 
Whoopi Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Christian Slater," she told Outside. "He's my full-on heartthrob. He 
kinda realized who I was, but I don't know. He was semi out of it." 
</P>
<P>

 Trivia question: Who has the record for receiving the highest number of ballot 
points in Heisman Award voting? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Conjugate this: Steve Hummer of the Atlanta Journal/Constitution has had it up 
to his shoulder pads with the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Writes Hummer: "Enough of the Philadelphia quarterback upheaval and the 
pillorying of Rich Kotite, who looks to be a perfectly fine junior high English 
teacher." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Foolish Bull: In its year-end wrap-up of "The Lamest of the Lame," Inside Edge 
magazine lists the Chicago Bulls' Scottie Pippen right alongside Burt Reynolds, 
Tori Spelling and Fabio. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
 "What have you got to complain about?" the magazine says. "Michael's gone, 
you've had your chance to (star), you're making millions, and yet you're 
suddenly (an idiot)? Or were you one all along?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cool Cowboy: By the way, if you haven't already figured it out, Inside Edge is 
directed toward a Generation X audience. The magazine says that Dallas Cowboy 
Emmitt Smith, though, is a sportsman to respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big, strong, fast, mean -- well, he's not mean as long as you're not on the 
opposition's defense," they write. " . . . There's the two Super Bowl rings, 
the MVP awards, the trips to the Pro Bowl, the ads, the media hype, the fans, 
and the huge wads of cash. We mean huge!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fore more years? He hits the ball long, but has an uncertain short game. Oh, 
and he isn't chintzy with the mulligans, either. For President Clinton, 
according to Golf Digest, golf is a true passion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's on Army base courses or private and public courses in his 
travels, President Clinton plays as much golf as any President ever has," the 
magazine writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rumor has it, he's trying to break President Eisenhower's record of 150 
rounds in a year while in office."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Allan Malamud 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is time for a change in El Segundo. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders need a better coach to become the force in the AFC that they 
should be. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Art Shell said at the start of the season that this was the finest of his six 
Raider teams. Other, more objective experts picked them to reach the Super 
Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't victims of bad luck or a rash of injuries, but still failed to 
qualify for the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the San Francisco 49ers, the toughest enemies they faced all year 
were themselves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They set an NFL record for penalties and, if such things were measured, would 
have at least threatened the marks for foolish errors and poor strategy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Well-coached teams don't make the same mistakes game after game after game. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Under salary-cap restrictions, Al Davis put together what might have been the 
most talented roster in the conference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He retained nearly every important player from the team that came within seven 
points of reaching the AFC championship game last season, improved the 
defensive line with free agent Jerry Ball and helped to alleviate weaknesses at 
running back with free agent Harvey Williams and linebacker with rookie Rob 
Fredrickson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know how much Davis has to do with the actual coaching of the Raiders. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 But he can't be blamed for all those penalties, the frequent lack of intensity 
or the bad call by Shell to try to gain a few more yards in the final seconds 
of the first half Saturday against Kansas City when they already were within 
Jeff Jaeger's field-goal range. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the things that kept the Raiders from becoming Los Angeles' only 
major league franchise to advance to the postseason in 1994. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is up to Davis to hire a coach to match the quality of the playing 
personnel. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He would be wise to forget about the Mike Shanahan fiasco and bring in some 
bright young guy with NFL assistant coaching experience outside the 
organization, such as Tony Dungy of the Minnesota Vikings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strange, but the best game Saturday was played by two teams that already had 
clinched playoff spots, the San Diego Chargers and Pittsburgh Steelers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers needed a victory to earn a rest this week, but there was nothing 
at stake for the Steelers, who kept some important players on the bench and 
still played hard. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I don't blame coaches who rest stars in late-season games that have little or 
no meaning.Their primary concern should be their teams' chances to advance in 
the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Cowboy Coach Barry Switzer should have kept Troy Aikman on the bench 
the whole afternoon against the New York Giants instead of allowing him to risk 
another injury. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Everett had the most passing yardage of any quarterback in the league 
Saturday and Jay Schroeder the third most. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 During their Christmas Eve nightmares, the Raiders must have heard referee Red 
Cashion yelling, "First down!". . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to Giant wide receiver Mike Sherrard for climbing up the stairs at 
the Meadowlands and giving a fan an unexpected Christmas gift -- the ball 
Sherrard had just caught for a touchdown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing about Cincinnati's comeback victory over the Philadelphia 
Eagles was that the Bengals got to carry Tim Krumrie off the field on their 
shoulders after the final game of the defensive tackle's 12-year career. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's Jim Lampley put a different slant on Natrone Means' touchdown run for 
the Chargers in the fourth quarter, saying it was "the key play that set up the 
game-tying extra point." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants might have cut their payroll, but damaged their 
chances in the National League West when they traded pitcher John Burkett to 
the Texas Rangers for a couple of minor leaguers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago White Sox, who lost Julio Franco to Japan and traded Jack McDowell 
to the New York Yankees, probably are going in the same direction as the 
Chicago Bulls. . . The Angels would be crazy not to make a serious bid to bring 
Jim Abbott back to Anaheim Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 An important horse during the Santa Anita meeting that begins today could be 
The Wicked North, who has been training superbly for his comeback. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jockeys are among my favorite athletes, but I don't think they'll have much 
leverage if they quit working on Jan. 1. After all, the name of the game isn't 
jockey racing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On closing day in Anaheim, the Rams lost to the worst team in the NFC in front 
of the smallest crowd in the NFL this season. John Shaw couldn't have planned 
it any better.

BOSTON COLLEGE DEFLATES KANSAS STATE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: MAY SACKED EIGHT TIMES, 
EAGLE DEFENSE GIVES UP ONLY SEVEN FIRST DOWNS AND MINUS 61 YARDS RUSHING IN 
12-7 VICTORY IN ALOHA BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boston College has made a believer out of Chad May. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas State quarterback, who ended an outstanding college career with 
2,571 yards and 18 touchdowns during the regular season, spent Christmas Day 
running for his life as Boston College shut down the 11th-ranked Wildcats, 
12-7, in the Aloha Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 May completed 13 of 31 passes for 185 yards, with two interceptions. He was 
sacked eight times for 71 yards as Kansas State finished with minus-61 yards on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Big East football," Boston College safety Eric Shorter said. "And Big 
East football is one of the best in the nation. When they came here, they were 
disrespecting us. They were saying we don't play anyone and stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if they're No. 11 in the country, we're No. 10." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College Coach Dan Henning praised his club's "great defensive effort." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think our defensive staff has set stepped foot in the Pacific Ocean 
since they've been here," he said. "They've been too busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made up a fine game plan, but more importantly, it was executed by a 
bunch of guys who really wanted to win." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an afternoon of frustration for May. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is that their defensive line did a great job and played better 
than our offense," he said. "We couldn't get anything going. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have play-action in our offense, but we didn't have a running game so 
play-action didn't work that much. So they just came after me and whatever they 
did, it worked. I had nowhere to go. I just didn't have enough time to even 
look up to another guy and that hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder placed part of the blame on the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't function well in any particular capacity," he said. "Chad didn't 
throw the ball well and we certainly didn't have them well-enough prepared, and 
that's a coaching thing." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Eagle defense, "I think their front four people are rather 
relentless and they are tough athletes," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for one long Boston College touchdown drive, keyed by David Green's 
51-yard run, the game belonged to the defensive units. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Smith scored Boston College's only touchdown in the first quarter and 
David Gordon added a 35-yard field goal in the fourth quarter for the only 
points scored on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (7-4-1) sacked May for a safety and Kansas State (9-3) got its only 
touchdown when Chris Sublette recovered a blocked punt in the Boston College 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams struggled in a game that featured a record 19 punts. The Eagles got 
only 13 first downs and Kansas State seven, the first coming with only 1:27 
left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College scored on its first possession, Smith going the last two yards 
four plays after Green's 51-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Green finished with 121 yards on 28 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kansas State tied it, Mike Mamula tackled May in the end zone for a 
safety that made it 9-7 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon's field goal came with 1:23 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas State's Eric Hardy averaged 46 yards for his 11 punts, seven of which 
came on the Wildcats' first eight possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous Aloha Bowl record was nine by Penn State in 1983.

A COLORFUL ENDING TO BLUE-GRAY; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TWENTY-EIGHT POINTS SCORED IN 
FINAL QUARTER OF BLUE'S 38-27 WIN. JOE ASKA, BLIND IN ONE EYE, IS NAMED MVP. 
</P>

<P>
 Quarterbacks were catching touchdown passes and points were racked up at a 
record pace. And when it was over, a running back born in the Virgin Islands, 
blind in one eye, walked away with the MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue-Gray game, often a dreary affair dominated by defense, turned into a 
celebration of offense on Christmas Day. The teams combined for 738 yards and 
set a record for total points in the Blue's 38-27 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't expected to do so much, but I'm happy I did," said Joe Aska, a 
small-college star at Central Oklahoma who began the game sulking on the bench 
but wound up as the Blue's top player. "I'm not used to sitting on the sideline 
and I was getting mad when I didn't start. But I told myself, 'Settle down, 
everybody is going to play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He wound up rushing for a game-high 69 yards, including two touchdowns, and 
set up the winning score with a 35-yard run -- not to mention an 18-yard pass 
reception and a 46-yard kickoff return, both key plays in a fourth quarter in 
which 28 points were scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue took the opening kickoff and went 70 yards for a touchdown -- a 
precursor of things to come. The Gray dipped into its bag of tricks for a 
10-yard touchdown pass in which Eastern Kentucky quarterback John Sacca pitched 
the ball on an apparent sweep to Georgia running back Terrell Davis, who 
stopped suddenly and passed it to Sacca. 
</P>
<P>
 Aska, one of the top players in NCAA Division II, came to Montgomery with 
lingering doubts about his ability because he is blind in his right eye -- the 
result of a childhood shooting accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Aska caught two passes, including a difficult, twisting 18-yard grab that set 
up his own one-yard touchdown run to put the Blue ahead, 24-20, with 12:12 
remaining in what turned out to be a wild fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gray, which piled up 399 yards of offense, marched right back down the 
field for a one-yard touchdown by Auburn's Joe Frazier just 1:39 later to 
regain the lead, 27-24. The Blue responded, needing only 1:54 to go back the 
other way. Aska returned the kickoff 46 yards to midfield -- he had 86 yards on 
three returns -- then nearly took it the rest of the way with his 35-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Wayne Cook completed a five-yard touchdown pass to Stanford's Tony 
Cline, putting the Blue ahead to stay, 31-27.

 Only three of the 112 Penn State players are from west of the Mississippi and 
none are from California. The three are fullback Brian Tupa of Rolla, N.D., 
cornerback Shino Prater of Arlington, Tex., and punter Scott Stephens of North 
Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 But that could change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe playing in Pasadena will catch the eye of some young men from 
California," Coach Joe Paterno said. "We know there are lot of good ones and 
they'd be welcome at Penn State." 
</P>

<P>
 With most of their heavy work behind them, Paterno and the Penn State football 
team will become sightseers much of this week.

 On Tuesday they will visit Disneyland along with members of the Oregon team. 
On Wednesday the Big Ten champions will be at Universal Studios.

 Some Penn State football alumni living in Southern California, including the 
Rams' Shane Conlan, Rosey Grier and Heisman Trophy winner John Cappelletti, 
have visited the Nittany Lions at practice.

 "We could put together a pretty good alumni team, although I don't know if 
Rosey Grier could get down in a three-point stance anymore," said Paterno, who 
coached them all. SHAV GLICK

BUILDING FROM SCRATCH; UTAH COACH RON MCBRIDE HAS TURNED ONCE-WOEFUL UTES INTO 
AN EMERGING POWER IN THE WESTERN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron McBride made the rounds at a recent Utah football practice, hugging 
players, shaking hands with bystanders and smiling when an off-tackle play went 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
 Why worry? 
</P>
<P>
 There are too many good things happening for McBride to rage over anything as 
trivial as one moment of failure in a scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah has won nine games, tying a school record, is ranked in the top 25 for 
the first time since 1947 and can wrap up its most successful season with a 
victory over Arizona in the Freedom Bowl on Tuesday at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy for McBride to smile. 
</P>
<P>
 He has built this emerging power from scratch, clearing a niche in a state 
once dominated by Brigham Young Coach Lavell Edwards and his string of 
strong-armed quarterbacks. McBride has even managed to make Utah's basketball 
team and rotund quipster, Coach Rick Majerus, secondary news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wins and losses establish your identity," McBride said. "(Winning) is what 
earns you respect." 
</P>
<P>
 To make that happen, McBride, 55, called on 25 years of experience as an 
assistant coach and what he learned growing up in South Gate, where he had to 
work for everything he got. 
</P>
<P>
 When McBride was hired by Utah in 1990, it was his first head coaching job. He 
had been an assistant at San Jose State, Piedmont Hills High in San Jose, 
Gavilan Community College in Gilroy, Calif., UC Riverside, Long Beach State, 
Wisconsin, Utah and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 He went right to work, turning the Utah football program into something he 
would be proud of, something worthy of a working-class man from South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting good players, teaching them well and pushing them hard were 
McBride's top priorities. It was the only way he knew how to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he'd do a good job there," said Arizona Coach Dick Tomey, who hired 
McBride to be his offensive line coach in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, McBride has been able to lure quality players. He has often been 
mentioned as the main attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons I picked Utah was Coach Mac," said senior Luther Elliss, 
the Utes' All-American defensive lineman. "He knows about you, about your 
family. It's not like you're a piece of meat to be used, then discarded after 
your playing days are over." 
</P>
<P>
 Mediocrity had been part of the equation for so long at Utah, nobody figured 
to bat an eye if the new coach showed he was a swell guy but couldn't win a 
lick. 
</P>
<P>
 McBride was determined to be a caring fellow, but also wanted the Utes to be 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year, he's slowly increased the standards," said senior quarterback Mike 
McCoy, who started his career under the late George Allen at Long Beach State. 
"It had to be realistic. This year, our goal was to win the conference. We 
should have won it. The next thing the program is going to have to learn is how 
to find ways to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The slow climb to a 9-2 record, a No. 14 ranking, a tie for second place in 
the Western Athletic Conference and a third consecutive bowl appearance, began 
with a 4-7 season in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Utes were 7-5 in 1991, 6-6 in '92 and 7-6 last season. This season, they 
were two games away from an undefeated regular season and their first 
conference title since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, McBride hammered away at the Utes' attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who had something to do with the program -- from the players and 
coaches to the guy who opens the weight room -- had to be on the same page," 
McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Utes and their fans had to be content with such mixed results 
as Scott Mitchell's 631-yard passing performance against Air Force in 1988 -- a 
game Utah lost, 56-49. 
</P>
<P>
 McBride made it clear that would no longer be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the season, he might have raised expectations too far. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Utes were 8-0, with victories over eventual conference champions 
Colorado State and Oregon, interest and expectation were at all-time highs.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were 8-0 and got to the point where it was all new to us," McBride said. 
"It was another learning experience. You get too many people telling you how 
good you are and you forget you have to get it done on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, Utah then lost consecutive games to New Mexico and Air Force -- 
games the Utes say they should have won. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah rallied to defeat BYU, 34-31, for the second season in a row and landed 
in the Freedom Bowl again. The Utes lost to USC, 28-21, in last year's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Utah would rather be playing Michigan in the Holiday Bowl, but 
McBride believes there is still time, and room, for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 At season's end, McBride will update the list of mistakes and failures he 
keeps in his office. He believes the key isn't dwelling on problems but in 
creating ways to solve them. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the season's over I'll go back through the whole thing and look 
for ways to get better," he said. "I'll try to turn the negatives into 
positives. If a kid isn't a good reader, you work with him and help him become 
a good reader." 
</P>
<P>
 McBride's not through molding, pushing, prodding and creating. When at last 
he's done, when it's a given that Utah is a top-25 team, he'll stand back and 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? He's been doing that all along.

THE BOWLS / DAILY REPORT; SUGAR; CHOICE SEEMS OBVIOUS FOR FLORIDA STATE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Florida and Florida State are still trying to figure out what happened on Nov. 
26, when each team played both brilliantly and horribly. So it makes sense that 
both teams are trying to outthink the other for the Sugar Bowl rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can bet your life they're going to have adjustments that we haven't 
seen," Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden told the Orlando Sentinel. "Until you 
find out what they're doing, it could give you some problems. We have to 
prepare for both of our formations and go out and see how to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The two formations the Seminoles use are the I, which they used to gain only 
123 first-half yards against the Gators, and the shotgun, which they used to 
gain 298 yards and score four touchdowns in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Which do you think they will try? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Reaves, who coaches the offensive backfield for Florida, has an offer to 
be the quarterback coach at South Carolina for Coach Brad Scott. He says he'll 
decide where to work after Vanderbilt decides on a coach. Reaves interviewed 
last week for the head coaching job at the traditional Southeastern Conference 
doormat. . . . Dean Golden, an offensive guard for the Gators, seemingly 
following a personal tradition, will sit out this year's Sugar Bowl because he 
is academically ineligible. Golden sat out last season's Sugar Bowl for the 
same reason. ORANGE

 Fishing for Good Time in South Florida 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The precursor to the national-championship matchup of Nebraska and Miami will 
take place on Thursday when a four-hour fishing challenge will be held between 
representatives of the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the possible entrants is Nebraska Gov. Ben Nelson and Sen. Bob Kerrey. 
The boats will have to release all billfish but can keep "fun fish" (dolphin, 
wahoo, tuna, kingfish, cobia, amberjack, snapper, grouper, mackerel and 
bonito). One hundred points are awarded for every billfish and one point per 
pound for the other fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition won't be pronounced, but there will be a friendly challenge," 
Orange Bowl spokesman Mark Miller told the Miami Herald. "Our main goal is for 
the participants to have fun." JOHN CHERWA

THE BOWLS / DAILY REPORT; HOLIDAY; GAME CAME NATURALLY TO BIAKABATUKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His name is Tshimanga Biakabatuka, but his North American friends call him 
Tim. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan's sophomore running back, who plays behind Tyrone Wheatley, has taken 
an unusual route to major college football.Biakabatuka was born in Zaire and as 
a child moved with his family to Montreal. He should have played soccer. Or ice 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never chose football," Biakabatuka said as Michigan prepared for its game 
Friday against Colorado State at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. "Football came 
to me and I fell in love with it." 
</P>
<P>
 That was six years ago during a physical education class in high school. A 
coach, looking for an extra body for his team, called upon the African 
immigrant. It did not take Biakabatuka long to excel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is a sport easy to learn," he said. "After three years I was pretty 
comfortable with the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Biakabatuka is one of three finalists for Quebec's 1994 athlete of the 
year after a strong season filling in for the oft-injured Wheatley. ELLIOTT

 Utah quarterback Mike McCoy remembers vividly how the Utes fell behind by 
halftime, 28-0, and lost in last year's Freedom Bowl to USC, 28-21. He's 
determined to keep the Utes closer early in the game Tuesday against Arizona 
while preventing the Utes from losing in their third consecutive bowl 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first bowl game, everybody was so excited," McCoy said of a 31-28 loss 
to Washington State in the 1992 Copper Bowl, Utah's first bowl appearance since 
1964. "We really got caught up in all that excitement. Then last year, once we 
got started playing (in the second half), we just ran out of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it's time to win one of these things." 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy, who completed 23 of 40 passes for 286 yards and one touchdown in last 
year's Freedom Bowl, began his career at Long Beach State but transferred when 
the 49ers dropped the program after the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy, a senior, passed for at least 210 yards in all but one of Utah's 11 
games this season. His season low of 150 yards, with two touchdowns, came in a 
66-0 rout of Division I-AA Idaho State. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished the regular season by completing 64.8% of his passes for 3,035 
yards and 28 touchdowns, with 11 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Utah Coach Ron McBride had this to say about last year's experience playing 
against USC: 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing we learned was that we were good enough to play with those 
guys. If we just hadn't been in awe of those guys we might have won." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Utes have more confidence this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arizona is a really good football team, much better than USC was a year ago," 
McBride said. "(But) we know we're better than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pity Utah defensive back Jeff Kirkman. The Utes are playing in their third 
consecutive bowl game and for the third year in a row the junior will be 
sidelined because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he suffered a knee injury against BYU in the regular-season finale 
and sat out the Copper Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, shoulder surgery sidelined him for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 He will sit out Tuesday's game because of a broken ankle, suffered in the 
Utes' final practice in Salt Lake City last Saturday. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; WILLIAMS WON'T RECALL BIG NUMBERS

<P>
 Tailback Harvey Williams rushed for 983 yards this season despite not being 
named the starting tailback until the Raiders' seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he been able to gain 17 more yards Saturday against the Kansas City 
Chiefs, he would have been the first Raider to gain 1,000 since Marcus Allen 
carried for 1,759 yards in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also scored seven touchdowns, nearly double his previous total of 
four, gained in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked what he would remember most about the season, Williams said, 
"The mistakes."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver Tim Brown was coming off a career season for the Raiders in 1993 with 
80 catches for 1,180 yards. He surpassed those totals this season with 89 
catches for 1,309 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that all the other wide receivers on the Raiders had a total 
of only 70 catches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler threw for 3,334 yards this season, the 
second-highest in club history, behind only the 3,615 yards amassed by Ken 
Stabler in 1979. Hostetler threw for 3,242 yards last season, his first with 
the Raiders. The highest total by Daryle Lamonica, the Raiders' so-called Mad 
Bomber of the Oakland days, was 3,302 yards in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders set a league record with 156 penalties, breaking the mark of 149 
set by the Houston Oilers in 1989, but they fell short of the record for 
penalty yardage. The Raiders were penalized 1,186 yards this season. The record 
is 1,274, set by the Oakland Raiders in 1969. STEVE SPRINGER

HE'S IN RIGHT PLACE AT RIGHT TIME; BASKETBALL: SALAHUDDIN MAKING MOST OF CHANCE 
AT LONG BEACH STATE AFTER TWO GUNSHOT INCIDENTS SCARED AWAY MANY RECRUITERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rasul Salahuddin lay in the street with a hole in his right knee, bullets 
flying above him and screams ringing in his ears, so it seemed like a good time 
for some serious self-evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin had been shot for the second time in three weeks during the summer 
of 1993 near his home in Mount Vernon, N.Y. A talented basketball player, 
Salahuddin made an important decision as he watched his blood spread across the 
ground: time to start making better choices. 
</P>
<P>
 He is, and Long Beach State benefits from his maturity. Salahuddin starts at 
point guard for the 49ers, who play in Michigan State's Spartan Classic on 
Thursday and Friday at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned you just have to watch where you go and the people you're 
around," Salahuddin said. "You don't know what's going to happen anywhere you 
go, but you have to try to be aware of everything that's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, this is a major outlook adjustment by Salahuddin (pronounced 
saul-uh-HOO-den). But if gunshot wounds won't inspire behavior modification, 
what will? 
</P>
<P>
 The first time was in July at a nightclub in New Rochelle, N.Y. A fight 
erupted and shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin, who was not involved in the altercation, was grazed on his right 
hip by a bullet. He was one of nine people shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in August, Salahuddin took a bullet in his right knee while attending a 
block party in Mount Vernon. Again, a fight started and he was not the intended 
target. 
</P>
<P>
 In both shootings, he said he didn't see who fired the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin and those who know him maintain his involvement was simply a case 
of timing -- all bad. They're also in agreement, though, that Salahuddin's 
judgment was less-than sound when selecting friends and putting himself in 
clearly risky situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks bad being that I had gotten shot two times within three weeks," 
Salahuddin said. "A lot of people were like, 'What's wrong with this kid?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, but unfortunately it had to 
happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the first incident, the second was extremely serious. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet created a hole the size of a quarter as it exited his knee. Friends 
drove him to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking, 'Damn, what's going on?' " he said. "Why me? Why did I have 
to get shot in the knee of all places?" 
</P>
<P>
 Al-farid Salahuddin was even more scared than his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "My cousin called me at work and said, 'You better get to the hospital, your 
son has been shot,' " said Al-farid, a firefighter in Mount Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't believe it happened again. Then I saw his knee." 
</P>
<P>
 Rasul underwent surgery to remove scar tissue. No ligaments were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet missed his kneecap by about a quarter-inch, by far the best news 
for the Salahuddin family. Salahuddin remained in the hospital for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have been it for basketball if it hit my kneecap," he said. "My 
knee would have had to (have) been totally reconstructed." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Al-farid wondered if his son would ever play again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt bad for Rasul because he'd worked so hard and he had so much 
potential," he said. "To have it go so quickly by some nonsense by someone 
acting stupid. . . . It was numbing." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he also was upset Rasul put himself in a dangerous environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is," Al-farid said, "he shouldn't have even been there." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Rose also was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin played for Rose at Dixie College in St. George, Utah, as a freshman 
the previous season. Rose didn't know what to make of the news he heard from 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "My question was, 'How is this happening?' " Rose said. "That's some pretty 
bad luck for a kid to get shot twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to his dad and he told me Rasul was hanging out with some of his 
high school buddies in some pretty bad parts of town. My biggest concern the 
second time he got shot was to get him out of New York and get him here." 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin arrived in Utah about two weeks after leaving the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he showed me his knee," Rose said, "I thought he would never play 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 An optimist's optimist, Salahuddin never doubted his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never think the worst things are going to happen," he said. "Even when I 
was laying there in that hospital, I knew I was going to play again." 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin dedicated himself to an intense rehabilitation program and had an 
excellent sophomore season. He averaged 11.2 points, 6.6 rebounds and four 
assists as Dixie won its conference title. He was selected first-team 
all-conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiters from four-year schools, however, weren't hounding Salahuddin 
anymore. And he knew why. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of schools backed off of me because of the fact I had gotten shot 
twice," Salahuddin said, "and they thought I was a bad person." 
</P>
<P>
 Al-farid heard the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "One recruiter I know personally, a coach at a big-time school, was telling 
people that Rasul was involved with drugs, that (the shootings) had to be drug 
things," he said. "This was a guy who's known Rasul since he was a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once that reputation got out there, Rasul was done." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach wasn't scared away. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coach Clyde Vaughan grew up in New York and knew the Salahuddin 
family. He vouched for Rasul, encouraging 49er Coach Seth Greenberg to offer 
him a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was doing some things he shouldn't have done, and that caused people to 
talk bad about Rasul," Vaughan said. "But he's the nicest person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that and I told coach that, so it was no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin's play hasn't been a problem either. 
</P>
<P>
 Because senior point guard Tye Mays, an occasional starter last season, was 
ineligible during the fall semester, the starting position was open. Salahuddin 
won the job going away. He averages eight points and six assists for the 49ers, 
who are 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose converted Salahuddin from shooting guard to the point at Dixie. 
Salahuddin, 21, works on his dribbling in one-on-one morning sessions with 
assistant coach John Welch, and Salahuddin credits him for his continued 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin is at his best when opponents have the ball. His defensive 
quickness, strength and long arms cause problems for ballhandlers. He already 
has 18 steals, a remarkable number after only four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a prediction a long time ago," Vaughan said, "that Rasul would lead 
the nation in steals if he plays 28 minutes per game." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaping is about the only part of his game not back to pre-shooting form. 
While he was at Mount Vernon High, Salahuddin was known around New York 
playgrounds and gymnasiums for his leaping ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not fully recovered because when Rasul's recovered, all those fast 
breaks that he's laying in will be two-handed dunks," Greenberg said. "He 
literally lost six inches of explosiveness off his vertical leap." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he's one of the 49ers' best leapers. In Long Beach's 71-64 
season-opening victory over Detroit Mercy, Salahuddin left his teammates in awe 
by driving along the baseline and throwing down a fierce dunk late in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd kill for half of his hops," senior forward Mike Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin is dedicated to repaying the 49er coaching staff for its belief in 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the phone stopped ringing, (Long Beach) was the only school that stuck 
by me," Salahuddin said. "No matter what happens, I know they'll be there."

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; LURIE, VERMEIL TALK ABOUT EAGLE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philadelphia Eagle owner Jeffrey Lurie has talked to former Coach Dick Vermeil 
about returning to the team, and Vermeil says he's interested, the Philadelphia 
Inquirer reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vermeil, 58, the only coach to take the Eagles to the Super Bowl, had kept 
quiet about his intentions but said he became interested during a three-hour 
meeting with Lurie on Friday, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into the meeting without an interest, and I came out of the meeting 
with an interest," said Vermeil, Eagle coach from 1976-1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "We discussed the possibilities of general manager or general manager and 
coach," Vermeil said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he and Lurie agreed to think it over for a week or two before making a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie refused to comment on "our coaching situation" after the Eagles' 33-30 
loss to Cincinnati on Saturday. But he did say he had spoken with Vermeil, a 
college football analyst for ABC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's acting in an advisory capacity," Lurie said. "That doesn't mean after an 
advisory capacity . . . nothing is precluded. I think Dick Vermeil is such a 
valuable asset to the NFL that certainly anyone would have to consider such a 
person with that insight." 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie said he had not offered a job to Vermeil but had talked to him about the 
"Eagles' future." 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie's advisers have told him not to make an offer to Vermeil until they're 
sure he would accept. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lurie and Eagle Coach Rich Kotite are scheduled to meet today, two 
days after the Eagles blew a 17-point lead to lose to the Bengals in the last 
game of what had started as a promising season. It was probably Kotite's last 
game as Eagle coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotite had hoped to preserve his record of no losing seasons with 
Philadelphia. Instead, the Eagles wound up 7-9 after the wacky ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was very important," Kotite told the Associated Press. "If we 
could have gotten to 8-8, I think it meant an awful lot. But it didn't and it's 
unbelievable the way it didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie acknowledged the meeting with Kotite. "We're going to sit down and talk 
it out," the owner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vermeil left coaching in 1982, two years after leading the Eagles to a 12-4 
season and a trip to the Super Bowl, where they lost to the Oakland Raiders, 
27-10.

ROAD TO ENGLAND IS FULL OF SURPRISES; SOCCER: EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP QUALIFYING 
PHASE NOT GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN AS SOME TOP TEAMS FACE STIFF COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The European Championship -- international soccer's second-largest event after 
the World Cup -- still is 18 months away, but if the qualifying phase is 
anything to go by, there will be surprises aplenty in England in June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the qualifying tournament has produced a series of strange results. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 18 was a prime example. 
</P>
<P>
 How else to explain Scotland's 1-0 loss to Greece in Athens, a result that put 
a sizable dent in the Scots' hopes of reaching the finals? 
</P>
<P>
 And what about Germany's feeble performance during a 2-1 victory over Albania 
in Kaiserslautern? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's like a defeat for us Germans," midfielder Matthias Sammer said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammer's comments were mild compared to the extraordinarily insensitive 
remarks made by Germany's former World Cup-winning captain and coach, Franz 
Beckenbauer, a few days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of international matches, I imagine clashes with the great 
nations -- Italy, England, the Netherlands," Beckenbauer wrote in a commentary 
published in the Bild newspaper. "But at the moment we have to wait two years 
before we meet these soccer greats. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why games against countries like Moldova are a slight to the German 
national squad. They're just stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moldova, Albania, or whatever all these countries are called, should first 
play qualifiers, and only later face the soccer greats." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that Germany has managed only 1-0 and 2-1 victories over Albania 
during the current qualifying campaign, Beckenbauer's view seems well off 
target. It could also provide an added incentive for Moldova, which lost, 3-0, 
to the Germans in Chisiniau but has to play them a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third match Dec. 18, records fell in Lisbon, where Portugal scored its 
most lopsided international victory by trouncing Lichtenstein, 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Portuguese scored four goals in six minutes during one second-half spell. 
Their previous record victory was a 6-0 defeat of Luxembourg in 1961 during 
qualifying for the 1962 World Cup in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in that game, Portugal's captain, Joao Pinto, become his country's 
most-capped player by appearing in his 67th international game. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal's neighbor, Spain, also is fast moving toward a place in the final 
16. The Spaniards scored a convincing 4-1 victory over Belgium in Brussels, a 
result that convinced Belgian captain Franky Van der Elst to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had already announced that I would quit if things went wrong against 
Macedonia and Spain," said Van der Elst, 33, who played 69 games for Belgium 
over the past decade but was jeered by the Belgian fans throughout the Dec. 17 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's now virtually impossible for us to qualify, so I think it's time to give 
other players a chance. I've had many good moments . . . one lousy game will 
not overshadow my international career." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish, meanwhile, probably will reach the finals, having won all four of 
their games to date, as have the Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian Coach Paul Van Himst, whose team had been tied, 1-1, by Macedonia in 
its previous match, acknowledged the situation looks bleak for the Red Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theoretically, we still have a chance to qualify," he said, "but it's a very 
slim one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spain deserved to win. They have more talent than us. We lack the power and 
speed to match teams like Spain, Italy or Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 Macedonia, which defeated Cyprus, 3-0, in Saturday's other match, is second 
behind Spain in the qualifying group, but is likely to be overtaken before long 
by Denmark, the reigning European champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine qualifying matches played two weeks ago improved the prospects for 
the Netherlands, European champion in 1988, France and Bulgaria, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 France, which will stage the next World Cup in 1998, ended a string of three 
0-0 ties by beating Azerbaijan, 2-0, in Trabzon, Turkey, on goals by 
Jean-Pierre Papin and Patrice Loko. 
</P>
<P>
 The French desperately needed the victory to stay in touch with the group 
leaders, Romania and Israel, and, as Papin said beforehand: "If we can't beat 
Azerbaijan, we'd better give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Papin plays for Bayern Munich in Germany, where he evidently has been taking 
lessons in diplomacy from Beckenbauer, the club's president. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch, meanwhile, gave departing Coach Dick Advocaat a rousing send-off by 
defeating Luxembourg, 5-0, in Rotterdam. Advocaat, who led Holland's '94 World 
Cup team, surprisingly decided to step down and accept the head coaching 
position at PSV Eindhoven. 
</P>
<P>
 He leaves with a record of 15 victories and six ties in 26 matches and with 
the confidence of knowing he can reclaim the national team job in the future if 
he wants it. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the national team, you play only eight times a year," Advocaat said. 
"With a league club, you play every week, and that is a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Gus Hiddink will take over as the Netherlands' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten Bulgaria scored a 3-0 victory over Wales in Cardiff, keeping it level 
with Germany in their group and all but mathematically ending Welsh hopes of 
reaching the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 In other matches, Norway edged Malta, 1-0; Switzerland scored its first 
victory over Turkey in a quarter-century, winning, 2-1, in Istanbul; Israel and 
Romania tied, 1-1, in Tel Aviv; Finland overwhelmed San Marino, 4-1, with 
striker Mika-Matti Paatelainen scoring all four goals in Helsinki; and Albania 
lost to the Republic of Georgia, 1-0, in Tirana. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest series of qualifying games is the last for this year. The 47 
nations seeking a place in the final 16 resume play in February. 
</P>
<P>
 England, as host, is the only country guaranteed a place in the finals and 
preparations there are well under way. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one million tickets (priced from $24.50 to $213) went on sale on 
Oct. 27, and soccer officials are confident the 1996 finals will be the 
country's most significant sports event in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be the biggest party in sporting and cultural terms since 
England hosted the World Cup 28 years ago," said tournament director Glen 
Kirton. "We are determined to make it a success." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 40% of the seats have been reserved for overseas fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadiums selected to stage the three-week, 31-match tournament are Wembley in 
London, where the opening game and the final will be played; Elland Road in 
Leeds; Old Trafford in Manchester; Hillsborough in Sheffield; Villa Park in 
Birmingham; St. James' Park in Newcastle; Anfield in Liverpool, and the City 
Ground in Nottingham. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for the event, England will stage a four-nation mini-tournament 
next June, using several of the European Championship stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to England, the tournament will include world champion Brazil, 
Sweden, which finished third in World Cup '94, and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 June 3: England-Japan and Brazil-Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 June 5: Japan-Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 June 6: England-Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 June 8: England-Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 June 9: Sweden-Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 June 11: Third-place game and final.

ANALYSIS; NHL PLAYERS LOSE SIGHT OF REASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What began as a struggle over economics has become an emotional battle by Bob 
Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a rallying point is fine, especially when so many of the issues are 
difficult to grasp. But in igniting players' passion, Goodenow is giving short 
shrift to reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow has inspired a fight over an issue few players understand: the NHL's 
proposed payroll tax. It is the one issue on which the union refuses to budge. 
The one issue keeping NHL rinks dark, yet it is the last issue that should 
stand in the way of an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 So strong is players' fixation about the evils of even a modest payroll tax, 
they have contorted themselves into pretzels to avoid it. Each time owners have 
mentioned the tax and dared them to offer another way to slow salary growth, 
players have forfeited something significant. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an astonishing series of concessions, beginning with their surrender on 
pay scales for rookies and entry-level players. Those salaries become the basis 
for the paychecks of mid-career and veteran players, so everyone will 
eventually feel the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the longest list of givebacks in sports," a player agent said. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation sent by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman to meet union 
representatives 10 days ago floated the idea of dropping the tax if players 
would relinquish most of their arbitration rights. That created hope for a 
compromise, but it is flickering. 
</P>
<P>
 When lawyers from each side tried to schedule talks today, Goodenow relayed 
word that if the NHL intends to keep the tax or to seek major changes in 
arbitration, he had nothing to talk about. They might not meet Tuesday, either. 
</P>
<P>
 It's absurd. Why not meet to see what can be done? 
</P>
<P>
 Each is waiting for the last instant to make his best offer. At this rate, 
neither will. 
</P>
<P>
 Players have conceded more to avoid the tax than they would have given up had 
they accepted a moderate levy two months ago. Salary arbitration would benefit 
more players in more ways than a payroll tax would hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
 Players claim the tax will be a cap and deter owners from paying high 
salaries. They contend once owners get a tax, the rate would rise with each 
collective bargaining agreement and that owners such as Chicago's Bill Wirtz 
and New Jersey's John McMullen will never exceed the cap. Salaries would 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible to believe those owners -- or any others -- would refuse to 
acquire a top-notch player his club needs because that salary would lift the 
payroll over the limit and trigger a tax assessment. Even NHL owners, though 
sometimes devious and often foolish, know a good player makes the team better, 
and a better team will draw more fans and perhaps play an extra round in the 
playoffs. That could bring in enough revenue to more than recoup the tax 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 A luxury tax is a punitive tax intended to discourage a purchase. An example 
is the luxury tax that was assessed on boats and was later rescinded because it 
hurt that industry so much. Compare that to the 10% levy assessed on cars that 
cost more than $32,000. The amount due is based on the difference between 
$32,000 and the total price, not on the total price. 
</P>
<P>
 If the NHL's payroll tax is levied on the amount spent over a limit, it might 
inhibit spending, but it won't prohibit spending. If you can afford a 
Mercedes-Benz, you can probably afford the tax. If it is assessed on every 
dollar of the payrolls that go over a limit, it would be like paying twice for 
one car and curtail spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is a graduated tax that kicks in at a trigger point -- rather than 
on the entire payroll -- and contains a provision to adjust the rate depending 
on the amount revenues and salaries rise next season. 
</P>
<P>
 If players continue to reject a tax, they'll have to yield on salary 
arbitration and accept 31 as the age for unrestricted free agency instead of 
30. They went on strike in 1992 to get salary arbitration; to give it back 
would be foolish. So would accepting a higher age for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Exceptional players will always be paid high salaries. It's the average, 
mid-career players who need protection. Those are the players the union would 
shortchange if it gives back arbitration rights to avoid a tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman wanted to stop the growth of salaries paid to players in their first 
and second contracts. The union agreed to a rookie cap and to a pay scale and 
two-way contracts for players in their first three seasons, trading controls on 
youngsters' salaries for unrestricted free agency later. It's not a great 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone passes through rookie and entry-level stages, but not everyone is 
still playing at 31 and skilled enough to draw big offers as a free agent. 
Players would be eligible for arbitration before then, but such awards will be 
two-year contracts, not the long, lucrative deals players think free agency 
will spawn. 
</P>
<P>
 If Goodenow decides he'd lose too much respect if he accepted a tax, his only 
alternative is to agree to a demand that clubs have the right to walk away from 
one or two arbitration awards they consider too high for Group 2 (middle-range) 
players. That defeats the purpose of arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has already handed over its wallet. The NHL wants its pocket change 
too. Bettman must modify the tax. Goodenow must put players' long-term 
prospects ahead of the short-term embarrassment of losing face. If there is no 
agreement and no season, the damage will be incalculable.

NBA ROUNDUP; PIPPEN SHOWS KERR IT'S BETTER TO RECEIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Kerr almost gave away the game. Scottie Pippen wouldn't let him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr practically handed a game-tying three-pointer to Hubert Davis with 
four-tenths of a second left in regulation. But Chicago defeated the New York 
Knicks anyway, 107-104, Sunday night in Chicago, as Pippen ended his 36-point 
performance by scoring all seven of the Bulls' overtime points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a clear shot at it and it ended up being one of the all-time bonehead 
plays," Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Chicago ahead, 100-97, New York's Anthony Mason threw a full-court 
inbounds pass right to Kerr. But instead of catching the ball, Kerr batted it 
with both hands like a volleyball, apparently intent on killing the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the ball went to Davis, who made an off-balance 25-foot heave from 
the right wing to tie the score at 100. Kerr, appalled at what he had just 
done, placed both hands on top of his head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, we pulled through in overtime or I'd be buried in the sand right 
now," Kerr said. "I felt horrible. It was embarrassing. Not only does it 
happen, but it happens on national TV, on Christmas night with the whole world 
watching. But we won and I'm off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 He's off the hook and the Knicks are on the skids. Their five-game losing 
streak is their longest since 1990 and the longest in the career of Coach Pat 
Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the teams' first meeting since the Knicks ended the Bulls' run of three 
NBA championships by winning last May's Eastern Conference semifinal series in 
seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen, who'll be forever remembered for refusing to play the final 1.8 
seconds of that series' third game when he wasn't called upon to take the 
Bulls' last shot, refused to leave Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 He played all 53 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get him out," Chicago Coach Phil Jackson said. "I tried to take 
him out a couple of times, asked him if he'd like to come out. He said he was 
fine. He wanted to be out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen, who added a season-high 16 rebounds to his season-high point total, 
made a driving layup with 2:24 to go put Chicago ahead for good, 104-102. He 
added three free throws for the final margin and blocked three-point attempts 
by both Davis and Charles Smith in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my teammates over the last couple of weeks that the Christmas game is 
big, with a lot of hype," said Pippen, whose Bulls have won five consecutive on 
the holiday. "I really wanted to win this." 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Kukoc added 25 points for the Bulls, who have consecutive victories at 
the United Center for the first time after 28 seasons at Chicago Stadium. The 
game drew the biggest crowd in club history, 22,854. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said from the first day that it's going to take time to get comfortable 
here and have some special moments," B.J. Armstrong said. "Tonight was one of 
those moments." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 105, Seattle 96 -- Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf scored 23 points and Rodney 
Rogers added 22 at Denver, as the Nuggets ended the SuperSonics' four-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Detlef Schrempf and Kendall Gill had 21 points each for Seattle. Denver held 
Shawn Kemp to 10 points, his second-lowest output of the year. Kemp was limited 
to 20 minutes because of foul trouble and fouled out with 8:04 left. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first meeting of the teams since last spring, when the Nuggets, 
seeded eighth, eliminated the top-seeded Sonics in the first round of the NBA 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle is winless in 10 games played on Christmas Day. Denver had lost three 
of its last four games.

 Baseball owners lost $105 million during the strike-shortened 1981 season and 
$206 million more in the succeeding four years, according to management 
documents obtained by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the industry lost money from 1975 through 1985, it had operating 
profits from 1986 to 1993, according to the documents. Baseball's overall 
revenues increased from $162.6 million in 1975 to $1.879 billion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents of baseball's finances from 1975 through 1991 were released last 
Thursday by the House Judiciary Committee, which has been examining baseball's 
antitrust exemption. Figures for 1992 were obtained by the AP from management 
sources and 1993 estimates were provided by the owners' Player Relations 
Committee.

<P>
 No estimates for 1994 are available yet. Boxing

<P>
 Saen Sor Ploenchit of Thailand stopped Danny Nunez of the Dominican Republic 
in the 11th round at Bangkok, Thailand and retained his World Boxing Assn. 
flyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez, 25, took terrific punishment in several toe-to-toe encounters during 
the scheduled 12-round fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Ploenchit, 23, pummeled Nunez for almost a minute when he had him trapped 
against the ropes in the eighth round, but the challenger came back in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with strength spent, Nunez did little but stumble about the ring for 
about 45 seconds in the 11th round. He was knocked down and the referee stopped 
the fight as he stood up shakily. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory improved Ploenchit's record to 18-0. Nunez (25-3) was the 
eighth-ranked challenger. Tennis

 Marian Ramon, from Valencia, Spain, negated Kournikova's defensive "moonball" 
style with penetrating topspin groundstrokes and was able to transform a 2-5

KILBARGER DROPS THE JUGGLING ACT; PREPS: AFTER PLAYING BASKETBALL AND SOCCER 
LAST SEASON, THE CANYON SENIOR IS CONCENTRATING ON SOCCER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though they aren't even remotely on the same level, Canyon's Clay Kilbarger 
can relate to Deion Sanders. Both athletes have had a difficult time choosing 
between two sports with overlapping seasons, and both have delayed the decision 
as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders loves baseball and football; Kilbarger can't get enough of basketball 
and soccer -- both winter sports in the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbarger skirted the dilemma his first two years at Canyon, playing soccer as 
a freshman and basketball as a sophomore. But he hit the conflict head on last 
year, playing both sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, Kilbarger fit in soccer and basketball without missing a game in 
either sport. But his schedule was hectic to say the least and it often 
bordered on the absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 He had soccer practice from 2:30 to 5 each afternoon, and basketball practice 
from six to nine. And from 5 to 6? 
</P>
<P>
 "I had that little one-hour gap for food and homework," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, game days went surprisingly smooth. The soccer and 
basketball teams had the same traveling schedule, so Kilbarger would start at 
halfback for the soccer team in the afternoon and point guard for the 
basketball team at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of fun last year, especially on game days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there was that occasion when the soccer team was playing in Orange 
County and the basketball team was playing a tournament in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to hop on a flight to San Francisco right after the soccer game," 
Kilbarger said. "But I made the basketball game that night." 
</P>
<P>
 This year -- without basketball -- Kilbarger's life is simpler and slower, but 
it is far from boring. The choice that Kilbarger had dreaded to make was 
actually made for him this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 As he had since his junior year, Kilbarger continued receiving letters from 
UCLA about soccer. The soccer letters also began coming from UC Irvine, Oregon 
State and Nevada Las Vegas. And the basketball letters? 
</P>
<P>
 "I never got any," Kilbarger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbarger also started realizing that his 5-foot-9, 145-pound frame wasn't 
helping him on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "My size just wasn't going to get me very far in basketball," he said. "In 
soccer, size doesn't mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbarger also figured it might be nice to chew and digest his food this 
winter, and maybe spend more time with his textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali Khosroshahian, Kilbarger's soccer coach last season, said he thinks 
Kilbarger chose the right sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he sticks with soccer, he can play at the Division I level in college," he 
said. "If he'd have played strictly soccer, he'd be a much better player than 
he is now." 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbarger understands what Khosroshahian is saying all too well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost a lot of skill playing basketball," said Kilbarger, who was the soccer 
team's most valuable player as a freshman. "My touches and my mental mistakes 
are there now. If I mess up, I'll say, 'Gosh, if I would have stuck with it, I 
wouldn't be making this seem so hard now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Kilbarger has managed to score four goals and dish out four assists for 
Canyon (3-3-3). 
</P>
<P>
 "The physical part isn't so tough," he said. "It's reading the game and 
situations that's the hard part." 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbarger got his leg in shape this fall by doing the kicking for Canyon's 
football team. Though he had always run cross-country in the fall -- he was the 
varsity's MVP three years in a row -- Kilbarger made a smooth transition to 
football. He kicked nine field goals, including a 46-yarder, and was selected 
first-team All-Century League and his team's rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 After the season, Kilbarger received a couple letters from college football 
programs. But he said football is not in his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like football, really," said Kilbarger, who also high jumped 6-5 as a 
sophomore. "Standing on the sidelines was boring. Waiting for your turn is 
tough. I like to be involved in the action." 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of those rare kids," said Khosroshahian, now an assistant at Cal 
State Los Angeles. "The kid's full of talent. For him, it's just a matter of 
focusing on one sport."
