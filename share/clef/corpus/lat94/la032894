GEORGE RAMOS: A DEATH FELT NORTH OF THE BORDER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Among Southern California's 3.8 million residents of Mexican descent, the 
assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio could not have hit harder than when 
Leticia Quezada heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada, the Los Angeles school board president who was born in Mexico, 
thought it was a cruel joke when her husband told her. She is among local 
leaders who have sought stronger ties between Mexican Americans and the next 
Mexican president and wanted to cultivate the 44-year-old Colosio, who was the 
candidate of Mexico's ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 When she realized the terrible news was true, Quezada, 38, now a naturalized 
U.S. citizen, was in a deep state of frustration. She couldn't work up 
enthusiasm for a teachers meeting the morning after Colosio died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so overwhelmed by it," she said. "I'm paralyzed. I'm depressed. It hits 
really close to home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's murder is the last thing Mexico needs right now, given the Zapatista 
uprising in Chiapas and the clamor for political reform. The assassination is a 
another signal that Mexico faces a very uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 In the minds of many Mexicans, there are powerful parallels between Colosio 
and the two slain Kennedy brothers, John and Robert. Colosio's murder will have 
as great an impact on Mexican history as the slayings of President Kennedy and 
his brother, the U.S. senator from New York, had on American history. 
</P>
<P>
 There's been no event like it in modern Mexican history. 
</P>
<P>
 The same Kennedyesque questions come to mind once again: Did the gunman in 
Tijuana act alone? Was there a conspiracy to kill Colosio? 
</P>
<P>
 The chaotic scenes from Tijuana of Colosio's supporters and aides grappling 
with the suspected assassin reminded me of 1968 when Sirhan Sirhan was wrestled 
to the ground after mortally wounding Robert Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, I was in The Times' newsroom working on a column about the 
closing of Los Angeles' oldest bookstore, the 105-year-old Fowler Brothers, 
when the first news bulletin came in. I knew instantly I'd be writing about 
something different. 
</P>
<P>
 The angry reaction over Colosio's death among local Chicanos and Mexicanos, 
which even extended to how L.A. broadcasters butchered the pronunciation of 
Colosio's name, is easy to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Mexicans, Colosio was one of the people. He wasn't a man of privilege 
as are many who run the PRI, as the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is 
called. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a norteno, a northerner, from the town of Magdalena de Kino, just 50 
miles south of the Arizona border. He came from poor ranching origins where 
family values stress self-reliance. Many of Mexican descent who have come to 
the U.S. can relate to Colosio's modest background. 
</P>
<P>
 They understand the hard work that is required to get an education. He 
couldn't afford much and had to fight for scholarships to attend college. 
Although he ultimately earned a doctorate, he retained an affection for the 
average man and woman. 
</P>
<P>
 He, in turn, became so popular that Quezada didn't have the heart to call her 
mother in Mexico to talk about the slaying -- it would have been too painful 
for the older woman to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 In his campaign, Colosio sought to transfer that personal popularity into 
votes for the PRI, the dominant but often corrupt political machine that has 
governed Mexico since its beginnings in 1929. The average Mexicans who grew 
tired of PRI's rule -- and yet have come to accept its rule and feared 
instability after the Indian uprising in Chiapas -- were heartened to know that 
Colosio would offer hope as Mexico's new chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 His death is especially disheartening for L.A.'s Chicano political 
Establishment because it sought to strengthen its ties with Mexico's top 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio, perhaps more than any other politician in modern Mexico, sought to 
understand the Mexican American experience in the United States. He had studied 
at the University of Pennsylvania and saw firsthand how many of his compatriots 
live in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Chicano activists and business leaders in Los Angeles say that they had 
met as many as five times in recent months with Colosio. They found him to be a 
man interested in their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were blunt in wanting a more serious and substantive relationship with the 
Mexican government," says Boyle Heights activist Juan Jose Gutierrez. "We were 
frank with him . . . and he listened." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The news of Colosio's death hit particularly hard in Los Angeles because, 
ironically, some Chicanos last week were awaiting word of yet another meeting 
with Colosio. It was proposed that they get together with the candidate during 
a campaign stop in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead came word that he was shot and killed there.

 How are Southern California residents affected by the Northridge earthquake 
faring in the wake of the 5.3 aftershock that struck March 20? Here are some 
impressions from people responsible for restoring services .  
</P>
<P>
 FRANCIS MILLER 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Gas Co., senior appliance representative, San Fernando 
Valley 
</P>
<P>
 I have people stopping me on the streets and in restaurants -- I do mainly 
restaurant repair -- and comment how great the service was, how quick our 
response time was. Some of the apartment dwellers who moved out of apartments 
that were damaged were just scared to go back, even though they were 
green-tagged. I encountered a lot of people moving into apartments deserted by 
previous tenants. Or ones that have moved into other ones thinking they were in 
better shape than the ones left behind. Well, some of it, I think, is a bit 
silly. They might not be any better off than where they were. In fact, a lot of 
people are ignoring the small earthquakes. They figure it's not building to 
another big one, it's just a roll-out from the last one. One thing that will 
always stay in my memory was doing a deli in Sepulveda. I got them back on 
within about three days. The owner of the restaurant told all the regular 
customers about it. I happened to go in there about a week later and got a 
standing ovation from the clientele. It was a real nice feeling. MARK SMITH 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The real challenge was trying to accommodate all the people that moved right 
after the quake. To get their service moved from one location to another. My 
impression of how things are right now is that people are still definitely 
jittery and displaced. A lot of people are moving away from the Valley to 
Thousand Oaks, Agoura and Westlake. But people seem to be managing pretty well, 
I think, on the whole. Everybody has their story to tell, no matter where you 
go, and I see eight to 10 customers per day. People want to talk about it, 
though -- they want to get it off their chests. The people that are from here, 
who were born and raised in L.A. -- they're getting over it real well. But I 
had a repair case in Canoga Park where a family would not go back in their 
apartment -- and this was probably a month afterward. And when I went in the 
apartment, it was in the same condition it was right after the quake. The fish 
tank was broken and all over the floor, and the furniture was in a jumble and 
the china cabinet had fallen over and broken. They went in when I went in to 
disconnect their service, then they went right back out again. ROBERT FICKETT 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Department captain whose station in Northridge was destroyed 
by the quake but will be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Despair. Uncertainty. It's a funny thing. We are still encountering people who 
don't want to go back into their homes. They're living in travel trailers, 
mobile homes. On a day-to-day basis, it's everything as usual. At night, they 
do not go back into their homes. It's surprising.  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, I think it'll recover. There's a lot of support from the community, 
different organizations and the City Council.  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people are not in a position to say, "Hey, we have to get out of 
here." I mean, their work, their family, the kids are in school -- it's all 
local. They can't move from this particular area. There is a lot of the 
feeling, too, about "Where are we going to start over?" or "How can we start 
over?" SEAN MEADE 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police officer on force for four months, Devonshire Division, 
Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 The call loads are back up to normal. We're back into effective enforcement of 
traffic, domestic violence. When you actually get a chance to talk to the 
citizens, most of them are relaxed. A lot of them are beginning to get through 
the rebuilding, waiting for the emergency aid to come through. A lot have 
prepared themselves, made emergency kits and are rethinking some of the design 
of their homes. I remember, right after the earthquake at Northridge Junior 
High, a lot of people were camping out in the football field. I remember the 
kids being more fascinated with our presence than normal. We'd show up and 
they'd wave, but they're not quite as clingy and as interested in our presence 
as before. Obviously, to them during the quake, we were a sign of safety. And 
now that they feel safe again, we're just the police again. KEVIN SHOST 
</P>
<P>
 Field investigator, Department of Water and Power, San Fernando Valley 
</P>
<P>
 There is still a lot of stress and confusion, especially among older 
customers. They really need sympathy and they deserve it. And they need to see 
people from DWP, the gas company, FEMA, someone out there. In addition to 
everything else, they're getting water bills that are much higher than normal. 
We're writing off everything that's higher than normal for these people. There 
was a lady two days ago in Reseda who came to the door. Apparently the whole 
neighborhood had been hit pretty bad. She lived alone. She was over 70. She 
seemed OK when I started talking to her, but half-way through the conversation, 
she started crying. She just broke down. And it caught me by surprise, because 
she seemed fine. All of a sudden, you could just tell that it just hit her at 
once. I felt sorry for her. That's the kind of thing I see a lot. People aren't 
crying a lot, but you can tell they're just frustrated. There's so much damage.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SERMON; ON WHAT AIDS 
CAN TEACH US THIS HOLY WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN E. BLAIRE, The Most Rev. Stephen E. Blaire is auxiliary bishop of 
the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!" Yesterday this chilling shout rang out in Catholic 
churches throughout the world, as we heard the Gospel account of the Lord's 
passion. We will hear these same words in our churches again this week on Good 
Friday, as we remember the death of Christ and our part in it. The crowds of 
Jerusalem passed judgment on Jesus, pressuring the civil authorities to hand 
down a sentence of a humiliating death reserved for the most despicable of 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 How much have Christians learned in the 2,000 years since we passed judgment 
on the Son of God? Have we listened to the Lord's admonition to judge not, lest 
we be judged? Sadly, the AIDS epidemic has shown that we still have an ugly 
tendency to judge others. Too often, faced with the unimaginable suffering of 
HIV or AIDS, we have hardened our hearts, ascribed guilt to the sick, and 
neglected our Christian calling for compassion and fellowship, especially for 
those whom society has named outcast, unwanted, despised. When we jeer at a gay 
man, disown our gay children, fire a gay co-worker, and say of a brave man 
facing a disease which should rouse us to solidarity and compassion: "he 
deserves it," we are once again pounding nails into the hands and feet of 
Christ and hoisting him up on the cross. 
</P>
<P>
 While I believe that sickness and death entered the world because of original 
sin -- resulting in our tendency not to do the right thing all the time -- no 
particular ailment or problem is a divine punishment of any individual or 
community. Neither earthquake nor financial trouble nor AIDS is dealt from God 
to us as retribution for our individual sins; we know this because many evil 
people live healthy and comfortable lives. We need to ask ourselves if we have 
ever fallen prey to spiritual pride, which causes us to assume for ourselves 
God's right of judgment of our brother or sister, coldly ignoring pain and 
loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been noted that the collective experience of the gay community is that 
when no one else realizes that one is gay, a mother can tell. "A mother always 
knows," they say. It's a phenomenon seen time and time again. Our blessed 
mother Mary knows her gay and lesbian children, just as she knows all her 
children. She knows them and accepts then with the unconditional love of a 
mother. And when her gay children are treated as outcasts from society, 
abandoned and left alone to die, she feels for them as she felt at the foot of 
the cross, watching her only Son endure a lonely and humiliating death. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason it is especially appropriate that the new chapel we dedicated 
Sunday at St. Victor's Church in West Hollywood in memory of those who have 
died of AIDS houses an image our Blessed Mother, whom we honor as Comforter of 
the Afflicted. It is an ancient Catholic custom to pray for the dead. We join 
them in the hope of everlasting joy, when every tear shall be wiped away.  
</P>
<P>
 At the feet of Our Lady in the AIDS chapel lies a book. In it are written the 
names of the loved ones whom we have lost to this epidemic, our brothers and 
sisters in Christ. Though we mourn their loss, this book is not a record of a 
dreary fate, but rather a sign of our hope and trust in the prophecy of Isaiah 
from the readings of the Chrism Mass on Holy Thursday. Isaiah foretold of 
Christ that he was sent "to comfort those who mourn and to give them for ashes 
a garland, for mourning the robe of gladness, for despondency, praise." It is a 
promise made to all the faithful, gay and straight, for we are all children of 
God and brothers and sisters of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Let this be the lesson we learn from AIDS this Holy Week: that we honor our 
dead and care for the sick, and that we not cry out in judgment on one another, 
calling out again for Christ to be crucified in the person of our gay and 
lesbian brothers and sisters. Rather, let our hearts go out to the outcast, 
those for whom society finds no welcome, and remember the words of the Lord: 
"As often as you did it to one of these, the least, you did it to me."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
TORRANCE: CLEANER AIR, JOBS RIDING ON ELECTRIC BUS PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of hopes are riding on ventures like the 25-seat electric bus the South 
Bay city of Torrance recently rolled out onto its streets. It represents an 
important example of efforts to develop cleaner transportation in a region 
plagued by smog while helping local industries, which have lost tens of 
thousands of aerospace and high-technology jobs in the past five year, make the 
transition into other markets. The 29-foot bus is described by its makers as 
the country's largest battery-powered, mass-transit vehicle to operate on major 
thoroughfares. Hughes Power Control Systems, a Torrance-based unit of Hughes 
Electronics, builds the buses in partnership with Specialty Vehicle 
Manufacturing Co. of Downey using electronics developed to power systems aboard 
military jets. Torrance purchased the Zero Emission Surface Transit (ZEST) bus 
with $300,000 in voter-approved Los Angeles County transportation funds. The 
city of Los Angeles has since followed suit putting an electric bus on route 
through Los Angeles International Airport. ZERO EMISSION SURFACE TRANSIT BUS

 A project like this isn't window dressing. People need to see what is behind 
the occasional appearance on the road of an electric bus and what has gone into 
it. It represents an attempt by companies to really redefine their market 
sector and market relationships that makes sense to their own technology base. 
For the municipality it represents an opportunity to serve citizens with clean, 
efficient transportation and meet crucial clean air standards while supporting 
the local economy as it goes through this transition. That's why it's so 
important in the interim to test out not just the viability of the technology, 
but what it's like to do business in a new context. It's as much cultural shift 
as it is an industrial shift. MANUFACTURER

 This represents a blending of technologies and ways of doing business that 
come together into a product that is going to satisfy a city. With each bus we 
have the potential to keep 5,000 pounds of pollutant from the air each year 
even considering the power plant contribution needed to generate the 
electricity. No one else is in the country is commercially selling and 
delivering electric buses right now, so here's an opportunity for California 
companies -- not only us, but our vendors -- to keep business in the state. 
We're now building buses for the city of Chatanooga, Tenn. If it hadn't been 
for Torrance's leadership role and risk-taking we couldn't have moved forward 
from the standpoint of having a customer to build a bus for and to demonstrate 
and advance the technology. CITY EMPLOYEE

 You'd love a prototype to be perfect when it's rolled out, but by the nature 
of what it is there's going to be modifications. We had the rollout last fall 
and little things along the way had to be adjusted. Hughes designed the 
power-control system and Specialty designed everything around it so there were 
some things in the marriage of those systems that had to be worked out. It's a 
learning process. When they rolled out the bus at LAX one of the comments I 
heard from an engineer was, "We learned so much from your bus we were able to 
build them into this one." And that's the point.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TESTIMONY; ONE 
PERSON'S STORY ABOUT SOUTH-CENTRAL LOS ANGELES; 'I SEE AN EROSION OF VALUES, AN 
EROSION OF CARING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By As told to ROBERT SCHEER; Larry Aubry retired last month from the Los 
Angeles Human Relations Commission. He still serves on the Inglewood school 
board. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I started working with Los Angeles County in 1960 as a probation officer. I 
did that for 7 1/2 years before going to the Human Relations Commission in late 
1967. So I've been around. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of affairs in the greater South-Central area has been the major 
focus of my career. Tragically, education, housing, employment, even 
police-community relations, are all now as bad as they were in 1965, when Watts 
exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of this stagnation is due to benign neglect from the people and 
institutions in positions of authority. They've written off these communities. 
Since April 29, 1992, it's been business as usual.  
</P>
<P>
 We're still pretty much in a crisis mode. We handle things on an ad-hoc basis 
-- something comes up, so we deal with it. We react. We need to get into 
proactive policy.  
</P>
<P>
 Look at the decline in student achievement scores, for example. Those in a 
position of authority just allow those conditions to worsen over time. And then 
it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. That's what people don't understand, 
people in the San Fernando Valley who say, "We gave them their shot, we tried 
to help those people already." Well, what was that shot?  
</P>
<P>
 When you really examine it -- who was really involved, and what kind of 
resources were there -- you find that the money spent on poverty programs was 
misdirected. There needs to be some political pressure brought to bear to force 
a fair allocation of resources, but unfortunately that pressure does not exist. 
 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of the most devastating, tragic aspects of racism that those who are 
heavily oppressed do not take up the fight against that oppression. You would 
think they would say, "To hell with this." But that only happens periodically. 
And when it happens, it's sometimes more self-destructive than anything else.  
</P>
<P>
 We have two Los Angeleses. One is the so-called inner city and the other is 
the non-inner city. Those are two distinct realities and I do not believe there 
is the will, the desire, the motivation to deal with the problems of the inner 
city to avoid future conflagration. 
</P>
<P>
 In my 34 years working with the county and the city I have not seen that will. 
Programs come up and programs die. I have not seen real policy that deals with 
people's problems. By policy, I mean directives that have kick, directives that 
have money behind them, that require people to do things differently. And the 
tragedy is that we have generations of youngsters who are going to live and die 
and never get a glimpse of the good life, just by virtue of accident of birth. 
I am not suggesting mollycoddling anybody. I am suggesting that people have to 
feel a sense of worth and dignity in order to participate in society in a 
constructive way. 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central, I see an erosion of values, an erosion of caring, I see a 
callousness on the part of youngsters. I see youngsters who seem to be 
impervious to pain, to fear, to suffering. I see kids who are witness to 
accidents or shootings or stabbings and who, at a very early age, seem to be 
unaffected. And the implications of that are just huge. It's almost like life 
doesn't mean anything to them.  
</P>
<P>
 The kids in South-Central have more obstacles than I did as a black man 
growing up in Los Angeles. They feel less hopeful about themselves than the 
average kid did when I was coming up. There was a certain hope that was part of 
the scene back then, a hope associated with the civil-rights movement and the 
belief that things would get better. That doesn't exist any longer.  
</P>
<P>
 You tell these kids, "Hey, man, you do this, you take care of this, you take 
care of that," and they say, "The hell with you, I'm going to do something 
else. Because they don't really believe you. Their experiences are that you 
have to do the conniving thing, you have to do the slick thing in order to get 
over -- because they don't even know about the substance, they're strictly 
dealing with the form. 
</P>
<P>
 And they're saying -- and this is the ultimate tragedy -- "My life is not 
worth it." When I was a kid I felt my life was worth it. I got that idea from 
my family. These kids just don't have that kind of experience; they've been 
beaten down to the point where they won't even acknowledge, or can't even see, 
the positive things that do exist.  
</P>
<P>
 We don't take time. I mean, my God, imagine if some people had to stop in 
South-Central Los Angeles, if their car broke or something, if they had to get 
off at Manchester or Florence? Know what I'm saying? And yet people live there. 
I live in Inglewood, and there are folks who won't even come to Inglewood.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm saying it's a mind-set, I'm saying we have to come together to struggle 
with this thing. Because everybody is affected, that was dramatically 
demonstrated on April 29 of 1992, where the thing went well past South-Central. 
 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a hopeful future that I see. I just think that we're going to have to 
reassess and we're going to have to be very uncomfortable for awhile as we try 
to carve out this new reality.

'TEENS DON'T ENJOY BEING STEREOTYPED AS SEX FIENDS'

 "Just say no./Just use a condom." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait until you're older./Everybody's doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The messages teen-agers receive about sex today are confusing. The result is a 
lost generation. Many teens have never received explicit guidelines regarding 
sexual behavior and, therefore, are setting their own standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics on teen sexuality indicate that too many parents are not 
teaching their teen-agers to be responsible and that the educational system is 
not doing its job in this subject. According to a 1993 issue of Christianity 
Today magazine, every year, 1 million teen-age pregnancies occur and about 2 
million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are reported. Today's 
teens also have to worry about disease more than their parents did: 20 years 
ago, there were four types of STDs among teens; today there are 30, including 
the deadly AIDS virus, HIV. Among 14 to 23 year olds, AIDS has increased 72% in 
the past two years, the magazine says. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, solutions to the problem of premarital sex. First, sex 
education needs to revamped, the message needs to be clarified. To promote 
abstinence and then hand out a condom is bewildering. 
</P>
<P>
 Condom distribution cannot replace sex education. Condoms are a bad idea and a 
dangerous cop-out. Among the general population, the magazine says the failure 
rate of condoms is 15%. Among teens, it is 18% to 20%. Even if properly used, 
condoms are not 100% effective against preventing transmission of HIV. Not only 
do they give users a false sense of security, but condoms also send the message 
that teens have no control over their sexual urges. 
</P>
<P>
 Arming teens with the facts isn't enough. They must also be empowered by 
teaching abstinence and how to handle peer pressure. Only 17% of girls planned 
their first intercourse, the magazine adds. This suggests that a vast majority 
were pressured into having sex. If females (and males) were taught to handle 
high-pressure situations, they could become more comfortable asserting 
themselves and refusing sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Abstinence seems like an old-fashioned idea but it is still applicable in 
modern-day life. Sexual abstinence is not only practical, but also gives a 
feeling of freedom -- freedom from worry about disease, pregnancy, and most of 
all, the loss of respect that can result from premarital sex. 
</P>
<P>
 This respect issue seems to be largely ignored in sex education. Sex is 
supposed to be the ultimate expression of love between two people who have high 
respect for one another. But too often sex becomes exploitation, used to gain 
power and status. A recent example is the Lakewood Spur Posse scandal, where 
young men accumulated "points" by sleeping with a number of young women. These 
women were used, then discarded. They were stripped of their dignity as they 
became another "point." Young men should learn that a woman is a human being, 
not an object. Both sexes should have enough respect for themselves that they 
do not need to prove their worth by sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to parents and educators: Teen-agers need your support and guidance. 
We deserve your respect and do not enjoy being stereotyped as hormone-driven 
sex fiends. Unless these conditions are met, no amount of education will curb 
the spread of disease or reduce the number of teen pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to my fellow teens: Respect yourselves and just say no.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; WAR 
ON PREJUDICE STARTS WITH OURSELVES; MANY OF OUR NEGATIVE VIEWS OF OTHERS WERE 
UNWITTINGLY FORMED IN CHILDHOOD. A WILLINGNESS TO RETHINK OLD IDEAS CAN HELP US 
CHANGE.

<P>
 All of us have prejudices. We might like to believe that we outgrow most of 
them. Unfortunately, a large number of prejudices begin early in life and 
linger until we confront and change them. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because early life exposure to society's rejection of select groups is 
profound. Sadly, the attitudes of fear and loathing are often delivered to us 
by people we love and depend on. The messages of intolerance and mistrust of 
others are interwoven with messages of nurturing and affection for us. 
</P>
<P>
 When we were children and our care-givers expressed their affection by telling 
us about threats and promising to protect us from them, that made us feel loved 
and secure. But if those care-givers didn't differentiate between "real 
threats" (people who drive recklessly, push drugs or bully others) and 
"imagined threats" (people who have a different race, religion or sexual 
orientation), then we developed fears and dislikes of people who are merely 
different. Those fears, though irrational, were paired with early memories of 
love and security -- and that makes them powerful and enduring. 
</P>
<P>
 As children, we weren't sophisticated enough to determine which messages were 
unnecessary for our survival and which reflected the prejudices of our 
care-givers. Unwittingly, we went along, reinforcing negative ideas about 
others because we trusted those who gave us those ideas in the first place. 
Many of us arrive at adulthood with some harmful baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 So what can we do about it now? 
</P>
<P>
 A lot. First, we can examine the many messages we have received and determine 
which we want to foster and which we want to change. It is possible to value 
the loving and nurturing messages we received from care-givers while 
acknowledging that they grew up with prejudices that may have been 
inadvertently passed along to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, we can educate ourselves and confront any false ideas we have about 
people who are different. The many cultural events in Los Angeles, including 
festivals, fairs, films and art exhibits, offer a great way to learn something 
new while having fun. If nothing new is allowed in, we're stuck with the 
information that created the prejudices in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we can put our learning into action. Do we let derogatory remarks 
about others pass without comment because we can remember hearing someone from 
our past say them? Or do we remind ourselves and others that we need to shed 
some of our old ideas and develop new ones? Do we structure our lives to avoid 
people who are different from us because "that's the way it's always been?" Or 
do we evaluate our behavior rationally and try to change it? 
</P>
<P>
 Examining old attitudes, seeking out information to form new ones and changing 
behavior -- those are the key elements to winning the war on prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the most effective way to do these things on a regular basis? If, in 
our personal and professional lives, we reach out to meet and interact with 
people who are different from us, we will be able to confront old attitudes 
regularly. New friends can help educate us by sharing their life experiences 
and listening to ours. As the friendships grow, our motivation to change will 
also grow. And as the number of friendships and acquaintances increases, we 
will have more examples of people in our lives who reinforce new ideas about 
others who may be different.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MULTICULTURAL 
MANNERS; CUSTOM THAT 'PROTECTS' BABY 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORINE DRESSER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mrs. Rose Del Signore comes to stay during the last few weeks of her 
daughter's pregnancy. Anxious to have everything ready before the child 
arrives, they go to a local baby furniture store for a crib and chest of 
drawers.After Del Signore pays for the merchandise, she tries to arrange for 
immediate delivery. But the store owners refuse to deliver it until after the 
child is born. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 The owners are Orthodox Jews who believe that the birth of a child can be 
fraught with problems and danger. Since they believe that one should not tempt 
fate, they wait until after a child is born before bringing any baby supplies 
into the home. This also explains why Orthodox Jews do not give baby showers 
before a birth. 
</P>
<P>
 From the store owners' point of view, they were performing an act of kindness 
by refusing to deliver the furniture before the child was born. They were 
trying to prevent anything negative from happening to Del Signore's grandchild. 
Del Signore accepted their custom, and notified the store as soon as the baby 
was born. As promised, they delivered the furniture before the new mother 
returned from the hospital with her healthy daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: Some peoples believe that pregnancy is a time of potential peril for the 
unborn. Consequently, this rite of passage is surrounded by many beliefs and 
customs designed to protect the baby.

SPORTSMEN'S CAUCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your unbiased article about hunters and the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus 
(March 16) was long overdue. As a longtime hunter, fisherman and 
conservationist, I would hesitate before aligning myself with such an 
apparently elitist group. Instead, I would prefer that hunters and fishermen 
work more closely with various environmental groups such as the National 
Audubon Society, the Sierra Club and the Nature Conservancy. As Richard Parsons 
of the Safari Club points out, goals of environmentalists and hunters are 
exactly the same: preservation of wilderness and natural habitat for the 
enjoyment of future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 You make the point that hunters' numbers are dwindling, but 15 million 
licensed hunters are still more than double the total membership of the 12 most 
prominent conservation groups in the country. With the sheer numbers and 
financial clout of sportsmen and the organization and financing of 
environmental groups, such an alliance could prove a formidable foe for those 
that would unabashedly trash our environment in the name of development and 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, pointing out that hunters and fishermen have long financed habitat 
conservation and restoration in this country through license fees and 
self-imposed special taxes raises the obvious question: If the animal rights 
movement were to succeed in banning hunting and fishing, who would foot the 
bill?

 It is a sad state of the union when both the President's Administration and 
nearly half of the Congress actively promote the recreational killing of 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's "point man on the hunting issue," U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service Deputy Director Kenneth L. Smith, believes that "it is important for 
the (Fish and Wildlife) service, state agencies and the hunting community as a 
whole to engage in outreach to promote hunting among the young and those who 
live in urban areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Our wildlife has been mismanaged for years because the Fish and Wildlife 
Service and all 50 state wildlife agencies are disproportionately stacked with 
hunters. There are many more Americans who enjoy wildlife through 
non-consumptive activities (such as wildlife photography, hiking and 
bird-watching) than there are hunters, yet the professional wildlife agencies 
continue to actively promote hunting opportunities and interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 7% of the American public hunts. The hunting population is even lower in 
many states, such as the 2% who hunt in California. State and federal agencies 
should manage America's wildlife in the interests of the entire public, not 
only the small but vocal minority of people who enjoy killing animals for their 
amusement.

<P>
 "A Surprise Bounty for Hunters" highlights some of the mischief the National 
Rifle Assn. and the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus are up to. In particular, 
their efforts to deny national park protection to the East Mojave in the 
California desert are shortsighted.  
</P>
<P>
 Hunting is not permitted in national parks. National and state parks serve as 
important habitats for several endangered species. The proposed East Mojave 
National Park has very limited hunting opportunities. In recent years less than 
two dozen deer tags have been used annually in the area. The California Desert 
Protection Act permits hunting to continue in wilderness and non-wilderness 
areas administered by the Bureau of Land Management.

NANNY POLICY: EQUITY AND DOMESTIC HELP; WASHINGTON MAKES A STAB AT REFORMING 
SOCIAL SECURITY RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Housekeepers are ubiquitous in Southern California. They clean, cook, care for 
children and generally work very hard for very little pay. On retirement, like 
most American workers, they are eligible for a Social Security check and 
Medicare benefits. Few collect because most employers fail to pay the requisite 
taxes. To ensure a minimally decent retirement for elderly nannies and other 
household workers, Congress should make it easier to pay up. 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires anyone who hires household help to pay a 7.65% Social 
Security tax on wages. (The employee is required to pay the same amount, but 
the IRS says that many bosses pay both shares.) The burdensome system is 
triggered when wages reach $50 during any three-month period. That antiquated 
threshold, which was set more than 50 years ago, now is easily reached in a day 
of cleaning or a weekend of baby-sitting. A much higher threshold is needed. 
Also, compliance requires completing complicated paperwork every three months 
and figuring out the amount of quarterly payments. That onerous task requires a 
calculator and a surfeit of patience. There's got to be a better way. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is considering several improvements. The Senate Finance Committee, 
chaired by Daniel P. Moynihan (D-N.Y.), recently approved a bill that would 
raise the threshold from the measly $50 per quarter to a still-too-low $630 a 
year. The legislation also would allow employers to satisfy their debt when 
they file their income taxes. It would exempt teen-agers who baby-sit, mow the 
lawn or perform other tasks. That's reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 The House is expected to consider similar legislation soon -- but all this 
comes far too late to save the Clinton Administration from embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoe Baird, President Clinton's first choice for attorney general, was the 
Administration's first casualty under this law. She never paid taxes on the 
wages of the Peruvian couple she hired to watch her child and tend her yard. 
(It didn't help her case that the housekeeper and gardener were in this country 
illegally.) Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown also ran into trouble for 
failing to pay taxes on the wages of his part-time housekeeper. Other 
candidates for Administration jobs at various levels were removed from 
consideration because of their negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 And the list grows longer. The latest to be caught is William Kennedy III, a 
White House attorney in charge of clearing Administration appointees of these 
very sins. He quietly paid up last month for a nanny who worked for him in 
1991. His offense cost him: Clinton's clean-up man, Lloyd Cutler, the White 
House special counsel named in the wake of Whitewater, demoted Kennedy and 
appropriately stripped him of some duties. 
</P>
<P>
 These high-profile cases put everyone on notice. Scofflaws can no longer plead 
ignorance. Yet their ranks remain plentiful. The Internal Revenue Service 
estimates that fewer than one out of four people who regularly use a maid or 
baby-sitter pay taxes. Granting amnesty would encourage more Americans to 
satisfy this important obligation. Overhauling the law that requires the taxes 
also would increase compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The women and men who work in the homes of others are not seeking charity. 
They earn these benefits. They can collect only if the Social Security 
Administration records taxes on wages for at least 10 quarters. More Americans 
will be encouraged to do that if Congress sets the triggering threshold high 
enough -- and keeps the paperwork simple.

NEEDED: A COMMON-SENSE CRIME LOBBY; HOWEVER HORRIBLE THE OFFENSE, LEGISLATORS 
MUST DEAL IN MORE THAN EMOTIONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crimes of the rapist and child molester horrify and anger the public so 
much that many would be happy to "lock 'em up and throw away the key." Sober 
second thoughts seldom temper that reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The state already imposes extra conditions on those convicted of sex crimes, 
requiring child molesters, for instance, to report their whereabouts to local 
police after being released from prison. When a community learns it will be 
home to a sex criminal, the alarm bells ring. Claremont residents protested 
strenuously over the news that a convicted rapist would be paroled to their 
community. But then he failed a psychiatric test and remained behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time Modoc County, despite protests, has become home to another 
rapist, after Hayward persuaded state officials not to put him in that Alameda 
County community. The rapist now is living at a prison work camp in Modoc 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 This week Gov. Pete Wilson campaigned in Claremont for a "one-strike" bill 
that would imprison rapists and child molesters for life after their first 
conviction. The bill will have a lot of support. It is something nearly 
impossible to oppose emotionally. But legislators are expected to bring more 
than emotions to the process of enacting laws. They must bring common sense and 
reason, too. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) has authored the bill requiring 
first-time convicted rapists and child molesters to spend life in prison 
without the possibility of parole. That is the same penalty long given to those 
convicted of first-degree murder, and recently it began to be applied to 
three-time felons. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson says her bill is needed because most perpetrators of sex crimes are 
repeat offenders who rarely respond to rehabilitation. But the evidence there 
is inconclusive. And if the bill became law, it surely would be challenged as 
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. Nor would it be likely to 
deter others from committing the same crimes, if, as experts argue, these 
crimes are not rational acts but psychological compulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also have questioned whether prosecutors would press charges as 
vigorously if they knew a person would go to jail for life, rather than only up 
to eight years for a first offense, as current law specifies. Knowing the 
penalty, would one family member turn in another? 
</P>
<P>
 In an election year, with crime such a hot issue, and given the despicable 
nature of rape and child molestation, the emotions are understandable. But more 
rationality is needed, before we have more laws on the books than we know what 
to do with, more prisoners than we know what to do with, and, despite all this 
campaign-year thrashing about, still more crime than we know what to do with.

NATURAL GAS AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The authors of the commentary "There's Money to Be Made From Virtue" (March 4) 
are correct in stating that the creation of an advanced transportation industry 
would not only help meet air-quality goals, but also yield thousands of 
high-skilled, high-wage jobs. However, there's more to the advanced 
transportation industry than electric vehicles -- such as natural gas vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural gas vehicles, or NGVs, are on the road in large numbers, offering 
superior performance, reduced emissions and a refueling infrastructure already 
in place. There are more than 30,000 NGVs in the U.S. -- 2,000 of which are in 
Southern California. In addition, there are 75 natural gas refueling stations 
in the region, with more than 600 expected to be in operation by the turn of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of NGVs is expected to grow as U.S. auto makers move ahead to 
produce factory-made natural gas-powered minivans, passenger vehicles and 
trucks. The Gas Co., in a joint venture with others, is opening this spring a 
manufacturing facility in East Los Angeles to produce NGVs. The facility, 
Ecotrans, will be creating jobs by converting or upfitting some 3,000 vehicles 
by the end of 1994 with a production goal of 13,000 vehicles manufactured by 
December, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 While other advanced transportation technologies need further development, 
NGVs have been proven to be safe, cost-effective and cleaner burning than other 
vehicle fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Vehicles powered by natural gas far exceed the state's low-emission vehicle 
standards. In fact, Chrysler received California's lowest emission 
certification yet (ULEV, or ultra-low-emission vehicle) achieved for its 
natural gas-powered minivan, which makes it the cleanest, commercially 
available vehicle on the road today.

 In your article of March 10, concerning the State Air Resources Board's report 
on electric vehicles (EVs), you report that the state bureaucrats who authored 
it consider an EV's huge price tag a "temporary start-up problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it will be a problem for those concerned about cleaning the air in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 To sell these expensive EVs -- as California is mandating for 1998 -- car 
companies will need to subsidize them by increasing the cost of conventional 
cars. Higher car prices will slow down sales, which means a slowdown in the 
turnover of older, polluting cars to newer, cleaner models. 
</P>
<P>
 Since new cars create about 1% of the pollution of cars built two decades ago, 
this turnover is one of the most effective ways we have of reducing emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 We should not be forcing EVs onto the market, especially since it will cost us 
in cleaner air.

 I am a survivor of Hitler's hell. I sat and watched the Oscars and tears ran 
down my face thinking of the millions who did not survive to see the winner for 
best picture.In my mind's eye I see another picture. I see my parents, my 
relatives, my 12-year-old brother -- all of them gasping for air in Hitler's 
gas chambers. Nobody helped the Jews then. The skinheads are not a fad. Do not 
ignore it, world. I was in Europe when it started the same way. Hitler Jugend , 
they called themselves. The world ignored that insane German leader. World, 
don't let history repeat.

 Occasionally, just every now and then, Hollywood genuinely stimulates its 
theatergoing public into contemplating real-life issues. Poignant testimonials 
such as "Philadelphia" and "Schindler's List" compel us to re-examine those 
belief systems that perpetuate what poet Robert Burns called "man's inhumanity 
to man." In the process we confront our personal demons and learn something 
about ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Is such painful self-scrutiny really necessary? You bet. In the same Times 
issue that quotes Tom Hanks' eloquent eulogy of AIDS victims runs a story of an 
uninformed emergency medical technician, who allegedly refused to place an 
ailing man on a stretcher because the patient confessed to taking AZT. "Oh my 
God, he has AIDS," the EMT is quoted as saying. Surely the ignorant health-care 
professional works in Smallsville, USA, you say, where such behavior is not 
unusual. Guess again. Smallsville's name -- the City of Brotherly Love, 
Philadelphia.

TRAGEDY IN HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. policy on political asylum for Haitian refugees is deeply flawed with 
inequities (Commentary, March 17). Worse, the Clinton Administration's hemming 
and hawing over our role in ending the reign of terror against that unlucky 
nation's first democratic government is shameful and not worthy of a great and 
powerful democracy like the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee sent a human rights delegation to 
Haiti in January to meet with acting Prime Minister Robert Malval and embassy 
officials, as well as with peasant leaders working underground in the struggle 
for justice.Delegation members found vocal support among democratic leaders and 
activists for strict and meaningful sanctions against the Haitian military. 
"Why," the Haitians asked, "won't the U.S. take even a little risk for Haitian 
democracy?" 
</P>
<P>
 There is a tragedy of disastrous proportions brewing in Haiti. When will the 
U.S. government have the courage of its convictions in defense of human rights 
and democracy in a very small, very poor and very brave country that continues 
to pay the ultimate price?

PERSPECTIVES ON ELECTRIC CARS; . . . NO, DETROIT IS THE PROBLEM ; CALIFORNIA IS 
PRIMED FOR MAJOR EV DEVELOPMENT, BUT AUTO MAKERS OFFER ONLY A TRADE-DOWN ON 
CLEAN AIR RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BOXER, Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) is a member of the Senate 
Environment and Public Works Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The emerging electric-vehicle industry in California is ready to form a 
partnership with Detroit to design and manufacture electric cars for the 
zero-polluting market. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the California Air Resources Board refuted the Detroit auto makers' 
contention that the electric-vehicle technology would not be ready for 
consumers by 1998, when the state will require that a portion of car sales be 
pollution-free vehicles. Four different electric-battery technologies available 
today could provide a range of at least 80 miles or more between rechargings to 
accommodate 85% of the state's commuters, according to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Council on Science and Technology estimates that the worldwide 
demand for EVs will reach nearly 2 million by 2007, with annual sales exceeding 
$25 billion. By the year 2005, hundreds of thousands of Americans could be 
employed in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 What is Detroit's reaction? They are calling for overturning rules requiring 
sales of zero-emission vehicles. This retreat would come while California's 
aerospace electronics and design industries are poised to help lead automobile 
manufacturing into a new era. 
</P>
<P>
 The most practical technology now available to achieve zero emissions is the 
EV that has no tailpipe emissions and can reduce major ozone-creating pollution 
emissions by 97% compared with gasoline-powered vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Calstart, California's advanced transportation consortium based in 
Burbank, has produced a "showcase electric vehicle" to demonstrate the high 
technologies integral to the development of the electric car, while 
demonstrating how defense companies can convert their military work to civilian 
uses. A cooling system once used for an infrared missile sensor has become a 
thermoelectric heating/cooling seat for EVs. Military-tank systems have become 
hybrid EV power systems. The power-control electronics in F-14s can be found in 
the controllers for EV drive systems. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the nation's first electric-powered school buses will roll out in 
Santa Barbara. If only 25% of new school buses were electric, we could generate 
$455 million in revenues, with retrofit sales totaling another $520 million. As 
many as 26,000 jobs could be created and the air would be cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California is the world's largest center of automobile design. We 
have plastics-molding firms, foundries, machine shops, tool-and-die 
manufacturing and electronic-components producers. About 450 businesses, mostly 
small shops, are poised to develop and manufacture electric-vehicle technology. 
GM's prototype electric car, the Impact, was designed here. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's strengths in engineering, high-technology research and production; 
extensive entrepreneurial activity; world-class universities; an employment 
base of skilled laborers, and advanced aeronautics and electronics industries 
position us perfectly for a major share of new EV jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of seizing this opportunity, the auto makers have promised new 
low-emission vehicles sometime early next century in return for relaxing 
clean-air rules so they won't be required to market electric vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has pledged to support California's zero-emission standard. 
That plan says that by 1998, 2% of all major automobile sales in the state must 
be zero-emission. 
</P>
<P>
 The California standard, which means that in less than five years, about 
40,000 EVs must be sold in California, increasing to 200,000 after the year 
2000, is the catalyst driving the electric-car industry. California could be 
the single largest market for EVs well into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 But not the only one. In February, representatives of Connecticut, New York, 
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Pennsylvania and the 
District of Columbia voted to adopt low-emission vehicle programs, including 
the possible adoption of zero-emission vehicle mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 We face the technological equivalent of the race to the moon. This time, it is 
the race to build the clean car. The winner has a global market at its feet. An 
editor for the Japan Automotive News has said that Japanese manufacturers will 
meet the standard to sell cars in California. Let's not lose this market. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, almost 45 million people still live in counties exceeding the smog 
standard. Children in the Los Angeles air basin suffer a 15% reduction in lung 
function by age 12 because of exposure to smog. Their best hope is cleaner cars 
in a few years -- not a decade. In their hope lies a tremendous economic 
opportunity.

'WHO'S PULLING THE RUG FROM UNDER OUR FEET?'; MEXICO: IN A COUNTRY STALKED BY 
ACCELERATING VIOLENCE, COLOSIO'S DEATH IS SYMBOLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOMERO ARIDJIS, Homero Aridjis is the author of 1492: The Life and Times of 
Juan Cabezon of Castile (NAL/Dutton, 1992) and president of the environmental 
Group of 100. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the day of his destape, his designation last Nov. 28 as the governing 
party's candidate, his campaign was dogged by misfortune. After Jan. 1, the 
shadow of Chiapas stalked him, and his public appearances were relegated to the 
inside pages of the papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever Luis Donaldo Colosio went, the name of Manuel Camacho Solis, one of 
his principal rivals in the party, followed him, and he was harried by rumors 
that he would be replaced or could lose next August's election. The uprising of 
the Zapatista National Liberation Army dealt him a fatal blow; it altered the 
familiar face of his constituency, crippled his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio tried to confront these times of uncertainty with optimism. Branded as 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's man, he wanted to be his own man and 
demonstrate his independence in his speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Destiny lay in wait for him on Wednesday at the hands of an assassin lurking 
among a crowd in the working-class Tijuana suburb of Lomas Taurinas, in Baja 
California Norte, at another border troubled by political unrest, social 
insecurity and migratory pressures. But this border does not face Central 
America and underdevelopment, as in Chiapas; it faces the most powerful country 
on Earth, a juxtaposition that serves as yet another reminder of their poverty 
to its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 One could say that the borders killed Colosio. The southern border dealt the 
political blow, the northern border fired the shots. And worst of all, no one 
knows for certain what is happening in Mexico, who's pulling the rug from under 
our feet, who's behind the accelerating violence. Our present reality is being 
reconfigured, the course of our history changed, although we don't know in 
which direction. A year of political, social and economic turbulence most 
probably lies ahead. We hope it will be only a year, and then we will return to 
stability and the road to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Acts such as the assassination of Colosio do not lead to democracy but to 
political barbarism. The pistolero who fired at the candidate of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party fired at all Mexicans, for we will all suffer 
from his act. No Mexican in his right mind can or should condone violence as a 
form of political expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we still do not know the motives of the gunman who committed this 
crime and whether he acted alone or as the instrument of a conspiracy, there is 
one thing we do know: Colosio is the first significant political victim of the 
climate of violence that Mexico has been experiencing since New Year's Day. 
Perhaps a crime of this magnitude would not have been possible before the 
events in Chiapas. It has irretrievably transformed the atmosphere of the 
August elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 500 kidnapings took place in Mexico during the past year -- and the 
murder of a cardinal last May in Guadalajara as well as a slew of armed 
robberies on our roads and in our cities. An increasing tide of violence, in 
which the hand of the police is often discernible, is invading our daily life. 
The crowds gathered in Mexico City to bid farewell to Colosio's body were 
clamoring for justice. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mexico manages to emerge unscathed, it will be as a stronger and more 
democratic country, worthy of its history and culture and ready to enter the 
21st Century under its next president, chosen in what must be, finally, a clean 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio ran for Tlatoani, supreme ruler of the Mexican political system; 
without becoming emperor, he suffered the fate of Julius Caesar and succumbed 
to his own Ides of March.

IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES, A CALL FOR CITIZENS AGAINST CRIME; POLICE: THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD APPROACH AIMS TO IMPROVE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK A. KROEKER, Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker is commanding officer of the 
LAPD's South Bureau, which runs roughly from the Santa Monica Freeway south to 
San Pedro, from La Brea on the west to the Harbor Freeway on the east. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As of this year, the LAPD's South Bureau -- 1,200 officers serving a 
population of 750,000 people -- has aggressively moved to deepen its commitment 
to community policing. Our goals are to reduce crime, both the violent and 
property varieties, and also the fear of crime, which oppresses people in their 
daily lives; to improve the quality of life in the neighborhoods, and a 
willingness to work together and create a new level of trust between police and 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Community policing is more than anything an attitude, one that acknowledges 
that the residents, merchants and other "stakeholders" are the MIPs, the most 
important persons, in the equation. They are our customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Our most important response is to listen, and we will do this through new 
community police advisory boards, community meetings, feedback from elected and 
appointed officials, letters and phone calls that come to our police stations 
and community surveys. We will listen when it's pleasant to and when it's 
painful, to supporters and detractors. Some of our best advice may well come 
from the most unlikely sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of this effort is at the neighborhood level. The adage "smaller is 
better" fits well in community policing because it speaks of small wins, 
incremental progress and visible results in neighborhood life, where things 
really matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy we will employ is the problem-solving method, which assumes that 
a large measure of the grief is produced by fairly identifiable problems. Our 
search for the problems will no doubt lead us to neighborhood aggravations, 
visible drug use, graffiti and street prostitution. We will also analyze data 
such as our multiple-call location reports, and ask why we are constantly 
sending response cars to certain locations. Then we can begin solving the 
problems.  
</P>
<P>
 The community-based policing organization is based on volunteerism within our 
communities -- a goodwill alliance of major proportions. This will take work, 
but we hope that the work will be shared by many. The community will be 
organized on a three-tiered basis, rather than the more traditional approach of 
a few good people who seem to do most of the work. The key persons are the 
residents, merchants and homeowners. They are at the top of the 
inverted-pyramid organization chart. Next is the block captain on each street, 
who will organize neighbors, residents or merchants, disseminate information 
and develop a neighborhood watch, business watch or apartment watch. The newest 
ingredient in this organization is the police-community representative, another 
community volunteer who will organize block captains and coordinate within the 
department's census-tract reporting districts.  
</P>
<P>
 For the department, we have taken 30 senior officers off routine response and 
reassigned them to recruiting this volunteer organization, cultivating it, 
listening to it and coordinating, along with the neighborhood stakeholders, 
creative and strategic problem-solving activities. 
</P>
<P>
 We will measure our success not only by looking at statistics, but also by 
surveying the level of community fear, which we hope to lower. And, we will 
measure the visible impact on the quality of neighborhood life. We want to 
measure our trust and respect by the number and nature of commendations for 
police officers as well as complaints against them. Both the city of Los 
Angeles and its Police Department have gone through an era of unprecedented 
negativity. Now it's time for "positivity," and in large doses. We have been 
locked in the age of condemnation. Now let's have some sincere and open 
commendation for our great city, for its neighborhoods and for the men and 
women who police those neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 What can you do? 
</P>
<P>
 Contact your local police station. Express your willingness to get involved, 
even in a minor way. There is a place for you. You are important to us.

PERSPECTIVES ON ELECTRIC CARS; MANDATES WILL ADD TO POLLUTION . . .; CURRENT 
TECHNOLOGY IS SO EXPENSIVE AND INEFFICIENT THAT PEOPLE WILL KEEP THEIR OLD, 
POLLUTING GAS-GUZZLERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. COLE and MICHAEL S. FLYNN, David E. Cole is director and Michael S. 
Flynn is associate director of the University of Michigan Office for the Study 
of Automotive Transportation. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most analysts believe that electric vehicles (EVs) will someday have a 
significant presence in our lives. They also agree that time is in the distant 
future.  
</P>
<P>
 The distinction between the EV's potential and present reality is important. 
California has mandated that essentially 2% -- roughly 40,000 -- of all cars 
sold here in 1998 must be EVs. Because of the lead time necessary to produce a 
new car, those 1998 cars will have today's battery technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, today's battery technology simply cannot support a practical 
and affordable EV. To be sure, there have been improvements as battery 
companies, domestic and foreign automakers and the U.S. government have 
invested hundreds of millions of dollars in research to develop new technology. 
But today's EV can be driven only 40 to 100 miles before it must be recharged. 
Some minor increases in mileage are possible over the next several years, but 
that range would be reduced if the driver uses heat, air-conditioning, the 
radio, lights or other electrical devices or is caught in the stop-and-go 
traffic typical of our cities. Moreover, the charging time for today's 
batteries is quite long and quick-charging systems are not yet reliable for 
mass use. Battery life also is a problem. EV applications require deep cycling, 
the concentrated use of a significant fraction of the charge, shortening the 
life of the batteries, necessitating replacement every few years and 
dramatically escalating the total life-cycle costs of the 1998 EV. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers' Assn., told 
the California Assembly Transportation Committee last month that today's EV is 
like having a car with a $15,000 gas tank with a capacity of three gallons that 
takes eight hours to fill and needs replacement every few years. Based on 
today's technology, we believe his statement is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the California mandate may ultimately delay the wider use of EVs. 
Forcing this technology into the marketplace before there is any realistic 
chance of its widespread consumer acceptance may stiffen resistance to it when 
it becomes effective.  
</P>
<P>
 There is some risk that the mandated use of EVs also will hinder current 
efforts to clean our air. Those 1998 EVs could easily cost as much as $20,000 
more than conventional cars, partially because they require more exotic body, 
chassis and heating-ventilation-air-conditioning systems to offset their 
battery limitations. Since such a price premium would almost certainly prevent 
sales from reaching the targeted level, this excess cost will be spread over 
all vehicles, and that is likely to reduce the sales of new conventional 
automobiles. Since new cars produce far lower levels of tailpipe pollutants 
than cars more than 10 years old, replacing older cars with newer vehicles is 
an effective and quick anti-smog strategy. Higher prices due to the EV mandate 
will surely slow that process. 
</P>
<P>
 California does not have to surrender its clean-air goals. But there are more 
effective means to those goals than EVs, including programs that increase the 
scrapping of old or poorly maintained cars, cleaner gasoline, inspection and 
maintenance programs and newer, less-polluting vehicles.  
</P>
<P>
 While EVs may work in replacing buses and delivery vehicles, where use 
patterns can accommodate their limitations, their use as passenger cars still 
faces too many obstacles for them to be a reasonable step to cleaner air. 
</P>
<P>
 We are confident, however, that someday technology will allow EVs to play a 
significant role in our urban-transportation network. A company making the 
necessary technical breakthroughs will become very successful indeed. If the 
ongoing cooperative research activities of the industry achieve the 
breakthrough, it will be competitively neutral and widely shared. Either of 
those outcomes is sufficient incentive to ensure that research into practical 
EVs will continue, even without mandate timetables. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, it seems clear that the realities of today's EV technology may 
make the California mandate one of the least effective approaches to reducing 
automotive pollution.

"Spanish for Gringos". . . . Harvey, who learned Spanish growing up in Santa 
Ana, ended a general course Thursday and will now tailor training for each city 
department. "It's not just Spanish that he's good at. He's good at culture," 
said Gerardo Mouet, the city personnel department's outreach coordinator. "Not 
being Hispanic, he's a walking symbol of crossing that bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 DIVERSITYVILLE: Long a Latino magnet, downtown Santa Ana is about to be 
pitched hard to whites, Koreans and other residents who have abandoned the Main 
Street core over the years. . . . In trying to lure a more diverse crowd to its 
shops and restaurants, the local merchants' group assigned a marketing 
consultant to recast downtown's image as an ethnic haven for all. . . . "I 
think people perceive downtown as a very Hispanic open-air mall," said Jose 
Martinez, president of the Downtown Santa Ana Business Assn. "This is a 
multicultural town!"

32 KILLED AS TORNADOES RAKE SOUTH; DISASTER: TWISTER HITS ALABAMA CHURCH PACKED 
WITH PALM SUNDAY WORSHIPERS. GEORGIA BRACES FOR MORE DAMAGE AS STRING OF STORMS 
HEADS FOR AREA.

<P>
 A series of powerful thunderstorms tore across the South on Sunday, killing 32 
people, including 16 who died when a tornado caved in the roof of a church 
crowded with Palm Sunday worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 The twister hit Goshen Methodist Church in Piedmont, Ala., about 11:30 a.m. 
CST, breaking windows and toppling a brick wall on a pew of children waiting to 
sing in a pageant. About 90 people were injured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One man ran down the aisle yelling: 'Get on the floor!' " worshiper Elwanna 
Acker, 63, told the Associated Press. "Then the roof came down. The woman right 
next to me died." 
</P>
<P>
 The storm system was blamed for deaths elsewhere in Alabama and Georgia and 
for causing widespread damage in several other states. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 11 north Georgia counties were hit hard by afternoon thunderstorms 
and tornadoes that reportedly killed at least 14 people, knocked out power for 
thousands of homes and businesses and closed roads. Dozens of people were 
reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of eastern Alabama and all of northwest Georgia was braced Sunday night 
for more bad weather as another line of tornado-flinging thunderstorms roared 
into the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst kind of tornado damage that we've had in north Georgia 
since the early '70s," said Gov. Zell Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of (power) lines down, a lot of trees down. Highway 75 is 
blocked, and probably won't be open until (Monday) morning because of the 
trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the state Department of Transportation and Department of 
Corrections workers were immediately dispatched to help clear the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the death toll could go higher. "There are a number of people 
missing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cherokee County, one of the Georgia counties hit hard by the storm, 
tornadoes cut large swaths through the countryside. Large fields of trees were 
snapped like toothpicks and the ground was littered with live power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to need the National Guard, and we need all the 
volunteers with chain saws we can find," County Commissioner Bobby Hawthorne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A flash flood warning was in effect in metropolitan Atlanta, and there were 
unconfirmed reports of tornado sightings just north of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In Piedmont, children dressed in their Easter clothes were performing in a 
Palm Sunday drama when the tornado hit. Six children, from 2 to 12 years old, 
were among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just started to scream, 'Everybody get down!' " Carol Scroggins, who was 
leading the pageant, told the AP. "People were screaming, but it happened so 
quickly there wasn't much time for reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 About six miles away, the Union Grove Methodist church also was hit by a 
tornado during Palm Sunday services, but its 75 worshipers took shelter in the 
basement and escaped injury, Piedmont Mayor Vera Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen bodies were found inside the Goshen church, and one man was found 
outside in a van, apparently killed by part of a toppled telephone pole, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were unconfirmed reports Sunday night that three of the injured had died 
in local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 About 140 people were in the church, five miles north of Piedmont in eastern 
Alabama, officials said. Rescuers had feared that others were buried, but all 
were accounted for after more than 100 searchers dug through the rubble by hand 
and called in a crane to lift the collapsed roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The tornado ripped away an entire side of the red-brick building and blew the 
steeple into the parking lot. Pieces of pews were scattered around the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Several nearby houses also were demolished by the twister, and the National 
Guard was called in to help search for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Christa Rhinehart, 16, who had sung earlier in the service, told the AP that 
she was sitting near the front when the roof came down on her pew. "I started 
screaming for my momma," she said, "and she was right beside me." 
</P>
<P>
 The storm knocked out power and telephone service, hampering rescue efforts. 
Passing motorists helped take the injured to hospitals around Piedmont, a rural 
town of 5,000 residents 72 miles west of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured were so numerous that five regional hospitals and medical centers 
had to be put on alert to handle the load. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service had issued a tornado watch for the area earlier 
in the morning. The weather service issued a warning saying a twister had been 
spotted on the ground about the time the roof collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 A temporary morgue was set up at a National Guard armory in Piedmont, and the 
civic center was turned into a shelter for the families of victims. 
</P>
<P>
 A tornado also damaged the Ten Island Baptist Church in Ragland, Ala., and 
injured an undetermined number of people, Calhoun County sheriff's dispatcher 
Leon Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Alabama, tornadoes killed one person at a park and another in his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 In Guntersville, Ala., the roof was blown off a nursing home. The 25 to 30 
residents were not injured and were taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A tornado that touched down in DeKalb County injured 20 people, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tornadoes were part of an intense springtime storm system that began with 
moist, unstable air off the Gulf of Mexico early Sunday. The air was pushed 
northeast by the jet stream and clashed with low pressure along a cold front. 
</P>
<P>
 In northern Georgia, dozens of injuries were reported. A trailer park was 
destroyed in Pickens County, near the Tennessee line. Seven of the 14 dead in 
Georgia were in Pickens County. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other trailer parks in nearby counties were also hit, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelters were being set up for displaced residents. Don Stephens, a spokesman 
for the American Red Cross, estimated that 200 homes were heavily damaged in 
northern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 A tornado touched down in Charlotte, N.C., with heavy damage reported at a 
housing complex and elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Power outages and structural damage was scattered in northern South Carolina, 
where at least two tornadoes touched down. Two homes were destroyed and at 
least two people injured in Long Creek, S.C., when a tornado hit the ground. 
The injured suffered cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfball-sized hail pelted parts of Alabama and Mississippi, and heavy winds 
caused damage in North Carolina and Mississippi.

CIGARETTE BAN NOT FULL ANSWER, ELDERS DECLARES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cigarettes should be regulated by federal health officials, but banning them 
"would not solve the problem" because millions of Americans already are 
addicted to nicotine, Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders said she supports Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David A. 
Kessler's efforts toward regulating cigarettes as delivery systems for 
nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure they would have to ban them, but I certainly think they would 
have to say cigarettes are addictive, we'd have to tell people that they kill, 
they would need to know the ingredients so they could make a decision about 
it," she said on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of a House health subcommittee, 
said: "The regulations we're going to have to adopt at the congressional level 
will be to have a nicotine-free cigarette or, if it has any nicotine in there, 
a warning label about the addictive qualities of nicotine."

LEACH URGES KEEPING FOCUS IN WHITEWATER; INQUIRY: GOP'S CHIEF CRITIC OF CLINTON 
IN CONTROVERSY SAYS TOO MUCH IS MADE OF WHITE HOUSE AIDES' PHONE CALLS. HE SAYS 
THEIR ANGER WAS 'NATURAL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The leading Republican critic of President Clinton's involvement in the 
Whitewater controversy Sunday said the angry White House reaction to the 
appointment of a partisan Republican to investigate civil cases for the 
Resolution Trust Corp. was "pretty natural" and too much should not be made of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) said it would be "premature to draw any extraordinary 
conclusions" about a phone call senior White House adviser George 
Stephanopoulos made in February to Joshua Steiner, chief of staff at the 
Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have described Stephanopoulos as angrily asking Steiner how the RTC 
came to name former federal prosecutor Jay B. Stephens to investigate possible 
civil cases against Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and whether that hiring 
could be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens, a former Republican U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, was 
sharply critical of Clinton when the President fired him as part of the removal 
of all the U.S. attorneys who were appointed by the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens has also considered running for political office. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hired by the RTC in early February, and among the cases the agency is 
examining for a possible civil action is the Rose Law Firm's representation of 
Madison Guaranty before Arkansas regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton, then a partner at the firm and a partner in the 
Whitewater Land Development Corp. with her then-governor husband and James B. 
McDougal, who owned Madison Guaranty, asserted to the state regulators that the 
thrift was on the road to financial health. 
</P>
<P>
 It later collapsed, requiring a taxpayer bailout of at least $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach, the senior Republican on the House Banking Committee who is leading the 
GOP charge on Whitewater, told NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" on Sunday that the 
Stephanopoulos phone call "may have been a mistake" but he added: "I hope we 
don't make too much of this part of the story." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Leach pressed for a full congressional investigation of the 
relationship between Madison Guaranty and Whitewater Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach has maintained that Whitewater Development and Madison Guaranty were so 
intertwined that the Clintons ended up with financial benefits from the S&L 
even as it was collapsing and their Whitewater project was failing. 
</P>
<P>
 The President maintains that he lost about $46,000 on the Whitewater endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 During the TV interview, Leach adhered to his previous assessment that the 
Whitewater case is not about impeachment and should not be about criminal 
charges against the Clintons. "If there are breaks of the law, it should be 
understood there are civil remedies and criminal remedies," he said, "In this 
case, I would strongly recommend a civil route."

U.S. HEALTH OFFICIALS TO CHECK RESEARCH ON BREAST CANCER STUDY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal health officials plan to audit the research data of a study that found 
a partial mastectomy with radiation just as effective as a full mastectomy in 
treating breast cancer, it was reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors will study all related documents at the University of Pittsburgh, 
which coordinated the study, after the news that some research data had been 
falsified, the New York Times said. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Cancer Institute will also examine the original records at many 
of the 89 U.S. and Canadian hospitals where 1,843 women took part in the 
surgical study that helped change the way breast cancer is treated. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the Federal Office of Research Integrity reported last 
year that Canadian scientist Dr. Roger Poisson of St. Luc's Hospital in 
Montreal falsified data he submitted for the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the cancer institute last week stood by assurances that there is 
no reason to doubt the major conclusions of the Pittsburgh study.

JANET CHANDLER; ACTRESS STARRED IN 1930S FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janet Chandler, a sultry blonde actress of the 1930s who starred in such films 
as "The Three Musketeers" with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and "The Golden West" with 
George O'Brien, has died. She was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Chandler died March 16 at UCLA Medical Center of heart failure after a 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 She began her career as a child and portrayed the young actress Anna Q. 
Nilsson in "Inez of Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Lillian Guenther in Pine Bluffs, Ark., Miss Chandler moved to Los Angeles 
as a child. She attended Harter School for Girls and Orton School for Girls. 
Years later, in 1952, she earned a bachelor's degree in English from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>

DONALD SWANN; HALF OF FLANDERS AND SWANN MUSICAL COMEDY ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald Swann, whose impish demeanor and owl-eyed expressions made him the more 
outgoing half of the jocular team of Flanders and Swann, has died in London. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press on Friday quoted a family spokesman as saying he had died 
Wednesday in a London hospital. Swann was 70 and fighting prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known for their eccentric revues of the 1950s and '60s -- "At the Drop of 
a Hat" and "At the Drop of Another Hat," Michael Flanders and Swann paid homage 
in song and verse to unusual themes. 
</P>
<P>
 A perennial favorite ode was to a hippopotamus: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mud, mud, glorious mud, there's nothing quite like it for cooling the blood." 
</P>
<P>
 They also celebrated wart hogs, the London bus system, the gnu and the 
armadillo. An added touch was that they sang of these non sequiturs in several 
languages, including Greek and Latin. 
</P>
<P>
 Their blend of odd humor and biting satire made them world favorites until 
Flanders' health failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of childhood polio, he used a wheelchair and gave up touring in 1967. 
Flanders died in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Swann had been the bemused pianist of the act, performing the Flanders-Swann 
repertoire with an expression on his face that indicated he might be slightly 
daft. 
</P>
<P>
 The bearded and more subdued Flanders sat at his side in his wheelchair 
offering up jokes that Swann found more hilarious than they sometimes were. 
Many times Swann was the object of Flanders' derision. 
</P>
<P>
 Swann was born in Wales, but was half-Russian and grew up speaking the 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 He performed in theatrical revues at Christ Church College, Oxford. A 
conscientious objector, he returned to Oxford after World War II where he 
performed refugee relief work in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 There he teamed with Flanders, the lyricist for the two. 
</P>

 VIRGINIA REELING: With Republicans aiming to retake the Senate in this fall's 
elections, no battleground is more turbulent than Virginia, where each party's 
front-runner is in hot water -- and being scalded by cartoonists and TV 
comedians. Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) has admitted to behavior "inappropriate 
for a married man," and his GOP challenger, Iran-Contra figure Oliver L. North, 
has been denounced by his ex-boss, former President Ronald Reagan, for lying. . 
. . Fearful that the GOP will nominate North instead of former Reagan 
Administration Budget Director James Miller, Republican business executives and 
party leaders are planning to field an independent candidate who would have the 
backing of North's arch-critic, Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.). That could open 
the door to former Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder to run as an independent, 
drawing from a base of blacks and white liberals. . . . Wilder, who with 
conservative state Sen. Virgil Goode may also challenge Robb in the Democratic 
primary, complains that North and Robb are "the laughingstock of the country."

 BOOKING THE HIGH ROAD: In a political age that has plunged most office-seekers 
into the politics of negativism, Republican presidential prospect William J. 
Bennett is taking a loftier road -- and cashing in. His $27.50 hardback, "Book 
of Virtues," is high on the best-seller list, with sales already topping 
three-quarters of a million copies. "There's not," the author says proudly, "a 
nasty or salacious word in it." . . . White House aide David Gergen favorably 
reviewed the book in a session with reporters, saying that even "good 
Democrats" are reading its stories on moral values to their children.

 MOLE PATROL: When the CIA opened its doors and some of its archives to Cold 
War scholars at a recent conference, the focus was on the agency's early years 
during the Harry S. Truman presidency. But it was probably inevitable that the 
subject of the agency's alleged turncoat spy, Aldrich H. Ames, would come up. . 
. . Russian historian Vladimir Pozniakov wanted to know whether the agency had 
been plagued by a similar mole-like spy during the Truman era. "You'll have to 
tell me that," retorted CIA historian Mary McAuliffe. . . . Pozniakov later 
told a reporter that his own search of Communist Party records had yielded "no 
trace" of Soviet penetration during that period, or any sign that the United 
States had burrowed a mole in Soviet intelligence operations. But he cautioned 
that his search was limited: "We still have no access to former KGB archives."

 NO CIGAR: Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) strongly opposes any tax 
increase, except one on tobacco because of its cancer costs. So why was the 
pin-striped senatorial candidate pictured in the New York Times greeting 
pro-tobacco forces on the steps of the Capitol, where they were lobbying 
against just such a tax hike? "Just being friendly," a spokesman said, 
explaining that Huffington was merely on his way to vote -- and still favors 
boosting tobacco taxes.

 OUT OF ORDER: After House Rules Committee Chairman Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) 
called his seatmate, Rep. Butler Derrick (D-S.C.), "Mr. Butler" for the 
umpteenth time, Derrick joined in the laughter and noted Moakley's persistence: 
"After 17 years!" PAUL HOUSTON and ROBERT SHOGAN

STREET SMART: SIGNS POSTED ON PCH NEAR ARCHES ARE ADEQUATE, CALTRANS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The widening of Pacific Coast Highway from the Arches Bridge (Newport 
Boulevard West) included a much needed signal at the Balboa Coves / Lower Hoag 
Hospital entrance. Now cars leaving or entering on the north or south side of 
this intersection have the assistance of a signal. However, it has created two 
traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 First, over 95% of the westbound cars using the left-turn lane into the Balboa 
Coves entrance actually make a U-turn to go east and up the ramp to get on 
Newport Boulevard heading for the peninsula. The intended way to reach the 
peninsula heading west on Pacific Coast Highway is to make a right turn just 
beyond the Arches overpass, reaching a signal at Newport Boulevard, allowing 
them to turn right on Newport Boulevard. However, the highway signs on Pacific 
Coast Highway are not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 If the vehicles are not in the extreme right lane as they proceed under the 
underpass, they miss the right turn and continue west on Pacific Coast Highway. 
Then, to reach the peninsula, they must make a U-turn to reach the Newport 
Boulevard ramp on the south side of Pacific Coast Highway.  
</P>
<P>
 More prominent signs, plus a sign on the east face of the Arches overpass 
indicating a right turn to reach the peninsula on Newport Boulevard, would 
improve this situation.  
</P>
<P>
 The secondary problem is the sign on Newport Boulevard going south directing 
the traffic to the right lane for Highway 1 (Pacific Coast Highway) to Long 
Beach and San Diego. Traffic wishing to go east to San Diego (Corona del Mar, 
Laguna Beach, etc.) that stays in the right lane of the off-ramp cannot turn 
left, and again, uses the left-turn signal at Balboa Coves to make a U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Both situations could be corrected by providing signs that direct vehicles to 
the proper lane in sufficient time for drivers to reach that lane and make the 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack F. King 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by Caltrans traffic engineers reached these conclusions.  
</P>
<P>
 First, for drivers going west on Pacific Coast Highway heading for the 
peninsula, investigators found that the posted signs were adequate considering 
the limited space available between the Arches and the southbound on-ramp 
leading to Balboa Peninsula, said Rose Orem, spokeswoman for Caltrans. Too many 
signs can confuse drivers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, for those exiting from Newport Boulevard to Pacific Coast Highway, a 
sign and painted arrows on the three-lane exit help direct motorists, Orem 
said. The left and center lanes are striped for left turns only (to San Diego) 
and the right lane is for right turns only (to Long Beach). 
</P>

 The Orange County Transportation Authority board of directors will conduct a 
public hearing at 9 a.m. today to consider the Orange County component of the 
Regional Transportation Improvement Program. The hearing will be held at the 
Hall of Administration, 10 Civic Center Drive, Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-year program of improvements for highways, transit and local streets 
and roads includes about 600 Orange County projects totaling more than $8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 It will later become part of the State Transportation Improvement Plan. Most 
of the funding for projects in the regional and state plans come from state and 
federal gas taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 All comments received during the public hearing or that are received in 
writing by the authority will be submitted to the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments for incorporation into the final report. SCAG regional council will 
hold a public hearing on the entire report in May.

 Ten call boxes recently were installed along Laguna Canyon Road, giving 
drivers emergency access to a California Highway Patrol or local police 
department dispatcher. The boxes are part of a network of more than 1,200 call 
boxes on every freeway in the county, Santiago Canyon Road, Ortega Highway and 
Carbon Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's call boxes were first installed in 1986 and are used about 400 
times a day. They are financed by a $1 assessment on vehicle registrations 
within the county.

2 STUDENTS SHOT DURING CARJACKING DIE; VIOLENCE: PARENTS OF THE TWO TEEN-AGERS 
ARRIVE FROM JAPAN AND TALK OF THEIR SONS' LOVE FOR AMERICA. VICTIMS' CAR IS 
FOUND NEAR THE SHOOTING SITE.

 Two teen-age college students from Japan who came to the United States to 
pursue their dreams of becoming filmmakers, only to be gunned down in a 
carjacking, died after being taken off life support systems Sunday, the day 
their parents arrived from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, both 19, died Sunday evening, said Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center spokesman Randy Foster. Both had been declared brain-dead after 
being shot in the back of the head in a carjacking in the parking lot of a San 
Pedro supermarket Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Also late Sunday, Los Angeles police said they had found the compact car that 
was stolen from the pair after they were shot. An anonymous caller alerted 
police, who found the white 1994 Honda Civic in the San Pedro area where the 
students were shot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car was taken Downtown to be tested for fingerprints and other evidence, 
an LAPD spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo early today, U.S. Ambassador Walter Mondale issued a statement on 
behalf of the President, extending condolences to the families and stressing 
that such crimes do not represent everyday American life. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles on Sunday, the families expressed no bitterness, saying they 
were grateful for the good experiences their sons had had here. "He loved 
America," Akihiro Ito said. On Sunday, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center was crowded 
with Japanese camera crews and reporters, who were covering the shooting as a 
top story -- one that followed on the heels of several other high-profile 
shootings of Japanese students in the United States. The shootings have raised 
the fears of many Japanese parents about sending their children abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Tokyo, Mondale said: "This is the saddest day in my 
time here as ambassador." He said he hoped that the Los Angeles shootings would 
not diminish the desire of Japanese to travel to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are over 3 million Japanese who travel to the United States each year, 
many of them tourists, and we have over 50,000 young Japanese studying in 
schools. . . . Practically every one of them has a wonderful experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "These tragedies -- such as this one over the weekend in Los Angeles and the 
killing of (Hattori) in Louisiana -- they are just tragic from every 
standpoint. They give an entirely distorted picture of life in the United 
States. Most everyone lives a safe and fulfilling life . . . and are untouched 
by such horrible criminal behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale noted that President Clinton had telephoned the parents of Yoshihiro 
Hattori, a Japanese high school student shot to death in Louisiana in 1992, and 
had received the Hattoris at the White House. Mondale said he was sure that the 
President would contact the families of the carjacking victims. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference were a group of officials and students from the Baton 
Rouge high school where Hattori had studied. The group had planned the trip to 
express their sorrow to the Hattori family. "We want the Japanese people to 
know that overall, the American people are a good people and that all of us 
aren't violent and prone to kill," Principal Clarence Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Harbor-UCLA, the students' Marymount College friends, both Japanese and 
American, had kept a vigil during the weekend. The Japanese students gathered 
quietly and told reporters they preferred to keep their grief private. Many 
American students wanted to express anger at the violence, and spoke with 
fondness of the two young men they described as fun-loving and dedicated to 
becoming filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 After improving their English at Marymount, Ito hoped to go to UCLA and 
Matsuura to USC to pursue their filmmaking studies, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Ito's) hobby was becoming American," said fellow student Erica Stenta. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Escandon, Ito's roommate, said the Japanese student was a fan of Steven 
Spielberg's work, especially his "Indiana Jones" movies. "He was a great guy. 
He had a wonderful personality. He was very, very funny," Escandon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuura's roommate, Clayton Blocker, said he and Matsuura hit it off right 
away when they were assigned to share an apartment last fall. "I didn't think 
it was his time to go. I don't think he deserved to die," Blocker said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ito and Matsuura's parents flew here to be at their sons' bedsides and to make 
the decision about terminating life support. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Curtis Doberstein, acting chief resident in neurosurgery at Harbor-UCLA, 
said both were shot at close range. The bullets did not exit their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The fathers of the victims, speaking at a news conference at the hospital, 
struggled to convey happy memories of their sons' dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Akihiro Ito, an executive with a subsidiary of Japan Air Lines, said in 
Japanese that his son had told him since junior high school that "I like 
America. I want to go to America. I want to make movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said that before his son came here, he was "a little worried," but what 
happened was "my child's fate." 
</P>
<P>
 "For eight months, he had an enjoyable, enjoyable experience in America. Now, 
we must make an effort that this kind of sad event won't happen to Japanese 
young people again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Go Matsuura was born in the United States and was in first grade when he went 
to Japan with his family, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought America was a place where you could realize your dreams. So he 
came to America," Shuji Matsuura said. "He was always saying he liked it here. 
We were glad.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then this happened. It's too bad that his dream was broken in the America my 
son loved." 
</P>
<P>
 His eyes downcast, Matsuura asked in Japanese: "Isn't there something we can 
all do so that this doesn't happen again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Spring break had emptied much of the campus of Marymount College in Rancho 
Palos Verdes, where flags remained at half-staff on the picturesque grounds set 
high above the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a spot where no one even thinks of crime at all because it's not a 
problem," said Kevin O'Connor, assistant director of admissions. "This is a 
shock to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ralphs supermarket on Western Avenue in San Pedro, where the shootings 
occurred about 11 p.m. Friday, several bouquets of flowers had been laid in the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 With no suspects, Los Angeles police have appealed to the public for help in 
finding the gunman or gunmen. Detectives with the robbery-homicide unit of 
LAPD's Major Crimes Section can be reached at (213) 485-2129 or (213) 485-2504. 
</P>
<P>
 American friends of the two young men said that this episode made them realize 
just how dangerous Los Angeles has become -- and how the danger is taken for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to put something in your article," Stenta insisted. "We have to 
stop accepting this as a normal, everyday part of life. Everybody has to stop 
it -- don't allow it. It can't go on like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why doesn't Japan have problems like this? They don't have guns on the 
street. We've got to have stronger laws or we're going to kill each other off." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Jeffrey Rabin and Ann W. O'Neill in Los Angeles and Sam 
Jameson in Tokyo contributed to this story.

STREET SMART / BOB POOL: NO REST FOR WEARY WHO LIVE NEAR FREEWAY REBUILDING

 Nobody would do anything about the noise outside. Until they started making 
noise from the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way Vicki McGee feels these days about life in the fast lane -- the 
frenetic Santa Monica Freeway earthquake repair zone. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee is one of hundreds of Westside residents who live a few steps from where 
platoons of construction workers are racing to rebuild a pair of collapsed 
freeway bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two months their lives have been punctuated by the 
pound-pound-pound of pile drivers, the clink-clink-clink of concrete chippers, 
the beep-beep-beep alarms of trucks and skip-loaders backing up. 
</P>
<P>
 The spongy former swampland that their neighborhood is built upon -- the kind 
of geology that probably caused the freeway spans to bounce loose and fall -- 
vibrates when heavy equipment rumbles past. 
</P>
<P>
 Darkness becomes day when huge floodlights used by the construction night 
shift crew shine into their homes. Workers on scaffolding shout to each other. 
Dust from the trucks and the demolished concrete pavement and pillars is 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's miserable," said McGee, an administrative assistant at UCLA who has 
lived 11 years on David Avenue, about 100 feet from the freeway. "Nobody can 
sleep -- you get so tired that you doze off at stoplights when you're driving." 
</P>
<P>
 On nearby Chariton Street, Al Aguilera stands outside the auto repair shop 
behind his home. He wears a weary look. No wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sound goes clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk," he said. "It goes on all night. 
And the lights drive me crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, Aguilera's Spanish-style home burned down a few hours 
after the Jan. 17 earthquake. To keep thieves from looting his garage behind 
the ruins, Aguilera moved into a house next door and has been afraid to leave 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 A block to the east on Cadillac Avenue, Myrtle Hamilton is planning to leave 
-- away from freeways and earthquakes. She is headed for Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been no rest from January to now," Hamilton said. "You manage to 
blank out the noise and finally get to sleep, and at 3 in the morning a 
different noise wakes you up. I've tried earplugs, but they don't work. When I 
get out of here I'll probably sleep for a week." 
</P>
<P>
 On the south side of the freeway, Ena Guadron can see the construction from 
the door of her Dauphin Avenue duplex. She can feel it from inside the house 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, my children feel the shaking when the machines go by and think 
it's another aftershock," said the mother of three. "They get very frightened." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans says it has heard the residents loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
 When the freeway neighbors grumbled that they could not sleep, the agency 
contracted with three Culver City hotels to offer them free rooms. So far, said 
Jerry Baxter, regional director for Caltrans, officials have paid for 1,600 
"room nights." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who did not want to move to a hotel, the agency installed 
30-foot-high temporary sound walls to muffle the noise. When families with 
children complained that hotels were difficult and the walls were not enough, 
Caltrans arranged to move them into two-bedroom units with kitchens at the 
nearby Oakwood Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 A temporary bypass road was built for apartment dwellers on David Avenue, 
which has been taken over by construction trucks. Guards were brought in to 
watch over apartment units that have been vacated by those moving into hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 When some residents reported feeling stressed out at work because of the 
disruptions, free counseling was arranged at a mental health center. When some 
reported that the dust was making them ill, officials set out to find a mobile 
health clinic to visit the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has also arranged for an ombudsman to work with residents. She is 
Lois Hill Hale, and her staff attends construction meetings daily and issues 
periodic updates to residents about the project's progress and traffic 
rerouting. The reports are hand-delivered to 200 nearby homes and apartment 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 Maps have been given to residents to show them the quickest way in and out of 
their neighborhoods. Special ID placards have been issued to allow residents 
past street barricades. A hot line (800-306-HELP) has been set up to take 
residents' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said his agency will have spent up to $500,000 helping the freeway's 
neighbors by the time the $21-million rebuilding project ends. This month, 
officials said they would reopen the freeway in May, a month ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an unusual situation we've never had before," Baxter said. 
"Government doesn't have the right to adversely affect people if it can be 
avoided." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's response to the earthquake has not fallen on deaf ears, even in 
the Santa Monica Freeway repair zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents say they are impressed by copies of internal memos they have 
been given that indicate noise complaints are being taken seriously. They show 
that the contractor has ordered workers to knock off the yelling, loud music 
and the gunning of their cars' engines during shift changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caltrans has been very, very nice," said apartment building owner Steven 
Stewart, who admits to initially being worried that his 16 tenants would be 
driven out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Caltrans has done everything it can to help. They put in the new 
road, they got the trash people to get in here and keep the place clean. They 
put in new street lights. They put in the sound wall. They've given us 24-hour 
security. They've sent anyone who wanted to go to hotels. They've done 
everything except give pure cash to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Chariton Street apartment renter Jaime Bitong said things have quieted down 
significantly since the first few weeks of the project. He said the nighttime 
construction is probably worth the headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want them to get the work done," Bitong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orville Swanston, who has lived on the street for 17 years, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 "The noise is a problem. But without the freeway, you're doomed. So we're all 
in this together."

LACK OF EMF TESTING PROGRAM IN SCHOOLS RAISES CONCERNS; HEALTH: PARENT'S 
REQUEST LED TO DETECTION OF HIGH LEVELS IN SHERMAN OAKS CLASSROOM. DISTRICT 
OFFICIALS SAY SIMILAR SITUATIONS COULD EXIST ON UP TO 100 CAMPUSES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent discovery of high electromagnetic fields in a Sherman Oaks 
kindergarten classroom exposed the lack of a concerted program to detect EMF 
hot spots in city schools. 
</P>
<P>
 EMF measurements were taken at Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary School because 
of a parent's concern about the placement of an electric transformer, not due 
to the vigilance of school authorities. As the episode revealed, testing for 
elevated EMFs usually is limited to schools with worried parents or staff. 
</P>
<P>
 EMFs have been linked by some studies to a small increased risk of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 This passive approach -- which one critic called a "squeaky wheel" policy -- 
has not produced much information about EMF levels in local schools. Only nine 
of more than 600 schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District have had 
EMF measurements, district records show. 
</P>
<P>
 More testing is likely after the Dixie Canyon flap, which involved a 
transformer installed inches from the exterior wall of a bungalow classroom. 
After a parent voiced concern, district safety officials sought measurements by 
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which obtained a high reading of 
107 milligauss at the teacher's desk. Typical readings in homes and offices are 
less than 2 milligauss. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents were particularly upset because the district installed the transformer 
in 1991 -- long after the EMF controversy surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Fried, the parent who raised the issue, said he was incensed that the 
district "put it (the transformer) seven inches away from the children." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, who have decided to relocate the transformer at a cost of 
about $100,000, say similar situations could exist on up to 100 campuses where 
transformers have been added since 1989 to serve portable classrooms and new 
air-conditioning systems. Rather than install the transformers as far as 
possible from classrooms, officials said they typically put them nearby to save 
money and space. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education since 1988 has required minimum setbacks 
from power lines for new schools and portable classrooms, but the standard does 
not mention other electrical installations. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Doi of the district's environmental health and safety branch said the 
risk of transformers creating higher EMF exposures "didn't register. . . . The 
focus with EMFs . . . was always with the power transmission lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Electric and magnetic fields are invisible lines of force that radiate outward 
from every electrical device, penetrating nearly everything around them -- 
including the human body. If EMFs are dangerous, distance is the best defense 
because their strength falls rapidly with distance from the source. 
</P>
<P>
 Several studies have found a small increased risk of cancer in children living 
near high-current power lines, and other EMF research has found elevated cancer 
rates among workers whose jobs bring them into close contact with electrical 
equipment, such as utility linemen and film projectionists. A smaller number of 
studies found no connection between EMFs and cancer, and experts generally say 
a causal link has not been proven. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that a definitive conclusion may be years away, some authorities 
-- including state health officials -- have called for voluntary adoption of 
no-cost and low-cost means to reduce exposures, in case EMFs are proven to be 
harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 Such "prudent avoidance" measures, as they are sometimes called, can be as 
simple as fencing off part of a playground or moving workstations farther from 
a source of EMFs. 
</P>
<P>
 But taking such precautions means knowing where elevated fields exist. And in 
Los Angeles and many other areas, this data exists for a mere handful of 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 As a free service to customers, a number of utilities, including the DWP and 
Southern California Edison Co., take EMF readings in homes, offices and schools 
by request. Although the DWP has surveyed nearly 600 homes and offices during 
the past two years, it has only been asked to test nine schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Edison, the nation's second-largest utility, has measured nearly 
3,900 sites during the past two years, fewer than 100 have been schools, said 
Mark Judy, manager of Edison's EMF education center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many experts believe there are compelling reasons why such testing should 
be focused on schools. For one thing, some schools were built near power lines 
or other electric installations to take advantage of cheaper land costs. By 
bringing large numbers of children and adults together in one place, schools 
concentrate any risks that may exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools have a special status, because they're public institutions to which 
people entrust their kids," said Dr. Raymond R. Neutra of the state Department 
of Health Services, the state's point man on the EMF issue. 
</P>
<P>
 State health and education officials say a mandate to test all schools is 
unlikely anytime soon -- particularly because there is no consensus on what EMF 
levels would be cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing "will probably continue to be on a public response mode, instead of a 
blanket 'everybody must do it,' " said Duwayne Brooks, an assistant 
superintendent of the state Department of Education and member of a state task 
force on EMF in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are veterans of emotionally charged health scares involving 
asbestos, lead and radon, school safety officials say they are floundering for 
lack of standards on EMF exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Several testing initiatives are expected in the coming months. In response to 
the Dixie Canyon episode, district officials said they will review building 
plans to pinpoint campuses where transformers near classrooms may be causing 
heightened exposures. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate study, DWP officials are planning to take EMF measurements at 41 
schools that are near transmission lines and substations -- although the 
readings will be confined to school property lines.

TEEN COUNSELORS HELP FIGHT SEXUAL MYTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The calls to a local teen hot line would be almost funny, if they weren't so 
pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Birth control pills will make you sterile. Only homosexuals can get AIDS. You 
can't get pregnant the first time you have sex. And this from the sexually 
experienced kids. 
</P>
<P>
 How do they know? Because other kids told them so. 
</P>
<P>
 To help fight such myths and reduce teen-age pregnancies, the state has turned 
to an unlikely weapon: other teens. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-year-old North Hollywood program is one of only a handful statewide to 
use the teen-to-teen approach. If it succeeds, the state plans to encourage 
other family planning clinics to copy it, potentially reducing the millions of 
tax dollars that are spent annually in health and welfare benefits for teen-age 
mothers and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in gray lab coats and sneakers, the teens are based at Valley Community 
Clinic on Vineland Avenue, where they help girls and boys ages 12 to 19 through 
the often-daunting process of obtaining contraceptives and tests for sexually 
transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Their other mission is to hang out with friends and informally impart accurate 
information when the subject of sex comes up, as it often does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be embarrassed to talk about condoms, but now I'll just grab a 
banana or cucumber and show my friends how to put one on right," said teen 
counselor Claudia Gutierrez, 17. "They didn't even know how to open a condom 
package right until I showed them" not to use their teeth to tear open the 
package, which could damage the contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Such matter-of-fact demonstrations -- both in and out of the clinic -- appear 
to be paying off. Halfway through the four-year pilot project, experts are 
giving it high marks for attracting adolescents. Teen-agers visited the clinic 
930 times last year, more than twice as often as before the program began. None 
have become pregnant, clinic officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the MTV in the lobby, or the personal recommendations from peers 
that account for the program's popularity. The clinic relies only on 
word-of-mouth, not advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can talk to us, just like a friend," said Rhonda Perez, 17, a teen 
counselor who became a teen-age mother about 18 months ago. "I tell them it's 
hard to be a teen mom and they don't have to be one if they don't want to." 
</P>
<P>
 California's birth rate among teen-age mothers recently decreased slightly for 
the first time in nine years. But there were still about 71 births per 1,000 
girls in 1992, the last year for which figures are available. Each birth can 
cost taxpayers $2,500 in medical costs and $3,100 a year in ongoing welfare 
benefits, according to the state office of family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood program is funded by a $100,000 annual grant from the 
state agency, which also spends $5 million a year on programs to encourage 
teen-age abstinence. The teen clinic is one of five projects aimed at comparing 
the effectiveness of the teen-to-teen approach with "teen-friendly" clinics, 
which are staffed by adults with special training. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is still out on which works better, but a researcher hired to 
evaluate the programs said there is room for both approaches. The teen-to-teen 
approach may work best in areas such as the east San Fernando Valley because 
low-income teen-agers tend to rely more on their peers for information about 
sexual matters, said the researcher, Claire Brindis, director of the Center for 
Reproductive Health Policy Research at UC San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the clinic may provide free or low-cost pregnancy-related 
services to youngsters age 12 or older without obtaining permission from their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't sit well with some parents. One father, who found out last year 
that his daughter was getting contraceptives, stormed the clinic in a rage and 
had to be forcibly removed by eight police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought he had a gun," said Connie L. Kruzan, the teen clinic's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, the program has been trouble-free. But, as any parent knows, 
managing anything involving teen-agers can be a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest risk, Kruzan said, is that the teen counselors, most of whom 
attend nearby North Hollywood High School, will gossip about the secrets 
they've learned: the sexually transmitted diseases fellow students have 
contracted or their choice of sex partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Violating a client's right to confidentiality is grounds for immediate 
dismissal, and none of the 16 teen-agers who have worked at the clinic has ever 
been caught breaking a confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen clinic is officially open on Monday evenings and Saturdays, but the 
hours are actually flexible because 40% of the clients routinely fail to show 
up for their appointments. On a recent rainy Saturday, only two out of more 
than 10 clients who scheduled visits had shown up by midafternoon. Pop singer 
Toni Braxton's video "Breathe Again" on MTV went unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had a choice between a pelvic exam and going to the mall, which would 
you do?" Kruzan asked rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
 Bored by the low turnout, some of the four teen-age counselors -- who earn $7 
an hour -- began calling clients and gently urged them to come in. "This is 
Barbara," one teen counselor says, using a previously agreed upon pseudonym to 
identify herself to one girl's mother. "Please leave a message that I called." 
</P>
<P>
 Two clients finally show up, one to be retested for a sexually transmitted 
disease and the other to obtain contraceptives after the recent birth of her 
second child. The girls claim to know the proper use of a condom, but teen 
counselor Alyssa Grigoryan, 18, shows them anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to get personal: Are you using birth control?" she asked the 
18-year-old teen-age mother, there on her first visit. "Not using anything," 
the mother said, an answer that the counselors say they are accustomed to 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make me feel comfortable here," the teen-age mom said after deciding to 
return for Norplant, a contraceptive that is implanted beneath the skin and 
releases synthetic hormones gradually to prevent pregnancies for up to five 
years. "I kind of wish I had known about this place before."

FOR COWBOY POETS, THE BIG ROUNDUP; ENTERTAINMENT: TENDERFOOTS CONVERGE FOR A 
FESTIVAL OF VERSE, MUSIC AND FILM. PERFORMERS NOTE A NEW UPSURGE IN INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At a glance it was near impossible to tell the cowpokes from the computer 
nerds who showed up Sunday for Santa Clarita's Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanna-bes in denim, pointy boots and wide-brim hats filled the dirt streets of 
the Melody Ranch, a Western movie lot hired for the three-day festival that 
drew more than 3,000 visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think anyplace in the Los Angeles area could be as perfect as this?" 
asked cowboy poet Waddie Mitchell to a sound studio filled with cheering fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival was moved to the set at the last minute, after the Northridge 
earthquake damaged a high school gym where it was to have been held. The city 
has applied for federal funds to pay for the estimated $13,000 in increased 
costs to rent the movie lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Out on Main Street, the saloon's bartenders were pouring drinks, deputies on 
horseback were keeping an eye out, and Bub Warren was ready to fix you up with 
a new saddle. Even the tumbleweeds were tacked down in all the right places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you what, cowboy stuff is hot," said Warren, who brought his saddles 
to sell at the festival from Bend, Ore. They ranged in price from the standard 
$3,000 model to a leather, silver and gem-encrusted $50,000 beauty housed in a 
glass case. 
</P>
<P>
 After 25 years at his craft, Warren has noticed a sudden surge of popular 
interest in all things cowboy. Festival organizers agree, saying popularity has 
grown since a similar festival started in Elko, Nev., seven years ago. Even 
National Public Radio jumped on the bandwagon with its regular airing of cowboy 
poet Baxter Black. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike, say, the work of Ezra Pound, part of the draw of cowboy poetry is its 
literalness. The verse tells stories about work and nature and courage, with 
melancholy or humor -- and, like rap lyrics, it flaunts a slew of double 
negatives in iambic pentameter. 
</P>
<P>
 And the sold-out audience for Sunday's 2 p.m. performance loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you won't find much cow dung on those $300 boots everyone seemed to 
be parading around the movie lot in. It seems that cowboys and urban hipsters 
have at least this in common: They are far outnumbered by their imitators. 
</P>
<P>
 Said leather craftsman Warren: "Seems I'm building more saddles for interior 
decorators than buckaroos." 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, not that he minds. He just sold a $6,000 saddle to an orthodontist for 
his office. "The goal of many of us is to provide gear that is functional for 
working buckaroos," said Vickie Mullen, who organized the festival's 30 or so 
vendors and specializes in horsehair products such as rope and belts. "But I 
don't mind if somebody puts it on their wall." 
</P>
<P>
 One decorator item might be the $700 hitched rope she has on display. Like all 
of her products, and much of the cowboy Americana being sold these days, the 
horsehair comes from China. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino attorney Marshall Oldman says he loves this stuff. His hat says, 
"Cowboy lawyer," the name of a group of about 150 California barristers who 
organize four to five horse rides a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had an interest in the Old West," said the 42-year-old Agoura 
resident, who owns a ranch east of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowboys -- unlike other American laborers -- have enjoyed a worldwide 
reputation for romantic adventures that were told first in early 20th-Century 
dime-store novels and then in movies. The recent rekindling of interest in this 
country is part of a cycle that cowboy singer Don Edwards has seen over the 
past 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last time around, it was the film "Urban Cowboy" that was the spur. "Ugh, that 
was disco-country music," said Edwards, a sweet-voiced balladeer. 
</P>
<P>
 He has recently teamed with poet Mitchell for shows, and the pair figure that 
they are on the road between 200 and 300 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got back from Rome, Italy, where there were 3,000 people in the 
streets listening to cowboy music," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 They and other professionals say the growing interest in cowboy music and 
poetry -- "This is not country-and-Western," insists Edwards -- comes from a 
generation of Americans who long for simpler times and traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband is an engineer during the week and a cowboy on weekends," said 
Priscilla Nielsen, a festival volunteer. "We and a lot of other people identify 
with the ideas that good is good and bad is bad. I think it is a sense of 
integrity that draws people to the cowboy movement." 
</P>
<P>
 The performers, most of whom once worked as cowboys, say they don't mind that 
fans at this and other festivals mostly just dress the part -- many of them 
even are -- whoa, pardner! -- property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 But as any real cowboy will tell you, that automatically excludes you from 
their gang, even if you deal in cattle instead of computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're yours, then you're a rancher, not a cowboy," said cowboy poet and 
Hidden Valley resident Gary Roberts. "I still chase other people's cows."

 For six weeks, the fourth-graders at Pomelo Drive Elementary School weren't 
able to escape whales. 
</P>
<P>
 They learned about them in science class, wrote poems about them for English 
and created multiplication and division problems using the creature's weight. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, armed with binoculars, cameras and an assortment of packed lunches, 
122 students, their teachers and 13 parents set sail from Cabrillo Marina in 
San Pedro to meet the object of their lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Their focus: The Pacific gray whale, which migrates from Baja California every 
winter and returns to the Mexican coast in early spring traveling nearly 12,000 
miles round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is fun . . . (but) all I'm seeing is water," said a disappointed Robert 
Vanlingen after about an hour of watching and waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles out at sea, under overcast skies, the students aboard the Monte Carlo 
and Islander spotted the first signs of the whales -- a "footprint" in the 
water. A whale traveling under water leaves what are known as footprints, when 
the vertical flapping motion of its tail causes the water to smooth out. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiting was over at noon, when a gray whale's fluke glided upward out of 
the ocean. "Free Willy, free Willy," the students yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameras clicked and students jockeyed for the choice spots to view the gray 
whales. For others, the excitement quickly wore off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of hard to get a picture when everyone's like crowded around," said 
Liska Jacobs, 10. "I just wish they'd start breaching. I want to see how big 
the whale really is." 
</P>
<P>
 Liska and the entire crew got their wish when one of the two gray whales that 
had been entertaining them leaped into the air and fell backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whales don't breach often when they're migrating," a tour guide said over a 
loudspeaker. "It's been a good two years since I've seen that." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one hat flew overboard, and though several students complained of feeling 
nauseous, no one became seasick and many were eager to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm going to come back 10 times," Steven Willet proclaimed. TERESA

<P>
 For more than a century, the mighty transcontinental railroads that helped 
build the West have been a mighty force in Los Angeles politics. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1886, they were bringing a thousand people a month into Los Angeles, 
transforming it into a modern megalopolis. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, the railroads fell victim to the trucking industry as well 
as the autos and airplanes that became the preferred mode of transportation for 
most people. Private railroads left the passenger business in 1971, turning it 
over to Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first station opened in 1869, 195 railroad companies have 
incorporated in the county. Some were only railroads on paper and others were 
quickly swallowed up by the bigger ones. Here is a short history. 1. SALT LAKE 
RAILROAD/ UNION PACIFIC 
</P>
<P>
 General Phineas Banning helped to build the Los Angeles & San Pedro Railroad, 
the city's first means of rail transportation, in 1869. Banning's railroad and 
its station at Alameda and Commercial streets were eventually handed over to 
Southern Pacific to entice the Great Iron Horse into Los Angeles. For about 10 
years around the turn of the century, Southern Pacific and Union Pacific 
operated as one railroad. A fire destroyed the Downtown station in 1924, 
sending the Union Pacific's trains to the Southern Pacific's Central Station at 
5th Street and Central Avenue. 2. CENTRAL PACIFIC/ SOUTHERN PACIFIC 
</P>
<P>
 For the San Francisco-based Southern Pacific -- nicknamed the "Espee" -- it 
all began in 1856, when civil engineer Theodore D. Judah built the 23-mile 
Sacramento Valley Railroad, the first steam railroad in the Far West. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by merchants who became known as the Big Four, Judah started the 
Central Pacific. Back then, Leland Stanford was a grocer, Charles Crocker owned 
a dry-goods store and Mark Hopkins and Collis P. Huntington were partners in a 
hardware business.  
</P>
<P>
 The railroad broke ground for the western end of the transcontinental line in 
January, 1863. Hoping to expand quickly, in 1865 the Central Pacific bought the 
Southern Pacific, a small company with intentions of building a railroad from 
San Francisco to San Diego. The Big Four soon decided they liked the Southern 
Pacific name better. 
</P>
<P>
 It hooked up with the Union Pacific on May 10, 1869, at Promontory Point, 
Utah, where Stanford drove the fabled golden spike. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1872, with Los Angeles developing a reputation as a capital of lawlessness, 
the Southern Pacific was threatening to build its main line from San Francisco 
through the Cajon Pass, north of Los Angeles, toward San Bernardino instead of 
into Los Angeles, bypassing the town -- and perhaps dooming it. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific demanded $600,000 from the city in return for coming here, 
plus control of the Los Angeles & San Pedro Railroad, the city's outlet to the 
sea. After a hard-fought battle, railroad backers won a special election that 
financed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4,000 Chinese laborers shoveled and blasted their way over and 
through the mountains toward the young city. Two crews worked on the San 
Fernando Tunnel, just south of Newhall, boring a 7,000-foot hole through more 
than a mile of solid rock at a cost of more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 5, 1876, the railroad line linking Los Angeles and San Francisco was 
completed, with the driving of another golden spike into a railway tie as a 
thousand spectators and laborers gathered at the now-vanished community of Lang 
in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Pacific operated out of three terminals before moving to Union 
Station in 1939: River Station in what is now Chinatown, the Arcade Depot at 
5th Street and Central Avenue and the nearby elaborate Central Station. 3. 
SANTA FE RAILWAY 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Fe Railway was founded in 1859 by Cyrus K. Holliday as the Atchison 
& Topeka, but because of the upheaval of the Civil War and other problems, the 
company laid no track until 1868, by which timed it had added Santa Fe to its 
name. Holliday's ambition was to build a railroad that followed the old Santa 
Fe Trail, which had guided many a wagon train West. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1880s, the Santa Fe battled with the Southern Pacific to gain a 
foothold in the West. Men working the two railroads reportedly faced off with 
rifles more than once. The Southern Pacific paid the Santa Fe $500,000 a year 
to make San Bernardino its terminal point instead of Los Angeles. In 1885, 
however, the agreement fell apart and the Santa Fe finally completed its first 
through route by buying a local railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 A bitter fare war between the two railroads began, helping bring thousands of 
settlers -- who bought tickets from Kansas City to Los Angeles for a mere $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe's La Grande Station opened on July 29, 1893, at 2nd Street and Santa 
Fe Avenue. The Moorish-style depot cost $50,000 and for 30 years boasted a 
first-class restaurant, the Harvey House. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Garland immortalized the Santa Fe in the MGM movie "The Harvey Girls," 
singing, "Do yuh hear that whistle down the line? I figure that it's engine No. 
49. She's the only one that'll sound that way. On the Atchison, Topeka and the 
Santa Fe." 
</P>
<P>
 The station's mosque-like domes were removed in 1933 after being damaged in 
the Long Beach earthquake. The depot closed in 1939 and was razed in 1946. 4. 
UNION STATION 
</P>
<P>
 Named for the uniting of three railroad lines -- the Santa Fe, Union Pacific 
and Southern Pacific -- the station was almost a relic from the day it opened 
in 1939. Although it had been conceived two decades earlier, a bitter struggle 
between Los Angeles city officials and the railroad commission over the 
proposed station postponed construction for years. 
</P>
<P>
 As Los Angeles builds for the 21st Century, Amtrak, Metro Rail and Metrolink 
all converge at Union Station, making it once again the Grand Central Station 
of Los Angeles. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

<P>
 A 29-year-old man was shot to death outside his apartment Sunday morning 
during an argument with another man who owed him money, Los Angeles police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Napoleon Orellana was pronounced dead outside 6740 Hayvenhurst Ave. near 
the Van Nuys Airport, said Detective Dan O'Hanian of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police issued an alert for the gray 1990 Toyota pickup truck that the suspect, 
Hector Rodolfo Mejia, used to flee the scene. The truck has a California 
license plate number, 3Z82354. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe that Mejia, 36, lived on and off at the apartment complex 
and was staying there Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia owed Orellana money, O'Hanian said, and the two men had apparently been 
arguing over it for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7:30 a.m. Sunday, Mejia allegedly shot Orellana with a handgun several 
times in the upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing is the second homicide of the year in the Van Nuys Division, 
O'Hanian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orellana is survived by his wife, Carmen Ramos, and a 10-month-old daughter.

FAGANS, HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS LEADER, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenneth J. Fagans, a 30-year resident of Balboa Island and a longtime 
commissioner of the organization that oversees Southern California high school 
athletics, died of a heart attack Saturday at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagans, who was elected to the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame in 1991, was 
84.He was the commissioner of the California Interscholastic Federation 
Southern Section office from 1951 until he retired in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 In his time, the Southern Section, which includes Orange County, grew from 218 
to more than 458 high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to be a strong commissioner," Fagans said at the time of his 
retirement. "I think when you take something from nothing and mold the thing as 
we have, you are considered a dictator." 
</P>
<P>
 Fagans was born in Detroit in 1909 and moved to California with his family in 
1923. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a standout basketball player at Huntington Park High School and earned 
all-state honors as a senior center in 1927. Huntington Park won a Southern 
Section title that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagans went to Oregon State, where he was the leading scorer on the freshman 
team. For the next three seasons, he played in every varsity game. Fagans was 
president of his senior class in 1932 at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagans coached basketball at Compton High School from 1947 to 1953. He led his 
team to a pair of Southern Section titles and his teams won 53 consecutive 
games between 1950 and 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Norma, two sons and his sister.

VALLEY CRONICLE: WOMAN GIVES GIFT OF HEALTH AND HAPPINESS TO ABUSED DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dogs at the Millerwood Animal Rescue and Sanctuary in Burbank are there as 
the result of man's inhumanity to animals, as well as the beneficiary of one 
woman's love and concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Pam Miller-Sackter's canine boarders have been through tragedies that 
are heart-wrenching -- circumstances you wouldn't wish on any dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Jake, a Sheperd mix, was badly injured after knife-wielding hoodlums almost 
cut off his nose. After having surgery to reattach it, he was adopted by folks 
with other pets and he is now the contented head dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells, a 4-year-old Shep mix, is a handsome devil who is ready to be adopted. 
Miller-Sackter says you would never know he was shot twice in the leg, now that 
he has had surgery and a bone graft. 
</P>
<P>
 Pall Mall is a 1 1/2-year-old Shepherd mix, who was found running on the 
freeway. He was covered in grease and had a bad case of mange. He is now the 
picture of health and ready for a good home. 
</P>
<P>
 So is Snowdonia, a sweet-tempered, 10-month-old Shepherd who was found locked 
in an abandoned car in the desert without food or water. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the others, she is now chipper and seems happy to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs come to Millerwood from veterinarians' offices and the city and 
county animal shelters. Some are brought in by concerned animal lovers. They 
are nursed back to health before being put up for adoption by Miller-Sackter, 
who runs the shelter and carries much of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller-Sackter hadn't considered herself an animal activist when she 
volunteered at a similar shelter several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had heard about a place where they took care of abused and abandoned dogs, 
and I offered to be one of the volunteers who would go out to the Chatsworth 
location and walk the animals," she remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 An equestrian trainer, she thought helping less fortunate animals would be a 
good change of pace. She says the man who ran the Chatsworth shelter at that 
time promised never to put down a dog who could be rehabilitated, but that 
eventually he did have some of the animals killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his instincts were good but that he just burned out and couldn't care 
for all the dogs," Miller-Sackter says. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when she went into action and Millerwood was founded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I located a kennel in Burbank and took over the lease from someone who had 
defaulted. I brought some of the dogs who were probably going to be put down 
over from the Chatsworth kennel," Miller-Sackter says. 
</P>
<P>
 That was about two years ago and upward of $40,000 out of Miller-Sackter's 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 She thinks it is money well spent. She has room at the kennel for about 28 
animals and currently has about 48. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are boarded out at other kennels and some we have put in foster homes," 
she says, adding that she wishes she had room for more. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years there has been a steady stream of dogs to the facility. 
Since people who work with animals have found out she is willing to take 
injured pets, her kennel population has grown. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Ladd, one of Miller-Sackter's volunteers, who also works with other 
organizations such as Pet Orphans, says Miller-Sackter is considered something 
of a saint. 
</P>
<P>
 "What she does is so difficult. In addition to rescuing animals and finding 
them good homes, she nurses them back to health and helps them feel secure and 
unthreatened." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller-Sackter says she does have volunteers who work with the dogs, and a vet 
who provides health care at a reduced cost, but that she wishes a dog food 
company would adopt her and help with the food. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a registered nonprofit agency and we do get some financial help from 
donations, but it costs about $2,500 a month to keep up the rent, food bill and 
medical costs," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she says the rewards are incredible. She cites the case of Dover, a 
yellow Labrador. 
</P>
<P>
 Dover was brought to the facility after being stabbed in the ribs by a child. 
The animal also had a fractured front leg. 
</P>
<P>
 After being nursed back to health by Miller-Sackter and her band of canine 
caretakers, he was adopted by a family with a home in the Valley and a vacation 
home in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "We often hear from people who adopt our dogs," Miller-Sackter says. "They 
like to keep in touch and tell us how well the dogs are doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last note we received from Dover's people included a picture of the dog, 
looking very pleased with himself. He was sitting in a dune buggy," 
Miller-Sackter says. West Valley Group Launching All-Out Assault on Taggers 
</P>
<P>
 No more nice guys. Graffiti-busters in the West Valley are not going to take 
it any more. 
</P>
<P>
 They are beefing up their political muscle to take on City Hall and the 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless the law puts some muscle into the way it deals with taggers, our 
children's children will still be dealing with this neighborhood situation, if 
there is any neighborhood left," George Haytens says. 
</P>
<P>
 Haytens is not some guy who just sits around grousing. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent part of his 31 years as a building and grounds administrator, most 
recently at Pierce College, cleaning away graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his retirement 10 years ago, he has redoubled his efforts and was 
instrumental in setting up the Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce graffiti hot 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work with members of the community, the Police Department and other 
chambers and citizens' groups to stop the advance of graffiti," says Haytens. 
"If you don't defeat this menace, it will take over your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Marlow Mogul, another member of his group, agrees, adding, "Graffiti is 
causing millions of dollars worth of damage to our communities every year, 
lowering property values and driving away customers from small businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 He says part of the problem is that the district attorney's office will not 
prosecute any crime under $10,000, so taggers basically get off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time that we made the taggers and their parents accountable with both 
hefty fines and community service time," Haytens says. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward this end, the Woodland Hills group is lining up support to present its 
views to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking to City Council members and putting together a coalition of 
concerned people who want to increase the penalties for tagging," Mogul says. 
</P>
<P>
 He adds that the effort is still in the planning stages and any other groups 
that would like to join the effort should contact the Woodland Hills chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Haytens says people should become more involved in their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say that there is no use cleaning up graffiti, because it will just be 
back the next day," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been my experience that if you do not remove the graffiti, there will be 
more the next day and the next," Haytens says. "You have to take a stand before 
you get overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
 He says people interested in getting involved in neighborhood graffiti removal 
should call the anti-graffiti units at the Valley's police stations for 
information. Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I would be having a discussion about whether or not to let my kids 
have pierced ears for earrings. I just never thought I would be having it with 
my son."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LARGEST FIELD IN YEARS SEEKS PALMDALE SEATS; 
POLITICS: THIRTEEN CHALLENGERS HOPE TO UNSEAT THE MAYOR AND 2 COUNCIL MEMBERS. 
DECLINING LOCAL ECONOMY AND QUALITY OF LIFE ARE ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pointing to the city's flagging economy and its stubborn crime problems, 13 
challengers are hoping to unseat the mayor of Palmdale and two incumbent City 
Council members in the April 12 municipal election. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor James Ledford and council members James Root and Teri Jones insist that 
they are working to beef up law enforcement, revitalize the aging downtown 
business district and attract new employers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the challengers -- the largest field in more than a dozen years -- insist 
that new blood is needed to get Palmdale -- California's fastest-growing city 
during the late 1980s -- moving again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two major problems in this city -- the creation of jobs and public 
safety," said Mike Dispenza, an insurance agency owner who is waging an 
aggressive, and expensive, campaign for mayor. "I think (Ledford) has fallen 
down in both of these areas. He has not offered the leadership we need." 
</P>
<P>
 Ledford dismisses such criticism as campaign rhetoric. "I think the most 
difficult part is getting these challengers to explain how they are going to 
make their promises come to be," he said. "When we get into details on issues, 
I don't see the plan." 
</P>
<P>
 In many of the state's smaller cities, the mayor's job is rotated annually 
among council members. But in Palmdale, voters elect a mayor directly every two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledford, who is selling his interest in a local sports bar to pursue other 
business ventures, was elected to the council in 1990, then successfully ran 
for mayor two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispenza and police officer Ron J. Saldivar are challenging Ledford this time 
around. (A fourth mayoral candidate, Rick Pamplin, will also appear on the 
ballot. Pamplin withdrew from the race after the deadline for having his name 
removed.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for two four-year terms on the council, incumbents Root and Jones 
are facing 11 challengers. One of the campaign's more dramatic developments has 
been a split among the incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledford and Root are running as a slate with John A. Mayfield, chairman of the 
city's Planning Commission. They said they have not teamed with the third 
incumbent, Jones, because she has abstained from voting on several key issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has defended her voting record and describes herself as an independent 
thinker who is not afraid to break with the views of the council majority. She 
has teamed with mayoral candidate Dispenza and council candidate Terence P. 
Judge, a sheriff's deputy, on joint mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The other challengers include one former councilman, Thomas Smith. Smith was 
the top vote-getter in 1986 but lost a 1990 reelection bid by 15 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The race also includes a husband and wife, Ron Saldivar and Lydia 
Guzman-Saldivar, who are running independently for mayor and council member, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Several candidates have vowed to spend $20,000 to $30,000 to win, although 
most expect their campaigns to cost less than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the future of the high desert city of 90,000, which grew at a 
furious pace during the late 1980s. Skyrocketing Los Angeles real estate prices 
caused many residents to flock to Palmdale, where builders put up thousands of 
relatively affordable new houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale edged out its northern neighbor, Lancaster, as the site of the area's 
first shopping mall -- a lucrative source of tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, the aerospace slump and plummeting housing prices have 
hurt the local economy. Home foreclosures are common, as are partially vacant 
retail centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's aging downtown area lost business when retailers moved into or near 
the regional mall. At the same time, graffiti and other crime problems have 
increased near the older commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the Northridge earthquake damaged the freeways that 
thousands of local commuters use to get to work in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 During this year's campaign, nearly all the candidates have said that a 
crackdown on crime and generating more local jobs are the keys to reviving 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates have interpreted recent crime statistics released by the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which polices the city, in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The report showed that the number of major crimes in Palmdale increased about 
5% from 1992 to 1993. In particular, more rapes, robberies, assaults and arson 
fires occurred during 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sheriff's Department estimated that the city's population also rose by 
almost 6,000 during that period. As a result, by measuring the number of 
offenses per 10,000 residents, the city's crime rate dropped by about 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how they interpret the numbers, however, nearly every candidate has 
vowed to add deputies, organize more crime-prevention meetings or draw on their 
own law-enforcement experience to crack down on crooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Root has said Palmdale should consider ending its relationship with 
the Sheriff's Department to set up a city police agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Council candidate Sandy Corrales, however, has complained that by focusing on 
crime, too many candidates have engaged in "the politics of fear." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have to question the type of city that some of these candidates are 
painting," she said. "It's not the city I live in." 
</P>
<P>
 To provide more jobs, she and most of the other candidates have called for 
increased efforts to lure new employers, particularly higher-paying industrial 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates for mayor are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mike Dispenza, 55, a six-year resident who chaired the Antelope Valley 
Business Outlook Conference for three years. He plans to spend about $30,000 in 
his campaign, half from his personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * James C. Ledford, 40, a resident since 1968. He served four years on the 
Planning Commission before being elected to the council and the mayor's post. 
He plans to spend up to $20,000, mostly in donations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ron J. Saldivar, 29, an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department who 
moved to Palmdale a year ago. He is president of a private investigation firm. 
He expects to spend less than $5,000 on his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates for the two council seats are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Albert Beattie, 50, an eight-year resident who owns a Midas Muffler shop and 
ran for council in 1992. He is active in downtown revitalization efforts and

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; GIFT GIVING IS AT THE ROOT OF WATER DISTRICT SCANDAL; 
MISCONDUCT: FIRMS THAT LAVISHED PRESENTS ON PUBLIC OFFICIALS ENCOURAGED 
CORRUPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. MITCHELL, William R. Mitchell is chairman of Orange County Common 
Cause. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent filing of criminal charges against two officials of the Santa 
Margarita Water District has again focused attention on the misconduct at the 
water district. 
</P>
<P>
 While these criminal charges remind us of this sordid saga, a more pervasive 
and pernicious course of conduct has also been revealed. This is the actions of 
firms which ply public officials with gifts. While the gift-giving is not 
illegal, when are we as a community going to acknowledge the moral wrongdoing 
of those who engage in the gift giving? 
</P>
<P>
 If you have followed the continuing press reports regarding the Santa 
Margarita Water District and other public officials' problems, one firm's name 
appears again and again: Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates (RBF). This 
Irvine firm regularly engages in the practice of providing meals, trips and 
other gifts to public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift giving to the Santa Margarita Water District alone is worthy of study 
(it has resulted in criminal charges). RBF and MacDonald-Stephens Engineering 
of Mission Viejo lavished gifts on board members and senior employees of the 
district. These gifts included: sports and theater tickets, massages, fishing 
trips to Mexico, hunting trips, meals and the ubiquitous dozen long-stemmed 
roses. The two officials who have had criminal charges filed against them, 
Walter Knitz and Michael Lord, together received over $11,000 in gifts from RBF 
during a period of time when the water district gave $13 million in business to 
RBF. 
</P>
<P>
 Other disclosures by The Times indicate that two additional Santa Margarita 
Water District employees were the beneficiaries of RBF gifts. The two senior 
engineers with the water district, Bill Dye and Dan Ferons, received nearly 
$12,000 in gifts during the period RBF was awarded millions of dollars worth of 
contracts by the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 The giving to Santa Margarita Water District employees and officials by RBF is 
not isolated. A review of the statements of economic interest filed by various 
county public officials indicates that RBF frequently gives gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 What the public needs to understand is that most engineering firms do not 
regularly engage in the widespread practice of attempting to compromise the 
decisions of public officials. Significantly, RBF does not lavish gifts on 
federal officials. Why? Because the federal government has strict gift 
limitations. The federal government has long recognized the inherently 
corrupting effect such ingratiating has on the decision-making process and its 
likely result of misuse of tax dollars. It should be noted that many officials 
of special districts manage to refrain from accepting these often offered 
gratuities. These officials are to be commended. 
</P>
<P>
 A gift ban ordinance, similar to the one adopted by the county Board of 
Supervisors, would have greatly reduced the opportunity for corruption. 
Further, that gift ban ordinance holds gift givers responsible as well as 
public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 An extremely troubling aspect is the involvement of RBF in the alleged 
violations of the laws by water district officials. The giving of the gift by 
RBF and its receipt were legal so long as those receiving the gift did not 
participate in decisions affecting RBF. But, contemporaneous with the giving of 
the gifts, the water district officials did, according to the charges, make 
decisions benefiting RBF. Yet, RBF stood by and watched their fishing and 
drinking "buddies" violate the law without saying a word. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that RBF has received millions of dollars in contracts from the 
Santa Margarita Water District while Messrs. Knitz and Lord have criminal 
charges pending. Former Board Chairman Don B. Schone resigned in disgrace. I 
wonder if a dozen roses now would make any of these men feel better about the 
public humiliation they have suffered? 
</P>
<P>
 It is time for those who lavish gifts on public officials to be held 
accountable. In the meantime, public officials should realize that the 
attention and gratuities showered on them by RBF and others are not based on 
personal affection, but rather represent a course of action designed solely to 
benefit the firm. Businesses, such as RBF, give because they expect return. 
Absent the receipt or at least the expectation of something in return, these 
firms would not otherwise give. Thus it is advisable for public officials to 
avoid the taint of receiving gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 As we have seen to date, when the light of day shines on these activities, it 
is public officials who get burned.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PIPE BOMB BLAST DAMAGES RV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one was injured when a pipe bomb exploded beneath a recreational vehicle 
parked behind a Sierra Highway cafe, sheriff's deputies said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said they have no suspects and no motive in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Rini Duzanne, 51, the vehicle's owner, said that upon returning to her home 
about 7:45 p.m. Saturday she noticed that her rear left tires were flat and 
that the rear cabin of her vehicle had sunk to the ground. Inside, the bathroom 
toilet and shower were damaged, Duzanne said. She thought that the motor home 
had sunk because of the flattened tires. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Duzanne noticed that her tires were not flattened but blown 
apart, and after seeing metal fragments underneath and around her vehicle she 
notified police. 
</P>
<P>
 An arson investigation team determined that a pipe bomb had caused the damage, 
estimated at $5,000.

JACK SMITH: BE KIND, BUT ALSO BE CHOOSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until it began to appear on bumper stickers, I had not heard the phrase, 
"Today I will commit one random act of senseless kindness. Will you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now I read of the origin and popularity of the saying in the Renegade Rip, the 
Bakersfield College newspaper of which I was once editor. 
</P>
<P>
 The pledge to commit "one random act of senseless kindness" was invented by 
Chuck Wall, a Bakersfield College human relations professor, and it received a 
great promotional boost recently when it was the subject of an Oprah Winfrey 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 It is said the show has an audience of 22 million in 65 countries. Obviously, 
if each one of those viewers committed one act of kindness, the world would 
suddenly be a better place in which to live. 
</P>
<P>
 One may wonder why Wall chose the word senseless . He explained on the show: 
"Listening to a newscaster say, 'We have another act of senseless violence to 
report,' I thought if I just take out that word violence and put in the word 
kindness, I'd take a well-known negative phrase and turn it into a positive 
phrase." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the word senseless adds to the appeal of the vow. One's kindness need 
not make sense in any practical way. It won't make you any money. It won't get 
you elected to office. It might not even bring you any thanks.  
</P>
<P>
 What started as a class project has become rather a craze. More than 20,000 
bumper stickers spelling out the message have been printed and 15,000 sold, the 
profit going to the Kern County Braille Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of letters have been sent to Wall, some addressed simply "Kindness, 
Postmaster, Bakersfield, CA." 
</P>
<P>
 But I have read nothing describing any acts of kindness that have been done as 
a result of Wall's prescription. Perhaps acts of kindness, unlike sidewalk 
shootings and kidnap-murders, are not sensational enough to be featured by the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wall asks "Will you?" my immediate answer is, "Yes, I will." But what 
will I do? What act of kindness, exactly, will I perform? 
</P>
<P>
 As the Boy Scouts are urged to do, I might help a little old lady across the 
street; but in my condition, I am more in need of that help than able to give 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easier to think of an act of mass violence than it is one random act of 
senseless kindness. Would the person we choose even know he had been the 
recipient of an act of kindness? Should we publicize our act or keep it 
anonymous? 
</P>
<P>
 I have been casting about for an act of kindness that I can perform. Can I 
just give money? Say $100 to a cancer fund? That seems like buying my way out. 
Besides, I couldn't keep it up every day. 
</P>
<P>
 How do I know the object of my kindness won't resent it? Short of dropping a 
dollar into a panhandler's can on the street, there's no way to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 It can become very complicated. My wife and I saw the movie "Thicker Than 
Blood" on TV the other night, about a stockbroker whose bedmate becomes 
pregnant. Although they aren't married, she has the baby. Meanwhile, her two 
other children by another man, also not her husband, are in the father's 
custody. A further complication is that the child is born with traces of 
cocaine from his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The stockbroker, played by Peter Strauss, thinking the child is his, loves him 
like a son. The mother, portrayed by Rachel Ticotin, kidnaps the boy and flies 
him to Miami, where she takes up with another man. Strauss has the boy returned 
and sues for custody. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute. Ticotin drops a bombshell: Strauss is not the father, and a 
blood test bears that out. The biological father then comes forward and claims 
parenthood. Are you with me? Meanwhile, the mother has married the guy in Miami 
and he wants the child, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Strauss says he loves the boy like a son, and the boy loves him. The boy bears 
this out. In the end, the judge grants custody to Strauss. The mother is 
devastated.  
</P>
<P>
 Strauss' fight for the boy is surely an act of kindness. But is it kind toward 
the mother? OK, she has a drug habit and sleeps around. But she loves the boy 
and is, in fact, his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, kindness isn't always simple, and Solomonic judgments don't always 
leave everyone happy. 
</P>
<P>
 So you have to give it a lot of thought before you commit an act of kindness. 
You must consider all the ramifications. The predicament in which Strauss found 
himself is not likely to envelope me. But I still haven't figured what act of 
kindness I can commit without making someone unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget another old saying: No good deed goes unpunished.

GIANT SUNDAY SCHOOL; REV. SCHULLER REVEALS HIS LATEST VISION IN MARKING 39TH 
YEAR OF HIS MINISTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Robert H. Schuller, whose services from the Crystal Cathedral are 
watched by millions worldwide, used the 39th anniversary celebration of the 
founding of his ministry Sunday to announce his latest vision: building the 
largest Sunday school in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will help me," Schuller told more than 3,000 worshipers as he stood 
beside his 20-foot-tall image on a huge Sony TV screen. "We're going after the 
next generation. And their kids. . . . We've got to get the kids whose parents 
don't want religion." Schuller -- one of the world's most popular 
televangelists, whose "Hour of Power" is broadcast to 20 million people 
worldwide -- declined to provide any details of the school plan or of a real 
estate deal at which he also hinted. Schuller cited "powerful, secret and 
sensitive negotiations" that may not be concluded for two or three months. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that he had restructured his ministry a week ago because of 
his frequent public appearances outside California. Schuller said he had named 
Charles Todd, the church's chief counsel and an ordained minister, chief 
operating officer -- a change that had not been widely known outside the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 The school plan, however, came as a surprise even to Crystal Cathedral 
staffers, who said they know none of the specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has his eye on the year 2000," said one staff member. "He likes to think 
far ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Church spokesman Mike Nason, the person most responsible for the church's 
growth into a high-tech broadcast facility, said Schuller has been considering 
the school effort for some time and will formally present it soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believes that getting to the youth is the answer to many of our society's 
problems," Nason said. "I can't tell you anything more about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nason added that the sensitive negotiations Schuller referred to are not 
related to his school plan. "I know about that, but I can't reveal anything," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller also used Sunday's anniversary to recall the unusual origins of his 
church, which opened at the Orange Drive-in Theater in 1955, a few months ahead 
of Disneyland and just down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 As Schuller recalled the hardships he endured in the early days of his 
ministry, hundreds of worshipers remained parked in the church's specially 
maintained "drive-in" section, arranged in rows as if they were in the parking 
lot of the original theater, listening to the pastor over a special station on 
their car radios. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Charlton Heston read a portion of the Easter story from a Bible 
printed in 1653, which, the actor noted, carries "extra weight" because of its 
antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, more than 7,500 people attended three morning worship services, 
church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief ceremony in the sunlit plaza between the morning's second and third 
services, Howard Kelly, chairman of the celebration, introduced several people 
who had attended the first worship service at the old drive-in. Among them was 
Wally Zirkle, who had placed the letters on the theater marquee and served 
coffee in the snack bar. 
</P>
<P>
 A small plane circled overhead, towing a banner that read: "Launching 40th 
Year at Crystal Cathedral." 
</P>
<P>
 Melodyland, another evangelical church, and several other nearby churches are 
moving or have already left the area, Schuller noted. "But we will remain here 
as the strongest church," he said. "We will succeed because we are a team, and 
the quarterback is Jesus Christ." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled how he purchased a trailer to carry church equipment from his home 
to the drive-in for $20, only to find out it wasn't registered. Its wheels were 
welded to its axles, Schuller said, so he always prayed that he wouldn't have a 
flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
 And he told the story of a rancher who, just out of the hospital after a 
cancer operation, bailed Schuller out by providing $3,000 to purchase land at 
the Crystal Cathedral site just four hours before the deal would have fallen 
out of escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller also spoke of a period in the late 1950s when, he said, there was a 
"conspiracy" to remove him as head of the church. At that time, he said, "my 
will to die was greater than my will to live." 
</P>
<P>
 The televangelist was referring to complaints from a contingent of worshipers 
and church leaders in 1958 that his services weren't based enough on Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been other controversies as well. After the Crystal Cathedral was 
built, state officials complained that Schuller's long list of big-name concert 
performers smacked too much of a commercial venture and stripped the church of 
its property-tax exemption. In the end, Schuller paid only part of the back 
taxes the state sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller also fielded complaints about his family members occupying key 
positions in the ministry. He dismissed most of these as the "work of the 
devil." 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller underwent brain surgery after hitting his head on the roof of a car 
in Amsterdam during a trip to Europe in 1991. The incident sparked speculation 
and debate about the church's line of succession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be chairman for the next 10 years," the 68-year-old Schuller said 
Sunday, "unless God takes me away." 
</P>
<P>
 A church official said later that Schuller's reference to 10 years did not 
mean he would automatically step down at that time. "There's no specific 
contract," the spokesman said. "It was just a figure of speech." 
</P>
<P>
 At the plaza celebration, Schuller's wife, Arvella, joked that there were many 
more people at this Palm Sunday event than at the first worship service 39 
years earlier. "And I hope a bigger offering," quipped Schuller. 
</P>
<P>
 Arvella Schuller played the same Conn organ used at the drive-in, near a 
replica of the 1953 Chevy she and the pastor drove to the first worship 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 red, blue, yellow, orange, pink and white balloons soared skyward 
from the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are they going?" asked Diedre Trask, 5, whose family was visiting from 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't they beautiful?" her mother, Heather Trask, responded. "They're flying 
toward God."

HIGH SCHOOL'S GROWING PAINS INFECT SPIRITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Expectations were high when parents and students celebrated the September 
opening of Aliso Niguel High School, a $50-million high-tech showpiece that 
educators said marked the "debut of a new era." 
</P>
<P>
 While some parents and students remain optimistic, others have seen their 
hopes turn to bitter frustration and complain that the Capistrano Unified 
School District rushed to open the school before it was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of torrential rainstorms last winter, only about half the campus -- 
including classrooms, science labs, administrative offices and the library -- 
had been built by the school's opening day, according to district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, continuing construction on the rest of the campus over the past six 
months has taken a toll on school spirit, leaving many students and parents 
feeling let down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a disappointing year," said one freshman, who asked that her name 
not be used. "We came in expecting we'd have more than other high schools, but 
we have less." 
</P>
<P>
 The main gym, swimming pool and classroom building for electives and 
vocational education, including the culinary arts academy, opened recently. But 
the student center, food court, theater, fine arts classrooms, stadium, 
auxiliary gym and playing fields still aren't ready. The remaining construction 
could be complete by mid-May, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the school's much-vaunted high-tech equipment has been operating since 
December, including a television production studio used to telecast the student 
bulletin each morning. The school is the first in the state to feature a fiber 
optics-based Dynacom information network, which links classroom video monitors 
and computers via remote control to a library nerve center filled with laser 
disc machines and other high-tech gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the school features cutting-edge technology, it was only recently 
that students could borrow books from the library because of a computer glitch 
that crippled the checkout procedure, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Without athletic facilities, teachers had to run physical education classes 
out of the library on most days during the first semester. It was only 
recently, when the gym finally opened, that the Wolverines could hold 
activities such as pep rallies for a large number of students. 
</P>
<P>
 Making things more challenging, the school opened Sept. 9 with about 1,600 
students in grades 9-11, about 400 more than expected, causing temporary 
shortages in everything from books to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not enough space," said Darin Wachs, a junior. "There's only a couple 
areas where you can eat lunch. All this construction is going on. It interrupts 
the school atmosphere. It's more like a construction site." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Denise Danne admits "growing pains" have been worse than 
anticipated, but believes that with patience, the school will live up to its 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of all the technology, which has been borne out, I think the 
expectations were higher," Danne said. "The higher you go, so to speak, the 
harder you fall." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite complaints, many more students have requested transfers into the 
school than out for the coming year, according to a district survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good group of kids," Danne said. "They have done well in sports and 
academics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the most important thing we do here is have an outstanding 
instructional program," she continued. "I think we have that." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students, like junior student body officer Maria Nguyen, believe the 
school will be great someday, but are afraid it will be too late for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, mounting frustration has made even the most routine challenges of 
starting a new school, such as picking letterman's jackets and building school 
spirit, more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students recently formed underground newspapers to criticize everything 
from the lunch menu to the price of letterman's jackets. (Some parents are also 
challenging the letterman's jacket selected by a student committee, saying its 
all-black color will be attractive to gang members and put their children at 
risk.) 
</P>
<P>
 One profanity-filled paper circulated on campus earlier this month, the 
Unauthorized Media, said its purpose was to "force the administration to notice 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 "For the entire year, I have heard nothing but criticism towards our school, 
well . . . keep up the good work, people!" wrote one student, using the name 
Cap'n. "I'm sick of hearing the dates for the school to be finished being 
pushed back further and further. The school shouldn't have even been opened 
this year. Personally, I would rather be at a fully built school than this one, 
regardless that this is supposedly a 'high-tech' school." 
</P>
<P>
 However, district officials say complaints would have been even louder had 
they waited to open the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the new school, Capistrano Valley and Dana Hills high schools would 
have each grown to about 3,000 students, far beyond maximum capacities, said 
Tom Anthony, the district's director of secondary education. Those two campuses 
already have at least 20 portable classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents and students say crowding has also been a problem at Aliso Niguel 
because parts of the campus are still under construction. Some say they would 
have rather waited at their old schools, even if they were overcrowded, until 
the campus was complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Yokoi, whose son, Stephan, is a junior, said she didn't expect the 
campus to be perfect on opening day, but she certainly expected it to be 
complete by midyear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, the parents, are the taxpayers," she said. School officials "have to know 
they're working for us. We don't expect them to do everything we want, but I 
want to make sure our kids get the education we expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Steven Rizzuto said his sophomore daughter is enjoying her teachers and 
classes, although he has become increasingly disappointed with the school. He 
resigned as booster foundation president this month, partly because of his 
waning enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "You expect a certain amount of issues and that's OK," he said. "But if I had 
to do it over again, I would have asked my daughter not to transfer. . . . I 
think the school was opened too prematurely. Too many kids are squeezed into 
too-little space."  
</P>
<P>
 Others are more optimistic and believe growing pains will be forgotten once 
the campus is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad for people who are disenchanted, but I think, on the whole, 
opening that school has been successful," Capistrano School Board President 
Paul B. Haseman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know next year when those juniors are seniors," he said, "they're going to 
have a beautiful facility and they will have a wonderful graduation and be very 
proud of their school." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Sun Hwang, a student body officer, said he believes the majority are 
winning what he described as a "battle of patience." 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have gotten a lot better since the beginning of the year," he said. 
"We've taken some big steps."

THE CHECKS ARE USUALLY IN THE MAIL; GOVERNMENT: HAROLD S. PITTMAN ENJOYS BEING 
THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE TO HOLD VENTURA COUNTY'S GIANT MONEY BAG. HE WILL BE 
UNOPPOSED IN ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This time every year, thousands of people in Ventura County write out huge 
checks to one man -- Harold S. Pittman. 
</P>
<P>
 Most will never meet him, but instead send off their hard-earned money via the 
U. S. Postal Service. A few residents will stop by his office just to make sure 
that he won't run off with the booty. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman, 55, just smiles and says: "Just keep those cards and letters coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the life of the county's treasurer-tax collector. More than 200,000 
pieces of mail -- the second portion of the 1993-94 property tax bills -- will 
cross Pittman's desk at the county Government Center by the April 10 tax 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 State rules require that the checks be made out to Pittman, since he is 
responsible for disbursing the money to the county government, schools and 
special districts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the requirement raises a question that Pittman hears constantly: Just who 
is this guy? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the elected collection agent for all the entities which collect money," 
Pittman said -- in one breath. "State code says I'm personally responsible for 
the funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: He's the people's choice to hold Ventura County's giant money 
bag, a task he takes very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 An even-tempered man with a Midwestern drawl, Pittman is a treasurer-tax 
collector who stands at the collections counter to personally accept the 
property tax payments. 
</P>
<P>
 He has held the position for six years and, unlike most of the other county 
officials, he will be unopposed in the June election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either people thought I was doing such a good job that they wouldn't run 
against me or no one wanted my job," Pittman said. "Either way, it's a nice 
present." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman says he is eager to serve another four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like dealing with finances, and I like dealing with people," he said. "It's 
big business. There are no boring times here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six years, Pittman watched property values drop and tax 
delinquency rates increase. Despite the recession, he has sought to make the 
most of the county's property taxes -- which will total $488 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Pittman's direction, his department has upgraded its computer system and 
purchased two new check-processing machines, nicknamed Thelma and Louise. 
</P>
<P>
 The machines, which cost a combined $263,000, can endorse and make microfilm 
copies of each check, as well as develop a tally that is loaded into the 
county's database. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased automation helps the county rush the property tax funds to the 
bank while reducing the number of workers needed to process the checks. For 
each $1 million the county deposits, it earns several hundred dollars per day 
in interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cut our processing costs by 50%," said John McKinney, Pittman's assistant. 
"There's virtually no overtime, yet we close the collection period now exactly 
on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements have won Pittman accolades from the County Board of 
Supervisors. Even Supervisor John K. Flynn, who is usually critical of his 
fellow county officials, says he has no complaints about Pittman's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hal is an excellent administrator," Flynn said. "He really minds the shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman says his favorite part of the job is hobnobbing with taxpayers. He 
spends several hours a day at the tax collection counter answering questions 
and accepting checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you're Harold S. Pittman," said Annie Sproul of Oxnard, who stopped by 
Pittman's office recently to pay her bill. "I've been writing checks to you for 
a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Lad, also of Oxnard, handed over his payment and told Pittman: "You are a 
famous man. I come here twice a year and you are always standing right there, 
collecting the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman smiled and nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the name recognition," Pittman said. "You don't make people happy by 
collecting taxes. But you can be appreciative and helpful. They recognize 
someone has to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most taxpayers know little more about Pittman than his name. 
</P>
<P>
 He's quick to provide a rundown on his background: He grew up in Oklahoma, 
where he earned an MBA from Oklahoma State University. Later, he joined the 
Navy and spent several years in Washington working on budgets at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Pittman and his wife, Bobbie, decided to move to Camarillo. Pittman 
went to work as the auditor-controller for the Navy at Port Hueneme. After 
retiring from the armed forces in 1982, Pittman joined the county as a 
supervising auditor. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked his way through the ranks and was appointed by the Board of 
Supervisors to fill an unexpired term as treasurer-tax collector in 1988. He 
ran unopposed in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 He has no children, but four dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the kind of county employee I can call at quarter-till-five and he's 
always in the office," Supervisor Vicky Howard said. "He's dedicated, and that 
says something about him." 
</P>
<P>
 He's also brave enough to list his number in the phone book, just in case 
someone needs him after-hours. Occasionally, he receives a strange phone call 
-- which he figures comes with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, an irate man telephoned Pittman on a weekend, desperate for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "His wife, who kept the checkbook, had died," Pittman said. "He found the 
check register and wanted to know why there was such a large check written out 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The man peppered Pittman with questions. Who are you? Why did you take the 
money? 
</P>
<P>
 "He was embarrassed when he found out it was for the taxes."

FUTURE SCIENTIST; TEEN-AGER GETS HEAD START IN BIOTECHNOLOGY BY LANDING JOB AT 
AMGEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of Lucy Vega's friends would be surprised to hear why she quit her 
part-time job at a fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard High School senior has not talked a lot about her new job, chiefly 
because it is so hard to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times a week, the energetic 18-year-old drives over the Conejo Grade to 
the Thousand Oaks headquarters of Amgen -- the largest biotechnology firm in 
the world -- where she dons a lab coat and sets to work in the X-ray 
crystallography lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen officials call Vega a symbol of the future in the field of science -- a 
field often criticized for shutting out girls long before they reach their 
upper teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega's family says she is a symbol of the dream they envisioned when they came 
to the United States in 1982: She will soon be the first in her family to go to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Little of this is lost on Vega herself, although she sees it in less grandiose 
terms. "I decided I liked science and, when the chance to work here came up, I 
decided to go for it," she said. "I had nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, Vega, like most high school students, had never heard of 
Amgen and knew nothing about biotechnology -- a complex scientific field that 
uses advanced cellular and molecular biology to create treatments for a variety 
of ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 But an assignment in her 11th-grade English class changed that, and Vega got 
her first glimpse at the world of science. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was supposed to shadow somebody who worked in a job that interested me," 
she recalled. "One of my teachers suggested Amgen. When I saw the labs and 
heard about what they were doing, it just seemed extremely interesting to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega spent the day with Tim Osslund, a research scientist who has worked at 
Amgen since it was founded in Thousand Oaks in 1980. They toured the company's 
maze of research laboratories, which have sprouted up across 100 acres of land 
in Newbury Park since Amgen products found worldwide success in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 As Vega got set to leave, Osslund said it struck him that one day was not 
sufficient to truly appreciate the experience of working in a lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "It dawned on me that we could really give high school kids an idea of how 
science works," Osslund recalled. "I also realized that it's rare for an 
industrial scientist to have the chance to give something back." 
</P>
<P>
 Osslund hired her to work as his lab assistant in one of the company's newest 
and most advanced laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vega arrived for her first day of work in October, she said she was so 
nervous, she was afraid to touch anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never seen things like this before," Vega said last week, pointing to a 
counter filled with test tubes and complex equipment used in X-ray 
crystallography. "I kept thinking, 'Oh my God, what if I do this wrong? I'll 
ruin everything.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Osslund was jittery as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The joke was that she would come into the lab and spontaneously combust," 
Osslund said. "It's not that this work is very dangerous, but it is a serious 
lab. For the first month, I told her not to wander around, not to touch things. 
We watched her like a hawk." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega's meticulous work quickly impressed Osslund, who increasingly began to 
see the potential of bringing a high school student into the lab. Every few 
weeks, Osslund would sit down with her and explain the projects and their 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 As important as being in the lab and doing the work, Osslund said, was 
understanding why the work was being done. 
</P>
<P>
 X-ray crystallography, Vega can now explain, involves getting 
three-dimensional molecular structures from genetic material. The process, she 
says, could lead to treatments for a host of illnesses, including Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is so excited by the work that she plans to make a career in 
crystallography. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's so much that you can do to help people through science," Vega 
said. "I'm going to go to college for as long as it takes for me to get a job 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Vega was accepted at UC Davis, which Osslund said is well known for 
its science departments. 
</P>
<P>
 When she broke the news to her mother that she would be leaving for Davis, 
which is just west of Sacramento, the reaction was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first heard she would be leaving our home, I was nervous. But when I 
thought about her going to a university, I felt very happy and very proud," 
Magdalena Vega said. "There are not words to describe how I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega, her mother said, has helped the whole family survive difficult times 
since they moved from Mexico to Oxnard. Magdalena and Carlos Vega have worked 
several jobs since being laid off by an Oxnard grower three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has frequently had trouble paying rent and keeping food in the 
cupboards. But Magdalena Vega said all of the hard times will be forgotten if 
Lucy and her other two children can fulfill their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we moved here," she said. "The whole reason was so the children 
could have a better life and so they wouldn't have to work as hard as we have." 
</P>
<P>
 And Lucy Vega, she said, has always had a natural gift for her studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when she was very young, she would always be independent," she said. 
"She would go off and study when others were watching television." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega's interest in science was unfailing, even as she entered high school -- a 
time, some local educators say, by which girls have already been pushed away 
from science and math. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are numerous studies which have found that girls are no longer 
encouraged to stick with those fields when they enter intermediate school," 
said Therese Hughes, who organizes an annual workshop in Thousand Oaks 
encouraging girls to pursue careers in science and math. 
</P>
<P>
 "When girls enter a science class, they still get a reaction like, 'Oh, what 
are you doing here?' " Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 That factor did not escape Osslund when he was considering hiring Vega. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems with science has always been that when children turn 8 or 
9 years old, they get turned off," Osslund said. "Science goes from being neat 
to being yucky -- especially for little girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega said she does not recall if she was discouraged from going into science, 
but that if she was, it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always liked it," she said. "I'm very excited about making it my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 Osslund, who has become a sort of mentor for Vega, gushes when he talks about 
her future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want her to go all the way," he said. "The Ph.D., the career, everything." 
</P>
<P>
 When Vega leaves in August to start working toward that career, Osslund said 
he will begin searching for another high school student to take under his wing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of 18-year-olds who couldn't handle this job," he said. "But 
having her here has shown that this can be very valuable. Lucy has proven a 
lot."

SIMI ARTS CENTER FACES HURDLE IN RISING COSTS; FINANCES: THE CITY COUNCIL 
AGREES TO PUT PROJECT OUT TO BID. BUT OFFICIALS SAY WORK WILL BE POSTPONED IF 
EXPENSES EXCEED $2.8 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As performers scramble for stage time in the much-touted $63.8-million Civic 
Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks, officials in Simi Valley are worried that 
skyrocketing costs will delay construction of east Ventura County's other 
planned theater -- a 70-year-old church scheduled for a $2.8-million make-over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center of the future will feature 
wisteria-covered porticoes, parquet wood floors and stained-glass windows if 
the design presented to the City Council prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as council members last week agreed to put the project out to bid, 
they said they feared that a boom in repair work caused by the earthquake may 
force the cost of the long-awaited project to soar out of the city's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started this, we were hoping to get good bids because of the 
recession, but now we're looking at a post-quake recovery," Mayor Greg Stratton 
said. "If the bids come in ridiculously high, we have to be prepared to put 
this off for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the council agreed with Stratton to postpone construction if the 
cost exceeds $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In supporting the plan, Councilwoman Judy Mikels called it a "much more 
positive step" than a proposal Thousand Oaks officials devised to make up a 
$13-million funding shortfall in construction costs for their Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council has agreed to close the funding gap by issuing 
bonds or taking out loans for construction of the plaza, which will include an 
1,800-seat theater, an adjacent 400-seat forum theater and a new city hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she would oppose similar action to ensure speedy construction of 
the city-run Simi theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking a much more conservative, much more workable approach," Mikels 
said. "We're not getting into anything we can't pay for." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo defended his city's funding plan, 
saying the debt is worth it to build a first-rate theater that has been in the 
planning for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you decide the size of a theater, you have to decide if you want to make 
it big enough to get top performers," he said. "Our theater will meet those 
requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he is confident that the theater will have no problem attracting 
large crowds. The center has already booked performer Bernadette Peters for its 
opening gala in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be the best facility between Los Angeles and San Francisco," 
Schillo said. "Just watch our dust." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center has met with resistance from council 
members who are reluctant to spend city money on a theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The council granted approval to design and plan the center in August, over the 
objections of Councilwomen Sandi Webb and Barbara Williamson, who argued that 
the money should be spent on public safety and other essential city services. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the city paid $821,000 for the crumbling former home of the Simi 
Valley Community Methodist Episcopal Church at 3050 Los Angeles Ave. When the 
renovation is completed, the drab-gray, boarded-up church will be transformed 
into a 290-seat theater with an art gallery, surrounded by rose gardens and 
swaying palms. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson set aside her reservations last week and agreed to go along with 
the council's vote on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will support this part of the project because all we're doing is going out 
to bid," she said. "We're not agreeing to spend any money." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb cast the lone dissenting vote, holding fast to her stance that city money 
should not be used to fund a theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, it breaks my heart to vote no," Webb said. "I still have to say I 
think we need to take the money and use it for a police station." 
</P>
<P>
 The council earlier this month launched a study of sites and funding sources 
for a new police headquarters, which could cost up to $11.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton countered Webb's argument, saying the arts center would provide a 
much-needed focal point for the city's art scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police station is still a few years off," he said. "This arts center has 
been a long time coming, and I think it's something we need."

PASSAGES IN 'BLACK BOY' RAISE FUROR IN FILLMORE; EDUCATION: SOME PARENTS 
CONTEND THAT RICHARD WRIGHT'S BOOK CONTAINS AMORAL, VIOLENT MESSAGES. OTHERS 
DEFEND THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly half a century after it was first published, Richard Wright's searing 
account of growing up poor and black in the segregated South has split a 
Fillmore High School honors class into two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents objecting to what they say are amoral and violent messages in the 
303-page "Black Boy" have insisted that their ninth- and 10th-grade children be 
given an alternative text. Out of 68 students in the two English class 
sections, 11 now spend the class period in the library, reading a novel about 
Eastern European immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the parents raised such a furor that the district has called a 
special parent-faculty conference April 4 to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The title seemed fairly aggressive to me," said Brian Botstone, who sensed a 
problem with the book ever since his son mentioned his new class assignment 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Flipping through the text confirmed Botstone's worst fears. "I know it's 
reality, but being reality doesn't make it worthwhile," he said. "This is not 
conducive to teaching people what civilized people are supposed to behave 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 But while some adults fume over what they call incendiary content, many other 
parents defend Wright's autobiography as a valuable lesson in the trials of 
bigotry and deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This community is very, very prejudiced, and there are lots of (religious) 
fundamentalists who feel it would be great if we could put blinders over our 
kids," said Ruth Prado, a parent of a student in the class. "But I think it's 
important for my son to know what life is all about. These are things kids need 
to be exposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 The students reading "Black Boy" -- many of whom say it is the best book 
they've read all year -- agree with their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book made me think about what's really out there," said Mark Prado, 15, 
Ruth Prado's son. "I think something like that could happen to me, and it makes 
me think I should never be prejudiced against anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy caught Andrea Allen, the teacher and a big fan of the book, by 
surprise. The book is part of the regular honors curriculum and, when she last 
taught it two years ago, not one parent objected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the book is wonderful," she said. "I tell the kids, 'When you are 
reading it, if you are not feeling any emotional pain, then something is wrong 
with the way you are reading it. I want you to take a good look at what man can 
do to man.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It is precisely that message that critics say made "Black Boy" a milestone in 
American literature. Over time, the book has become required reading in high 
schools and universities around the country, used as an insight into black 
culture and the black modern literary tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wright was one of the first black writers to try to focus on the rage that 
arises from the black urban experience," said Richard Yarborough, an associate 
professor of English and Afro-American Studies at UCLA. "He was breaking some 
barriers." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright described his childhood and adolescence as a minefield fraught with 
bigotry and physical and mental abuse -- from his black friends and relatives, 
mired in their poverty and ignorance, as well as from whites. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how he attempted to cope with his surroundings, Wright found himself 
unable to fit within the narrow, confining roles prescribed to blacks in 
turn-of-the-century America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what was wrong with me, but I could not correct it," the author writes 
in one passage. "The words and actions of white people were baffling signs to 
me. I was living in a culture and not a civilization, and I could learn how 
that culture worked only by living with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "While standing before a white man I had to figure out how to perform each act 
and how to say each word," he continues. "I could not help it. I could not 
grin. . . . I could not react as the world in which I lived expected me to; 
that world was too baffling, too uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, is one of the book's milder passages. Wright graphically 
describes key events in his life to drive home how abhorrent conditions and 
abusive relationships can lead to a lifetime of resentment and occasional 
outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 One such description that some students and parents in Fillmore mention 
repeatedly is the "kitten passage." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright writes how, as a young child, he hated his father for his father's 
constant beatings and erratic temper, which flared up with the slightest 
provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, a meowing kitten drove Wright's father into a rage and he bellowed at 
his son to " 'kill that damn thing. . . . Do anything, but get it away from 
here!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Seething at this unreasonable reaction, the boy decided to take his father 
literally. He quickly strung a noose and hung the kitten. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gasped, slobbered, spun, doubled, clawed the air frantically," he writes. 
"Finally, its mouth gaped and its pink-white tongue shot out stiffly." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of writing that alarms Marion Holladay, whose daughter 
Spring, a 10th-grader, is reading Willa Cather's "My Antonia" instead of "Black 
Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are a lot of books out there that are better quality than this," 
she fumed. "I don't understand how somebody could read it and not see what's 
wrong with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Spring, like many of the students reading the Cather book instead, agrees with 
her mother about Wright's autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to fill my mind with that kind of stuff," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said she began rereading the book after some of the initial complaints. 
She said she quickly realized her mistake in not sending a notification letter 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, she said, this is a district where parents regularly object to 
their children reading "Catcher in the Rye" and "Lord of the Flies." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yep, I should've seen it," she said. "And for my own sanity, I will do that 
next time. It is very difficult to teach a class when some of your students are 
in the library." 
</P>
<P>
 For each parent who refuses to get near the book, there are many others 
reading it because of all the uproar and finding that they like it very much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have read it cover to cover, and I thought it was a great book," said Jan 
Lee, whose son Ryan, 14, is in the class. "I'm trying to figure out what they 
find trashy about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The book is not always pleasant going, but then, neither is life, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality of life is that it's not always sweet, and children need to be 
exposed to that kind of thing so they have the ability to make decisions," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's views mirror those of other parents who do not object to their children 
reading "Black Boy." She said she did not worry about the book exposing her son 
to subversive ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a child who is 14 years old goes out and kills a kitten, then they have a 
real problem and it's not the book that caused it," she said. "It's hard to 
raise kids these days, but I'm hoping we've given them enough of a foundation 
that one book doesn't undermine their whole morality."

STREET SMART: DRIVER SLINGS ARROWS AT PERCEIVED SIGNS OF MISDIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Eastbound drivers exiting the Santa Paula Freeway at Victoria Avenue face 
confusing signs that trigger a frustrating problem. 
</P>
<P>
 It all starts with straight-ahead arrows painted on the pavement of the 
two-lane off-ramp at Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 When you reach Victoria, however, the left lane that was supposedly a 
straight-ahead lane suddenly becomes a left-turn-only lane. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are trying to go straight onto Webster Street, and believe the arrows 
painted on the road and stay in the left lane, you are either forced to turn 
left or cut somebody off and try to go straight. 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide against cutting anybody off and instead turn left and make a 
U-turn to get back to Webster, you'll be out of luck -- once you've risked your 
life to make the U-turn, you'll find that it's illegal to turn left onto 
Webster from Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
 This whole problem could be avoided if one of those straight-ahead arrows 
painted on the off-ramp pavement was changed to a left-turn arrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this possible? 
</P>
<P>
 William B. Morgan, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, not possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because those off-ramp arrows are not intended to indicate whether you 
can or cannot turn. They are painted there by the state Department of 
Transportation to warn motorists who may have accidentally driven onto the 
off-ramp coming from the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Nazir Lalani, traffic engineer for the city of Ventura, says the 
arrows often confuse more motorists than they help, especially if they are too 
close to the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The real solution at this intersection, Lalani says, is to add a lane. Plans 
to do just that are on the city's list of traffic improvements, he says. But 
that project is five years or more down the road. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Rosa Road between Camarillo and Thousand Oaks used to be a pleasant 
driving experience. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed when the county came in and did "improvements." They eliminated a 
passing lane that allowed drivers to pass the tractors, school buses, garbage 
trucks and other slow-moving vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now drivers who get stuck behind slow drivers swing out across the double 
yellow line to pass, creating a very dangerous situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Can some passing lanes be added? 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Helfet, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Passing lanes are not part of the plan for the county's overhaul of Santa Rosa 
Road, Principal Engineer Ken Gordon says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, says Gordon, was passing allowed before the project was launched two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the best of my recollection, there was a double yellow line there before," 
he said. "And there are good reasons for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Those reasons? Low visibility because of the undulating, winding roadway, and 
many driveways and side roads that intersect with Santa Rosa Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just wouldn't be safe to allow passing," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to clear up what seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the 
function of red left-turn arrows. 
</P>
<P>
 It is legal to turn left on a red arrow if three conditions exist: 1. The 
controlling light for the intersection is green. 2. There is no sign limiting 
turns to green arrow only. 3. Oncoming traffic is clear and turns can be made 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
 It's frustrating during rush hours to see long lines waiting at the red arrow 
when safe left turns can be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Fuller, Westlake Village 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 It may be frustrating, but what you're advocating is against the law. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Vehicle Code, Section 21453, Paragraph C, a driver 
facing a steady red arrow signal may not enter the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Special laws come into effect in case of nuclear war and other emergencies," 
said John Knowles, assistant traffic engineer for the city of Thousand Oaks. 
"But under all normal circumstances, you cannot turn left if the arrow is red."

GUNMEN KILL 1, HURT 3 IN WESTMINSTER; CRIME: THE TWO OPEN FIRE IN A CROWDED, 
POPULAR CAFE. A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY IS LEFT PARALYZED IN THE MIDNIGHT ATTACK THAT 
POLICE BELIEVE IS GANG-RELATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two gunmen strode into a crowded cafe just before midnight Saturday and opened 
fire, killing a 20-year-old Garden Grove man and wounding a 16-year-old boy and 
two 19-year-old women, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the shootings were gang-related because of the killers' brazen 
attack at a popular nightspot as well as the absence of any other apparent 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third shooting at a Westminster restaurant in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest victim, according to police, was Le Quan Nguyen, who died from 
multiple gunshot wounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Another bullet struck a 16-year-old Santa Ana boy in the back, leaving him 
paralyzed, Sgt. Dave Stronach said. The boy remained in critical condition at 
Long Beach Memorial Medical Center on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 19-year-old women, one shot in the elbow and the other in the knee, were 
listed in good condition Sunday at Garden Grove Medical Center.  
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to identify the survivors, saying the victims did not want 
their names disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do whatever we can to try to get them to cooperate" with the 
investigation, Stronach said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the attack occurred at the Cafe Mozart, a small coffee 
shop in a strip shopping mall in the 7900 block of Westminster Boulevard near 
Beach Boulevard. The cafe is a popular hangout for young people who come to 
listen to the jukeboxes and karaoke and play the video machines. Just before 
midnight, police said, two men walked in, armed with handguns, and began firing 
in several directions. The four people who were shot were in different parts of 
the cafe and police said they do not know why they were singled out. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen fled after the shooting and were still at large Sunday, police 
said. Both men were described as Vietnamese males, 19 to 20 years old, wearing 
baseball caps.  
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, a sign in Vietnamese said the cafe would be temporarily closed. 
Several chairs were overturned and abandoned drinks remained on some of the 
round cocktail tables. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, 18 people were inside the coffee shop at the time of the 
shooting but none knew what prompted the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't describe anybody," Stronach said. "The victims and everyone, they 
all say they don't know anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Stronach said police suspect the shooting was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the style -- to go through the front door guns ablazing," he said. 
"There's no other motive." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some city officials sought to downplay the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gang violence is a problem in every city," City Councilman Craig Schweisinger 
said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE CASITAS; HUNDREDS ATTEND RENAISSANCE FAIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scent of musk incense and patchouli drifted through the air as the shore 
along Lake Casitas was transformed over the weekend into a 16th-Century English 
village. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people took advantage of light breezes and warm temperatures 
Sunday afternoon to attend the last day of the annual Ojai Renaissance Faire. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of vendors selling everything from swords and daggers to jewelry and 
handmade garlands lined the lakeside, where characters from Elizabethan England 
acted out stage plays and fantasies from centuries past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful day and a chance to be outdoors," Kathy Hodgson, a brokerage 
house assistant from Simi Valley, said as she sipped on a strawberry margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've enjoyed Renaissance fairs for years," she said. "People from that time 
just seem to have enjoyed life more, despite the hardships." 
</P>
<P>
 On a wooden stage nearby, a court jester was preparing for his juggling and 
comedy routine before about two dozen spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an idiot on stage," the jester yelled to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, sir. Can you stand up here for a minute?" he asked a man in the front 
row, who promptly declined to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the "Shadow Dragon" exhibit, blindfolded villains Ludwig and Turtle were 
engaged in a fierce balancing game that had them adding to a tower of 
2-by-4-foot boards by pulling out boards from the bottom and placing them on 
top. 
</P>
<P>
 After several near-misses, Turtle finally toppled the tower, losing amid 
bitter claims of foul. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ludwig won but we don't really know," said Nathan, the judge and publican 
presiding over the contest. "It might have been pushed." 
</P>
<P>
 A rematch was scheduled later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the atmosphere was 16th Century, prices were more like 20th Century. 
One booth was selling old-time foils and bayonets for as much as $325. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the period, the dressing up," said Kevin Smith of KS Steel in Redondo 
Beach, who manned the sword and antique booth Sunday wearing a T-shirt 
proclaiming himself a born-again pagan. "Most of the people who are buying this 
stuff are buying it for accessories to costumes they already have." JEFF 
McDONALD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GRANTS WEIGHED FOR CHILD SAFETY PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday will consider giving grants to two 
programs working to keep children safe, one by visiting schools to teach 
personal safety, the other by producing a video that offers youngsters 
alternatives to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will review a request by the National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children for $1,000 to create "Kids and Company: Together in Safety," 
a classroom program that would teach personal safety to children in grades 
kindergarten through six. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would begin in schools in the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Human Relations Commission is also requesting a $3,150 grant 
to develop a video and manual for middle and high school students titled "Stop 
in Your Tracks: Alternatives to Violence." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which includes role-playing, is designed to teach youngsters 
peaceful ways to deal with anger. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants would come from the county's Social Programs Grants fund, which 
distributes money to nonprofit groups such as shelters, senior citizens centers 
and health-care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants generally are between $500 and $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisor will meet at 9:30 a.m. in the Board Hearing Room, on 
the first floor of the County Hall of Administration, 10 Civic Center Plaza in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings are open to the public and include a segment dedicated to citizen 
comment.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerry Aust has been appointed principal of the C.E. Utt Middle School, which 
will reopen this fall at its original campus on Browning Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees of Tustin Unified School District named Aust, currently principal of 
Marjorie Veeh Elementary School, to his new job earlier this month.He has been 
with the school district for 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said that Utt Middle School, which was closed in 1978 
because of declining enrollment, was reopened because of the increasing number 
of students entering sixth, seventh and eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 With the school's reopening, the district will have three middle schools. The 
others are A.G. Currie and Columbus Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbus Tustin, which has been using the Utt campus for the last three years, 
will return to its former site at 17952 Beneta Way in September, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beneta Way campus was closed in 1991 for renovation. Bob Boies will remain 
the school principal. BERT ELJERA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PRINCIPAL SINGS NEW TUNE AT SCHOOL CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Oxnard High School Principal Rick Rezinas volunteered to perform with a 
group of students in a lip-syncing contest, he knew that he took the risk of 
appearing silly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Spanish-language radio station in Northern California that sponsors 
the contest promised to give Rezinas and the students $5,000 if they won the 
competition and at least $1,000 just for entering. All of the money would go 
toward school scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made a fool out of myself for a lot less than that," said Rezinas, who 
competed Saturday in Modesto with 20 of his students against principals and 
students from eight other California high schools. Dozens of other schools had 
been eliminated in earlier competition. The top prize went to Santa Cruz High 
School, but Oxnard received $2,500 for participating.  
</P>
<P>
 Rezinas was willing to risk being silly, but he drew the line at lip-syncing a 
line about marijuana in the song "La Cucaracha," which the students chose to 
perform for the program to be televised on a cable television station in 
Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
 In "La Cucaracha," the lyrics reflect the viewpoint of Pancho Villa and his 
soldiers during the Mexican Revolution in the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the word cucaracha means cockroach in Spanish, Oxnard High bilingual 
teacher Augustin Lopez said that, in one interpretation of the folk song, 
cucaracha refers to a broken-down car owned by the revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The song's chorus refers to the cucaracha as being unable to move because it 
does not have "marijuana para fumar ," or marijuana to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for a funny song and a funny skit," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, the students and Rezinas agreed that it wouldn't be appropriate 
for a principal to sing, or even to lip-sync, about an illegal drug. 
</P>
<P>
 So they changed the lyrics to refer to the cucaracha as being unable to move 
because it does not have a principal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the skit, Rezinas and the students wear traditional Mexican garb and act as 
if they are fighters in the Mexican revolution, with Rezinas playing Pancho 
Villa. 
</P>
<P>
 Rezinas said he learned about the lip-syncing contest when he was a principal 
in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the scholarship money from the contest is attractive, the best part 
of rehearsing and performing the skit has been getting better acquainted with 
students in the school's bilingual program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such students "frequently don't participate in athletics," he said. "They 
don't participate in some of the other social activities. We're always trying 
to make contact with those students." 
</P>
<P>
 The students said they also enjoyed getting to know Rezinas. But some said 
they are relieved that the principal lip-syncs rather than sings the song 
because of Rezinas' accent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows the song, but it's kind of funny to hear Spanish words with an 
English accent," said Celeste Mercado, a sophomore. MAIA DAVIS

<P>
 A team from the state Department of Education visited A.G. Currie Middle 
School last week to evaluate the school's programs as part of the process for 
selecting this year's best schools in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was among 103 middle schools and 76 high schools across the state 
nominated for the 1994 California Distinguished School award, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous honor," said Dan Brooks, principal of the school, where 
more than 1,000 students are enrolled. "The students can start walking with 
their heads held high." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time the school has been nominated for the award, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another school in the Tustin Unified district, Foothill High School, has also 
been nominated for the award. The schools were culled from an original list of 
more than 700 schools, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners will be announced in April. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CRITICISMS STALL CITY'S GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Approval of the city's general plan has been delayed because of objections 
from property owners and local church leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Some property owners are objecting to limits on traffic that future 
developments will be allowed to generate.And church leaders are against a new 
zoning designation for churches that they say could reduce the value of church 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners and consultants have been working on the document for the past 
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 After two hours of public hearings last week, the City Council postponed 
approval of the general plan and directed city staff to try to resolve the 
problems with the property owners and church leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Bouvier, the city's building and planning manager, said the matter 
could come back to the council in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The general plan would create "planned development areas," which would allow 
mixed land uses, such as residences within commercial zones, to give developers 
more flexibility, Bouvier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six such sites have been identified, including existing mobile-home 
parks, which could be converted to other uses in the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But city planners are placing limits on the amount of traffic that each 
development could generate to control congestion and comply with state 
pollution, noise and other requirements. BERT ELJERA

<P>
 Dana Donnelly was 29 and working as a nurse three years ago when she was 
diagnosed with lupus, a little-known disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to cope with at first," said the Garden Grove resident, who has 
had inflamed lungs, memory loss and hip problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a loss. I was not the same person I was before. I couldn't do the same 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Donnelly said her situation has been eased by the Orange County Lupus Support 
Group, which will hold its next meeting April 20 at Anaheim Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The group offers people with lupus and their families a chance to meet and 
talk about how they cope with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest speakers share the latest medical data and give information on other 
support services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave me back my self-esteem," Donnelly said. "The group gives me a chance 
to verbalize my feelings and meet people who are dealing with the same things I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
 Lupus has many different symptoms, from rashes and joint pains to kidney 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition affects people of all ages, but women in their child-bearing 
years are especially susceptible, Donnelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The topic of the April 20 meeting will be how families deal with lupus. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting starts at 7 p.m. at the hospital, 1211 W. La Palma Ave., Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the group plans to have an attorney discuss how those with lupus can 
receive Social Security benefits.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura city fire officials Sunday were investigating two suspicious blazes 
that broke out within an hour of each other in a Ventura Avenue neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the 100 block of East Simpson Avenue reported a house fire about 
1:30 a.m. Sunday; the home was fully engulfed when fire crews arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency crews were able to extinguish the fire within 20 minutes, but the 
structure at 128 E. Simpson Ave. suffered $50,000 in damage, and the family 
lost possessions worth $5,000, fire investigators said. A neighboring house had 
paint damage. 
</P>
<P>
 A second fire was reported about 45 minutes later at the Westpark Recreation 
Center, a facility in the 400 block of West Harrison Avenue, about four blocks 
from the first blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators estimated damage to the park facility at $250. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in either fire. Investigators said both are still under 
investigation. JEFF McDONALD

 The City Council has voted unanimously to allow a collector of antique cars to 
build an eight-car garage almost as large as his house, a proposal opposed by 
the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold S. Beckman was seeking a conditional use permit to create 1,251 square 
feet of garage space where he could store and work on his antique 
cars.(Beckman's home is 1,284 square feet.) 
</P>
<P>
 Beckman told the council last week that he is preparing a 1956 Ford truck for 
show and needs a space where he can do the delicate cleaning it requires. He 
argued that he would not do any heavy construction or spray-painting and 
probably would not produce much noise. His Harley Davidson motorcycle, he said, 
is probably is noisier than any of his tools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to enjoy myself and play with the toys that I want to play with," 
Beckman, a 20-year resident, said. Beckman said he has been fascinated by 
antique cars since high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners voted 4 to 1 to oppose the project, arguing that such a 
garage would be too big for a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis said that she wants more residents to be able to park 
their cars off public streets and that she does not think the project will 
disturb neighbors. Two of Beckman's neighbors spoke in favor of his plans.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA LA HABRA; 2 CITIES ORDER CUT IN CABLE TV RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brea and La Habra city council members have ordered Century Cable to cut the 
price of basic cable television rates and pay refunds to subscribers in the two 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, approved Thursday, La Habra subscribers will see a $2.98 
cut in their monthly basic service charge and Brea subscribers will see a $1.52 
reduction each month. La Habra's new rate for 32 channels will be $21.54 a 
month, and Brea's rate for 38 channels will be $23 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable companies across the nation changed their rates Sept. 1 to comply with 
the Federal Cable Act of 1992. The law granted cities the right to regulate the 
cost of the most basic cable service. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants hired by Brea and La Habra concluded that subscribers had been 
overcharged since Sept. 1, and the councils made the newly adjusted rates 
retroactive to that date. Customers can expect to see changes in their bills 
beginning in May, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, both cities voted to drop Century's hourly service charges from 
$15.89 to $12.02. The charge for some television-top cable boxes will drop by 
79 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The municipalities held public hearings on the cable rates Thursday. The cable 
operator did not comment at the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, more than 600 residents called city officials in both cities 
to complain about their cable rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting for years to have some type of say," La Habra Councilman 
Juan M. Garcia said. "It gives me great pleasure to be a part of this" action 
to order rate cuts and refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing something good for the community," Brea Councilwoman Bev Perry 
said. "It's the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Century Cable has about a month to respond to the councils' decision and 
develop a plan on how it will refund its customers money, city officials said.

MOTORCYCLIST FATALLY INJURED IN COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24-year-old Rancho Palos Verdes man sustained fatal head injuries Sunday 
after he lost control of his motorcycle on California 150 west of Osborne Road 
and collided with a westbound motorist, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcyclist, whose name was not released pending notification of next of 
kin, was traveling east near Santa Paula about 12:20 p.m. when he failed to 
negotiate a sharp right-hand curve, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcycle crossed over the double yellow lines and struck the side of a 
car driven by Joseph Fallowfield, 60, of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officials said the motorcyclist was driving in excess of the posted 35 
m.p.h. speed limit at the time of the accident. Authorities said Fallowfield 
could not have avoided the collision and was not at fault. He was not cited. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens said investigators believe that 
the man, who was wearing a helmet, most likely hit a wet spot in the road, 
causing him to lose control of the motorcycle. J. E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; TALKING KIOSK OFFERS FACTS ON TOXIC 
WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's the best way to dispose of hazardous household products? What toxic 
chemical is contained in latex paint? Where do contaminants go when they're 
flushed down a storm drain? 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask the friendly talking kiosk on display at Thousand Oaks City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The kiosk, with its interactive software and full-color graphic displays, 
reacts to a light touch on its notebook-sized screen. It offers a quiz on 
household hazardous waste, short narratives describing Ventura County's efforts 
to safely dispose of toxic substances and other information on hazardous 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first week in Thousand Oaks, the display has attracted dozens of 
students, who listen and learn as their parents conduct city business at nearby 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of misconceptions concerning household hazardous waste, 
and this provides an enjoyable way to learn about it," said Grahame Watts, the 
city's recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The talking computer has arrived in time for the city's annual Household 
Hazardous Waste Collection Day, which will take place from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
April 16. 
</P>
<P>
 To dispose of paint, oil, pesticides, batteries and pool chemicals on 
collection day, residents must make appointments through the recycling hot 
line, 496-8679, or City Hall, 497-8611, Ext. 339. 
</P>
<P>
 After a six-week stint in Thousand Oaks, the hazardous waste kiosk will rotate 
to other Ventura County cities and may put in guest appearances at Earth Day 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The county paid for the $10,300 kiosk using money collected from garbage 
hauling fees in unincorporated areas, said Mark Delin, a waste management 
analyst with Ventura County. STEPHANIE SIMON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; PLANNING PANEL OKS BREWERY INSTALLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to install a small brewery in a historic building in the downtown area 
have been unanimously approved by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual new business -- the first of its kind in this city -- will be 
installed in a 60-year-old "Heisler Building" on South Coast Highway, which 
also houses the Jolly Roger restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Laguna Beach Brewing Co. will feature two-story fermenting tanks at 
the back of the building and an upstairs "brew pub" in the space where the Sail 
Loft was previously located. Patrons will be able to watch as barley and hops 
are transformed into lager and ale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an interesting use, (and) it's going to be wildly successful," said 
Planning Commissioner Norm Grossman, who with his colleagues endorsed the 
project last week. "They really have no competition. When you look at some uses 
and see there's an opening in the market, this seems to be one of those." 
</P>
<P>
 The beer will not be bottled to go since Laguna Beach has a law restricting 
the sale of alcohol for off-site consumption within 200 yards of Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the new business, who for the past year and a half also have 
operated the Huntington Beach Beer Co. near that city's pier, say they hope to 
open in Laguna Beach on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really excited about coming to Laguna," said architect Jeff Bergsma, 
who is starting the business with his partners Michael Fein and Peter Andreit. 
"We think that the people in Laguna will be the kind of people who would enjoy 
a hand-crafted beer, and we like being in beach cities." 
</P>
<P>
 As a condition of approval, planning commissioners instructed the business 
owners to install equipment to ensure that the odor of hops doesn't leak into 
the air and annoy neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 They also will restore the 11,082-square-foot building, which is listed on the 
city's Historic Register with the highest rating due to its historical 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The E-rated provincial revival building contributes greatly to the quality of 
downtown Laguna," city staff member Ann Larson said. "It's in excellent 
condition and is a prime historic architectural example." LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; RECREATION CENTER UPDATES EXPECTED

<P>
 The progress of negotiations between city officials and nonprofit 
organizations over the leasing of city-owned recreation centers will be updated 
at tonight's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been working to lease four recreation centers in the wake of a 
recent report that said operating them would cost taxpayers about $1 million 
per year.The council has assured concerned users of the centers that the city 
would try to find nonprofit, recreation-oriented groups to run the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Several organizations have stepped forward, and council members asked city 
staff to update the status of negotiations for the recreation centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra recreation center, which was closed earlier this year because of 
dwindling attendance, is being eyed by the Boys Scouts of America. The group 
has talked to city officials and visited the site, which has a pool and meeting 
facilities. Saddleback College, two preschools and a swim school have also 
expressed interest in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary candidate for the Montanoso center is the Lake Mission Viejo 
Assn., which maintains Lake Mission Viejo. The facility has tennis courts, a 
pool and spa. Other groups considering leasing the center are the Carden 
Academy of Basic Education and a preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 For the largest of the four recreation centers, the Marguerite center, city 
staffers are considering proposals from the YMCA and Sports Leisure Group. The 
latter is currently under contract with the city to run all city recreation 
centers.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; ARROYO FACES STUDY OVER SEWAGE IMPACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council will consider today spending $47,000 in addition 
to $226,000 it has already spent to study a stretch of the Arroyo Simi where 
the city sewage treatment plant discharges effluent. 
</P>
<P>
 Information from the biological assessment will be used to help set new 
standards for the quality of treated sewage discharged into the Arroyo Simi, a 
seasonal creek that winds through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is concerned that standards being considered by the Regional Water 
Quality Control Board are so stringent that the city will have to spend "tens 
of millions of dollars" to upgrade the treatment plant, said Ronald Coons, Simi 
Valley's public works director. 
</P>
<P>
 "The regional board is considering viewing the arroyo in the same way as they 
would view a stream with salmon in it," Coons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coons said the daily discharge of water from the plant has benefited the 
arroyo, which would otherwise be dry most of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental consulting firm of Montgomery Watson of Pasadena will 
perform the biological assessment, which will include a detailed study 
comparing the water quality in the arroyo above and below the site where the 
plant discharges its treated sewage. SCOTT HADLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; SENIORS EMBRACE COMPUTER NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Computers are almost an obsession for Dorothy Wallace. Ever since the 
77-year-old retired hospital administrator started taking computer classes 
three months ago, hardly a day goes by that she doesn't work to perfect her 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't felt this good since I learned to bowl at age 63," she said while 
waiting for a desktop publishing class to begin at the Morningside of Fullerton 
retirement community. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace is one of an increasing number of senior citizens who are embracing 
the computer revolution and learning to use personal computers to perform 
common tasks, such as writing letters, keeping financial records, or making 
greeting cards. Some have even expanded their circle of friends by 
communicating on a nationwide computer network called SeniorNet, designed 
especially for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the computer age had passed me by and it hasn't," Wallace said. 
"You're never too old to learn something." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Doughton, one of Wallace's classmates at Morningside, said she uses her 
computer every day to keep track of personal affairs and enjoys the publishing 
class where she learns to use complex graphics to make colorful cards and 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Harvey Hennig, 75, is also computer literate and takes an array of 
classes to expand his skills. 
</P>
<P>
 While many of the students at Morningside said they intend to use the computer 
to simplify tasks, others said they enjoy communicating with seniors around the 
country on the SeniorNet. 
</P>
<P>
 SeniorNet is a nonprofit, on-line service in which seniors use a computer, a 
phone and a modem to chat with others around the country about everything from 
grief, gout and grandchildren to World War II memories and sex after age 50. 
</P>
<P>
 To access the network, seniors must pay a $25 annual fee to the SeniorNet and 
join America Online, which costs $9.95 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Doughton says she logs on to the SeniorNet system two or three times a week, 
when time permits, and enjoys talking on several lines, including the "pet" 
line. "I wanted to tell them that I had a new Persian cat . . . and brag a 
little bit," she said. People from other states answered her comments with 
their own cat stories, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors from other parts of the county are also logged on to the SeniorNet and 
have even planned cruises together. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of 39 seniors met in February for a three-day cruise to Catalina 
Island and Ensenada, Mexico, said John Roberts, an 80-year-old Mission Viejo 
resident who publishes a SeniorNet newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said he spends as much as six hours a day chatting with other seniors 
on the system, and has met several close friends. "When I first got on, I was 
very shy," he said. "Now I am completely the other way." Roberts and his 
friends have also planned trips to Reno, Nevada, and Las Vegas. "We're always 
thinking about things to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes at Morningside are not sponsored by SeniorNet, but there are two 
SeniorNet centers in Orange County that offer computer classes to the general 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastline Community College in Huntington Beach offers SeniorNet computer 
classes, and the Ruby Gerontology Center in Fullerton has offered courses for 
the past five years, ranging from introductory computer courses to word 
processing to financial planning. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; EDISON CORP. DENIES OWING CITY $58,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California Edison Corp. is disputing the city's claim that the 
company owes three years of unpaid business license taxes, plus penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials billed the utility $58,000 for back taxes plus penalties after 
an outside audit of the city's financial records revealed Edison had not been 
paying the license fee since 1949, when it was awarded a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, however, the city can attempt to collect the money for just the 
past three years. But Edison officials contend that the city's own ordinance 
exempts public utilities from the tax and are refusing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Whittemore, Edison's regional manager for the area that includes 
Placentia, said the city has not tried to collect a business license tax for 
the past 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, in 1992 they told us we had to pay," Whittemore said. "Our 
attorneys read the ordinance, and we contend (that the license fee) does not 
apply to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison is basing its claim on the fact that utilities are not specifically 
mentioned in the section of the municipal code covering business licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the list of categories of businesses subject to licensing, public 
utilities are not listed," Whittemore said. "We feel we are exempt." 
</P>
<P>
 The city demanded the tax from two other utilities, the gas and telephone 
companies. They have paid. The Southern California Gas Co. and Pacific Bell 
agreed to pay the back taxes if the city waived the penalties, which it did. 
</P>
<P>
 But Placentia Finance Director Howard Longballa said public utilities are 
considered businesses that offer a service, a category covered in the municipal 
code. Therefore, they are required to pay the tax, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison turned down a similar deal, Longballa said, and now the city expects 
the company to pay the full amount. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

SHOTS FIRED; PEOPLE IN PARK SEEK COVER; VENTURA: POLICE SAY GUNFIRE RESULTED 
FROM AN APPARENT ARGUMENT BETWEEN TWO GROUPS BELIEVED TO BE RIVAL GANGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fight erupted Sunday afternoon at a normally quiet Ventura park, sending 
dozens of people running for cover from gunfire and flying rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 One youth was reported to be injured in the incident, and police detained one 
man for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 An argument between two groups believed to be rival gangs apparently sparked 
the violence, which broke out around 5 p.m. at Hobert Park near Petit Avenue 
and Telegraph Road, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they heard as many as four shots fired during the melee, 
touching off panic among the 80 to 100 people who were at the park. Witnesses 
also reported the two groups throwing rocks at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 One man was apparently beaten during the incident and taken by friends to a 
local hospital for treatment. As of 7 p.m., however, police could not locate 
the man, who police believe was beaten with a tire iron or baseball bat. No 
other injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who police would not identify was detained on suspicion of committing 
assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we don't have a victim and without a victim we might not have a 
crime to charge our suspect," Ventura Police Capt. Randy Adams said. "We 
believe shots were fired here, but other than through witness accounts, we've 
found no physical evidence yet. So far, we haven't found any guns or even shell 
casings." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Joanna Hernandez, 31, who was in the park to celebrate a 
birthday, the fighting and shooting caused widespread confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the shots rang out, everyone either hit the ground or ran," she said. "I 
don't think it was a full-on gang fight. I just think it started by someone 
saying something to someone else that he didn't like." 
</P>
<P>
 Police were investigating whether the two groups gathered at the tree-lined 
park were gang members from Saticoy and Santa Paula.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: CONVERGING FORCES MAY FUEL A WILD RIDE ON WALL 
STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors who aren't vacationing this week may wish they were by the time it's 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounting pessimism on Wall Street could combine with traditional 
end-of-quarter portfolio shifts to produce wild turbulence in financial markets 
during this holiday-shortened week. 
</P>
<P>
 The only good news is that the markets' penchant for overreaction could 
present opportunities for buyers who can look ahead a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's tone turned sharply negative on Friday, when the bellwether 
30-year Treasury bond yield jumped to 7.01% from 6.95% on Thursday, marking the 
bond's first close above 7% since last May. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market crumbled as bond yields surged: The Dow industrials dropped 
46.36 points to 3,774.73 on Friday, the lowest close since Jan. 3. The broader 
Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 3.77 points to 460.58, its lowest close 
since mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems suddenly ailing the markets are legion, of course. Inflation 
fears are rising despite the Federal Reserve Board's efforts to quash those 
worries by tightening credit. In fact, the Fed's latest quarter-point boost in 
short-term interest rates, last Wednesday, appeared to make investors feel 
worse instead of better about prospects for U.S. stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Whitewater scandal is like a spreading oil spill within the 
Clinton Administration; the shining promise of Third World economic growth has 
been dimmed by the assassination of Mexico's leading presidential candidate and 
by the U.S.-China row over human rights, and North Korea may or may not decide 
to go to war with South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The markets now see bogymen in every direction," laments William Dodge, chief 
investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be tempting to argue that Wall Street is already so negative that 
sentiment -- and stock and bond prices -- can't get much worse. But a 
convergence of special factors could produce a selloff of surprising magnitude 
this week, analysts warn: 
</P>
<P>
 * This will be a four-day week for most traders because most financial markets 
will be closed on Good Friday. The federal government, however, will be working 
Friday, and will report that day on March employment, the first major economic 
statistic for this month. 
</P>
<P>
 If bond investors fear the March gain in jobs will be above expectations -- 
fueling new worries about the economy's strength and about higher interest 
rates -- they will have to exit bonds before Friday because they won't be able 
to sell on the actual news. That could mean heavy dumping of bonds between 
today and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't help that the 30-year T-bond broke through 7% on Friday, leading 
many bond pros to raise their forecasts for rate levels between now and the end 
of the year. John Lonski, economist at Moody's Investors Service in New York, 
said he now expects the T-bond yield to hit 7.3% by year's end. He had been 
forecasting 6.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 * The first quarter ends on Thursday, which means markets will be subject to 
the usual quarter-end window-dressing by institutional investors. Typically, 
many big investors seek to jettison losing investments at quarter's end, so 
clients don't see too many dogs on their quarterly statements. 
</P>
<P>
 End-of-quarter activity this time around may also involve a rush to raise 
cash, as a buffer against further market turmoil. A money manager can raise 
cash by selling his dogs, but late last week it began to look as if some 
institutions were cashing in their winners as well -- stocks such as Chrysler, 
Deere, Motorola and other industrial and technology issues that have led the 
market this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another downward spiral in the dollar's value against key foreign currencies 
last week could translate into renewed selling of stocks and bonds by big 
"hedge funds," many of which invest worldwide and use heavy leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's plunge in early February, when the United States and Japan 
entered their trade war of words, had tripped many hedge funds that had bet on 
a strengthening dollar this year. Because they use leverage, or margin, to up 
the ante in their trading, hedge funds can't afford to stay with a bet for long 
if markets turn against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar finished at 1.666 German marks in New York on Friday, near a 
five-month low. The buck also closed at 104.80 Japanese yen, a drop from 106.10 
a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one of these hits (to the dollar) is a margin call" for hedge funds, 
warns Dean Witter's Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
 * The mutual fund industry will report on February fund purchases later this 
week, but press reports will focus more on March purchase and redemption 
activity than on February results. The latest news isn't likely to be a 
confidence builder for the markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund companies have admitted in recent weeks that the tide of money flowing 
into stock and bond funds late last year has ebbed considerably since Feb. 1, 
as markets have turned ugly. In March, many funds have begun to see net 
outflows of cash as would-be investors hold off, and as nervous fund owners 
cash out rather than ride through market turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, with April 15 looming, more investors will be tallying their tax 
bills for 1993, and that may mean cashing out investments to pay Uncle Sam -- 
especially for high-income investors who underestimated what they'd owe in the 
wake of last year's income tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the risk to markets this week, many Wall Streeters argue that stocks 
and bonds face no serious threat of a crash that would devastate most 
diversified portfolios in the near term. The problem today is more a function 
of investors having had things too perfect for too long, some pros say. 
</P>
<P>
 Until late last year, bond yields had been falling steadily for three years, 
lulling many investors into the absurd belief that they might just fall 
forever. And stock market volatility was so low in both 1992 and 1993, as share 
prices moved steadily higher, that the return of even normal volatility would 
be enough to spook novice and veteran investors alike, at least initially. 
</P>
<P>
 To put it another way, the painful reminder that one can lose money in stocks 
and bonds is settling into investors' psyche this quarter, and that inevitably 
has to translate into some long-overdue selling, probably across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which could mean that stocks are finally subject to the 10% to 15% 
pullback that they have thus far avoided in this 3-year-old bull market. And 
bond yields may be run up another half-point or more in panic selling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you have a period of relative market calm, it is inevitably followed 
by a period of above-normal volatility," warns Morgan White, a principal at 
Woodside Asset Management in Menlo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But keep your eye on the horizon, many Wall Streeters say. For the stock 
market, first-quarter corporate earnings will begin to flow out within three 
weeks, and they should look sensational given the economy's healthy pace. That 
should help support stock prices, especially shares of companies with the most 
to gain from ongoing economic expansion (industrial and technology stocks, 
among others). 
</P>
<P>
 And for the bond market, remember that the higher long-term rates go, the 
faster they become self-defeating. Higher rates should eventually slow the 
economy somewhat, which should dampen the inflation paranoia and create an 
environment wherein rates can fall back again -- at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also worth remembering, however, that if you're more inclined to believe 
in continuing global economic growth over the next few years than a new global 
recession, stocks offer more money-making possibilities than bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Many pros believe that buying stocks on pullbacks still makes sense, but that 
bonds should be sold on any market rallies later this spring or summer, after 
the current deep gloom subsides.

QUAKE VICTIMS FACE BACKLOG OF HOUSE PAYMENTS; MORTGAGES: LENDERS SAY SOME 
CUSTOMERS DESERVE MORE TIME. OTHERS MAY BE ALLOWED TO TACK THE NEW DEBT ONTO 
THEIR LOANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thousands of Southern California property owners whose homes were damaged by 
January's earthquake are bracing for a strong financial aftershock, now that 
the moratorium on their mortgage payments is nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America, Great Western Bank and other major lenders have begun sending 
out letters to more than 10,000 borrowers who were granted 90-day suspensions 
of their house payments while they regrouped from effects of the Jan. 17 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people took us up on our (offer of a) 90-day payment moratorium, and 
we have the right to collect all of those payments when the 90 days are up," 
said Dale Ruby, BofA's senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who had already made their January payments when the earthquake 
struck have a little more breathing room, Ruby said, because they won't be 
expected to come up with four payments until May. 
</P>
<P>
 Most borrowers whose homes were destroyed or who face lengthy repair periods 
have already received long-term relief packages from their lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 But bankers say that most customers simply received a 90-day payment 
moratorium so they could use their cash to meet short-term expenses while 
awaiting aid from federal agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency or Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 With the moratorium almost over, borrowers now must make up for the payments 
they have skipped. "I haven't gotten a letter yet, but I'm just dreading what 
it's going to say," said Mary Ann Davis, a retiree who has skipped about $3,600 
in payments since the quake caused minor damage to a rental house she owns in 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the temblor was enough to send her tenants packing to Arizona, and 
that cost her more than $1,000 in lost rent. Although she has found new 
tenants, they paid only $2,200 to move in -- half of which was gobbled up as 
commission for the leasing agent -- and she does not have the cash to make the 
back house payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders promised that they will try to make alternative payment arrangements 
for borrowers who still are not back on their feet, but cautioned that 
additional financial assistance will be more difficult to obtain a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time around, we gave forbearance to just about anybody who asked 
for it," said Steve Hawkins of Chatsworth-based Great Western, which granted 
payment relief to about 2,500 of its borrowers after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, if you call up and ask for more help, we're going to inspect your 
property and make our decisions on a case-by-case basis," Hawkins said. "We'll 
help you if you really need it, but we're going to have to corroborate your 
story first." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many homeowners will be ineligible for further help, they will not 
necessarily have to write one large check for all the payments they have 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders say that some customers will be allowed to add $100 or $200 to each 
future payment to bring their accounts slowly back up to date, while others 
will be able to add their missed payments to their outstanding balances and pay 
back the money later, when the home is sold or refinanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, most bankers admit that they don't look forward to the difficult 
decisions as to who will get further mortgage relief and who will not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be sending out more than 2,000 letters to borrowers asking 
them to pony up their back payments, which means we'll probably get about 2,000 
phone calls from people who will be screaming bloody murder," an official at 
one large bank said.

 Stewart Cramer, an aerospace worker, said his bank granted him a 90-day 
payment moratorium shortly after the earthquake, which caused an estimated 
$25,000 in damage to his Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cramer has yet to make any repairs, because his lender has not decided 
whether he will have to come up with $5,000 in a lump sum to make up for the 
skipped payments when the moratorium ends next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't have $5,000 lying around, and I won't be able to pay the bank if 
they ask for it," Cramer said. He added that his house was worth $35,000 less 
than he paid for it, even before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason for me to go out and borrow $25,000 to fix the place up if 
I'm going to be in foreclosure in May. I'd just be throwing good money after 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, borrowers such as Cramer -- who have no equity left in their homes 
and therefore little incentive to spend heavily on repairs -- may have a slight 
edge in negotiating with lenders for additional help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banks tend to be more lenient with borrowers who don't have any equity, 
because they're the people who have nothing to lose in a foreclosure," said 
Alan Kheel, a Sherman Oaks real estate attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Kheel said, "some lenders are playing hard-ball with 
longtime borrowers" who have lots of equity, because those homeowners could 
lose thousands of dollars of their own investment if they default on their 
loans.

A SHAKE-UP IN LABOR LAW; WILSON'S POST-QUAKE ORDER STIRS CONCERN FOR 8-HOUR 
DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For Helen Lima, at least one good thing came out of the Northridge earthquake: 
a "flexible" work schedule. Lima, a clerical worker at Valley Presbyterian 
Hospital in Van Nuys, swapped a conventional Monday-through-Friday routine for 
a new schedule giving her four 10-hour workdays and three days off every week. 
</P>
<P>
 But as more employees are granted similar schedules -- sometimes working 35 to 
40 hours spread over three or four long days -- questions are being raised. Is 
it a sign of enlightened management responding to the preferences of 
stressed-out workers? Or is it a back-door assault on the eight-hour working 
day, a historic protection that the U.S. labor movement struggled to win? 
</P>
<P>
 A controversy has been brewing in California over the issue after an order by 
Gov. Pete Wilson aimed at helping workers and employers whose lives or 
operations were complicated by the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The order temporarily frees Southland firms from the state's requirement to 
pay most employees, including part-timers, overtime wages whenever they work 
more than eight hours in a single day. Wilson's intent was to allow employers 
to offer alternative work schedules, thus easing rush-hour congestion on the 
freeways while construction crews make road repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters also regard the waiver as a challenge to anachronistic workplace 
rules that have damaged California's economy by making it a tough place to 
operate a business. But in a state that began passing laws to curb overtime 
work abuses as far back as 1911, labor leaders aren't willing to yield ground 
on the eight-hour day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It remains an emotional issue for anyone with a sense of labor history," said 
Floyd Tucker, a spokesman for the California Labor Federation. "A lot of people 
got their heads busted for this." 
</P>
<P>
 For an example of how the daily overtime law has worked, consider someone 
working 10 hours a day, four days a week. Unless the employer met certain 
strict requirements, the worker was entitled to eight hours of overtime pay for 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so under the governor's new order. Unless workers are covered by union 
contracts providing better terms, they aren't owed overtime until they work 
more than 40 hours for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some union officials fear a hidden agenda behind the Wilson order, sensing an 
effort to give employers the labor law changes they have sought, 
unsuccessfully, for years through their lobbyists in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to kill the eight-hour day to stagger working hours," Tucker 
said. "There are all sorts of alternatives employers can use without whacking 
down the eight-hour day." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, due to union pressure, Wilson is considering revising the order, 
possibly by shrinking the five-county territory where it applies. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most affected by Wilson's order are part-timers and other employees 
who work less than 40 hours a week but who often put in long shifts. Many 
grumble privately that the governor's order -- and their opportunistic 
employers -- are taking money out of their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, plenty of workers have never been covered by the daily 
overtime rule, including salaried professionals and managers and workers whose 
employers flouted the rules all along. 
</P>
<P>
 Some employers don't even know about the Wilson order, and others have decided 
against using it for fear of antagonizing their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 David G. Gossman, a consultant for the Employers Group, a statewide lobbying 
and consulting organization serving 4,500 firms, said he has received hundreds 
of phone calls about the issue. Yet Gossman said that most employers he spoke 
to were not going to do anything because their employees' commuting problems 
were not severe enough to justify schedule changes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, "just because it's OK to do something temporarily, how 
are you going to explain it to your employees? It might be a little awkward to 
explain why you are shutting it (overtime pay) off." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the governor's order say the traditional eight-hour-day 
rules have put California employers at a disadvantage. They note that only 
about five states have such requirements; most states, and the federal 
government, require overtime to be paid only if a worker puts in more than 40 
hours per week, just as Wilson's order now allows in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the story of Hinderliter Heat Treating, a metals-processing firm with 
plants in Tarzana and Anaheim, as well as Texas, Oklahoma and Tennessee. 
Outside of California, the company has found it could operate most efficiently 
by keeping its plants running all day, every day, and by putting workers on 
schedules of 12 hours a day, three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, however, the cost of paying time-and-a-half overtime wages for 
the 12-hour work days has been prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a small company, and every penny counts," said Paul M. Schmidt, a vice 
president at Hinderliter's headquarters in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: The company has thought about moving its California operations to 
Nevada or Utah. With the governor's temporary order in effect, however, 
Hinderliter is experimenting with new work schedules in California resembling 
those it uses elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial reaction is generally upbeat, the company says, although some 
workers resent getting less overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working a couple extra hours a day and then getting an additional 
day-and-one-half off a week is a pretty good trade-off," said Philip P. Stella, 
Hinderliter's district manager for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Other supporters of the governor's order say it allows employers to provide 
flexible schedules for workers who want them. At Valley Presbyterian Hospital, 
employees now on flexible schedules "are very grateful that the hospital is 
willing to let them do this," said Katie Wargnier, the hospital's manager of 
human resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see this as one more way that we've been trying to help them" deal with 
the consequences of the earthquake, she added. The Overtime Pay Suspension 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage employers to offer flexible work schedules in the wake of the 
Northridge earthquake, Gov. Pete Wilson issued an order in January suspending 
the state's daily overtime pay requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 What the order does: When workers put in more than eight hours in a single 
day, but not more than 40 hours during the week, they no longer are entitled to 
overtime. Previously, hourly and other "non-exempt" workers putting in more 
than eight hours in a single day were owed overtime pay, even if they were 
part-time employees. There were exceptions to the rule before, but only in 
certain industries and only if two-thirds of the affected workers approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Who it affects: The order currently applies to Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, 
San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Due to opposition from unions, Wilson is 
considering narrowing the order. The order is supposed to expire when "all Los 
Angeles and Ventura County freeways damaged by the earthquake are open to 
normal traffic" free from rebuilding-related delays. The order does not apply 
to government employees nor union workers whose collective bargaining 
agreements cover their overtime pay rates.

FOOTNOTES /JAMES BATES: SHARK FEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Professional golfer Greg Norman, whose nickname is "The Shark," has been doing 
swimmingly in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 One of golf's top pros, Norman has made nearly $7 million in career PGA 
winnings. 
</P>
<P>
 But that amount pales in comparison to the money he's making from a deal with 
Cobra Golf Inc., a golf club manufacturer in Carlsbad, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cobra document filed last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
provides a rare glimpse at just how lucrative an endorsement deal can be for a 
top golfer. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Norman stands to reap about $7.5 million in an upcoming stock 
offering. He is listed as planning to sell 244,106 shares, according to the 
registration statement, which lists the proposed maximum offering price at 
$30.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just a start. Last year, Norman reaped about $3.5 million selling 
181,115 shares in a separate offering. He's still left with 405,697 shares, 
worth about $12.3 million based on the stock's current value. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all that is a lucrative endorsement deal. The document says Norman 
gets a $500,000 annual retainer through this year, which rises to $750,000 
annually in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 He gets $100,000 if he wins one of the four major golf tournaments, as he did 
when he won the 1993 British Open. Norman also receives a 7% royalty on sales 
exceeding $15 million of products with his name on them, and owns 50% of the 
Cobra equipment licensee in Australia, where he is from. 
</P>
<P>
 Add another $300,000 if he uses the company's "King Cobra driver" on the pro 
tour this year. Metaphor of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 Add the folks at The Trends Journal, a New York newsletter about business and 
social trends, to those coming up with more metaphors for the much-hyped 
information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 In its current issue, the publication says pessimistically that its 
researchers are forecasting that "much of the superhighway bringing us all into 
cyberspace will be littered with junk; that the overwhelming majority of people 
will want nothing more exalting than what they get now from TV." The Zsa Zsa 
Fund 
</P>
<P>
 The recent celebrity Bankruptcy Court filing by Zsa Zsa Gabor reveals a rare 
glimpse into what the stars are buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabor's stock holdings include AT&T, Walt Disney Co., Merck & Co, Nestle, 
Pacific Telesis and Royal Dutch Petroleum. Briefly. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Creative Marketing Consultants, a Michigan consulting firm, found in a survey 
that 64% of the viewers of last week's Academy Awards found the program more 
appealing than last year's broadcast. . . . The same survey found 16% of the 
viewers had seen "Schindler's List," the same percentage of respondents in the 
company's survey a year ago that had seen Oscar winner "Unforgiven." . . . A 
Maryland company sells a watch with President Clinton's picture on it that runs 
backward. . . . Whatever that means: A garlic pill is touted as reducing "the 
risk of free radical oxidation."

POLL FINDS WIDESPREAD CLAIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN WORKPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost a third of all working women say they have been sexually harassed -- by 
men who tend to be in more senior positions -- according to a Harris poll to be 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide survey also found that 7% of male workers said they were 
sexually harassed, most often by women. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims took no action, the poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The survey provides evidence that sexual harassment at work is widespread, if 
not pervasive," said Louis Harris & Associates Inc., which conducted the 
telephone survey of 782 full-time and part-time employees between Feb. 2 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those polled, 18% said they had been sexually harassed at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger workers are more likely to report such incidents, which happen more 
often to black and Latino workers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, 63% said they believed their workplaces to be free of such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who have had problems, just 4% said there is "a lot" of sexual 
harassment at work; 15% believed there is "some, but not a lot;" 17% believed 
there is "a little" harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors were responsible for 38% of the incidents of sexual harassment; 
other senior workers accounted for 25% of them. Equals in the workplace were 
blamed for 15% of all the cases; juniors 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Women were blamed by 59% of the men who said they had been sexually harassed. 
For all the widespread acknowledgment of the problem, the poll said just 39% of 
the women and 32% of the men took any action. The Harris poll has a margin of 
error of 3%.

DISNEY PLANS NEW PARK, PAPER REPORTS

<P>
 Walt Disney Co. plans to open a fourth theme park in Orlando, Fla., as early 
as 1997, mixing wild animals with nature walks and elaborate thrill rides, 
according to a report in the Orlando Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper, citing a confidential Disney marketing video, said the 500-acre 
animal park will have a strong conservation theme.It will compete with other 
animal-themed parks and rides in central Florida, including Tampa's Busch 
Gardens and Universal Studios' planned "Jurassic Park" attraction in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney executives in Burbank declined to confirm the report on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't announced anything yet," said Tom Deegan, a Disney spokesman. 
"Until we announce it, we look upon it as speculation." But he said Disney has 
considered adding a fourth park in Orlando since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney sources said the park's design is constantly being revised. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney already has three theme parks in its complex near Orlando: the Magic 
Kingdom, Epcot Center and the Disney-MGM Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Magic Kingdom, the newest park will be divided into several lands 
with a central hub, according to the video, which has been shown in a marketing 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 A giant Tree of Life, the park's icon, rises in the midst of the setting, in 
the style of the Sleeping Beauty Castle. 
</P>
<P>
 The lands may include a Beastly Kingdom, which features imaginary animals from 
storybooks and fairy tales; Dinoland, Disney's answer to "Jurassic Park," which 
invites guests on an archeological dig; Africa, where guests can see wild 
animals and witness the capture of poachers, and Asia, which features rides 
through simulated rain forests.

 Turner Reported Mulling Bid for Shopping Network: Turner Broadcasting System 
Chairman Ted Turner is considering buying Home Shopping Network, according to a 
report in the weekly newspaper Variety. Turner is mulling the deal in part to 
acquire the 11 UHF television stations that the home shopping giant owns 
through its Silver King Communications unit, the report said. Variety quoted 
one source as saying Turner would like to use the stations as the linchpin for 
another broadcasting network, employing his production resources in 
entertainment, sports and news to reprogram the channels for mass appeal.

 Nintendo, Atari Games Reach Settlement: Nintendo of America Inc. and Atari 
Games Corp. said they have settled all litigation between them regarding 
alleged patent and copyright infringements and antitrust violations. In a 
statement, both sides said most terms were confidential.Each party agreed to 
dismiss all claims, including judgments of patent infringement and copyright 
infringement previously awarded to Nintendo against Atari Games. Also, Nintendo 
receives certain unspecified payments as well as certain patent licenses from 
Atari Games, which again becomes a Nintendo licensee. The settlement is the 
result of a lawsuit initially filed by Atari Games in 1988. Nintendo of 
America, based near Seattle, is a subsidiary of Nintendo Co. Japan, the world's 
largest manufacturer and marketer of video games. Atari Games, based in 
Milpitas, Calif., is a privately held corporation and is a developer and 
manufacturer of coin-operated video games.

 Tuna Recalled in California, 16 Other States: Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. said it 
is recalling some 6 1/8-ounce cans of water-packed solid white tuna sold in 
plastic-wrapped multipacks because some of the cans may be damaged. The San 
Diego-based canner, in a recorded toll-free telephone message to consumers, 
said: "While we believe there is little or no health or safety risk involved,

 Nationwide Check on Inflation Ordered: China's leaders have ordered a check 
into soaring prices and unrestrained capital investment as inflation bites 
jittery consumers harder.The official People's Daily announced that the State 
Council (Cabinet) has ordered city and provincial leaders to make a full 
investigation into pricing as official urban inflation hit nearly 26% in 
February. The checks will focus on household goods, as well as products such as 
rolled steel, electricity, coal, petroleum and chemical fertilizer. China's 
last major brush with inflation occurred in the late 1980s, culminating in the 
1989 Tian An Men pro-democracy protests that the government put down with tanks 
and troops.

 Two Rival Stock Exchanges Unified: Ending three decades of rivalry that 
stifled trade, the Philippines completed the long-delayed electronic 
unification of its two stock exchanges.The Manila and Makati floors continue to 
trade at separate locations in the capital, but each transaction is now matched 
by a computer link, and standardized share prices are listed under the new 
Philippine Stock Exchange. Exchange executives said the merger, which had been 
delayed for more than a year because of political disputes and technical 
problems, will simplify trading and boost foreign investment. Japanese mutual 
fund investors and brokers have already indicated they will invest additional 
funds in the Philippines once the unification was completed.

 GNP Rose in 1993: South Korea's gross national product rose 5.6% in 1993 from 
the previous year, up from 5.0% in 1992, according to the Bank of Korea.The 
central bank said active construction and services industries, steady growth in 
capital investment and brisk exports contributed to the rise in the GNP. GNP 
amounted to $328.7 billion last year, the central bank said. Per capita income 
came to $7,466, it said.

CHINESE LINE UP TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS; INVESTING: PUBLIC ISSUES ARE SO POPULAR 
THAT A LOTTERY SYSTEM WAS SET UP TO CHOOSE WHO MAY BUY SHARES. SALE PROCEEDS 
ARE USED TO PAY FOR DEVELOPMENT.

 Thousands of people lined up at banks across Beijing on Sunday for a chance to 
buy shares in four state-run companies. It was the first such public offering 
made by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and security guards, some armed with electric batons, were mobilized to 
prevent a recurrence of rioting that broke out less than two years ago in the 
southern boom town of Shenzhen over a similar public issuing of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Lines formed before dawn at some banks and other financial institutions 
authorized to accept applications to buy the stocks. By mid-morning, nearly 300 
people were patiently waiting outside two banks in the main central shopping 
districts of Xidan and Wangfujin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying my luck," said a 38-year-old government employee waiting to buy 
Beijing Department Store stock. "I'll just buy a few to try it out." 
</P>
<P>
 "This company is pretty good," said another potential investor who gave only 
his surname, Dou. "Everybody in Beijing goes there to shop, so people trust 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the crowds attests to the continuing attraction to stocks as 
Communist China shifts to a market economy. Other major forms of investment, 
such as bank savings and national bonds, have yields far below the inflation 
rate in China's cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1992, more than 1.2 million people flocked to Shenzhen to buy 
application forms for stocks at 11 financial institutions. Rioting broke out 
when the would-be investors accused bank officials, and authorities of hoarding 
the forms or selling them privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing authorities, determined to avoid further rioting, named more than 300 
locations to accept deposits for three days from people who want to buy shares. 
The deposit receipts will be entered next month in a lottery to determine who 
can buy shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the long lines, the stock frenzy that gripped the nation in recent 
years may be easing as Chinese realize that shares can decline in value as well 
as rise. Last week, stock prices fell on the nation's two stock exchanges, and 
the Shenzhen market's index hit its lowest point for the year. The other 
exchange is in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those standing in line on Sunday said they were aware that stocks 
could be risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Beijing people are relatively conservative," said Dou, a 39-year-old 
employee of a handicraft factory. 
</P>
<P>
 "At most, they won't put more than a third of their savings" into shares, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other companies, issuing a total of 175 million shares, are Beiren 
Printing Machinery, Beijing Light Bus and Beijing Town County Trade Center. 
They are expected to be listed on the Shanghai exchange, but no date for the 
listing has been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The official China Daily said the offering was city's first. The proceeds will 
pay for technology, product development and new plants, the paper said.

FROM RAW-GOODS SUPPLIER TO FINISHED EXPORTS; MALAYSIA: LATEX PRODUCTS AUGMENT 
INCOME, BUT U.S. CONDOM TESTS SCREEN OUT MANY IMPORTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Seven years ago, Malaysia's rubber industry faced declining prices and 
increasing competition from other Southeast Asian nations to be the world's 
leading supplier of raw latex. 
</P>
<P>
 While Malaysia remains a major exporter of the commodity, it has in the 
intervening years developed a substantial manufacturing segment that has become 
a leading exporter of finished rubber products -- chiefly gloves and condoms -- 
and thus added value to a flagging natural-resource industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for latex gloves and condoms is booming because of worldwide concern 
about containing the spread of AIDS. One result: Malaysia has more than doubled 
its condom exports since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The greater emphasis on producing manufactured goods "is in line with the 
structural change in the Malaysian economy, transforming from an agrarian to an 
industrial economy," said Ng Kok Tee, deputy chairman of the Malaysian Rubber 
Exchange and Licensing Board, the government agency that oversees rubber 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
 With subsidies and other incentives from the government, Malaysia's rubber 
producers are diversifying. Take Sime Darby, for example. The 83-year-old, 
Kuala Lumpur-based company -- known throughout Asia for its vast rubber 
plantations -- now makes latex gloves and condoms, tires and medical products 
and is a developer of residential and commercial properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversifying into manufacturing was a natural move for Sime Darby because of 
its ready access to raw materials. "We own the land, we own the trees, so, it 
seems to be a logical thing to do," said Sunny Yap, marketing coordinator for 
Sime Darby's latex division, a maker of gloves and condoms. Sime Darby's 
Seattle-based subsidiary is currently awaiting regulatory approval to 
distribute condoms in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of companies such as Sime Darby in the exporting of condoms has 
not been matched by increases in domestic sales, however. Government policy, 
reflecting Malaysian traditions and moral attitudes associating the use of 
condoms with promiscuity, bans condom advertising and severely restricts sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't advertise condom products through the mass media. That's the 
problem," said Kim Bum Ki, managing director of Hevealactics International, a 
South Korean-Malaysian venture that produces condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half Malaysia's population is Muslim, a religion that forbids using 
condoms as contraceptives and holds that they should be used only within 
marriage to protect against the transmission of disease, said Dr. Maher 
Hathout, a spokesman for the Islamic Center of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion is not a factor in condom manufacturing, however, Hathout noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commodity in itself cannot be good or bad; the way it's used is the 
decisive factor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysian manufacturers say they can live with the domestic restrictions 
because their home market is so small. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the much larger U.S. market is a source of concern. As worldwide 
condom exports have grown each year, Malaysian sales in the United States have 
remained slow. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. regulations play an important role in limiting the volume of Malaysian 
condom sales, manufacturers say. Some charge that the Food and Drug 
Administration, which must test and approve all condoms, has unfairly rejected 
Malaysian products to protect U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manufacturers don't want to sell in the United States because (the) FDA is 
protecting local suppliers -- most of Malaysian exports face rejections from 
FDA," Kim said. The company has stopped trying to export to the United States, 
he said, and instead concentrates on meeting increased demand from Asia and 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 An FDA spokeswoman said the agency's policy is not motivated by protectionism. 
"It doesn't matter who manufactures the condoms -- it's all held to the same 
standards," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts said the delays and other problems that Malaysian 
manufacturers encounter in seeking FDA approval are, in part, a result of the 
great distance between the two countries. For instance, FDA officials cannot 
easily inspect Malaysian manufacturing plants, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. manufacturers may encounter fewer problems winning FDA approvals, they 
say, because the FDA has likely been able to inspect domestic plants and has 
followed the process from inception. Their lack of familiarity with foreign 
manufacturing processes may lead inspectors to test imported condoms more 
stringently, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, industry experts said, a more significant factor limiting Malaysia's 
U.S. sales is the strength of companies that already dominate the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. market is controlled by three condom manufacturers: Carter Wallace, 
which makes the Trojan brand; Schmid Laboratories, which makes Sheik, and 
Ansell Inc., which sells the Lifestyle brand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very difficult market to break into," said James S. Murphy, an 
industry expert who has worked for major American condom manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Malaysian products were priced lower than brands already established 
in the market, brand switching is unlikely because of the nature of the 
product, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you pay 50 cents for a product you can trust, or 25 cents for a product 
you haven't heard of? Are you going to worry about that quarter?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysian manufacturers may have some success with joint ventures in the 
United States, however. 
</P>
<P>
 One such venture involves Line One, a Los Angeles-based trading company. Once 
merely a representative of a Malaysian manufacturer, Line One became an 
investor in the Malaysian plants. 
</P>
<P>
 With some control of manufacturing, Line One has been able to help the 
Malaysians make products to meet FDA standards, said Robert Gruber, Line One's 
sales manager. "We have better ties with factories overseas, so we can be 
updated with FDA regulations and keep (factories) updated," Gruber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture now sells condoms, under the names Ria and Trustex, to government 
health agencies and novelty stores in the United States, such as Condomania. 
Exporting Condoms 
</P>
<P>
 Falling prices and a labor shortage have slowed Malaysia's production and 
export of rubber, but the nation has significantly increased production and 
exports of finished rubber products including condoms and gloves.

 Intellectual Property Forum Planned: China, stung by charges of soaring 
copyright piracy by private and even state firms, said Saturday it will host a 
major forum on protection of intellectual property rights. The symposium in May 
will bring together more than 200 Chinese and foreign experts to discuss 
strategies for patent, copyright and trademark protection, Xinhua news agency 
said. Vice President Rong Yiren said last week that much needs to be done to 
improve intellectual property protection in China, whose laws are less than 
three years old.

 U.S. Autos and Parts to Be Promoted: The Japan Auto Parts Industries Assn. and 
the Japan Automobile Importers Assn., following the example of the Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Assn., announced plans to promote U.S. autos and auto 
parts.Automobiles and components account for roughly two-thirds of Japan's 
$59-billion trade surplus with the United States. The plan released by the 
Japan Auto Parts Industries Assn., which represents 529 Japanese component 
manufacturers, proposed regular meetings with U.S. auto parts makers to expand 
business opportunities. The Japan Automobile Importers Assn. said it will 
increase the number of import exhibits it holds. The association will also 
encourage its members to expand sales and maintenance networks for foreign 
cars.

 P. ANTHONY BURNHAM 
</P>
<P>
 President, ProActive Institute 
</P>
<P>
 Some by choice and others because of corporate downsizing, most U.S. workers 
change employers -- and even careers -- at least once during their working 
days. P. Anthony Burnham's previous position heading the reorganization of 
Carnation Co. ended in 1990 when his became one of the posts eliminated. So he 
started ProActive Institute in Costa Mesa to help people make the transition 
into a leaner job market. Burnham discussed the current employment situation in 
an interview last week with Times staff writer John O'Dell. 
</P>

 Rockwell Space Systems in Seal Beach said last week it is going to an outside 
vendor for data processing and will lay off 70 people. Disneyland has changed 
its rules for retiree health benefits, and that could force scores of veteran 
employees to quit years earlier than they had planned. Northrop Corp. said it 
will lay off 3,000 workers, most of them in Los Angeles County. It doesn't seem 
to be a good time to be an employee. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the only time we've got and if you are prepared, it can be an exciting 
time. If someone suggested just three years ago that a company like Rockwell 
would hire out its data processing, they'd have been laughed at. That's letting 
outsiders deal with the lifeblood of a business. But that's where we're at now, 
and we are never going back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So where's the excitement? Aren't we talking about layoffs and a lack of job 
security? 
</P>
<P>
 We are really looking at a more secure future. In this new job market, the 
only important thing is results. You, as the employee, must be able to quantify 
the results you can obtain for an employer. The employer hires you to achieve 
those results, and you have a job until you no longer produce results or until 
the employer no longer needs the kinds of results you are capable of producing. 
Security comes from the results we accomplish and the knowledge that we really 
are working for ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 We talk about the new workplace, but the truth is that there is nothing new. 
We are just going back to basics. The 1960s, '70s and '80s spoiled us because 
we got dependent on someone else -- the employer, the corporation -- to provide 
security for us. It was our tenure, not what we contributed on a daily basis, 
that determined our job security. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing uncomfortable about the "new" employment market is that it puts 
responsibility and accountability back on the individual, and we're not used to 
that. But think about the pioneers, even our grandparents and 
great-grandparents. They struck out and did what they had to do, and nobody was 
holding their hands. They would be shocked at how spoiled we have become. And 
now we are going back to that kind of very basic approach. We're going back to 
reality, to our roots as individual entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 And when you understand that and understand that you really do work for 
yourself and are responsible for marketing yourself and training yourself, then 
you have gone a long way to being secure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Won't the continual turnover of employees cost employers more in training than 
they'll save on the payroll? 
</P>
<P>
 No. Changes in technology already mean that employers are offering constant 
training. The people taking advantage of it are the employees they want. And as 
we move forward, more and more employees are going to insist on training, maybe 
even if it means less direct pay, because the trade-off is they will be better 
prepared for the next generation of jobs, and that will make them more secure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How do we learn to shed our old habits? 
</P>
<P>
 The trend in Orange County, as in much of the country, is that business is 
moving from production jobs to service jobs. But whether you are an assembly 
line worker or an accountant or a middle manager, what you have got to be able 
to do today is to quantify your accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 You have got to be able to tell prospective employers how productive you are 
and how your productivity can transfer from one employment engagement to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic skills for this are the ability to communicate well, in writing and 
verbally. Workers are so bad at this these days that it can give you a big 
competitive edge just to be able to talk and think in terms of the results you 
have obtained in an old position and how you can apply them to a new position. 
</P>
<P>
 Time is money. That's a cliche, but it's never been truer. Companies are doing 
more with fewer people; that's the whole flattened organization concept. There 
are fewer people to focus on the same or even more projects, and the work's got 
to be done quickly, so you've got to have precise communications to make it 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What about actual job skills? Aren't they important? 
</P>
<P>
 Skills training is very important, but people have to learn to become 
entrepreneurs so they can take the results they have accomplished and market 
them. If you just have the skills but are unable to convince an employer or 
employers -- and there will be a succession of them -- that your skills fit 
their needs, then the job skills don't help. You have to be able to show that 
what you bring to the table will contribute results to the bottom line of that 
organization. So you have got to be able to market yourself just as though you 
are a product. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So an aircraft welder who is about to be out of a job should take marketing 
classes instead of learning how to make electronic circuit boards? 
</P>
<P>
 People need to do both. The way to look at it is that you are always employed 
because you work for yourself. You might be between engagements, and that's a 
good time to get some training to better prepare yourself for your next jobs. 
And when you are training, you are working, even though you may not be getting 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 You should be getting training while you have employment engagements and in 
between. That training should include job skills, marketing skills and business 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most important classes anyone can take is one of the many that the 
community colleges, universities and private organizations offer in how to 
start and run a business. Today that's just what every worker is doing. 
</P>

 On American competitiveness. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We got very spoiled and complacent in the '60s, '70s and '80s, and while we

that results were what counted. We are competing with people who got better at 
free enterprise than we were."

OPEC'S FAILURE TO AGREE ON CUTS IN OUTPUT COULD PUSH PRICES LOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News

<TEXT>
<P>
 International oil prices are poised to drop after OPEC ministers gave in to 
Saudi demands that the current oil production ceiling be extended until the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of talks, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on 
Saturday failed to hammer out an agreement to cut output, electing instead to 
hold the ceiling at 24.52 million barrels a day.OPEC produces 40% of the 
world's supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that quota was set in September, oil prices have slumped about 20%. A 
senior OPEC official warned that oil prices may slide further, to single 
digits, if member states don't strictly adhere to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody sees the danger if we don't follow the script," the senior official 
said. "A single-digit price is not excluded." 
</P>
<P>
 West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, for May delivery on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, settled at $15.13 a barrel on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts were divided over the outlook for prices, although few were as 
skeptical as the OPEC official. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means OPEC is not prepared to defend the price of oil," said Mike Rothman, 
senior energy analyst for Merrill Lynch Commodity Research Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Tower, research manager with New Orleans-based Howard, Weil, Labouisse, 
Friedrichs Inc. agreed. "The (U.S.) market may trade off $1 or $2. I can't see 
how you can say this agreement is good." 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts said prices will be steady since the decision was in line with 
expectations.

O.C. ENTERPRISE / GREG JOHNSON: FROM CORPORATE EXECUTIVE TO ENTREPRENEUR; FOR 
RICHER AND POORER, A FORMER HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGER IS LEARNING WHAT OWNING A 
CONSULTING FIRM MEANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Human resources consultant D. Mark Carneal often makes his clients climb 
15-foot walls and jump off a 12-foot perch to foster team spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Running the obstacle course, Carneal says, teaches team building and engenders 
trust among managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carneal knows a bit about climbing and jumping. Last year, Carneal, a human 
resources executive with Restaurant Enterprises Group, left after a 22-year 
career there and started his own consulting service, Innovative Resources, in 
Irvine. The six-person company offers human resources knowledge to businesses 
wanting to adapt their strategic plans to a fast-changing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving from a large corporation into a small firm has been "scarier than hell 
at times," Carneal, 43, said. "Times are not good right now . . . and every 
month is like a roller coaster. One month you have $30,000 to $40,000 in 
billings, and the next month you have only $6,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Carneal acknowledges having made mistakes. He drew a reprimand from his 
accountant after paying cash for office furniture when he could have arranged 
for credit and not drained the company's limited cash supply. One of his 
biggest regrets, he says, is having waited until after starting up before 
hiring a publicist. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to start marketing yourself before you open the doors," Carneal 
said. "We had $200,000 in (contracts) lined up when we opened, but now we're 
scrambling because many of those things are finishing up." 
</P>
<P>
 Carneal says he is confident that Innovative Resources will survive, though, 
because he and his partners followed advice that they regularly give to 
corporate clients: Look before you leap. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a key difference between me and other consultants," Carneal said. 
"And that's the fact that I didn't lose a job. I planned for 24 months in 
advance, in great detail, prior to opening the firm." 
</P>
<P>
 Carneal, who left Irvine-based REG in 1992, also made changes in his personal 
life before completing the career switch. "I began paying things down and 
reducing our standard of living," Carneal said. "And, as a single parent, I sat 
down with my son and had several discussions on why I was entering into this." 
</P>
<P>
 He also contacted people already doing consulting work full-time to ask about 
pitfalls. "Everything (bad) they said would happen is coming true," Carneal 
said, "but because of the planning, everything they said would happen at the 
six-month point was behind us before we started the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's struggling economy has been a hindrance because 
contracts are coming in slowly, Carneal said, but it has also helped Innovative 
Resources to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leases are easier to secure, and it's easier to get a small line of credit" 
with suppliers, Carneal said. His company is also hoping to benefit by 
appealing to companies that need management-level advice but can't afford to 
hire professionals full-time. 
</P>
<P>
 Carneal isn't waiting for business to come to him. "I get flashbacks of all 
the times that I hung up on people" when he was with REG, he said. "Now they're 
hanging up on me. (Consultants) tell you it's one in 10 calls that are 
productive, but I'd say it's more like one in 40 or 50." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than confine itself to Southern California, Innovative Resources is 
marketing itself in Las Vegas, Phoenix, Houston, Dallas and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Innovative Resources' professional staff includes some people who worked with 
Carneal during his corporate years. Jim Moore is another former REG executive, 
and Nellie Attwater did consulting work for REG. Another staffer, Mike Howard, 
has owned several small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is on a long-term profit-sharing plan," Carneal said. "Basically, 
we practice what we preach . . . which is long-term quality service that's 
designed for long-term success."

 Analyst review: "Quantum has established a highly successful service 
enterprise providing care to chronically ill patients in the home. To meet the 
needs of a changing health-care system, Quantum's innovative management team is 
developing an "integrated delivery system" to provide hpspital and specialty 
care along with home care to chronically ill patients. this pioneering strategy 
has risks, but the potential rewards favor our continued buy recommendation. On 
a fully-diluted basis, Quantum should generate at least $1.35 in earnings per 
share in 1994, an increase of about 23% from the just-reported $1.10 for 1993. 
In 1995, earnings per share should grow as fast as operating income."

MACHINE TOOL ORDERS DOWN IN FEBRUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orders for U.S.-made machine tools fell a sharp 22.1% in February, an industry 
group will announce today, signaling a slowdown in manufacturing after a hectic 
pace in the last half of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Tool orders fell to $280.75 million in February from January's revised $360.20 
million, said the Assn. of Manufacturing Technology.The drop was the first 
since last November, when orders fell 7.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 February orders fell 0.7% from $282.65 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the decline, the month's orders were among the best in the industry's 
history, association president Albert Moore said. "That's a good harbinger of 
continued strong growth in order activity during 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Machine tools are used by manufacturers to create their own tools for the 
factory floor. Since orders are made at the beginning of a production cycle, 
they provide an early indication of what production levels will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts expect manufacturing to continue growing this year but at a 
slower rate than in 1993. Last year, manufacturing output jumped 4.6%, with 
much of the increase coming toward the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The heady pace of manufacturing activity from late last year into early 1994 
was fueled mostly by a surge in auto production and aircraft orders. 
</P>
<P>
 But many analysts expect auto manufacturing to fall off in the second quarter 
and the aircraft industry to go into a long-term decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Machine tool orders for export rose 56% to $16.85 million in February from 
$10.80 million in January. But February export orders were down 53.6% from 
$36.30 a year ago.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: SEC PROPOSALS WOULD GIVE INVESTORS MORE INFO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than six decades, mutual funds have operated under a set of laws 
designed to ensure fair play, partly by making certain that investors are given 
sufficient facts to make informed decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But mindful that even good mousetraps can be improved, federal regulators are 
contemplating several new rules that would result in disclosure of even more 
information to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 And rather than complain about additional burdens, many industry officials 
support some of these proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 They see more disclosure as an effective way to deal with the possibility that 
millions of fund investors don't really understand what they own, especially 
now that banks and their customers have arrived on the scene in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of these topics were discussed at a conference in Phoenix last week 
sponsored by the Federal Bar Assn. and Commerce Clearing House Inc. The event 
brought together 1,400 attorneys, accountants and mutual fund administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt got the ball rolling with a keynote speech that 
urged each fund's board of directors to stay "alert, informed and involved" on 
behalf of shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that his own agency's inspection program has been hard-pressed 
to keep up with the fund industry's rapid growth, Levitt affirmed that the 
independent directors in particular are on the "front lines of investor 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the possible regulatory changes would involve directors. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the SEC's staff has recommended that the number of independent 
directors -- those not working for the management company -- be increased to at 
least 50% of a fund's board, from a current minimum 40%. Another proposal would 
give the independent directors, as opposed to the entire board, authority to 
terminate the management company's contract to run a fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these changes would require congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
 Another SEC staff idea, which the SEC's commissioners can approve on their 
own, would require greater disclosure of the compensation earned by the 
independent directors. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some concern that the independence of these officials could be 
undermined as they earn increasing pay, even if it reflects greater 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate proposal, which the commission can also enact, would require more 
disclosure of wrap-fee accounts. With a typical wrap-fee program, investors 
hire a broker and a money manager. The manager puts together a diversified 
portfolio of stocks for the investor, while the broker monitors the manager and 
services the investor. The customer pays a single annual fee of perhaps 2% to 
3% that covers all fees and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 This single-fee arrangement removes the danger that the broker might overtrade 
the account to generate commissions. Still, the fees in many cases have been 
criticized as too steep. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC staff proposal would force wrap-account sponsors to describe their 
fees and other account basics in greater detail. This requirement would also 
extend to banks and mutual fund companies that offer wrap programs using an 
assortment of funds rather than stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to requiring a separate brochure in a new format, the proposal 
would require new types of information to be disclosed," according to Cathy G. 
O'Kelly, a partner in the Chicago law firm Vedder, Price, Kaufman & Kammholz. 
</P>
<P>
 Another disclosure-oriented proposal that awaits SEC approval would allow fund 
companies to sell shares to investors without having to first supply them with 
a full prospectus -- the lengthy legal document that provides information about 
a fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, key facts taken from the prospectus could be summarized in an 
advertisement, and investors could purchase simply by clipping an attached 
coupon and sending in a check. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say this process would make it too easy for uninformed people to 
invest, but supporters contend that shareholders would still receive a full 
prospectus with their first confirmation statement. 
</P>
<P>
 And more to the point, the "summary prospectus" contained in the ad would 
crystallize key points better than full prospectuses do, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The surest path to consumer understanding is through simple, concise 
disclosure," said Matt Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute, a 
Washington-based fund group that supports the plan. Wording of the ads would 
still be regulated. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides the proposals discussed above, there are other regulatory issues 
on the table of interest to fund shareholders, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * A plan that would force tax-free money-market funds to upgrade their 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 * A simmering dispute between the SEC and the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency over which agency should regulate banks entering the fund business. 
</P>
<P>
 * A proposal to raise the fees paid by registered investment advisers to help 
pay for more SEC inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 * A plan to start a self-regulating organization for mutual funds, like the 
one the brokerage industry already has. 
</P>
<P>
 How these proposals might affect shareholders is still under debate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Have brokers been sleeping? 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to reach that conclusion by looking at the 1994 list of "forgotten" 
mutual funds -- strong performers with small asset bases -- compiled by 
Morningstar Inc. of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five are brokerage-sold products, even though no-load funds are 
assumed to have a tougher time making a name for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallest of the group is Franklin Balance Sheet Investment (maximum 1.5% load; 
(800) 342-5236), a growth portfolio that counts just $40 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The other commission products are Connecticut Mutual Growth (5% load; (800) 
234-5606), GAM International (5% load; (800) 426-4685) and Seligman 
Communications & Information (4.75% load; (800) 221-2783). Evergreen Value 
Timing ((800) 235-0064) checks in as the sole commission-free portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seligman fund is the largest of the five at $110 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Associates has unveiled the 1994 edition of its 
"Retirees Financial Guide." The free package ((800) 638-5660) features a 
discussion of topics of concern to seniors and includes a workbook for 
estimating your post-retirement finances. Regulation Gap 
</P>
<P>
 The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission in recent years has 
suggested some changes that would increase both the power and public scrutiny 
of mutual fund directors. Independent directors -- those not affiliated with a 
fund's management company -- are key players entrusted with protecting 
shareholders and preventing scandal. Their role has grown in recent years 
because the SEC has failed to keep pace with fund-industry expansion due to 
budget constraints.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; BREAKING THE SILENCE ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT; BEARING 
WITNESS: SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND BEYOND: EVERYWOMAN'S STORY BY CELIA MORRIS ; 
LITTLE BROWN, $21.95, 326 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 T o bear, that most interesting and female of verbs, can ring like a curse 
shouted by a shrewish God waving a wooden spoon at the gates of Eden: "I will 
greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to 
children." Bearing witness, bearing children, bearing burdens : these stolid 
words evoke fate and history. I much prefer "breaking silence," a phrase Celia 
Morris, a Texan and author of two previous books on women in politics -- 
"Storming the Statehouse: Running for Governor With Ann Richards and Dianne 
Feinstein," and "Fanny Wright: Rebel in America" -- uses throughout "Bearing 
Witness." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, this book gives more space to the stories told by individual women 
than to Morris' analysis; part of a noble and increasingly popular academic and 
journalistic tradition (not unlike the Oprah Winfrey show) in which people bear 
witness and break silence simply by telling their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need colleagues," writes Morris, "committed to the proposition that there 
are no excuses for men who abuse women, as well as friends who will bear 
witness with us -- friends who believe that abuse is unjust and that justice 
matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the book pivots on the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, which 
Morris sees as the point of historical change in attitudes toward sexual 
harassment and women's political power in general. 
</P>
<P>
 But even after the hearings, it still remains difficult to identify sexual 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of us, telling the Neanderthal with the dumb jokes that one more will 
land him in the personnel office is a clear, easy alternative. Others obsess 
for months over whether the gesture the parking attendant makes each morning 
and afternoon is actually a lewd gesture, then end up parking six blocks away 
while the parking attendant goes on making the gesture to other women.  
</P>
<P>
 These are obnoxious but relatively harmless examples. Being touched or forced 
to engage in sexual relationships just to keep your job is a form of abuse not 
unlike slavery (a point Morris makes repeatedly). Being forced to do something 
because someone is stronger than you or has an economic advantage over you is 
like being discriminated against on the basis of race or religion.  
</P>
<P>
 History has shown that people in power are almost incapable of identifying it, 
but why don't we know it the second we experience it? And even if we recognize 
a sinking feeling in the heart, who put all that cotton wool between our hearts 
and our mouths? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps we need a working definition. Morris offers several, including Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg's: "Conduct that on the basis of the employee's sex makes 
it more difficult for one person than another to perform the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the women Morris spoke with expressed a feeling, even if they were 
able to identify sexual harassment, of being powerless to get justice, a 
hopeless feeling that the men harassing them could continue to do whatever they 
wanted, that speaking out would only incur punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these women were indeed punished: They lost their jobs or were 
ostracized in the communities they worked in. Most of them were in their late 
30s or early 40s, and most of them had financial responsibilities. They may 
have gained their dignity and self-respect, but as individuals in institutions 
(many of them academic), most were hung out to dry.  
</P>
<P>
 Institutions change slowly, with much stalling and complaining: Think of 
corporations forced to write environmental impact reports, or to follow 
affirmative action hiring practices. We are correcting for decades of 
imbalance, unfairness, inequity and abuse in all walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
 The word victim appears frequently in feminist literature, and many of the 
women quoted in "Bearing Witness" express or expose a fear of looking like 
victims. Therapy tells us that we want to be in control of our lives, that we 
don't want to be victims. Victims are unappealing, stuck, weak.  
</P>
<P>
 "Women who don't laugh at the old jokes and pratfalls anymore," Morris writes, 
"can be expected to be called humorless, hysterical, shrill, strident. . . . 
The truth is that men are losing control of a potent weapon: the power to 
define what is funny."  
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, we are all victims at one point or another -- on the wrong side 
of a power equation. In order not to remain victims, we must have a variety of 
choices and responses: telling others, telling the person or people harassing 
us, telling authorities who will listen and respond, seeking representation and 
taking legal steps. 
</P>
<P>
 These stories encourage you to think about the Neanderthal with the dumb 
jokes; to try to remember how much time you spent wondering about someone's 
slimy innuendo, or being afraid you were going to be punished. Try out 
Ginsburg's definition and see if the verdict is sexual harassment. Then tell 
someone about it.

LOCAL HERO / VICTORIA WALLER: HELPING BRIDGE THE GENERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every other Friday afternoon from October to June, residents of the Jewish 
Home for the Aging in Reseda gather in the facility's computer room.  
</P>
<P>
 One 86-year-old woman, fingers flying, types a letter at 100 words per minute. 
Others, hampered by arthritis or failing eyesight, dictate letters containing 
memories of childhood holiday celebrations and summer pastimes to a teen-ager 
at a keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters are distributed in Victoria Waller's fifth-grade class at the 
Stephen S. Wise Temple Elementary School in West Los Angeles for the children 
to read and answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the Printer Pal Program, this exchange of computer correspondence 
between the very old and the very young was started in 1990 by Waller to help 
bridge the generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we had to connect children with their grandparents," says Waller, 48, 
a reading specialist, "but I felt first they should connect with someone they 
did not know and then move on to their grandparents." 
</P>
<P>
 Waller approached her school's educational director, Metuka Benjamin, and 
Caryl Geiger, Jewish Home program director, who paved the way for installation 
of computers at both locations. She also recruited her teen-age son, Andrew, 
and daughter Alison to type letters for the women who dictate. Only two women 
participated at first; there are now about 12 at each session, ranging in age 
from 84 to 94.  
</P>
<P>
 Waller chooses the topics for her students -- U.S. Presidents, Passover, 
favorite hobbies, vacations. The children ask questions about the elderly 
residents' lives. The women's responses have included memories of life during 
the Depression, five-cent movies, berry picking and hayrides, and such culinary 
customs as cleaning chickens and keeping a live fish in the bathtub until it 
was killed for gefilte fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups meet only once a year, at a June luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 The students -- who have also included second- and fourth-graders -- are more 
fascinated by the program than she could have predicted, Waller says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love it when I come back with the letters. The kids will get interested 
in certain people, depending on the connection: Maybe someone's father died 
when she was young, for instance. When June comes, they know exactly who they 
want to sit by at lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the women, the computer project has afforded a new skill for some. More 
important, Waller says, "They love remembering. I feel it's important that 
everyone, while we're living, feel worthwhile, and I think that too often, 
senior citizens don't. They need to pass on all this stuff to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Waller encourages her students to videotape oral histories with their 
grandparents. Whether or not they do, she says, "Their parents have said 
there's a difference now in how the kids treat the grandparents. They take time 
to talk with them. They realize that their grandparents don't just sit around. 
They do things, and they have lives."

RECESSION'S PAINFUL VISE SQUEEZES HOMEOWNERS; POLL: O.C. SOUTHERN FOOTHILLS 
RESIDENTS HAVE SEEN HOUSE VALUES PLUMMET. SEVEN IN 10 FIND PAYMENTS A STRAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Roger Harvey used to park his Jaguar and Fiat in front of his hilltop home. 
The cars are gone now. And so is the house, with its back-yard gazebo, 
sparkling pool and spectacular view of Saddleback Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to keep up with house payments and other bills after the recession 
devastated his small, deck-building company, Harvey and his wife were forced to 
sell their house last month at a loss of about $100,000. The couple also have 
separated -- in part, he says, because of the stress over their finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been just crushing," he said, glancing around the two-bedroom Mission 
Viejo apartment that doubles as an office while he rebuilds his company. "I got 
caught in a real crunch with both my house and my business. And now, I've 
basically got all the things I started with -- my guitars and my fishing reel 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Times Orange County Poll of residents in the new southern foothills 
communities has found that many homeowners are finding it difficult to make 
house payments. To make matters worse, because so many bought their homes at 
the market's peak in the late 1980s, they have been caught in a painful vise, 
watching their property values plunge as their payments and taxes remain high. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly seven in 10 poll respondents in Rancho Santa Margarita, Coto de Caza, 
Dove Canyon, Portola Hills, Foothill Ranch and Robinson Ranch said they found 
it at least something of a strain to make their housing payments, including 
mortgage, property taxes, Mello-Roos bonds and other assessments. Even those 
with annual incomes of $75,000 or more indicated that it was not always easy to 
meet their housing-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing prices here have slipped 18% to 20% since the recession began, on par 
with the drop in values for the rest of Orange County, most analysts say. But 
foreclosures in the foothills communities are running at a rate nearly twice as 
high as the countywide figure, according to a recent analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest personal negative for the people living in these new communities 
seems to be that nagging feeling that their house is not going up in value or, 
worse, is worth a lot less than it was," said poll director Mark Baldassare. 
</P>
<P>
 "This, coupled with the financial strain that most people say they're going 
through to make their payments, is leading to some real stress for them," added 
Baldassare, an urban sociologist at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 In another indication that money may be tight for many families, the poll 
showed that the area has fewer mothers who have stayed home after their 
children were born. More than seven of every 10 respondents who described 
themselves as married with children also said that both husband and wife work, 
compared to 64% for the county as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden collapse of the real estate market had the effect of crushing the 
equities of many who bought homes at the end of the 1980s, an effect that was 
magnified here because so many purchased their homes during that period, said 
Kenneth Agid, an Irvine real estate consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very cruel process," Agid said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, despite the recession and its attendant travails, the poll found 
extraordinarily high levels of satisfaction among residents of the region. 
Eighty-two percent here said they had "very favorable" views of their 
communities, compared to the 58% who gave the same response in a recent 
countywide survey. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also encouraging signs here that the housing market, on the decline 
since early 1990, may finally have hit bottom: a relatively brisk rate of sales 
at new developments in Dove Canyon, a sharp rise in home sales countywide in 
December, and "just a lot of people in the building industry beginning to get 
confidence" again, according to Richard B. Peiser, director of USC's center for 
real estate development. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one doesn't need to look far in these communities to find evidence of 
financial distress, at least for some. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in Rancho Santa Margarita, there are currently 70 homeowners who 
are involved in foreclosure proceedings on their single-family, detached 
houses, a rate about twice that of Orange County as a whole, according to 
Dataquick Information Systems, a real estate database service. 
</P>
<P>
 In the neighboring communities of Coto de Caza, Dove Canyon and Robinson 
Ranch, the foreclosure rate was equally high, said John Karevoll, financial 
editor of Dataquick. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember the ratio is disproportionately high because there's a 
much higher number of at-risk properties in these areas than in the county's 
older, more established communities," Karevoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many of these homes were bought close to or at the top of the market. 
Probably half the homes were bought during the past five years," since the 
downturn began, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices have also fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 The median price for a resale home in Rancho Santa Margarita one year ago 
stood at $218,000, according to Dataquick. Now, it has slipped to $187,000, a 
decline of 14%. Karevoll cautioned against reading too much into those figures, 
saying that the houses coming on the market lately, which include a greater 
proportion of homes built since the recession began, are also somewhat smaller 
than those being sold a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Another company that provides real estate statistics to lenders, TRW-Redi 
Property Data, examined a sample of resale transactions in Rancho Santa 
Margarita homes in 1992 and 1993 and found a drop in the median price from 
about $199,000 in 1992 to $191,500 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, property values in the foothills communities, along with those 
throughout Southern California, have declined 4% to 5% in the past year, and 
18% to 20% from the market's height in the late 1980s, according to Karevoll 
and other experts, including several area realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 "People saw prices going up around 1989 and, out of greed or fear, they rushed 
out to buy a house or another house. There was both a real fear of being left 
out and an element of greed in thinking you could make a lot of money in a 
hurry," said Alfred Gobar, a real estate consultant in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that area, a lot of people just went rushing out at exactly the wrong time 
and got caught when the market turned." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Harvey's story reads like a case study of the market's caprice. 
</P>
<P>
 When he and his wife were first married in the early 1980s, they rented an 
apartment in Garden Grove, then moved up to a rented condominium in Costa Mesa, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1983, they had saved $30,000, enough for a down payment on a $135,000 
townhouse in Irvine's Woodbridge community. Benefiting from the market's 
upswing, they sold it in 1989 for $285,000 and moved to the elegant home in 
Rancho Santa Margarita, only to be caught when the crash came. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harveys had bought their home for $330,000 and embellished it with an 
additional $50,000 in improvements, mostly in landscaping, brickwork and the 
back-yard gazebo overlooking the mountains. They sold it for $275,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At one particularly low point, Harvey, 36, said, he drove up to the peak of 
San Clemente Hill, then to Top of the World in Laguna Beach, gazing out from 
each promontory in a vain search for any sign of construction, anything that 
might give him hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had to cut everything way back, put my nail bag back on and go back to 
work," he said, adding that he has been sustained by a renewed religious faith 
and the constant support of his pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, he was forced to let five of his eight employees go, and to use up 
the family's savings and money market accounts to pay his $2,000 monthly 
mortgage and $500 a month in property taxes, half of which was a Mello-Roos 
levy to pay for the new community's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Harvey and many others interviewed are opposed to the additional 
tax. Many areas of the foothills communities are included in Mello-Roos 
districts created under a 1982 state law that allowed local governments to tax 
homeowners to pay for building roads, schools and other public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition has grown enough, in fact, that a large sign on a hillside just 
above Rancho Santa Margarita and below Robinson Ranch advertises: "No 
Mello-Roos." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really irritating," said Riley White, a 44-year-old appraiser who lives 
in Portola Hills. "About a third of our property taxes go to Mello-Roos, but 
what does it get us? We still don't have a high school up here. When our kids 
get to that age, they'll probably take them and ship them off to Lake Forest or 
Mission Viejo." 
</P>
<P>
 By many measures, though, there are encouraging signals for the foothills 
region, both that an economic turnaround is finally in sight and that it may 
reach this area early on. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey, for one, said he has been cheered by a slow but steady increase 
recently in the number of calls from people needing new decks or willing to pay 
for repairs to their old ones. "At least the phone's starting to ring again," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate analysts looking for more scientific measures of a turnaround said 
they, too, see reason for guarded optimism, pointing to increases in 
construction in the area and an end-of-year surge in home sales countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 And several predicted that the foothills region, especially with new roadways 
increasing accessibility from population and employment centers, may be among 
the first in the county to emerge from the slump. 
</P>
<P>
 When the economy picks up, Agid said, there is likely to be a "tremendous 
shortage of new housing supply relative to the potential demand. And what there 
is, it's all concentrated in that region." 
</P>
<P>
 SUNDAY: A look at the people who live in Orange County's southern foothills -- 
and why. 
</P>
<P>
 TODAY: The recession had a crushing impact on residents, who saw their home 
values drop, and on many developers, who had to restructure their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 TUESDAY: Families are flocking to the new suburbs, where parents praise the 
many activities for youngsters. But for the teens, there's not much to do. 
</P>
<P>
 WEDNESDAY: Living so far out means secluded neighborhoods and horrendous 
commutes. Though access is improving, traffic congestion remains a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 THURSDAY: Two-thirds of foothill residents expect to be living in the area 
when 1999 rolls around. But what does that future hold? THE SOUTHERN FOOTHILLS: 
Good Standard of Living 
</P>
<P>
 Contentment is more common in the new southern suburbs than in the rest of the 
county. Part of it can be traced to economic well-being: Suburban dwellers are 
likelier to describe their standard of living as more than comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 * How would you say things are these days? Would you say you're: 03,16,20,15 
Southern foothills Orange County Very happy 45% 27% Somewhat happy 49% 60% Not

 People with higher incomes are much more apt to describe themselves as very

MASSACRE PROBE PUTS ISRAEL ARMY ON DEFENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a million Israelis were glued to their radios and television sets last 
week for an extraordinary broadcast: For the first time in history, an Arab 
judge aggressively interrogated the highest-ranking military officer in the 
land -- live and in color. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of inquiry: just how much blame Israel's security forces must bear 
for a Jewish settler's massacre of about 30 Palestinian worshipers in a mosque 
in Hebron's sacred Cave of the Patriarchs on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 And Israel's military chief of staff was on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The sometimes harsh questioning of Gen. Ehud Barak by the Israeli Arab 
justice, Judge Abdel Rahman Zouabi -- a scene unthinkable to many Israelis -- 
was the latest act in a running drama that has riveted the Israeli public and 
forced many to re-examine their view of the powerful armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two weeks since the five-member Israeli Commission of Inquiry began 
hearing sworn testimony about a massacre that shook the nation, the official 
judicial body has produced an almost daily diet of startling disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 These revelations have reinforced the commission's credibility, even for some 
Palestinians -- who nevertheless have initiated two separate inquiries of their 
own. And the facts have put Israel's once-sacred armed forces on the defensive 
for the first time in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the disclosures from 70 witnesses who have testified before the official 
Israeli commission, which will continue its work for at least two more months: 
</P>
<P>
 * Israeli security at the cave was inadequate at the time of the massacre. 
Three of the six guards who should have been inside when Brooklyn-born 
physician Dr. Baruch Goldstein opened fire at about 5:30 a.m. were sleeping. 
Two others were away from their post. The only guard who was present said it 
was routine for guards to show up late. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, security cameras that should have warned other guards that the 
massacre was under way were either broken or focused elsewhere. If the full 
guard contingent had been present and the equipment working, Barak and other 
senior commanders concluded, the massacre could have been prevented or stopped 
before so many died. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Israeli soldiers who were on sentry duty outside the cave that day said 
in testimony confirmed by their commander that they would not have opened fire 
on Goldstein in any event. They were under orders, they said, never to shoot at 
Jewish settlers, even if the settlers were killing people. Barak and other 
senior commanders called it a "misunderstanding," but commission members have 
concluded that, at the very least, it indicated a breakdown in the chain of 
command. 
</P>
<P>
 * Israeli intelligence and military commanders in the occupied territories 
never imagined or planned for a Jew firing in anything but self-defense. The 
settlers were allowed to enter places of worship fully armed because 
Palestinian attacks on them in the occupied territories had escalated in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite increasing acts of violence by the settlers against Palestinians 
-- a trend so clear that even Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned his 
commanders last October that it was a potentially explosive security hazard -- 
those commanders never drew up contingency plans to defend against such a 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 * There may well have been a second gunman who joined Goldstein in the 
slaughter. Two of the Israeli sentries said they saw a second Jewish settler 
enter the cave before the shooting began. He was armed with a Glilon assault 
rifle, the weapon used in the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein, they said, was carrying an M-16 when he walked past them at the 
cave's entrance. And three Palestinian survivors testified they heard shooting 
from more than one direction. Taken as a whole, the testimony directly 
contradicted the Israeli government's conclusion that the massacre was the act 
of a single settler gone mad. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Palestinians, and even some Israelis, a host of questions remain: Did 
Goldstein, in fact, act alone? Was there a conspiracy that included elements of 
the security forces? Will the commission ever find out? 
</P>
<P>
 For some regular observers, the questions were echoes from another crime in 
another country in another time. They have likened the Israeli inquiry to that 
of the Warren Commission, which never quite satisfied the public demand for 
historical truth after President John F. Kennedy's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli commission has even come to be known by the surname of the chief 
Supreme Court justice who heads it, Meir Shamgar, and skeptics point to several 
apparently critical lapses that have hampered the Shamgar Commission in its 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The cave where the worshipers were gunned down was hosed clean of clues before 
the commission members paid their official daylong visit to the site, which 
remains off limits to the public, to the Palestinian inquiry commissions and to 
the press. And the commission must rely entirely on the military's forensic and 
ballistic data as well as its description of the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five key Palestinian witnesses -- members of the religious board that 
oversees the shrine -- have refused the Israeli commission's invitations to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the religious leaders have testified only before a commission of 
their own creation -- a rival Palestinian inquiry board based in Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative commission underscores the skepticism most Palestinians share 
about the Shamgar Commission. And the existence of a rival Palestinian 
investigation underscores the splits in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 For most in the occupied territories, the slaughter of the unarmed worshipers 
confirmed their worst suspicions about Israeli justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The accused cannot be the judge," said Abdul Aziz Dweik, chief administrator 
of the 11-member Palestinian commission appointed by the shrine's religious 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Dweik, who recently returned to his home in the occupied territories after 
Israeli authorities deported him for a year to a southern Lebanon no-man's-land 
as a suspected fundamentalist extremist, said his group's inquest has persuaded 
him that there were at least two gunmen in the cave that day. And he said he 
suspects that the massacre was the result of a conspiracy involving the Israeli 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 He conceded, however, that his panel's work has been severely hampered by its 
lack of access to the crime scene and to the key Israeli military officers who 
have testified before the Shamgar Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Hashem Salman Qawasme heartily agreed. He is chairman of the other Palestinian 
inquiry commission, a body handpicked by Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat within days of the massacre, apparently as an 
alternative to Dweik's commission, whose members are opposed to Arafat's peace 
efforts with Israel. And Qawasme also admitted that key details will be missing 
from both Palestinian inquiries because of lack of access. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his commission office -- two rooms on the second floor of an 
otherwise empty building in Hebron, with one computer, two desks, one secretary 
and 10 chairs -- Qawasme also conceded that he has far fewer resources than the 
Shamgar Commission. That panel has a battery of investigators and 
administrators and a modern hearing room inside Israel's Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the more than 50 witnesses his commission has interviewed, Qawasme, a 
veteran judge in the occupied territories, said it has concluded that there was 
more than one gunman in the cave. 
</P>
<P>
 He stressed, however, that his most dramatic finding was what he called "a 
second massacre," in which the Israeli army allegedly killed five Palestinians 
-- most of them waiting to donate blood -- during rioting outside a Hebron 
hospital where many of the wounded had been taken from the cave. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessing the work of the Shamgar Commission, Qawasme said, "The (Palestinian) 
people don't trust anything being done by the Israeli authorities anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he thought the Israeli government appointed the commission, he said, 
"I think that what this committee is for is to take away the madness of the 
general public after this horrible act." 
</P>
<P>
 Qawasme had rare words of praise for the work of his Israeli rivals. He 
applauded the objectivity of the five commission members; besides Zouabi and 
Shamgar, they include a university president widely known for his liberal 
views, another Supreme Court justice and a retired general. And, citing the 
series of disclosures the Shamgar Commission has produced on live national 
television, he said: "They have some positive points. Some facts that have been 
unknown have been aired by them." 
</P>
<P>
 The most provocative of those facts for most Israelis has been the "open-fire" 
order that middle- and low-ranking officers said barred them from shooting a 
Jew who was shooting Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it sounded to an audience that the Israeli Broadcasting Authority 
estimates at nearly 1 million at any given time during Zouabi's interrogation 
of Deputy Cmdr. Meir Tayar, head of Hebron's border police: 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if I had been there," Tayar said, "I could not have done anything, 
because there were special instructions. The open-fire instructions in the 
event a settler or a Jewish resident of Hebron shoots with intent: Under no 
circumstances shoot at him. . . . We are to overcome him by other means. For 
example, to take cover and wait for the (ammunition) magazine to be used up." 
</P>
<P>
 Zouabi was incredulous: "You mean, to wait until he killed other people?" 
</P>
<P>
 And Tayar confirmed that, indeed, that was the order. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in response to a flurry of public reaction to such a policy that Barak 
last week flatly denied, before the commission and the nation, that he or any 
other senior officer ever gave such an order. Rather, he said, it appeared that 
somewhere down the chain of command his orders were "misunderstood." 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony, however, gave rise to additional, widespread criticism of the 
security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three security organizations are supposed to cooperate in fulfilling a clear 
mission: guarding the Cave (of the Patriarchs)," concluded a recent commentary 
in the Hebrew daily Davar, which often reflects the views of Rabin's ruling 
Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the testimony heard so far by the Shamgar Commission, a chilling picture 
is being painted of a lack of coordination and, occasionally, conflicting 
interests. It is a pity that we needed such a tragic and brutal event to reveal 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's disclosures have spawned growing concern in Israel's 
political right wing about the image of a military Establishment unaccustomed 
to scrutiny in its task of protecting a small nation surrounded by enemies and 
enforcing 27 years of occupation in hostile lands. 
</P>
<P>
 More liberal Israeli analysts, such as Uri Avnery, brushed aside such 
observations. Avnery, a peace activist and frequent commentator, has attended 
every commission session since it opened March 8. For him, the Shamgar 
Commission already has done irreversible good for the army and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as a very healthy process for Israel," he said. "The army has been a 
(sacred) cow for a generation. What is happening with this commission is it's 
forcing us to rethink our attitude toward the army. For the first time, we're 
getting a normal attitude toward the army, seeing that it is filled with normal 
people, both good and bad."

LEGAL RULES MAY HAVE WRONG MAN IN PRISON

<P>
 When the fighting was over, one young man had been shot in the head and 
Ernesto Avila, by his own account, was running away with a gun in his pocket, 
fleeing the crowded Lynwood park before the police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila got away that afternoon in 1990. But his brother, Jesus, was arrested 
and charged with attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses say Ernesto Avila almost immediately tried to set the record 
straight, telling a private investigator he had pulled the trigger, and then 
acknowledging the same to a lawyer. But neither the lawyer nor the private 
investigator -- both of whom were bound by confidentiality rules -- told anyone 
about Ernesto Avila's admissions. When the case came to trial, the jury did not 
hear anything about Ernesto's possible involvement, and Jesus was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Avila case has thrust the two brothers -- both of them gang members who 
had had scrapes with the law -- into a pair of intense legal debates, testing 
the limits of confidentiality agreements between lawyers and their clients and 
stoking a long-running controversy about whether judges are too unwilling to 
reopen criminal cases when new evidence emerges. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of one of those controversies is Jesus Avila's original lawyer, 
George D. Denny III, a respected Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer, who 
learned early on that Ernesto Avila might be the shooter. But Denny never told 
anyone because he represented Ernesto in another matter and believed that he 
could not be a party to implicating him -- even if doing so might help clear 
his other client, Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 While Denny wrestled with his ethical quandary, Ernesto and the Avila family 
gambled. Rather than come forward and testify for his brother at the trial, 
Ernesto kept his peace, hoping that Jesus would win his freedom anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought Jesus would be acquitted and Ernesto would not have to go to jail 
either," said Christine Avila, their mother. "Maybe that was the wrong thing, 
but that was what we hoped for." 
</P>
<P>
 They were to be bitterly disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a joke," Jesus Avila said in an interview last week from 
prison. "Now, the way this is going, it looks like I'm never going to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 When the case came before Superior Court Judge William R. Pounders after Jesus 
Avila's conviction, the judge heard sworn testimony that Ernesto Avila was the 
guilty party, both from Ernesto and several other witnesses. Pounders declined 
to order a new trial for Jesus, saying later that he did not find Ernesto's 
admissions credible. Instead, Pounders ruled that Jesus' trial lawyer did a 
competent job with the information he had at the time and that Jesus received a 
fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Ernesto, who says he pulled the trigger, is free, while Jesus, who 
maintains his innocence, has spent nearly four years in some of the nation's 
toughest maximum security prisons for a crime that many people today doubt he 
committed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, like doctors, like other people, sometimes make a mistake," Denny said of 
Pounders' decision. "Sometimes those mistakes can be very costly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus and Ernesto Avila were guests at a baby shower in Lynwood's Ham Park on 
Aug. 19, 1990. Pink and blue balloons floated from the benches and trees. A 
table was piled high with gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 During the party, a group of young black men wandered through the park and 
were confronted by Jesus and some of his friends, members of a Latino gang 
known as the Young Crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the two groups talked about their tattoos, but then a large group of 
Latino gangsters surrounded Demetrius Kidd and his friends, some of whom were 
members of a rival Crips gang. As they turned to run, someone fired several 
shots. Kidd was hit behind the left ear and fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies arrested Jesus Avila at the scene, and Kidd identified him 
as the attacker. Another witness, Romel Johnson, also testified that Jesus 
Avila was the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were other witnesses who contradicted them. Several guests at the 
party -- including some with no apparent reason to lie for Jesus Avila -- 
recalled that he was far away from the area of the park where the shooting 
occurred. They remembered him hitting the ground when the shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those witnesses went further. They told Denny's private investigator, 
David Lynn, that Ernesto had been the shooter. At a hearing on Jesus' appeal, 
Lynn described some of those conversations under oath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did anyone else tell you that Ernesto was the shooter while you were the 
investigator on the case?" Barry Levin, one of Jesus' lawyers, asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did," Lynn said. "Ernesto." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn warned Denny that they might have a problem, so the lawyer called Ernesto 
in for a meeting. According to testimony from several witnesses at the hearing, 
Denny questioned Ernesto and confronted him with the information that he was 
the shooter. Although Denny cannot recall the exact words from that meeting, he 
left convinced that Ernesto, not his brother, had fired the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no doubt whatsoever that Ernie did it based on the conversation that we 
had," Denny said. "He was telling me that he did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under most circumstances, a lawyer would be overjoyed to get such information. 
After all, Ernesto's admissions would greatly undermine the prosecution case 
against Jesus. A jury would almost certainly have a tough time convicting one 
brother of a crime that the other brother admitted committing. 
</P>
<P>
 But no jury ever heard Ernesto's story. Instead, Denny told the court that he 
had a conflict of interest, and he withdrew from representing Jesus, never 
telling the lawyer who replaced him why he had been forced to make that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, I was in a quandary," Denny said. "Because Ernie was my client 
in another matter, I had an absolute obligation to him. . . . Knowing what I 
did know at the time, I don't feel that I could have done anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal experts fault Denny for not sharing the information with the lawyer 
who took his place. But most agree that the lawyer-client relationship is so 
sacrosanct that Denny was obligated to keep Ernesto's secrets, even if that 
worked against the interests of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Rules of Professional Conduct strictly prohibit any lawyer from 
disclosing confidential communications from a client. There are a few 
exceptions noted in the code -- in cases where a client obtained the services 
of a lawyer to commit a fraud, or when the lawyer believes disclosing 
information is needed to keep the client from committing a crime. But for the 
most part, the rules are unyielding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the rules of professional conduct, you can't tell anybody, even if it 
is to the value of another client," said Laurie Levenson, a Loyola law school 
professor. "You can just never do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn's handling of witness statements implicating Ernesto is more problematic. 
Those interviews are not covered by the attorney-client privilege because they 
did not involve conversations with the client. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Lynn never turned over the details of those interviews to 
anyone. In fact, he made a point of not taping them and not writing them down 
because he did not want to be a party to implicating Ernesto. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a problem for me," Lynn said in an interview last week from San 
Salvador, where he is working with a United Nations commission investigating 
death squads. "I'd been an investigator for less than a year, and I was being 
told to protect both their interests. I couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 So Lynn sat on the information. When the new lawyer took over for Denny, he 
got some files from Lynn but nothing indicating that the real shooter might be 
Ernesto. 
</P>
<P>
 The new attorney tried to win an acquittal for Jesus by putting on evidence 
that he was on the other side of the park. Faced with other witnesses who 
identified Jesus as the shooter, the jury voted to convict. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 31, 1991, Jesus was sentenced to life plus eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Jesus got a second chance. This time, Ernesto came to his 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The court of appeal had reviewed Jesus' plea for a new trial. Based on it, the 
court ordered a special hearing, and Pounders was picked to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
 As they prepared for the hearing, Nancy Coan and Levin -- the two lawyers who 
represented Jesus in his appeal -- began canvassing witnesses. Several told 
them that Ernesto was the guilty party, so they met with him. He admitted it 
and said he would be willing to waive the attorney-client privilege that had 
bound his lawyer to silence for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ernesto continued to hedge about testifying. According to his family and 
his brother's lawyers, he was frightened about the prospect of admitting his 
guilt under oath. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Ernesto continued to balk right up to the moment that the hearing 
began. Then, seeing his brother in court, Ernesto decided he would tell his 
story. Levin called him to the stand, and Ernesto, for the first time, told a 
judge that he was the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the events of that day, Ernesto told of a fight between his 
homeboys and the others and gave a disjointed account of people running in 
various directions. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then I reached in my pocket, and I pulled out a handgun, and I shot a 
couple shots at them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He equivocated about some details, claiming that he could not be totally sure 
that his shots struck Kidd because he never saw Kidd fall. But he testified 
that he fired the only shots in the park that day, and he acknowledged that his 
admission could be used against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have any reason to come into court and, under oath, lie and say that 
you committed a serious crime that you did not commit?" Levin asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, there is no reason for me to do that," Ernesto responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Having heard that testimony -- as well as the sworn testimony of the lawyer 
and private investigator and a number of other witnesses -- the judge 
nevertheless declined to recommend that Jesus receive a new trial. Instead, 
Pounders found that Jesus was competently represented at trial and that Ernesto 
had missed the opportunity to come forward at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Avila was dumbfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody comes forward in a court of law, knowing the risks, and says he 
committed a crime," she said. "He handed them all this evidence, and the judge 
sat there and didn't believe him. What more did he want?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many legal experts note that it is extraordinarily difficult to get judges to 
order new trials based on new evidence. In this case, the battle was made more 
difficult by the fact that Pounders only was asked to assess whether Jesus' 
trial lawyer had effectively represented him. But Levin stressed that no one 
was asking Pounders to free Jesus, merely to grant him a new trial so that a 
jury could assess the evidence against him in light of Ernesto's admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Other legal experts sympathize with Levin's frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, I was co-counsel in a case involving a 16-year-old named 
Gordon Castillo Hall," said Gerald F. Uelman, dean of the Santa Clara 
University Law School. Hall was convicted of first-degree murder but on appeal 
his lawyers presented evidence that somebody else had done the shooting. The 
court threw out Hall's conviction and the district attorney then dropped the 
case, Uelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced that if that happened today, Gordon Hall would still be in 
jail," Uelman said. "Courts don't have time to do justice anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, Pounders acknowledged that it is difficult for 
appellate courts to examine new evidence, but he explained that in the Avila 
case he did not find Ernesto credible. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this case began, my thought was, 'God help us if the process has 
convicted the wrong person,' " Pounders said. "I felt it was my job to look at 
this with wide eyes and almost a feeling of terror that the wrong person might 
have been convicted." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Pounders said he felt exactly that as the evidence began coming in. 
But as more witnesses testified -- a total of 23 took the stand in an extensive 
hearing -- he began to doubt Ernesto's story more and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto's admissions, Pounders said, were evasive and inconclusive -- "dancing 
in the shadows," the judge termed them -- and he concluded that they were "an 
attempt to spring the actual criminal loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether she is convinced that the right Avila brother is in prison, 
prosecutor Eleanor Barrett demurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, it's irrelevant what I believe," she said. "What's important is what 
the judge believes." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph P. Furman, a deputy attorney general who handled the Avila case on 
appeal, stressed that prosecutors have "an overriding duty to see that justice 
is done" and added that Avila and his lawyers have had every opportunity to 
present the facts of their case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue was fully aired before a Superior Court judge who was sitting as a 
referee," Furman said. "There was a lengthy, thorough and comprehensive 
hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Pounders' recommendations, the court of appeal denied Jesus' plea. 
The state Supreme Court followed suit last month, leaving Jesus' only possible 
recourse with the federal system. 
</P>
<P>
 His family still holds out hope, but it is fading. Other cases with some 
similarities have failed to sway the appeals courts: In 1993, the U.S. Supreme 
Court denied an appeal by a Texas Death Row inmate who presented affidavits 
suggesting that his brother had committed the crime for which he was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, however, the brother was dead by the time the affidavits were 
filed. And the brother never told anyone at the time the crime was committed 
that he was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Sheldon Sanders was convicted of murder in a 1985 shooting in 
Compton. His brother later confessed to his lawyer, family and others. But when 
the brother was called to the stand, he invoked the 5th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts in the Avila case bode better for Jesus -- his brother has testified 
under oath and there is evidence, albeit disputed, that he admitted his 
responsibility just days after the shooting. Still, persuading a court to order 
a new trial remains an uphill struggle, as even his family and lawyers concede. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say that this is the one that got away," Levin said. "Jake (Jesus) 
is an innocent man, and he may spend the rest of his life in prison just 
because no one bothered to give him a fair hearing. That's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus' father, Ernesto Avila Sr., could not agree more. "They say it's justice 
for all, but they got the wrong guy," he said last week, sifting through 
photographs of his two sons. "That's no justice for anyone."

ASSASSINATION TO TEST MEXICO JUSTICE SYSTEM; INVESTIGATION: LUIS DONALDO 
COLOSIO'S KILLING AND SUSPECT'S INTERROGATION RAISE SUSPICIONS OF CONSPIRACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The investigation into the assassination of ruling party presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio has hooked the government's credibility to one 
of Mexico's most mistrusted institutions: the country's criminal justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The strain was already becoming evident the weekend after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the attorney general's office was forced to deny rumors that the 
suspect being held in a prison outside Mexico City is not the same person 
arrested in Tijuana, where Colosio was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Diego Valades' statement that Mario Aburto Martinez had confessed 
to the crime has also become suspect. The human rights activist who government 
officials said witnessed their interrogation of the prisoner has told reporters 
that he did not hear the confession. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, prominent opposition politician Porfirio Munoz Ledo has raised 
suspicions of a conspiracy, setting the stage for accusations of a cover-up, if 
the investigation shows that Aburto acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 That is an inauspicious beginning for an investigation crucial to restoring 
the confidence of a citizenry shocked and angered by the violent death of a man 
most had expected to be their next president. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's election was virtually assured because he was the candidate of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has ruled Mexico for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission would be difficult for law enforcement agencies in any country, 
but it is particularly tough in Mexico, where only 12% of the population 
respects the police -- the same percentage that respects politicians. Both 
figures are from a recent survey in the demographic magazine Este Pais. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is complicated by Mexicans' long collective memory and a history 
of political murders and suspicious deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials have said the last thing they want is another 
controversy like the John F. Kennedy assassination: a political murder whose 
motive is still a mystery and whose investigation is questioned three decades 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 They have taken elaborate precautions to make sure that Aburto neither escapes 
nor gets killed himself, as did JFK assassin suspect Lee Harvey Oswald. The 
suspect's transfer from Tijuana to a maximum-security prison outside Mexico 
City was kept quiet until Aburto was safely locked inside the country's newest 
penitentiary Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards with submachine guns surrounded Aburto, who was placed in a bulletproof 
glass cell for five-minute photo sessions with small groups of photographers 
Friday morning. Despite such precautions, an entirely different set of problems 
emerged when photographs of the prisoner appeared in Saturday newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanshaven man in the photos looked so different from the bloodied, 
mustachioed figure shown on television Wednesday being led away by police from 
the murder scene that people suspected a switch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exactly the same person," Valades said in a written statement. The only 
difference was that Aburto's hair was combed and he was shaved, with his 
permission, the attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto's identity was proven with fingerprints, he added. But the public 
remains skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid charges -- familiar in Mexico -- that Aburto's statement to police 
was obtained by torture, Jose Luis Perez Canchola, the Baja California state 
ombudsman for human rights, was asked to attend the interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 After Valades said Aburto had confessed, however, Perez told reporters that he 
had heard no such statement. In addition, the human rights activist said he 
believes that the assassin did not act alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of a conspiracy was also voiced by Munoz Ledo, chairman of the 
opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party and formerly a PRI member. Munoz Ledo 
said police reports he had seen called Aburto a professional killer who was 
paid to execute Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of Mexicans believe that there was a conspiracy to kill the 
candidate, opinion polls show. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Mexico's history of political killings and the police record in solving 
them, those suspicions are understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has his life already paid for" is a common refrain among Mexican 
politicians, according to political historian Oscar Hinojosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Plutarco Elias Calles, the founder of the ruling party, was known for a series 
of executions in the 1930s. Politically ambitious generals also were killed, 
although less routinely, in the 1940s and 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Mexicans are suspicious about the 1969 airplane crash in which Carlos 
Alberto Madrazo died. Four years earlier, he had resigned as the PRI chairman, 
convinced that the party could not be reformed, and at the time of the crash 
rumors were circulating that he was planning to start a new party. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that the 1988 car crash that killed Manuel Clouthier, a charismatic 
opposition party presidential candidate, and the murder of two key aides from 
another party, which is still under investigation.

COLUMN ONE; UKRAINE'S MASTER HOARDER; HOW DID A SCRUFFY ELECTRICIAN ELUDE THE 
SOVIETS TO AMASS A SECRET TROVE OF RARE BOOKS AND ICONS? SOME SAY ALEXANDER 
ILYIN'S PASSION FOR COLLECTING MADE HIM STOP AT NOTHING TO GET WHAT HE WANTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Few visitors were ever allowed into Alexander Ilyin's ramshackle house in this 
wheat-country town. When he died, people found out why. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilyin had been a familiar scruffy figure around here, an electrician for local 
cafeterias. With his long face and burning eyes, he resembled a scrawny 
vampire; in his ancient shoes and shabby coat, he could pass for a bum. 
</P>
<P>
 The eyes gave him away. He was a man with an illicit passion burning so strong 
that nothing -- not the KGB, not the criminal underworld, not the bonds of 
Soviet ideology -- could stand in its way. 
</P>
<P>
 After he died last fall at 73, local officials invaded Ilyin's home with an 
order to freeze his property until his rightful heirs could be determined. They 
had suspicions about what they would find; everyone in town knew Ilyin was a 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
 But they had never imagined the magnitude of the treasure he left, a monument 
to the peculiar ingenuity of a true collector who could overcome anything -- 
even the repression of a Communist police state that frowned on private 
property -- to amass his hoard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilyin had done the seemingly impossible. He had accumulated an entire museum 
-- tens of thousands of rare books along with gold- and silver-framed icons, 
paintings and antiques -- under the Soviet regime. His cache included 
16th-Century books believed to be published by the Russian Gutenberg -- Ivan 
Fyodorov -- and tome after leather-bound tome of valuable manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet Union had no equivalent of Sotheby's auction house, but some of 
Ilyin's methods of procurement can be guessed. 
</P>
<P>
 He bought valuables at bargain-basement prices from fallen noble families and 
needy pensioners, victims of revolution, war and poverty. He swapped with less 
knowledgeable colleagues. According to many, he also corrupted library and 
museum officials to obtain choice objets , and may have had dealings with 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirovograd residents shake their heads in bewildered wonder at the size of his 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a collector of the highest order," said librarian Alexander Chudnov, 
an Ilyin protege who is helping to catalogue the hoard. "People often compare 
the love of books to the love of women -- he knew value and to some extent it 
was love that turned into lust, into a 'This is mine!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ilyin's home and an annex on the half-acre lot had no plumbing or central 
heating, like most houses in the Ukrainian countryside. But officials found 
both to be stuffed with the density of a moving van. Ancient books teetered in 
floor-to-ceiling piles, some rotting in the damp and nibbled by mice. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilyin's niece, Irina Podtyolkova, and her husband lived with the collector and 
objected furiously to the state intervention. But this was bigger than both of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like coming into a cave," said Oxana Nelga, a librarian who helped 
pack up and list the Ilyin collection. "First the fear, then the surprise of 
finding silver wrapped in rags." 
</P>
<P>
 The treasures of the Ilyin household created a sensation. The local press, 
quoting an overly enthusiastic official, claimed that the books and other 
valuables were worth a far-fetched $40 billion, more than the Ukrainian state 
budget for the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Their actual value is uncertain. Rare Russian book collections sold for 
millions of rubles back when that would have been millions of dollars, said 
Alexandra Guseva of the rare books section of Moscow's Lenin Library. But Harry 
Leich, Russian specialist at the U.S. Library of Congress, said there seems to 
be little market for them now. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, "I would not underestimate the cultural value of it," Leich said, 
noting that the discovery of an extensive private Russian collection is "a 
major event culturally and historically. Because of the vicissitudes of 
history, there aren't many of them around." 
</P>
<P>
 Ilyin's collection, which local museum director Pavel Bosiy valued at several 
million dollars, is not all catalogued yet, and the authenticity of some of the 
rarest books must be checked. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials at the Kirovograd museum, which serves the province's population 
of 1.5 million, figure that Ilyin's collection outstrips theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see Ilyin as a looter who exploited his country's misfortunes. Others 
view him as a visionary. 
</P>
<P>
 His collection reflects some of the tremendous distortion of values under 
Soviet Communist dogma, a distortion that is only beginning to be set right as 
Russia reclaims its history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsheviks slaughtered priests, tore down churches and persecuted 
believers. They saw little value in icons, the Byzantine-style portraits of 
saints typically painted on wood and framed with gold and silver. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Stalin era, Ilyin had seen local museum workers destroy icons with 
an ax, pulling away the silver frames and then chopping the wood to be burned 
for heating, said Ivan Anastasiev, a fellow collector in Kirovograd. 
</P>
<P>
 But those with clear sight cherished them. Westerners have long smuggled icons 
out of Russia, and Ilyin was gathering them even when Soviet citizens could be 
hounded for having them. 
</P>
<P>
 "God knows how, but he gathered and kept what could have disappeared," 
Anastasiev said. "It's a great feat that it's still here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsheviks also frowned upon everything that smacked of the highfalutin 
world of the aristocracy they had ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 When rebellious peasants sacked the family estates of noble clans, the spoils 
could often be bought for a song. 
</P>
<P>
 "The logic of the regime was that everything before 1917 was lies," said 
Valery Repalo, head of the state commission on the Ilyin collection. "Only that 
which related to the Soviet epoch had value." 
</P>
<P>
 Ilyin loved the Baroque and Rococo styles of pre-revolutionary Russia. His 
collection included magnificent books such as "The Byzantine Enamels" -- which 
cost 12,000 silver pieces in 1892 -- and "The Great Princes and Czars Hunting 
in Russia," gorgeous coffee-table-size editions printed at 200 or so copies 
with brilliant illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communists hated the czars. Ilyin bought their portraits, one of them 
apparently done by the renowned painter Dmitri Levitsky, who died in the early 
19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilyin had taste, but there was an unsavory side to his collecting. He was, as 
one librarian said, "no angel." 
</P>
<P>
 Collecting "is a passion that swallows everything," Anastasiev said. "When a 
person will do anything, including criminal acts, to get things." 
</P>
<P>
 Communism made property collective -- and therefore no one's. 
</P>
<P>
 Stealing from the state was considered a minor peccadillo; that meant that 
museum and library workers could be easily persuaded to make an unprofitable 
swap or to purloin a book from dusty shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could take an icon from a museum for a bottle of vodka if you were in 
cahoots with the director," said Pavel Bosiy, now head of the local museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Ilyin's books have library stamps in them, cataloguers said. And how 
are they to explain Ilyin's possession of the very Bible that the Empress 
Yelizaveta bestowed upon their city back when it was called Yelizavetgrad? 
</P>
<P>
 And there are rumors about the World War II years. Some say Ilyin was one of 
the carpetbaggers who, during the 900-day siege of Leningrad, traded bread to 
ravenous residents for their heirlooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Podtyolkova, his niece, angrily denied the rumors, saying Ilyin never even 
served in Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
 But the war did turn the country upside down, with museums evacuated eastward 
away from the invading Nazis and new treasures flooding in with the victorious 
Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Museums did not begin normal postwar inventories until 1948, Bosiy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilyin may or may not have taken advantage of his country's chaos. What he 
definitely exploited was the Communist ideal of equality that left everyone 
equally poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back when pensions were 12 rubles a month" -- then about $20 -- "an old lady 
would let you take an icon with silver and enamel and jewels for 30 rubles. 
People needed every penny," Anastasiev recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilyin, Chudnov said, had been described as "a python person. He'd choose a 
victim who he knew had something, then he'd circle around them and sometimes if 
he couldn't get close he'd just wait. . . . And when the person died, he'd 
pounce." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main mysteries about Ilyin is that he lived as a poor man, eating 
for free in the cafeterias where he worked and wearing the uniforms provided on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 He never married -- probably, Anastasiev said, because he was too cheap to 
spend money on a family when the cash could have furthered his collection. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are greater mysteries. The Soviet regime frowned upon private book 
collecting -- as it did on any wheeling and dealing -- and confiscated many of 
the country's best private collections. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Ilyin survive untouched -- especially when, some accounts say, his 
collection included coins and medals, which tended to draw the interest of the 
KGB and the criminal world? 
</P>
<P>
 Podtyolkova said that Ilyin had been robbed only once and that the thieves had 
soon been caught. She speculated that he had been otherwise untouched by the 
KGB and the underworld because her father -- Ilyin's brother-in-law -- was a 
highly placed prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Local reporters have other theories. Perhaps, they say, Ilyin was what the 
Russian underworld knows as a "thief in the law," a criminal leader whose 
treasure was actually an obschak -- a general pot, the repository of the goods 
a gang has accumulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Chudnov has found documents showing that Ilyin spent time in jail, and there 
is also a period of 14 years in his life unaccounted for in his work records. 
</P>
<P>
 Podtyolkova denied that Ilyin had ever served time, but Chudnov believes that 
gap could mean Ilyin was either in a labor camp or perhaps working for the 
Russian Orthodox Church, which led something of a life apart from the Soviet 
state and might not have appeared in his records. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kirovograd KGB has answered museum officials' queries about Ilyin with a 
blank wall, responding only that it has no information on him. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest remaining mystery is how Ilyin could allow his treasures to molder 
in the freezing damp of winter and the humid heat of summer. Museum workers 
said some of the books were so filthy and moldy that they had to wear 
respirators while examining them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a person we don't understand because we can't say he didn't know they 
were valuable -- but still they were kept in such bad condition," commission 
head Repalo said. "He was an egotist." 
</P>
<P>
 Chudnov saw Ilyin more as a sadist, saying that the collector's passion was 
twisted enough that he believed that he could do anything he wanted with his 
own books. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very complex person -- probably in world literature there's no 
parallel," museum director Bosiy said. "He was a believer, but he took things 
from churches. He restored books, but he allowed many to be destroyed. He put 
contemporary pictures in old books." 
</P>
<P>
 Museum and Kirovograd officials use Ilyin's ill treatment of his treasures as 
the moral basis for moving in on them. They base their claims on a law 
requiring that collections of unique historical items must be registered, and 
Ilyin never registered his. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, they have only confiscated the collection for six months because 
Ilyin left no will. But Podtyolkova is sure that she will never see most of it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 She spoke in the cluttered kitchen of Ilyin's house, which still smacks 
visitors with a waft of something rotting as they walk in. It is also still 
overflowing with books, apparently only the least valuable, even after 
officials trucked away 500 giant sackfuls. 
</P>
<P>
 Podtyolkova verged repeatedly on tears as she described how police had invaded 
her home in early January despite her protests. They ripped up the floorboards 
and used metal detectors to check for last bits of loot, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials say things known to belong to Ilyin had begun to turn up on 
the market, implying that his niece had begun selling items without having 
clear title. 
</P>
<P>
 Podtyolkova, who had always lived with her eccentric uncle, makes the 
counter-accusation that museum officials have not registered all they took, so 
as to sell the items themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in our democracy," she said. "They may give us some money, 
but they won't return the things. . . . They came and said: 'Oh, you have a 
spoon by Faberge? Why, we have only two of those in our museum in Kiev.' What I 
want to know is, why can't we have a spoon by Faberge?" 
</P>
<P>
 Podtyolkova and museum officials are seeking legal help. 
</P>
<P>
 Podtyolkova said she cannot afford to hire a lawyer from Kiev, and local 
attorneys have all refused to aid her. All sides expect long court battles. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of her would-be inheritance hurts Podtyolkova. Selling just a portion 
of it would be enough to buy her a new house, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest escalation of the fight between family and state, Podtyolkova 
said Chudnov and others are accusing her of having done her uncle in and have 
issued an order for his grave to be opened. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the collection fills several rooms at the local museum and several 
more at the Kirovograd library. All are sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosiy and Chudnov have not even finished counting all they have. Bosiy says 
the houses held more than 300,000 items, including a silver cup he values at 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Chudnov at the library is looking at everything from bags of tattered Torahs 
to books from the era of Ivan the Terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one truly sacred book," he said reverently of a tome printed by Ivan 
Fyodorov in 1575. "This is like an English speaker holding an original 
Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
 He has some of Ilyin's passion, it seems, but maintains his is different. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are bibliophiles," he said, "and then there are bibliomaniacs."

36 KILLED AS TORNADOES RAKE SOUTH; DISASTER: TWISTER HITS ALABAMA CHURCH PACKED 
WITH PALM SUNDAY WORSHIPERS. REGION BRACES FOR MORE DAMAGE AS STRING OF NEW 
STORMS APPROACHES. 
</P>

<P>
 A series of powerful thunderstorms tore across the South on Palm Sunday, 
killing at least 36 people, including 18 who died because a tornado knocked 
down the roof of a crowded church. 
</P>
<P>
 The tornado hit the Goshen Methodist Church near Piedmont, Ala., about 11:30 
a.m., toppling a brick wall onto a pew of children waiting to sing in a Palm 
Sunday pageant. About 90 people were injured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One man ran down the aisle yelling: 'Get on the floor!' " worshiper Elwanna 
Acker, 63, told the Associated Press. "Then the roof came down. The woman right 
next to me died." 
</P>
<P>
 The storm system, which weather service spokesmen said spawned an unusually 
high number of tornadoes, was blamed for deaths elsewhere in Alabama and 
Georgia and for causing heavy damage from Mississippi to the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 13 north Georgia counties were hit hard by afternoon thunderstorms 
and tornadoes that reportedly killed at least 15 people, knocked out power for 
thousands of homes and businesses and closed roads. Dozens of people were 
reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of eastern Alabama and all of northwest Georgia was braced Sunday night 
for more bad weather as another line of tornado-spawning thunderstorms roared 
into the area. A large portion of Georgia remained under a tornado watch until 
2 a.m., but by midnight it appeared that metropolitan Atlanta had escaped the 
brunt of both storm systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst kind of tornado damage that we've had in north Georgia 
since the early '70s," said Gov. Zell Miller, who planned to fly over the state 
Monday morning to assess the damage, estimated to be in the tens of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the death toll could go higher. "There are a number of people 
missing," he said. Through Georgia and Alabama, dangerous conditions impeded 
search parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation and Department of Corrections workers 
were immediately dispatched to help clear the roads, Miller said, but officials 
said at least two major roads in north Georgia were expected to remain blocked 
until Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cherokee County, one of the Georgia counties hit hard by the storm, 
tornadoes cut large swaths through the countryside. Large fields of trees were 
snapped like toothpicks and the ground was littered with live power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to need the National Guard, and we need all the 
volunteers with chain saws we can find," County Commissioner Bobby Hawthorne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar scenes of devastation were found throughout the region: overturned 
cars, felled trees, buildings and homes demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Alabama church that was destroyed, children dressed in their Easter 
clothes were performing in a Palm Sunday drama when the tornado hit. Six 
children, from 2 to 12 years old, were among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just started to scream, 'Everybody get down!' " Carol Scroggins, who was 
leading the pageant, told the AP. "People were screaming, but it happened so 
quickly there wasn't much time for reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 About six miles away, the Union Grove Methodist church was also hit by a 
tornado during services, but its 75 worshipers took shelter in the basement and 
escaped injury, Piedmont Mayor Vera Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen bodies were found inside the Goshen church, and one man was found 
outside in a van, apparently killed by a toppled telephone pole, officials 
said. Two other victims died later Sunday from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 About 140 people were in the church, five miles north of Piedmont in eastern 
Alabama, officials said. Rescuers had feared that others were buried, but all 
were accounted for after more than 100 searchers dug through the rubble by hand 
and called in a crane to lift the collapsed roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The tornado ripped away an entire side of the red-brick building and blew the 
steeple into the parking lot. Pieces of pews were scattered around the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Several nearby houses were also demolished by the twister, and the National 
Guard was called in to help search for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Christa Rhianehart, 16, who had sung earlier in the service, told the AP that 
she was sitting near the front when the roof came down on her pew. "I started 
screaming for my momma," she said, "and she was right beside me." 
</P>
<P>
 The storm knocked out power and telephone service, hampering rescue efforts. 
Passing motorists helped take the injured to hospitals around Piedmont, a rural 
town of 5,000 residents 72 miles west of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured were so numerous that five regional hospitals and medical centers 
had to be put on alert to handle the load. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service had issued a tornado watch for the area earlier 
in the morning. The weather service issued a warning saying a twister had been 
spotted on the ground about the time the roof collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 A temporary morgue was set up at a National Guard armory in Piedmont, and the 
civic center was turned into a shelter for the families of victims. 
</P>
<P>
 A tornado also damaged the Ten Island Baptist Church in Ragland, Ala., and 
injured an undetermined number of people, Calhoun County sheriff's dispatcher 
Leon Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Alabama, tornadoes killed one person at a park and another in his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 In Guntersville, Ala., the roof was blown off a nursing home. The 25 to 30 
residents were not injured and were taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A tornado that touched down in DeKalb County injured 20 people, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tornadoes were part of an intense springtime storm system that began with 
moist, unstable air off the Gulf of Mexico early Sunday. The air was pushed 
northeast by the jet stream and clashed with low pressure along a cold front. 
</P>
<P>
 In northern Georgia, dozens of injuries were reported. A trailer park was 
destroyed in Pickens County, near the Tennessee line. Seven of the 15 dead in 
Georgia were in Pickens County. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other trailer parks in nearby counties were also hit, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelters were being set up for displaced residents. Don Stephens, a spokesman 
for the American Red Cross, estimated that 200 homes were heavily damaged in 
northern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 A tornado touched down in Charlotte, N.C., with heavy damage reported at a 
housing complex and elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Power outages and structural damage was scattered in northern South Carolina, 
where at least two tornadoes touched down. Two homes were destroyed and at 
least two people injured in Long Creek, S.C., when a tornado hit the ground. 
The injured suffered cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfball-sized hail pelted parts of Alabama and Mississippi, and heavy winds 
caused damage in North Carolina and Mississippi.

COSTLY NEW TREATMENTS PUT INSURERS IN QUANDARY; HEALTH: FIRMS MUST DECIDE WHO 
GETS HIGH-TECH CARE. REFUSING COVERAGE CAN MEAN AN EVEN COSTLIER COURT CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mother was in a strong state of denial, said Dr. Ron Bachman, a geneticist 
at Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Her young son had early, mild symptoms of Peliazeus Mersbacher syndrome, a 
degenerative disorder marked initially by tremors, problems in walking and 
unusual eye motions. It is usually fatal in the teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Although three of her great uncles had died from the disease, she was sure her 
son did not have it, despite physicians' certainty that he did. She wanted them 
to perform a new genetic test to rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the test is done in only one academic laboratory in the country, costs 
$3,000 and can detect at best 20% of the mutations that cause the disease, 
Bachman said. In short, he said, "it had a limited chance of telling us 
something we already knew for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 As a new generation of expensive drugs, medical procedures and genetic 
screening tests becomes increasingly available, the dilemma Bachman faced is 
becoming more common throughout the medical profession. Responding to these 
developments -- especially those involving biotechnology and genetics -- 
insurance companies have to make critical, controversial decisions about 
whether to cover them. 
</P>
<P>
 The need to make such decisions is coming at a time when the insurance 
industry is under increased criticism for, among other things, excluding 
coverage for patients with existing conditions or with genetic defects that 
make them susceptible to illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies for decades have had to make hard choices about covering 
myriad tests, treatments and drugs. But with the genetics boom opening up new 
medical arenas, those choices are more complex and uncertain than ever. 
Already, companies are facing pressures to pay for unnecessary genetic tests. 
And Kaiser and other companies are funding significant numbers of so-called 
"anxiety amnios" -- expensive amniocentesis tests for pregnant women under 35 
who are at no particular risk of having a child with a birth defect but are 
apprehensive nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 New genetic advances have the potential of being a "black hole" for soaking up 
much larger portions of an insurer's funds, said Dr. Edward Schoen, a Kaiser 
pediatrician. Every time a new gene is discovered, such as those that cause 
cystic fibrosis and colon cancer, it opens the possibility of widespread -- and 
expensive -- testing for its disease. New drugs produced by genetic techniques, 
such as Pulmozyme for dissolving lung mucus in cystic fibrosis patients, are 
often much more expensive than conventional drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are already living in a world of health care reform," said Dr. Ian 
Leverton, chairman of Kaiser's New Technology Committee, which decides when 
coverage will be provided. "We have to look at what our priorities really are 
because we don't have enough money to do everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, said Dr. William McGiveny, vice president for clinical 
evaluation research at Aetna Life & Casualty, is that "we don't want to 
withhold good medical care from patients because of cost. But we don't want to 
pay for medical technologies that are not proven to be safe and effective." 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to shore up the bottom line can be very expensive, as Health Net 
learned recently. A jury awarded $89 million in damages to the family of Nelene 
Fox, a Riverside breast cancer patient who sought, but did not receive, 
coverage from Health Net for a potentially life-saving procedure called 
autologous bone marrow transplantation. That decision, which is being appealed, 
sounded a clear warning to insurers that the courts are carefully watching over 
their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 As well they should be, critics argue, because the most commonly used reason 
for denying coverage -- that a treatment is "experimental" -- is highly 
ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox family's attorney, Mark O. Hiepler of Oxnard, said: "Our case, and the 
continuing debate, have proved that insurance companies can't define what it 
(experimental) means. . . . The companies use an experimental exclusion as the 
greatest tool for rationing health care without appearing to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos) last year introduced a bill that would 
require insurers to justify their decisions not to cover experimental 
procedures and to shorten the appeals process so that a decision on coverage is 
made before the patient dies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may sound cold and heartless -- and it is -- but HMOs and insurance 
companies bank on the expiration of the patient," said Denyne M. Kowalewski, 
Epple's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill passed, but was vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson, who argued that the 
required administrative procedures would increase health care costs. Epple has 
introduced it again this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers have yet to subject many gene-based technologies to the 
decision-making process. But most experts agree that virtually all of the 
potential problems that loom for genetics have been covered in the controversy 
over autologous bone marrow transplants, often known as ABMT. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure "is a microcosm of today's health care quandary," Aetna's 
McGiveny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone marrow transplants are the treatment of choice for leukemia, but are 
considered experimental by many researchers for the treatment of breast cancer. 
That disease strikes 180,000 women each year, killing 46,000, making it the 
most common cancer to strike women and the second most lethal, behind lung 
cancer. About a third of the patients are potentially eligible for ABMT, which 
is, in essence, a form of high-dose chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure becomes necessary when patients require extraordinarily high 
doses of anti-cancer drugs to eradicate all traces of the tumor. But such high 
doses also kill bone marrow and would be lethal without further intervention. 
To avoid this problem, surgeons remove some of the patient's bone marrow before 
chemotherapy and treat it to kill any tumor cells that may be in it. After 
chemotherapy, the marrow is re-infused, restoring the patient's immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure, which typically costs $100,000 to $200,000 and is used on 
patients who have had conventional chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, has 
roughly a 5% to 10% risk of killing the patient, compared to a 1% risk for 
chemotherapy alone. But it also has a one in four chance of curing the disease, 
a much higher rate than is normally achieved in patients who have suffered a 
relapse. Clinical trials directed by the National Institutes of Health that 
will assess ABMT's value will not be completed for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Few critics have argued with the process by which insurers decide broadly that 
they will pay for a new technology like ABMT. Rather, it is the case-by-case 
decrees on which patients qualify for a treatment or test that generate 
disagreements and lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the decision is made by a new technologies committee composed 
of physicians whose primary criterion, they say, is not cost, but whether the 
benefit of the treatment is worth the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Kaiser is not sitting up there making decisions for us," Bachman said. 
"We as doctors have to say this is what we should offer, and it needs to be 
factored into the dues (insurance costs)." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the ordinary physician who is providing most of the consumer care 
who makes such decisions, but rather the department head, the university dean, 
the internationally recognized expert. At Kaiser and some other large 
companies, the experts are in-house. Blue Cross, Aetna and Blue Shield, among 
others, use outside experts, who are unpaid and have no financial stake in the 
decisions, according to company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charge that these experts are one step removed from the process of 
caring for patients and thus lack an intellectual and emotional appreciation of 
the patients' needs. Insurance officials argue that these elite physicians are 
the most knowledgeable about the procedures in question and the most competent 
in evaluating their efficacy. "They bring to us . . . what they believe to be 
the best standards of practice," said Dr. David Chernoff, corporate medical 
director for Blue Cross of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the committees review all the available literature about a new 
technique or drug, and they often interview the people who developed it. They 
address a number of key questions, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Is the procedure safe? One of the arguments against ABMT has been its high 
risk, but it is covered by many insurers. However, the implantation of 
artificial hearts and baboon hearts has proved too debilitating to the patient 
to be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is it effective? ABMT can prolong life for certain breast cancer patients, 
particularly those whose tumors are still sensitive to anti-cancer drugs. Most 
companies now cover the procedure, even though it is considered experimental, 
for patients who meet very specific criteria. Fetal cell transplants for 
Parkinson's disease are not covered by insurance because the evidence is not 
strong enough that they are helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is it medically necessary? That is, can the same results be achieved with an 
existing -- and cheaper -- procedure? 
</P>
<P>
 * Can the risks and benefits be quantified? Is it cost-effective? Screening of 
the entire population for cystic fibrosis would probably not be cost-effective, 
according to studies by Dr. David Witte of Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "CF screening won't save the insurer money," said his colleague, Dr. Tracey 
Lieu. "But it may be justified if we judge the benefits to society worth the 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the new technology committees vote on whether a new procedure or 
drug is "experimental" or "non-experimental." If a procedure is ruled 
experimental, a company can, and usually does, deny coverage for it. If it is 
ruled non-experimental, the procedure is almost always covered. 
</P>
<P>
 However, fear of litigation is driving Kaiser and others away from the 
experimental vs. non-experimental classification. 
</P>
<P>
 "If push comes to shove, the courts are unlikely to accept experimental as an 
adequate reason for not treating terminal patients," Leverton said. "But they 
are perfectly willing to listen to arguments about the 'appropriateness' of 
treatments." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, he added, is "if we have time for an in-depth 
consultation between the clinician, the patient and the family, (then) we can 
usually reach agreement on the appropriateness of treatment as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Each company typically evaluates about 30 new drugs or procedures per year, 
approving about two-thirds on the first pass. Some come back for re-evaluation 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield's committee reviewed ABMT three times between 1989 and 1991 before 
approving it, Chernoff said. The first two times, he said, "there were just a 
couple of (scientific) articles about it, and they suggested that perhaps it 
had a high mortality. . . . Subsequently, there was an explosion of literature 
supporting the appropriateness of the procedure." 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies have ruled that ABMT is still experimental, but have decided 
to pay for patients who meet appropriate criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics concede that the approval process is well designed and fair, but they 
argue that the decisions reached by the committees are not always implemented 
fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William P. Peters and Dr. Mark C. Rogers of Duke University reported last 
month that insurers can be "arbitrary and capricious" in denying coverage for 
ABMT, even though they approve 77% of requests for coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 They reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that they examined the 
records of 533 breast cancer patients who were candidates for ABMT and 
concluded that the decision to deny coverage for 121 patients did not seem to 
be related to the normal selection criteria for the procedure. Those denied 
coverage, they found, did not appear to be sicker or less likely to respond to 
chemotherapy -- two of the primary criteria for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible way to overcome such capriciousness is the growing use of an 
ombudsman service, such as that run by Grace Monaco in Washington, D.C. Monaco 
has compiled a list of about 140 oncology experts at medical schools throughout 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of an insurance company, she selects three or four from the 
list to review the medical records of a patient who has sought ABMT (or some 
other controversial procedure) and been denied. The panel decides if the 
treatment is appropriate and makes a recommendation to the company, which 
usually pays for the procedure if the panel approves it. 
</P>
<P>
 Aetna has sent 151 ABMT cases to Monaco, McGiveny said, and 59 have been 
denied because the treatment was not appropriate for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Hiepler, for one, believes this is the wave of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the people that should be left to decide on really tough cases, and 
their decisions are virtually litigation-proof," he said. "If I find out that 
good people like this don't think it (ABMT) should take place, I won't touch 
the case."

TANKER TRUCK CRASH KILLS 5; DRIVER HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four men and a 9-year-old girl were killed and 14 others were injured Sunday 
when a milk tanker truck plowed into a pickup truck and two Caltrans vehicles 
at a roadside cleanup by community service workers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the tanker truck, George Schappman, 36, of Manteca was arrested 
on suspicion of drunk driving after he was treated for minor injuries at a San 
Leandro hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Schappman faces charges of felony drunk driving and five counts of vehicular 
manslaughter, California Highway Patrol spokesman Mitch Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80,000-pound tanker truck was on Interstate 880 and apparently veered onto 
the shoulder about 9:15 a.m., striking a pickup truck parked behind a Caltrans 
van and bus, Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The force of the collision punched the van into the back end of the bus, 
Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-year-old Hayward girl in the pickup died at the scene. The driver of the 
pickup was critically injured and was taken to San Leandro Hospital, Mueller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four others who were killed were picking up trash as a part of 
court-ordered community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were critically injured. Others received minor injuries and were 
taken to area hospitals.

FENCE CUTS FATALITIES NEAR CHECKPOINT; BORDER: SEVEN-MILE BARRIER ON I-5 MEDIAN 
IS AMONG STEPS TAKEN TO DETER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM RUNNING ACROSS THE 
FREEWAY. NONE HAVE DIED SINCE LAST MARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The warnings first appear just south of the checkpoint here and continue 
almost as far north as the San Onofre nuclear power plant. Well-known by now, 
they depict the silhouette of a man, woman and child dashing across a yellow 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawing symbolizes the real people who make the grim run for their lives 
across Interstate 5 as they try to elude the U.S. Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Until August, when a seven-mile-long, eight-foot-high fence was erected in the 
median strip from Las Pulgas Road in Camp Pendleton to the edge of the 
checkpoint, the warnings went largely unheeded -- both by fleeing illegal 
immigrants and streams of speeding motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 But the $458,000 fence seems to have had an impact, according to the Border 
Patrol and California Highway Patrol -- and one key statistic backs them up. 
For more than a year -- since March 14, 1993 -- no pedestrian fatalities or 
injuries have occurred along the 18-mile stretch between Las Pulgas Road and 
the checkpoint three miles south of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the fence is hardly viewed as a panacea. Good luck and several random 
factors have also been a factor in the lack of deaths, said Karl Hansen, 
spokesman for the Highway Patrol, which documents pedestrian fatalities near 
the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP and Border Patrol "tend to celebrate anything that's had a positive 
impact," he said, "which the fence certainly has. But it's not the foolproof 
answer. Next week, we could have five or six people hit. We hope and pray it 
continues to work. But the problem remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was so different in 1991, when we only had two fatalities, as compared 
to 1990, when we had 15 -- our worst year ever?" Hansen asked. "Luck does have 
a certain amount to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics bear out the random nature of the problem -- four fatalities in 
1993, before the fence was completed in August; seven fatalities in 1992; two 
in 1991; 15 in 1990; 14 in 1989; six in 1988, and five in 1987, according to 
the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Hansen and others credit an aggressive public relations 
campaign carried out by the CHP's Mexican liaison office for having spread the 
word about the dangers of Southland freeways to the migrant labor camps of San 
Diego and Orange counties and the rural communities of northern Baja 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to control the problem, the CHP in 1992 received a federal grant 
to station three more officers along the 18-mile stretch, but in that year, 
seven immigrants were struck and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, the funding was cut. And before the fence could be 
completed, four fatalities occurred, along with one serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedestrian fatalities near the checkpoint have long had an impact on hospitals 
in south Orange County, which ended up with scores of severe trauma cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Thomas Shaver, director of trauma services at Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo -- where many of the victims were treated -- 
has been an outspoken critic of the federal government for, in his words, 
helping to create the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver favors a blockade at the San Ysidro port of entry, similar to the one 
in El Paso, Tex., under which all available agents would be deployed at the 
international border. Under that plan, any would-be immigrants who somehow make 
it across would be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a blockade would spell the end of the San Clemente checkpoint, which 
Shaver sees as playing a fatal role in most of the incidents involving 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole point is why create a dangerous obstacle 66 miles (from the 
border)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost of treating one patient admitted to a trauma center is 
$22,000, Shaver noted, and in the case of a severe head injury, the cost jumps 
to $250,000. Long-term rehabilitation sends the total higher. Because most 
patients are uninsured, the cost is borne by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scene eerily similar to the signs, one child, an 8-year-old Mexican boy, 
died in 1990 trying to cross the freeway in the southbound lanes when he was 
struck by a car while clutching his mother's coat. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get these patients, they are so violently injured because of the 
impact that you work hard, but the outcome . . . is never satisfactory," Shaver 
said. "It will never make them physically or mentally whole, nor will they ever 
be gainfully employed." 
</P>
<P>
 But the doctor praised the fence for creating at least a stopgap deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a fence can help stop that, it has to be viewed as a step in the right 
direction," he said. "If it's helped to stop the loss of life, I'm all for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the fence appears to have halted what extra personnel and 
flashing warning signs could not. The wire barrier is applauded by state and 
federal officials, who have no intention of closing the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the fence as having a dramatic impact," said G.C. Geer, the agent in 
charge of the San Clemente Border Patrol station. "But other factors have 
helped too. Warning signs went in (in 1991), and Caltrans started stripping 
away vegetation in the median (in 1992)." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the same year the CHP launched a speed reduction campaign that the 
agency believes has also helped cut down on fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no measure has eliminated illegal immigration near the checkpoint. Geer 
said that more than 50,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended there in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimates that 90% of those trying to head north -- illegal immigrants, 
drug smugglers or anyone else attempting to traverse the dark stretches of I-5 
-- are now staying east of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government has appropriated $30 million for the first phase of a new 
16-lane freeway checkpoint proposed for the Horno Canyon area, adjacent to the 
Camp Pendleton Marine Base. The checkpoint would have 16 electronic gates for 
traffic flow, and added truck scales and booths for Border Patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new checkpoint is not expected to open for at least another decade.

UNCERTAINTIES FACE HMO PLAN FOR MEDI-CAL; HEALTH: CRITICS SAY CONVERSION COULD 
INCREASE COSTS AND TAKE KEY INCOME AWAY FROM CLINICS THAT ALSO CARE FOR 
LOW-INCOME PEOPLE WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR STATE AID. WILSON OFFICIALS INSIST THE 
PROPOSAL WILL WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the Wilson Administration poised to advance toward its goal of putting 
2.5 million low-income Californians into managed care health plans, significant 
questions remain about whether the effort will work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although advocates say the proposal will provide the same mainstream health 
care to the poor that many other Californians enjoy, critics fear that it may 
backfire and cause millions of low-income Californians to fall through the 
cracks. Another fear is that the plan may threaten the existence of the 
community clinics and other local providers that have served the poor for so 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also concerns that the state's "strategic plan" may be more 
expensive than the present fee-for-service system. 
</P>
<P>
 Voicing some of the concerns, state Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill 
recently urged the Legislature to rescind the broad authority it gave the state 
Department of Health Services to expand managed care "because we believe these 
efforts . . . are likely to result in additional costs to the Medi-Cal program, 
rather than achieve savings." 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Health Services officials continue to insist that their 
managed care plan will greatly improve health care to a large number of 
Medi-Cal recipients. Specifically they cite those enrolled in Aid to Families 
with Dependent Children (AFDC), most of them impoverished mothers and children 
who traditionally have been shunned by the mainstream health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Pierce, a Medi-Cal contract specialist and one of the architects of the 
plan, said the immediate goal was not to cut costs. "The bottom line is this 
program has always been about getting access for a population of very 
vulnerable people, pregnant women, children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions are being raised against the backdrop of a campaign by a 
coalition of eight large HMOs to win one of the biggest prizes offered by the 
state: the exclusive right to be the private sector provider of health care to 
about 40% of the AFDC recipients enrolled in Medi-Cal in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial contract is expected to be worth roughly $450 million, but there 
is a much bigger prize on the horizon. Overall, federal, state and local 
governments pump about $15 billion in taxpayer dollars into Medi-Cal each year, 
and far bigger contracts are in the offing if state health planners get their 
way and convert more of the Medi-Cal program to managed care. 
</P>
<P>
 Under managed care, health care providers agree to furnish all the care 
necessary to Medi-Cal members at a fixed rate. This benefits the clients 
because they would have all the privileges of other HMO members. It benefits 
the state because the rates would be capped, while the HMOs take the risk of 
providing more expensive care should the members develop a serious illness. The 
HMOs benefit by enrolling a large number of relatively healthy people, and 
getting reimbursed for each one of them, regardless of whether treatment is 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current fee-for-service system, Medi-Cal members can pick a doctor 
or hospital of their choice, and the state gets billed for each service 
provided. One problem has been that many doctors or hospitals refuse to accept 
Medi-Cal patients, contending that the state's rates are too low and they do 
not want to deal with the paperwork and red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition of HMOs, which includes giants in managed care such as Kaiser 
Permanente Southern California and Cigna Healthplan and has adopted the name LA 
Health Advantage, is bidding against at least two groups. Even though the 
contracts will not be awarded until fall, the coalition is seeking local health 
clinics to sign up as subcontractors to help handle the 440,000 Medi-Cal 
beneficiaries it is hoping to represent. "If we could put a sign out, it would 
say: 'Safety net providers, please apply,' " said Joy Howell, spokeswoman for 
the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is putting together a community advisory board that it said will 
represent the racial and ethnic diversity of Los Angeles County. The first 
three names released included a black, a Latino and a Korean American. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other large HMOs bidding for the county contract are PacifiCare of 
California and Health Net. While keeping their plans as secret as possible for 
strategic reasons, both organizations are also trying to develop business 
relationships with physicians and clinics in low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that has left traditional providers of health care to the poor, such as 
the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services and community clinics, 
wondering what will be left for them when the dust settles. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest unanswered questions is what will happen to the 2.7 million 
residents of the county who do not have insurance, about 32% of the under-65 
population. These are people who work and earn enough to disqualify them from 
Medi-Cal, but do not have private or group health insurance through their 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has left this large block of medically indigent Californians out of 
its managed care plan, and is assuming no responsibility for their care, 
contending that it is a federal issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, health care for the medically indigent will still be the legal 
responsibility of the county, and the community clinics and urban hospitals 
willing to treat them. For years, the safety net providers have counted on the 
steady flow of Medi-Cal dollars to help defray the costs of treating these 
people, but a substantial amount of that flow could be diverted to commercial 
HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fern Seizer, on the board of the Venice Family Clinic and one of 40 members of 
a community-oriented coalition, the Managed Care Planning Council, predicts 
that there will not be enough money left to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a disaster for the public health system -- the county (health 
department) and clinics like ours," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traditional providers also fear that they will be left out of the new 
system, despite claims that the commercial HMOs are interested in developing 
business relationships with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Castulo de la Rocha, president of AltaMed Health Services, which has a heavily 
Latino patient load, said: "I am really concerned, and the same concern has 
been expressed by private physicians and community clinics, about the lack of 
contracting opportunities made available by the HMOs. The large HMOs look at 
large medical groups (for subcontracting), and not necessarily at the small 
organizations or medical groups that you would find in the inner cities," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without naming the company, Rocha said a large HMO had recently turned down 
AltaMed for a contract because "No. 1, we were told essentially that as an 
organization we did not have enough experience working in the HMO market, and, 
No. 2, we were too small." 
</P>
<P>
 Another question hovering over the state's plan is how long the corporate 
chiefs who run the commercial HMOs will remain interested in serving the 
Medi-Cal population. It is widely acknowledged, even by the HMOs, that language 
differences, variations in cultural beliefs and the common thread of poverty 
can present special problems in providing health care to this group. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the carrot at the end of the stick is the state's promise to properly 
fund its Medi-Cal HMO contracts. But the state also has a track record of 
squeezing the Medi-Cal program when it runs into budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 An industry newsletter, Managed Competition, recently noted that California 
froze its HMO Medi-Cal rates for welfare recipients in the Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children program at $95.80 per member per month, less than half the 
amount paid by Massachusetts and well below the $110 to $130 it said most 
states pay. 
</P>
<P>
 One HMO executive, asking not to be identified, said the political vagaries of 
rate-setting by the state are very much a concern. 
</P>
<P>
 But other executives said they expect to make the program work. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare of California does not have any Medi-Cal clients, but for years has 
done a big business with Medicare under the name Secure Horizons. Carol Rhoads, 
who is developing PacifiCare's contract bid, said: "We think we can get a 
reasonable return on this business. It is not a lucrative business, but it is a 
large market and we think we can make it work."

TABLOID MAY FACE FURTHER DAMAGES IN LIBEL LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Monica Superior Court jury will reconvene this morning to consider 
whether the Globe tabloid must pay punitive damages in addition to a $675,000 
libel award for falsely suggesting that a Bakersfield farmer was the assassin 
of Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 After a nearly four-week trial that featured an extensive review of the June 
5, 1968, shooting of Kennedy in Los Angeles, the jury Friday found that the 
Globe must pay Khalid Khawar for injury to his reputation and emotional 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
 The tabloid newspaper in April, 1989, carried a story on a book by author 
Robert Morrow, entitled "The Senator Must Die: The Murder of Robert F. 
Kennedy," which alleged that a secret Iranian police hit squad -- and not 
convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan -- was responsible for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The article was accompanied by a photograph showing Kennedy claiming victory 
in the California Democratic presidential primary on stage at the Ambassador 
Hotel moments before he was killed. Over the photo was an arrow pointing to 
Khawar, then a young free-lance photographer, who was clad in a yellow sweater 
and carrying a camera while standing not far from Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 A caption said Morrow claims that an Iranian agent in the photograph killed 
Kennedy with a gun disguised to look like a camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica attorney Francis C. Pizzulli, who represented Khawar, said the 
$675,000 judgment shows "if you repeat a lie and you know it's a lie, you can't 
get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Khawar, who grows oranges and grapes on his Bakersfield farm, was present for 
the verdict and is "very pleased that his name has been cleared," Pizzulli 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills attorney Anthony M. Glassman, who represented the Globe, 
expressed "obvious disappointment" with the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said "the book apparently did not tell the truth about Mr. 
Khawar," Glassman questioned how the tabloid could be forced to pay damages 
when it "accurately, fairly and in a neutral fashion" reported on the 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a book," he said. "I don't think we shoot the messenger in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Glassman expressed the hope that the award will be set aside by Superior Court

TURNOUT IN UKRAINE IS WELL ABOVE 50% REQUIRED TO MAKE THE ELECTION VALID 
</P>

<P>
 Angered by an economy that's going nowhere fast, Ukrainians voted in large 
numbers Sunday to replace the Communist-dominated Parliament that has blocked 
reforms and opposes nuclear disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine ignored a presidential order by holding 
referendums on closer ties with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The brisk turnout for parliamentary elections, Ukraine's first since the 
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, defied predictions of voter apathy. 
Preliminary turnout on a crisp, sunny day topped 67% by evening, well above the 
50% needed for the election to be valid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Ukraine understand very well these are not ordinary elections," 
said Viktor Pohorylo, deputy chairman of the Election Commission. "This is a 
vote for future social peace." 
</P>
<P>
 First results were not expected until at least today. 
</P>
<P>
 The election took place amid growing economic despair in Ukraine. After voting 
in central Kiev, President Leonid Kravchuk said he hoped for a pro-reform 
Parliament but warned that he will postpone presidential elections if the new 
Parliament deepened political chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 The election could fuel tensions between the pro-Russian east and the 
nationalist west. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood is mixed. Some don't know whom to vote for and the rest are more 
radical. I don't think Communists will get votes in western Ukraine," said Yuri 
Hresko, who was helping get out the vote in Lvov, near the Polish border.

TURKISH LEADER RECEIVES SOLID BOOST IN LOCAL BALLOTING; POLITICS: LEFTIST PRIME 
MINISTER HOLDS OFF HER CONSERVATIVE RIVALS AND ASCENDING ISLAMISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Tansu Ciller won an unexpected new lease on political life in 
nationwide municipal elections Sunday, holding off her rivals on the right as 
well as a challenge from Turkey's rising Islamists. 
</P>
<P>
 Early returns showed Ciller's conservative True Path Party with 26.3% of the 
first 1.5 million votes counted for municipal councils, the most party-oriented 
overall vote. Turkey's electorate of 32 million people was voting for more than 
80,000 local council members and 2,700 town mayors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result is a greater tactical victory than even Mrs. Ciller expected, a 
vote for continuation. People have opted for stability," commentator Gungor 
Mengi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent's success is surprising because Turkey is facing its worst 
fiscal crisis in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 International rating agencies have downgraded Turkey's credit worthiness twice 
this year in a vote of no confidence in the policies of Ciller's 9-month-old 
government. The Turkish lira has lost more than 70% of its value, the stock 
market has slumped, and industry is sliding into recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-Islamist Welfare Party appears to have capitalized on Turkish anger at 
the economic mismanagement, an arthritic parliamentary system and corrupt 
political classes. Taking votes from leftist parties, the Welfare Party 
advanced to take about 20% of the municipal council vote. It won several 
mayoralty races in rural areas and the mainly Kurdish southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen what the others do. We want clean leaders. That's why I switched 
from the True Path to the Welfare Party," said Zeki Atay, a 41-year-old voter 
in Istanbul. "Bringing Islamic law would be good, but I don't think anybody 
wants to force women to wear the veil." 
</P>
<P>
 The other 80% of Turkey's mostly Muslim population seemed to have little time 
for even such moderate Islamic talk. The Islamists' hopes of winning the great 
prize of Istanbul were also dashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey's biggest city seems likely to be one of the consolation prizes for the 
center-right Motherland Party, which continued its slow decline in the national 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important for Turkey is that Ciller has a new mandate heading toward the 
next parliamentary elections in 1996. All expect a new army crackdown on 
Kurdish rebels and an austerity program to get the economy back on track. 
Newspapers predict huge price rises, tax increases, budget cuts, speedier 
privatization and early retirement for officials in the bloated bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no time left to lose. Turkey must take the necessary measures 
immediately," said Halis Komili, the chief of the influential union of Turkish 
businessmen, Tusiad. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminders of the problems shadowing this country between the Balkans, the 
Caucasus and the Middle East are never far away. 
</P>
<P>
 A bomb exploded Sunday and injured three Western European tourists at the gate 
of Istanbul's great Byzantine cathedral, Haghia Sophia. Another bomb in the 
Covered Bazaar injured four people Thursday, including two Eastern Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurdish guerrillas who have been fighting since 1984 for greater ethnic and 
political rights would neither confirm nor deny telephone claims that one of 
their groups was responsible as part of the Marxist rebels' attempts to disrupt 
Turkish tourism revenue.

MILLIONS OF ITALIANS VOTE AT END OF BITTER CAMPAIGNS; EUROPE: PERSONALITIES AND 
PARTIES OVERSHADOW THE ISSUES. BALLOTING WILL CONTINUE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under sparkling Palm Sunday skies, the vanguard of 48 million Italian voters 
meandered leisurely to the polls for national elections expected to recast 
their troubled nation's political future. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting to renew a bicameral national legislature resumes this morning and 
continues until 10 p.m. Exit polls should be available around noon Pacific 
time, but Interior Ministry officials do not expect authoritative returns 
before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues weighed less in the campaign than stark left, center and right 
divisions carved around personalities and their political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 In all three camps, there is broad agreement that Italy should remain an 
integral part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union, 
that its economy should remain free market with a strong social awareness, that 
major government-controlled industries should be privatized and that a national 
government saddled with huge public debts should be made more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Such general consensus was obscured, however, by campaign vitriol with Cold 
War echoes. With many voters undecided until the last minute and no polls 
published in the last two weeks of the campaign, the outcome was anybody's 
guess. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, voters chose candidates rather than parties in 
winner-take-all voting for three-quarters of the 630 seats in the lower house 
and 315 seats in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "These elections are without doubt a decisive moment in the history of our 
country," President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro said after voting. Alarmed by the 
volume and tone of campaign venom, he had called for candidates to tone down 
their rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts predicted a tight finish between a three-party right-wing 
alliance headed by political newcomer Silvio Berlusconi, one of Italy's richest 
men, and an eight-party leftist alliance centered on the former Italian 
Communist Party led by Achille Occhetto. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, a self-made Milan billionaire, ran on an anti-communism platform 
and the promises of more jobs and lower taxes. "Oppressor," he snarled at 
Occhetto in a vituperative televised debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Occhetto, who transformed what was once the largest Communist Party in the 
West into the social democratic Party of the Democratic Left, ran on 
conservative economics and experience -- his party has administered virtually 
every major Italian city in recent years. "Demagogue," Occhetto snapped at 
Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the elections will strip authority from the political center, 
embodied by the former Christian Democrats who dominated all 52 Italian 
governments since World War II. Decimated and splintered by a corruption 
scandal that has tarred thousands of politicians and businessmen, the best the 
Christian Democrats could hope for this time is a junior partnership in a new 
coalition government dominated by newcomers of either the left or right. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections were extended to a second day to allow members of Italy's small 
Jewish community observing Passover to vote after sundown today. Fewer than 
half of the 519 voters registered at Precinct 2397 in the heart of Rome's old 
Jewish ghetto voted Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of where we are and who we are, we expect the big rush tomorrow after 
the sun goes down," said Giancarlo Ministieri, poll-watcher for the leftist 
alliance at a middle school turned polling station in the ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the venomous campaign, Election Day itself was quiet -- a street 
festival for many Romans. 
</P>
<P>
 No major incidents were reported in a country where electoral high jinks are 
not unknown. In the past, the dead have been known to vote in southern areas of 
the country where organized crime plays a major political role. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, by contrast, Calabrians could vote for the dead. Domenico Longo, a 
neo-fascist candidate in the town of Cosenza, died after the ballots were 
printed, but judges said votes for him would count.

 Opponents of the Pakistani government battled police and troops during a 
protest strike, pelting cars with stones and setting buses on fire.At least 
four people were killed. Karachi, a sprawling port city of about 10 million 
people, has been troubled by repeated confrontations between security forces 
and the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, a political party opposed to Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto's government. Supporters of the movement waged gun battles with 
police and army troops in several parts of the city, security forces said. The 
strike shut down much of the city's business, schools and transportation.

 An orgy of looting and gunfights has been launched around U.N. bases in 
Mogadishu, the Somali capital, where peacekeepers were struggling to prevent 
mayhem just two days after U.S. forces pulled out.Razor wire, fences, tanks and 
sandbagged machine gun posts around the bases have not stopped determined 
Somalis. "There have been various incidents of looting at the airport and 
seaport. . . . There have been lapses in security," a U.N. military spokesman, 
Maj. Chris Budge, told reporters. Budge said Somalis were cutting holes through 
wire fences around the U.N.-controlled airfield and slipping past Egyptian 
guards. At the seaport, they siphoned fuel from U.N. storage tanks and stole 
tires and office equipment.

 Waving palm branches and singing hymns, about a thousand Christian pilgrims 
from around the world marched down the slopes of the Mount of Olives to mark 
Palm Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The procession walked from the Mount of Olives into the walled Old City amid 
tight security.Border police with submachine guns accompanied the pilgrims on 
foot, and several jeeps were stationed at points along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli security forces are on high alert, fearing revenge attacks by 
Palestinian militants for the Feb. 25 massacre in Hebron carried out by a 
Jewish settler. Security officials have been warned that assailants might 
strike during the eight-day Jewish Passover holiday, which began Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Sunday, which commemorates Jesus' entry into Jerusalem when the 
multitudes proclaiming him King of Israel laid palm branches before him, falls 
on the Sunday before Easter.

<P>
 Many expected visitors to the Holy Land have stayed away, fearing new 
violence. Hoteliers and souvenir dealers say the prospects for the Easter 
pilgrim trade are also blighted.

HOSOKAWA'S COALITION VICTORIOUS IN A KEY GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition won a test-case election for 
governor of Ishikawa prefecture, or state, Sunday that tore another hole in the 
fabric of power of the once-almighty Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first head-on gubernatorial race between a candidate for Hosokawa's 
seven-party coalition and the Liberal Democrats, voters in the state west of 
Tokyo gave the coalition candidate, Masamori Tanimoto, the 48-year-old former 
vice governor, 288,085 votes, or 46.9% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiroshi Ishikawa, 65, a former upper house member of the Liberal Democratic 
Party, whose 38-year rule ended in August, won 277,426, or 45.2%. A Communist 
picked up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a badly needed victory for Hosokawa, who has come under increasing 
pressure to reveal details of a 100-million yen ($952,000) "loan" he has 
admitted receiving from a gangster-tainted parcel-delivery company. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign became an extension of national politics, with Liberal Democrats 
insisting that Hosokawa disclose more documents and allow his former secretary 
to testify under oath in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, stumping in the prefecture Saturday, called the election an 
"extremely important" test of the coalition's ability to unite behind 
candidates in preparation for both an upper house election and nationwide local 
elections scheduled for next year, as well as for the next lower house 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister was among 100 members of Parliament who stumped during the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanimoto's victory marked the first time that a candidate not backed by the 
Liberal Democrats, who still control most of the gubernatorial and local 
assembly posts in the country, has been elected to the top post in Ishikawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The midterm death of the previous governor precipitated the election. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was the first time that the business community backed a non-Liberal 
Democrat in a gubernatorial election anywhere.

NEWS ANALYSIS; SALVADOR'S ELECTION UNVEILS FUTURE WOES; POLITICS: THE RULING 
PARTY'S VICTORY IS OVERSHADOWED BY THE FACT THAT THOUSANDS WERE PREVENTED FROM 
VOTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first elections here since the end of a brutal civil war were meant to be 
an important test of El Salvador's struggle to recover from more than a decade 
of bloodshed and division. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet serious irregularities that prevented tens of thousands of people from 
voting showed that El Salvador, despite two years of U.N. tutelage, is still a 
long way from building a real democracy. Last Sunday's flawed elections also 
raised questions about the future of the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salvadorans trusted that the international community was going to guarantee 
the rules," said political scientist Hector Dada, who heads a liberal think 
tank. "The lesson was that without a (strong) civil society, you cannot have 
free, democratic elections. These elections laid bare the real problem: You 
have to build democratic structures in order to guarantee elections." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling right-wing party rolled to victory in elections in which nearly 
half the registered electorate did not, or could not, vote. Because right-wing 
presidential candidate Armando Calderon Sol fell shy of an absolute majority, 
however, he was forced into a runoff with Ruben Zamora, a leftist legislator 
who heads a coalition that includes former guerrillas who waged war against a 
string of U.S.-backed governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The presidential race is almost a moot point. Zamora is not expected to be 
able to overcome Calderon Sol's sizable lead. Still at issue, however, are 
legislative and local posts that will determine the balance of power in postwar 
El Salvador. It is at this crucial level, where a small number of votes can 
change the outcome, that the voting irregularities may have had the greatest 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The left is challenging results in 37 of El Salvador's 262 municipalities, and 
three seats in the 84-member national legislature are also being disputed, 
according to Joaquin Villalobos, former commander of the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front, the guerrilla army that became a political party 
under U.N.-brokered peace accords that ended the war in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Those three seats in the legislature will determine whether the ruling 
Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, has majority control or whether the 
opposition will have enough votes to block unwanted legislation and influence 
the choice of a new Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Arena and its allies controlled the National Assembly during the term of 
outgoing President Alfredo Cristiani and were able to approve such 
controversial laws as a 1992 amnesty pardoning war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition fears that an Arena-dominated legislature would roll back some 
of the reforms enacted as part of the peace accords, such as the formation of a 
civilian police force. Calderon Sol has said he supports the peace process but 
does not agree with all of the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dada, the political scientist, said the perception of election fraud 
discourages people who are only gradually being incorporated into a democratic 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "People value democracy more if they have elected their closest leader, the 
one they can see and greet on the street," Dada said. "People have the idea 
these elections were not clean, and that does not help build democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 On Election Day, thousands of people with valid voter cards were turned away 
from the polls because their names had been omitted from registry lists. Tens 
of thousands more never received their cards despite having completed the 
paperwork in time. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision by the official Supreme Electoral Tribunal to concentrate voting 
stations in a handful of locations meant inordinately long lines and forced 
some voters to travel across town or for miles over country roads to their 
designated ballot boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The irregularities alone do not account for the losses suffered by the former 
guerrillas in their first foray into mainstream politics. The left 
overestimated its strength in some areas, and some citizens may have been 
casting their vote to punish the guerrillas for their role in the war's 
destruction. And many voters clearly favored the image of stability that Arena 
sought to project. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some of the worst irregularities were reported in areas of traditional 
leftist support, such as Morazan, Chalatenango and Soyapango. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora said that despite the widespread irregularities he will participate in 
the runoff, which will probably take place April 24. But he said he was 
disturbed by the flaws and insisted that steps be taken to correct them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want to use the word fraud , because fraud would imply having to 
withdraw from the electoral system," Zamora told a news conference late last 
week. "(But) we cannot accept that more than 45% of the people do not vote, and 
they don't vote because the system rejects them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some veteran observers of Salvadoran elections, such as British scholar David 
Browning, are skeptical that changes will be made in the next month, especially 
because many of the same problems were noted in 1991 legislative elections and 
never corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers and resident diplomats reserved the most harsh criticism for 
the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Although opposition parties have 
representatives on the tribunal, it is dominated by magistrates who support 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribunal was repeatedly accused of violating the election code it was 
appointed to uphold, and diplomats said it routinely ignored advice from U.N. 
observers assigned to monitor the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, the tribunal was supposed to appoint an auditor to monitor the 
millions of dollars donated by the United States, Europe and the United Nations 
for the elections. The tribunal never appointed an auditor, saying it could not 
find a firm willing to do the job.

 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin returned to Moscow on Sunday after a 
two-week holiday on the Black Sea coast, seeking to bring his authority to bear 
after a week of coup and illness rumors in the Russian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters before his plane took off for Moscow from Adler airport, 
near the resort of Sochi, Yeltsin scoffed at reports in the various media that 
he was seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the rainy weather, I had a good time. I even played tennis and swam 
in the sea, although the temperature was only about 7 or 8 degrees (Celsius)," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can a sick man swim in the sea when it's 8 degrees (46 Fahrenheit)?" he 
asked, according to Itar-Tass news agency.

THE NEW PIONEERS; NOT QUITE ACCORDING TO MASTER PLANS; DOWNTURN IN HOME, 
BUSINESS MARKET FORCED MANY DEVELOPERS TO RETHINK IDEAS FOR THE FOOTHILLS 
COMMUNITIES

<P>
 Near the southern end of this small community in the foothills of South 
County, a 100-acre parcel of partially graded land sits dormant, waiting for 
the industrial development that never came. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to the west, in the neighboring, unincorporated community of Foothill 
Ranch, 130 acres initially improved for commercial use are also vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 And down the road in Rancho Santa Margarita, a steadily growing village that 
its planners say will one day emerge as the urban center of South County, more 
than two-thirds of the 450 acres of land in the business park have not been 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 These parcels of unsold, mostly undeveloped industrial land in the young 
communities of the foothills region represent one of the most visible signs 
here of the prolonged recession that crippled the Southern California 
construction industry and threw at least a temporary wrench into the ambitious 
plans of the area's developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin Co. President Al Baldwin, whose firm is the master developer of 
Portola Hills, said plans to develop an industrial park and neighborhood 
commercial center in the now-empty 100 acres on Glenn Ranch Road have existed 
since the community first opened in 1985. When the recession hit, though, the 
few inquiries he had received simply dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 "And right now, there are just no users willing to buy those parcels," Baldwin 
said. "There's been no interest at all." 
</P>
<P>
 And even with encouraging signals that the worst may be past -- including 
recent figures showing that Orange County home sales in 1993 were substantially 
ahead of 1992 -- the downturn's devastating effects on the developers and 
builders working in the region remain clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late '80s, the master developers of many of these new communities were 
in the middle of opening their doors and putting together a strategy for the 
next five to seven years," said Irvine development consultant Kenneth Agid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly," he said, "there was this tremendous interruption, and it affected 
everything from the timing of their plans to ultimately, the survival of many 
of the builders." 
</P>
<P>
 In its wake, developers like the William Lyon Co. of Newport Beach, the master 
developer of Robinson Ranch, have undergone painful restructurings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many others have had to cut employees and learn to operate more efficiently 
including the Santa Margarita Co., the master planner behind Rancho Santa 
Margarita that is run by Anthony Moiso, which laid off nearly a third of its 
employees between 1990 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the region's unincorporated, master-planned communities, several of which 
opened in the heady days of the late 1980s, the recession's bite was seen most 
dramatically in a sudden slowing of the furious pace of development. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the developers had to postpone their plans because of the lack of money," 
said Sanford Goodkin of Goodkin and Associates, a real estate consulting firm 
in San Diego. "There was hardly any money around for the improvement of land, 
and construction financing just shut down completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "While it would have been very difficult for anything to be hit harder than 
residential home sales, all the demand also dried up for anything commercial 
and industrial," Goodkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, if everything had gone according to the original plans for 
Rancho Santa Margarita -- and every acre of it is planned -- the community by 
the turn of the century was expected to be home to 50,000 residents and support 
26,000 jobs. Built on 5,000 acres just east of Mission Viejo, the village was 
designed to allow residents to live, work and play within its bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 With six years to go toward that self-imposed but much-publicized deadline set 
by the master planners, nearly 21,000 people now make their homes in Rancho 
Santa Margarita. And the Santa Margarita Co.'s official goal for its population 
has now been revised to 40,000, which officials say is more realistic after 
plans for high-rise apartment buildings in the town's center were scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 More significantly, though, for Rancho Santa Margarita residents hoping to 
find work within the community, the recession pushed back plans for job 
creation. Even with Loral Aeronutronic of Newport Beach moving its aerospace 
division and 1,300 employees this spring to a building vacated two years ago by 
Hughes Aircraft, the community's work force will stand at just about 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Company president Moiso -- whose family has owned land in the region since the 
late 19th Century -- declined to be interviewed for this story, referring 
questions to his senior vice president, Donald E. Moe. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe said land sales for factories, warehouses and corporate office space in 
the vast business park, which lies near the center point of Rancho Santa 
Margarita's Y-shaped design, have been flat for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1990 to 1993, the company sold 20 acres of commercial land, or about half 
the amount sold in 1989 alone, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recession just shut down business property land sales across the board," 
Moe said. "When companies are trying so hard just to survive, they're obviously 
not expanding; they're not buying new corporate headquarters or even thinking 
about moving." 
</P>
<P>
 As they did virtually across the board, home sales also slipped in Rancho 
Santa Margarita during the recession, falling from a high of 1,175 in 1989 to 
702 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But capitalizing on its market niche as a center of lower-priced homes, often 
for first-time buyers, the community still managed to rank first in the county 
for new home sales for both 1992 and 1993, according to the Research Network, a 
real estate research firm in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bright spot has been the pace of deals in the Town Center, a business, 
retail and entertainment hub that will become Rancho Santa Margarita's 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine acres have been sold to Target, and Edwards Cinema has signed a letter of 
intent to build a multiscreen theater complex. And the first phase of the Town 
Center, a 162,000-square-foot shopping area known as Plaza Antonio, is 
completed and 95% is leased, according to company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In Foothill Ranch, too, the retail picture has been relatively rosy recently, 
helped along by the opening last October of the first phase of the Foothill 
tollway, a 30-mile roadway that at completion will connect San Clemente and 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 900,000 square feet of retail space is now under construction at 
Foothill Ranch Towne Centre, including such large stores as Mervyn's, Wal-Mart 
and HomeBase. A 24-screen theater project is also in the works for the center, 
which will ultimately include 1.3 million square feet and is expected to be 
completed in 1995, said a spokesman for Hon Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 142 acres originally intended for industrial use, though, only 12 have 
been sold so far -- and all in the past 18 months -- said Dougall Agan, vice 
president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there's hasn't been a huge demand for that type of property since 
the community opened in 1991, but we're relatively pleased with it right now," 
Agan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Coto de Caza, a gated residential community that borders Rancho 
Santa Margarita, the changing real estate realities of the 1990s have meant 
plans for a greater mix of homes, including some starting in the low $200,000 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the slump, the community's developers late last year unveiled plans 
for the southern half of Coto de Caza, including 4,000 new homes and a second 
golf course, a move that was cited by industry analysts as an early signal of a 
potential residential real estate turnaround in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers -- a partnership of Chevron Land Co. and Arvida/JMB Partners -- 
also unveiled plans for about 1,200 attached and detached single-family homes 
that will be built just outside the gates and priced from $120,000 to $250,000. 
The lower-priced neighborhood, still unnamed, will satisfy the affordable 
housing guidelines required by the county when plans for Coto were first 
processed. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the aftermath of the recession, Coto's marketing campaigns will no 
longer cast the community as quite so exclusive or expensive, geared only 
toward those able to afford its luxury, custom homes, many on huge lots with 
equestrian easements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where Coto was marketed before as exclusive, high-end, horse property, we 
want to position the community now to target a broad range of buyers, all the 
way from young families to older couples," said Tom Martin, vice president of 
marketing for the Coto de Caza Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 With housing prices throughout Orange County down about 20% from the market's 
peak, the company wants "to make it clear that living here is a reality now for 
many who might not have been able to afford it before," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But both Coto de Caza and Rancho Santa Margarita were more fortunate than Dove 
Canyon, which was hit with plummeting housing prices just after it opened its 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the first homes in Dove Canyon, a small, gated community that 
borders the Cleveland National Forest and will eventually include 1,300 units, 
were completed and occupied in early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few years, the homeowners watched their real estate values 
plummet an average of $50,000. Building slowed, then virtually stopped, as 
developers holding the land parcels were forced to sell out to others. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pace of building -- and sales -- has quickened again, with nine 
developments now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Smith, vice president for marketing of the Dove Canyon Co., said that 
because of the real estate slump, officials also have decided against including 
any custom homes in Dove Canyon. The developers recently sold off a parcel of 
lots originally intended for that purpose to a builder who plans to put up 
tract housing, she said.

THE NEW PIONEERS; LOOKING FOR A 'PERFECT WORLD'; SECURITY, TRANQUILLITY, HOME 
PRICES ARE ATTRACTING BUYERS TO DOVE CANYON 
</P>

 They liked the gate, they said, and the security it promised. They liked the 
golf course, the mountain views, the three-car garages. And they liked both the 
distance from established North County cities like Anaheim and the proximity to 
tony Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the sales office at Waterford Crest, a new development in this gated 
community in Orange County's southern foothills, sales representative Kim Cavin 
nodded her approval. These potential buyers, after all, were echoing the themes 
of a new marketing campaign that invites visitors to enter Dove Canyon's "more 
perfect world," one of comfortable homes, security patrols and bucolic vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gone crazy here lately," Cavin said one recent day, jumping up to greet 
another group that had braved frequent downpours to shop for new homes. "We all 
have traffic, we all have sales out here now." 
</P>
<P>
 After a recession-driven lull in construction that forced many builders to 
sell their land here to better-financed companies -- and prompted a few to 
refer to the area as "Dead Canyon" -- the sounds of hammers and heavy equipment 
are resonating again through this scenic valley. And both lookers and buyers, 
lured by a drop in prices, are finding their way to the nine developments under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Smith, vice president of marketing for the Dove Canyon Co., said that 
depending on the location, people buying a house in the community today might 
pay anywhere from $20,000 to $150,000 less than they would have paid for a 
comparable home at the market's peak five years ago. Dove Canyon's opening in 
early 1989 came just before the devastating plunge in Southern California real 
estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous week, Cavin, 37, had sold four houses -- double her recent weekly 
average -- at the Waterford Crest development, which is built by Richmond 
American Homes. Only the day before, despite storm clouds that threatened to 
let loose all Sunday afternoon, 65 groups of potential buyers had walked 
through the models for the homes, priced from $221,000 to $266,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Activity has been strong enough lately that Richmond American raised prices in 
January an average of $6,000 for its three types of homes at Waterford Crest, 
Cavin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of Cavin's buyers are in their 30s and 40s, she said. Most are 
professionals, with annual incomes starting around $60,000, and many have young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are older couples, some of whom hope to travel when they retire and 
like the idea of leaving their homes protected behind gates, she said. A few 
are young couples, looking to move up from rented houses or condominiums in 
nearby communities. 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of the new homeowners in this region come from outside the county, 
according to The Times Orange County Poll. Those looking at property in Dove 
Canyon recently said they had heard about the area either from relatives or 
colleagues already living in Orange County, or from the splashy "more perfect 
world" newspaper ads that are part of a newly aggressive joint advertising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven Dove Canyon builders have spent about $14,000 each for a 90-day 
advertising package that began in February and is aimed at positioning the 
community as one of both affordable homes and superior amenities, according to 
Hayes-Martin Associates of Costa Mesa, which is spearheading the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman walked through Waterford's double doors, coming to a stop in front of 
a board displaying a model of the neighborhood, where tiny red and green 
buttons marked the houses already sold. Cavin launched into her pitch: "Welcome 
to Waterford Crest. What brings you out here today?" 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene Matthey, 59, said she and her husband, Leslie, also 59, had lived in 
the same house for 33 years but were thinking of moving to South County. The 
reason? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Anaheim," Darlene Matthey said in reference to the city's crime and 
congestion. "Just Anaheim. It's not the same as it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Dove Canyon, in contrast to Anaheim, she said, seemed clean, fresh, peaceful. 
And while her husband would face a much longer commute to his job as a 
stockbroker in Santa Ana, the security and tranquillity at home would be worth 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Cavin was explaining the wonders of double-paned, white vinyl windows 
and maple cabinetry to Jerry and Denise Siedhoff, who had flown in from Houston 
on a house-shopping trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Siedhoff, a bank liquidation specialist with the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., said they were moving here in June, when he will transfer to 
the agency's Irvine office. Several factors about Dove Canyon appealed to the 
couple, they said, including its natural beauty, housing values and "the fact 
that it's next door to Coto (de Caza)." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Lakeview Real Estate office inside the gates of neighboring Coto de 
Caza, realtor Bobbi Mezger was talking about the communities she works for: 
Rancho Santa Margarita, Coto de Caza, Trabuco Canyon and a little in Portola 
Hills and Foothill Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The realtor, who has been selling homes in the area for five years, said 
out-of-the-area home buyers often ask her to describe the various communities 
in order to help them find the right environment. In response, she tells them 
that the remote communities of Portola Hills and Foothill Ranch have a more 
rural feeling than the more densely built Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Coto de Caza, where Mezger lives and does most of her business, is the most 
expensive and resort-like, she said, with equestrian easements and a second 
golf course now under construction. Homes there, including condominiums, 
typically sell for an average of $75,000 more than nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dove Canyon? "Compared to Coto, it's a housing tract versus a community," 
she said. "I know that sounds terrible, but it's true. Don't get me wrong, they 
have lots of wonderful facilities and great values there right now, but 
compared to this, Dove feels like Irvine behind gates to me." 
</P>
<P>
 True or not, Coto de Caza resident Kelli Krienke apparently doesn't share that 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Krienke, 30, was eagerly taking her second, detailed look at a 
four-bedroom home at Waterford Crest in Dove Canyon. She said she and her 
husband had lived in a condominium in Coto for three years but were looking 
forward to getting into a house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like Coto a lot but this is nice, too," she said. "We've looked around the 
area but we've just really gotten used to the feeling of security in a gated 
community and we want to stay in one if we can." Homes In the Hills

NATION'S MEDICAL SCHOOLS SEE REVENUE SOURCES DRY UP; MEDICINE: PROPOSED CLINTON 
HEALTH REFORM CUTS WOULD ADD TO BATTERING FROM INSURERS. SOME URBAN TEACHING 
HOSPITALS MAY BE FACING BANKRUPTCY.

<P>
 Battered by insurance companies looking for bargains and terrified of cuts 
proposed by President Clinton in their Medicare payments, officials of some of 
the nation's most prestigious hospitals say they are worried about the future 
of their institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most severely squeezed are the teaching hospitals that train many of the 
nation's doctors and the massive urban hospitals that serve poor communities as 
everything from family doctor's office to surgical center. 
</P>
<P>
 Institutions that play both these roles are in a double bind. In California 
alone, several medical schools eventually could face bankruptcy without 
financial help, warned Dr. David Korn, dean of the Stanford University Medical 
School.

 The federal Medicare program for the elderly, recognizing the special needs of 
these hospitals, offers them extra reimbursement to compensate for their 
elevated costs. But now President Clinton wants to cut their special Medicare 
subsidies by $31 billion over five years as part of his plan to overhaul the 
nation's health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire what President Clinton is trying to do," said Sheldon King, who just 
retired as chief administrator at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
"But to say that hospitals can take all these cuts and provide care for 
everyone without the quality suffering, that is patent nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the biggest hospitals are heavily dependent on the flow of federal 
dollars. Just 71 of the more than 6,600 hospitals enrolled in the Medicare 
program received 10% of all Medicare funds distributed in 1992, according to a 
computer-aided analysis of the more than 11 million patients served by 
hospitals that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals receive a fixed fee, set in advance, for each Medicare case, 
according to their diagnosis of a patient's ailments. Reimbursement rates are 
so low that the federal government covers just 88% of the full cost of caring 
for elderly or disabled Medicare patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals have been able to fill most of the gap by charging patients with 
private health insurance for more than the full cost of their care. Altogether, 
patients with private insurance pay 129% of the actual cost of their care, 
according to a special study commission created by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, hospitals receive Medicare bonuses for training doctors and for 
treating poor people who cannot pay their bills. It is these two subsidies that 
are now in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 All this comes at a time when hospitals of all stripes are under increasing 
pressure to cut costs. In California, for example, more than half the 
population is enrolled in cost-conscious networks operated by health 
maintenance organizations or insurance companies -- and they drive a tough 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health alliances will say: 'We're interested in having you in our network of 
providers, but we will pay you nothing more than we pay the hospital up the 
street,' " King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars-Sinai loses $2 million a year on its trauma center, which treats a 
thousand mangled and battered victims of car wrecks, shootings, stabbings, 
fires and falls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the teeth, the fangs of the storm," Korn said. Stanford hospital has 
already carved $65 million from its annual budget of about $300 million and 
hopes to trim another $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurers say: 'Here it is folks, here's what we're willing to pay.' If they 
don't like it, they will go elsewhere. I have not seen one shred of evidence 
(that) the medical market puts any premium on academic centers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His gloomy forecast is that some medical schools will close unless health care 
reform legislation offers them special financial relief. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of great pressure on hospitals to become more efficient, teaching 
hospitals are inherently inefficient. In a teaching hospital, a medical student 
or a resident might see one patient every half an hour, while a doctor in 
private practice might take 15 minutes, said T. Michael Bolger, president and 
chief executive of the Medical College of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't be as efficient and quick because you're training people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of Florida medical complex at Gainesville, 75% of the 
patients traditionally come from outside the county. But the institution is 
steadily losing profitable private patients to competing health networks in 
such locations as Tampa and Orlando, said Dr. David Challenor, vice president 
for health affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 New York has a heavy concentration of urban medical centers: what Dr. John 
Rowe, president of both Mt. Sinai Hospital and Mt. Sinai Medical School, called 
"medical schools and hospitals joined at the hip and heart." Mt. Sinai hospital 
received nearly $140 million from Medicare in 1992, the latest year for which 
full data is available, according to The Times' study. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest sum of Medicare funds, $146 million, went to another New York 
hospital, the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, a 1,276-bed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Montefiore's president, Dr. Spencer Foreman, said the hospital stands to lose 
$55 million under Clinton's proposed reforms, a deeply damaging blow to the 
annual budget of about $660 million. "We have 750 interns and residents, and 
these cuts would put us in serious financial jeopardy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Presbyterian Hospital in New York now loses $25 million a year. The Clinton 
plan would take $38 million a year from its Medicare revenue, which totaled 
$141.7 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would probably have to give up being a teaching hospital and let the city 
take us over," said Dr. William T. Speck, president and chief executive of the 
hospital, part of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital administrators say they feel as though they are under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these things happening to us at once add up to major losses in revenue," 
said Dr. John D. Clough, chairman of the division of health affairs at the 
Cleveland Clinic, which received $134.5 million from Medicare, according to The 
Times' study. "The ability to squeeze more out of the system without impacting 
services is very limited." 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of health care reform from Washington has to be supported with 
dollars, said Sister Ruth Marie Nickerson, president and chief executive of the 
St. Agnes Medical Center in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can be against the objective of health reform, but I'm concerned by 
the constant reduction of various funding sources," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is telling the hospital administrators not to 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have lots of friends," Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala 
told a meeting here this week of the Assn. of Academic Health Centers. "We all 
understand it costs more to train students." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clinton health care reform plan becomes law, everyone will have health 
insurance, wiping out the problem of poor people who cannot pay for their 
treatment, Administration officials say. More than that, they add, that extra 
money will be available for hospitals that train and teach. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials say they will believe it when they see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "To assume universal coverage would take care of these costs is a leap of 
faith," Korn said. "To talk about coverage is one thing. To talk about actual 
dollars is another thing."

LEACH URGES KEEPING FOCUS IN WHITEWATER; CRITIC: ANGRY REACTION TO NAMING OF 
INVESTIGATOR DISMISSED AS 'PRETTY NATURAL.' REPORTS ON INVESTMENTS IN CATTLE 
FUTURES BRING DENIALS.

<P>
 The leading Republican critic of President Clinton's involvement in the 
Whitewater controversy Sunday said the angry White House reaction to the 
appointment of a partisan Republican to investigate civil cases for the 
Resolution Trust Corp. was "pretty natural" and too much should not be made of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House, meanwhile, spent much of the day denying allegations from 
Whitewater-related news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials flatly denied a report that Hillary Rodham Clinton put none of the 
Clinton's own money into a cattle-futures investment that earned the family 
about $100,000 in 1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, a White House spokesman approached reporters aboard Air 
Force One to deny broadcast reports that White House support for senior adviser 
George Stephanopoulos was weakening. 
</P>
<P>
 On the "Meet the Press" program, Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) said it would be 
"premature to draw any extraordinary conclusions" about a phone call 
Stephanopoulos made in February to Joshua Steiner, chief of staff at the 
Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have described Stephanopoulos as angrily asking Steiner how the RTC 
came to name former federal prosecutor Jay B. Stephens to investigate possible 
civil cases against Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and whether that hiring 
could be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens, a former Republican U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, was 
sharply critical of Clinton when the President fired him as part of the removal 
of all the U.S. attorneys appointed by the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the cases the RTC is examining for a possible civil action is the Rose 
Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty before Arkansas regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton, then a partner at the firm and a partner in the 
Whitewater Land Development Corp. with her then-governor husband and James B. 
McDougal, who owned Madison Guaranty, asserted to the state regulators that the 
thrift was on the road to financial health. It later collapsed, requiring a 
taxpayer bailout of at least $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach has maintained that Whitewater Development and Madison Guaranty were so 
intertwined that the Clintons ended up with financial benefits from the S&L 
even as it was collapsing and their Whitewater project was failing. 
</P>
<P>
 The President maintains that he lost about $46,000 on the Whitewater endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," Leach adhered to his 
previous assessment that the Whitewater case is not about impeachment and 
should not be about criminal charges against the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 The futures investment came up in Newsweek story that quoted professor Marvin 
A. Chirelstein of Columbia University Law School as saying that Mrs. Clinton 
invested no money of her own. Chirelstein issued a statement calling the 
article "false and irresponsible."

CLINTONS ARRIVE IN SAN DIEGO FOR OCEANFRONT BREAK; PRESIDENCY: FIRST FAMILY TO 
STAY AT HOME OF CORONADO DEVELOPER. TWO EVENTS TIED TO HIS DOMESTIC AGENDA MAY 
BE HELD.

<P>
 President Clinton arrived in San Diego on Sunday evening for a weeklong spring 
vacation that is likely to include two public events to promote his domestic 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, staying with his family at the oceanfront home of developer H. Larry 
Lawrence, is expected to hold one event to promote his health care reform plan 
and a second to sign the Administration-backed Goals 2000 education bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence, a major Democratic contributor and owner of the Hotel Del Coronado, 
was confirmed as ambassador to Switzerland in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the events are not settled, aides said, but the signing of the bill 
may happen Thursday. Both events are likely to take place in the San Diego 
area, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, 
flew to California from Dallas, where they had attended the wedding of his 
brother, Roger Clinton, Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, the Clintons also visited a Dallas pediatric hospital in 
an effort to push the Administration's health care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Up early Sunday, Clinton jogged three miles through a lush, affluent 
neighborhood and then joined his family for Palm Sunday services at First 
Baptist Church in suburban Richardson, Tex. The pastor, Rev. Brian Harbour, 
used to be pastor of Clinton's church in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 The family then attended the NCAA Midwest regional final basketball game 
between the University of Arkansas and the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, a fan of basketball and the Arkansas Razorbacks, roared and raised a 
clenched fist when the team played well, and grimaced, shouted and slapped a 
knee when play went against Arkansas. He was so upset at one point that 
Chelsea, 14, squeezed his arm for him to settle down. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas wound up winning, 76 to 68, and moving on to the Final Four national 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton rushed onto the floor at the buzzer to give Arkansas coach Nolan 
Richardson a high-five. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not visit the locker rooms, however, choosing to get in the air as soon 
as possible to continue his vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The spring break is Clinton's third extended vacation as President. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent 11 days on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts last August and split a 
week between Arkansas and Hilton Head, S.C., over the New Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 The President last visited San Diego in May last year.

 Betty Spates, a former Memphis restaurant worker, has implicated a man other 
than James Earl Ray in the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.The 
affidavit filed in Nashville, Tenn., by Ray's attorneys implicates Loyd Jowers, 
who has already told a national television audience that Ray wasn't the 
assassin. Spates formerly worked at Jowers' Memphis restaurant, Jim's Grill. 
"Based on everything I know, James Earl Ray was not the person who shot Dr. 
King," Spates said in the affidavit. "Other persons have tried to get me to 
change my story, saying that if I did so I would benefit financially. I have 
refused to do so, and will continue to refuse."

TOP BOSTON OFFICIALS CALL FOR HEALING AFTER BUNGLED DRUG RAID

 The mayor and police commissioner attended Sunday services at a Baptist church 
to deliver a message of peace and healing after a bungled police drug raid led 
to the death of a retired minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "A mistake was made, and we're going to heal those mistakes," Mayor Thomas 
Menino said after the service at the Dorchester Temple Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Accelynne Williams, 75, a retired Methodist minister, died of a heart

Police chased Williams into his bedroom and handcuffed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were looking for a large cache of cocaine, marijuana and guns described 
by an informant. The informant gave the wrong apartment number, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to bring peace to the community . . . yet the drug problem 
continues," Police Commissioner Paul Evans said after the service. "We have to 
continue. We have to search within ourselves to go on and still fight the 
fight."

 A 1993 congressional study warned against concentrating aircraft squadrons at 
the Air Force base where two planes collided in flight and killed 23 soldiers 
on the ground.The study by the General Accounting Office cautioned against 
basing many squadrons of different planes at Pope Air Force Base in 
Fayetteville, N.C., and Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. Since the end of 
the Cold War, Pope has been quietly transformed into one of the nation's two 
special strike force wings. The other is at Mountain Home.

SCHULLER STEPS ASIDE AS ADMINISTRATOR, PLANS YOUTH DRIVE

 The Rev. Robert Schuller, whose services from the Crystal Cathedral are 
watched by millions worldwide, used the 39th anniversary celebration of the 
founding of his ministry Sunday to announce a change in leadership and to 
launch a new project. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his frequent public appearances outside California, Schuller told 
his congregation, he has restructured the ministry, naming Charles Todd, the 
church's chief counsel and an ordained minister, as chief operating officer. 
Schuller had occupied the position. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he also plans to build the state's largest Sunday school. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will help me," Schuller told more than 3,000 worshipers as he stood 
beside his own 20-foot-tall image on a TV screen. "We're going after the next 
generation. And their kids. . . . We've got to get the kids whose parents don't 
want religion." 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller -- one of the world's most popular televangelists, whose "Hour of 
Power" is broadcast to 20 million people worldwide -- declined to provide 
details of the school plan, or of a real estate or business deal that he hinted 
at. Schuller cited "powerful, secret and sensitive negotiations" that may not 
be concluded for two to three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrative change had been known within the church, but the school 
plan came as a surprise even to Crystal Cathedral staffers, who said they know 
none of the specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 Church spokesman Mike Nason said Schuller has been considering the school 
effort for some time and will present it formally soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believes that getting to the youth is the answer to many of our society's 
problems," Nason said. "I can't tell you anything more about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nason added that the sensitive negotiations Schuller referred to are not 
related to his school plan. "I know about that, but I can't reveal anything," 
he said. 
</P>

WINDMILLER PITCHES ANOTHER NO-HITTER; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: SHE GIVES UP ONLY TWO 
WALKS TO FULLERTON IN 1-0 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Asked to describe the recent outings of Cal State Northridge pitcher Amy 
Windmiller, teammate Tamara Ivie said it all in one word. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phenomenal," said Ivie, smiling broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been kind of a March Madness for Windmiller, whose no-hitter against Cal 
State Fullerton on Sunday propelled the Matadors' 1-0 victory in a losers' 
bracket game of the Cal State Fullerton tournament. Southwest Louisiana 
defeated Washington, 2-1, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Windmiller has been extraordinary. The senior right-hander has 
thrown five no-hitters, including two perfect games, and has given up only five 
hits in eight games (52 innings) in March. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't ask her about her success. She is genuinely uncomfortable talking 
about it. "I know I say this all the time," Windmiller said, "but I don't care 
(about the no-hitters). I want to win. That's all that matters to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller (12-1), who had five strikeouts against Fullerton, faced two 
batters over the minimum, allowing walks in the second and sixth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she felt like her "pitches weren't working well" against the Titans, 
Fullerton failed to take advantage. Windmiller relied heavily on her rise ball 
and enticed nine infield popups. Fullerton (12-18) hit only three ground balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the sixth-ranked Matadors (23-4) continued to struggle offensively, 
providing Windmiller with just enough offense. Ivie, who remains the Matadors' 
most consistent leader, provided two of Northridge's five hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Pearson scored from second on Ivie's two-out single in the first inning. 
Kelly Hunt and Ivie each hit one-out doubles in the second and sixth, 
respectively, but both were left stranded at third. 
</P>
<P>
 The punchless Matadors will have little time to work out their offensive 
problems. Northridge returns to Western Athletic Conference play this weekend 
and will make their toughest trip of the season, playing at Sacramento State 
and Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something is missing. I don't know what it is," said Ivie of the Matadors' 
recent lackluster performances. "Hopefully we'll find it this week."

 Cal State Northridge pitcher Rick Orr demonstrated his closer's mentality by 
throwing his first two warm-up pitches over the catcher's head and into the 
backstop when he entered the eighth inning of Sunday's game against Fresno 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't worried," Orr said. "I knew I'd been throwing well in the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with runners at second and third and one out and the host Matadors 
clinging to a one-run lead, Orr got the last five outs, allowing Northridge to 
score a 9-8 Western Athletic Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr's save was the first for the Matadors this season and came in dramatic 
fashion. Northridge was leading, 9-7, entering the eighth, but two errors gave 
the Bulldog a chance to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 After starter Aaron D'Aoust (5-1) got the first out, third baseman Tyler 
Nelson dropped a towering popup from Josh Kaitfors, who scored after singles by 
Kevin Gunther and Matt Curtis. Center fielder Joey Arnold mishandled Curtis' 
single, enabling both runners to advance. On Orr's second pitch, pinch-hitter 
Kyle Fielstad hit a line drive directly at first baseman Jason Shanahan. Orr 
retired the next batter on a ground ball to get out of the jam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think D'Aoust would have been OK if we catch the popup," Northridge Coach 
Bill Kernen said. "That changed everything. We tried to hold together, then we 
got lucky with the line drive. The same thing happened to us earlier in the 
game so it evened out." 
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth, after walking James Borges with one out, Orr got Javier Renteria 
on a ground ball to Nelson, who started a game-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
 After two scoreless innings, Fresno State (15-15, 3-3 in conference play) took 
a 3-0 lead in the third inning on Curtis' double and run-scoring singles by 
Ryan Wood and Borges. The Matadors (17-14, 6-3) came back with four runs in the 
bottom of the third when they sent nine men to the plate and chased starter 
Brendan Behn. Fresno State replied with four runs in the fourth, which included 
a two-run homer by second baseman Jim Fisher to take a 7-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Matadors scored five runs on five hits in the fifth, including four 
runs off reliever Chad Cattaneo (1-3). "We held together and didn't fold," 
Kernen said. "We really held together well offensively and came back twice; not 
many teams can do that. It showed the character we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the 13-hit attack was left fielder Brian Vasey, a utility player 
batting ninth. He had three hits and drove in three. "It was the first time in 
a while that I've played three games in a row," Vasey said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Howard also had three hits for the Matadors.

DRIVING; THE 'GREEN' WAY TO DRIVE A CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The automobile can be one of the greatest threats to clean air -- but a few 
environmentally conscious habits can help motorists cut pollution and save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving your car the "green" way will save gasoline and prolong your car's 
life, write Richard Mastrangelo and E. David Kuo in Good Housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what you can do: 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep your car tuned. This will keep it operating as efficiently as possible, 
reduce fuel and oil consumption, and decrease emissions. Follow the 
manufacturer's service schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't warm up your car for more than 30 seconds. Warming up not only 
produces emissions but wastes fuel. Drivers once were advised to warm up a 
car's engine to prevent stalling. But modern fuel systems allow cars to be 
driven without waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid jack-rabbit starts or abrupt braking. Anticipate what is going to 
happen while on the road. Your car will pollute less at a steady speed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce idling time. If you drop off or pick up someone, turn off the engine 
while you wait. Never leave your car with the keys in the ignition and the 
engine idling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exercise your car. If you are a city driver, stop-and-go trips will increase 
harmful deposits in the fuel and oil systems. To reduce this, drive the car for 
about half an hour at steady highway speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Back into a parking spot. Driving forward out of a spot reduces inefficient 
maneuvering of a cold car and cuts down on start-up emissions.

A CHANGE OF PLANS; NONSTOP PARTYING IN EXOTIC LOCALES? NOT THIS SPRING BREAK. 
AS MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS TAKE STOCK OF THEIR LIVES -- AND WALLETS -- SERIOUS 
PURSUITS TAKE PRIORITY. SOME OPT FOR VOLUNTEER WORK OR -- GASP! -- STUDYING. 
</P>

<P>
 Ft. Lauderdale. Daytona Beach. Palm Springs. Lake Havasu. All are time-tested 
spring break datelines. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Bluff, Utah? Or East Palo Alto? 
</P>
<P>
 As the weather heats up and classrooms empty out this week and next, TV 
newscasts will glow with images of sand and surf. But many Los Angeles students 
say their spring breaks won't be anything like the party on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than head-banging, some choose to do volunteer work locally or abroad. 
Others head home to the folks' house to dodge the costs of living for a week. 
And still more work traditional jobs, flipping burgers or pulling heavy hours 
at an on-campus site to finance the coming semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinesh DeSilva, a 22-year-old USC senior, spent last year's break painting 
houses and doing light construction work on a Navajo Indian reservation in 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Partying) can be done anytime," he said. "But an opportunity like (that) 
doesn't come very often." 
</P>
<P>
 Alternative spring break programs -- low-cost trips sponsored by colleges and 
universities that offer an educational or public service component to the 
vacation -- are catching on. "It's a growing national thing," said Martin 
Gonzalez, a graduate assistant at USC's Student Volunteer Center. "A lot of 
universities are doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 USC has been offering programs for three years. Stanford has been doing it for 
nearly a decade. UCLA also offers a program, and Loyola Marymount has in years 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanford, the goal of the spring break alternative is articulated clearly 
in the promotional flyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the walls of a private, privileged institution, one is sheltered from 
poverty and other problems that a large portion of the world's population 
experiences," it says. "Thus, Alternative Spring Break Projects are designed to 
help students go beyond their Stanford campus to explore and learn about issues 
concerning the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's program sends students to Native American reservations in Arizona 
and New Mexico, as well as Oakland, East Palo Alto and San Francisco's 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 At USC, students can opt for the reservation in Utah or choose to learn about 
environmental issues while cleaning fire damage in Altadena. A third program 
focuses on the roots of homelessness and the crisis in public education locally 
by taking students to an elementary school in the Pico-Union district, a 
homeless shelter in Pasadena and a women's shelter in South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 All USC trips cost about $100, Gonzalez said. Students eat their meals and 
spend their nights in the shelters or on the reservation and, when they aren't 
working, are treated to lectures by experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great interactive experience," Gonzalez said. "Last year, we got 
people who had done no volunteer work and found it intriguing. We get people 
who just want to do something, and we get people who are looking for an 
adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 Susana Bugadin, 20, is enrolled in USC's Homelessness and Education program 
that will take place here in Los Angeles. A sociology major, Bugadin said the 
project is a way to keep productive over the break. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volunteerism, for me, is a distraction from school work," she said. "I enjoy 
it tremendously. Most important is the sense of satisfaction I get from doing 
something for the community. I like to give. I'm not rich, so what I give is 
time and dedication." 
</P>
<P>
 DeSilva said last year's trip was entirely different from anything he had done 
before. He liked it so much that he is going to volunteer again this year, this 
time locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of the normal 'go to Cabo' spring break, I was able to go to a 
community I'm completely unfamiliar with and help others," said DeSilva, whose 
major is international finance. "It's nice to help people who really need it 
and to make a difference, even if it's a small one. It's nice to get out of 
L.A. and submerge yourself in a culture you know very little about." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not they are volunteering, many students have chosen this year to 
pass on the traditional party destinations. Although Mexico, Hawaii and other 
holiday locales continue to draw, travel agents say exotic destinations are 
becoming less popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Students) don't have the disposable income to spend on a week drinking in 
Mexico," said Lucie Lena, manager of the travel service at UCLA. "Times are 
changing." 
</P>
<P>
 She said concrete figures were not available but added that the number of 
students traveling this year is probably lower than last year, despite a recent 
surge in last-minute travel plans. Other local schools report the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are less people traveling," Lena said. "A lot just don't have the money 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Harris, a Loyola Marymount University freshman, said: "I have to work. 
It's a drag, but then I'd probably just sit around here anyway. Most of my 
friends aren't doing anything for the same reasons -- work and finances." 
</P>
<P>
 Although expensive trips may be out, local destinations are still in vogue. 
San Diego, where MTV taped its popular Spring Break special this year, will 
swell by 200,000 this week and next if the weather is hot, said Sgt. Terry 
Degelder of the San Diego Police Department. Lake Havasu and Palm Springs are 
other popular destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 But many students who may once have been part of the action say they are tired 
of the crowds and of the booze. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK when you are 18, but it gets old," said Phoebe Gifford, 22, a senior 
at UCLA. "I don't know if it's declining (in popularity), but you get sick of 
being drunk and not knowing what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Ford, a 24-year-old student at Santa Monica City College, said: "The party 
scene is over. It's time to grow up. There are lots of risks out there. The big 
one is AIDS, but the old ones are still around." 
</P>
<P>
 Camping -- usually in areas such as Joshua Tree, the Angeles National Forest 
or even Yosemite -- is another substitute for nonstop partying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't afford to go to Cancun or Mazatlan, so for me it's my tent," said 
Clarice Chavira, a junior at Loyola who plans to camp in Del Mar for five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Jackson, a 22-year-old senior at UCLA, said: "Camping is fun and 
inexpensive. It's a good way to get together with friends when you have the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some travel, others see spring break merely as a chance to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Charles, a 20-year-old biology major at Loyola, is a good example. Hoping 
to get into medical school, Charles will spend his break studying for the 
entrance exams he will take in coming weeks. To further cut costs and maximize 
his time, he plans to live with his parents in Las Vegas -- a popular move for 
many students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of those nerd students who studies over spring break," Charles said. 
"Every year I say I'm going to do something, but I don't have much money, and 
I'm trying to be more disciplined. I can go home and live for free and get free 
food."  
</P>
<P>
 Charles said many of his friends are doing the same: "A lot of my friends are 
working 24 (hours a day)-7 (days a week). The economy has a lot to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Monastero, a 28-year-old history major at Loyola, said: "I look at spring 
break as a chance to get my papers done. But I enjoy my major, and I like to 
read, so I try and look at it as a positive. I plan to go to grad school, so 
it's all part of the goal." 
</P>
<P>
 For Derrick Gwynn, however, spring break is an opportunity to make money that 
can't be passed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't mind going somewhere, but it's just another week for me," said 
Gwynn, 19, of Santa Monica City College. "I might as well get some money while 
I can, because I'm still going to have school when I get back."

COMEDY REVIEW; BOBCAT MAY HAVE LOST HIS HAIR BUT NOT HIS CLAWS

 SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO -- When Bobcat Goldthwait searches for new material, he 
sometimes needs to look no further than the latest surreal episode in his own 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, he was in a grocery store in Sioux City, Iowa, when a clerk accused 
him of shoplifting a pack of Rolaids. Words were exchanged, the police were 
called in, and Goldthwait was released after a search proved that he wasn't 
harboring any antacids after all. 
</P>
<P>
 So what did he find when he took the stage Friday night at the Coach House? A 
roll of Rolaids, of course, thoughtfully provided by a fan. "I'm the Rolaids 
bandit," Goldthwait told the crowd. "I'm on a jag from the law." 
</P>
<P>
 He launched his set with a hilarious re-creation of the Rolaids incident, even 
reading a news account from the Sioux City Journal. "When the clerk said she 
wanted to search my pockets," he said, "I told her I would rather have dinner 
and drinks first." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait flirted with a mainstream breakthrough by playing a deranged cop in 
some of the "Police Academy" movies, but he sees those a source of 
self-deprecation now. Since then, he has continued a successful stand-up 
career; success in movie and television has been spottier. The highlight came a 
couple of years ago with "Shakes the Clown," a brave but little-seen movie that 
so upset some of our men and women in greasepaint that Goldthwait found himself 
on national TV, debating a clown in full makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait's manic delivery -- his voice strangled, each sentence punctuated 
by a rasping intake of breath -- is a trademark that sometimes threatens to 
veer into self-parody. But, hey, as he told the crowd Friday, it's really the 
way he talks, and in any case, it somehow fits his material, a fragmented but 
often searingly funny view of pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to think of anyone who attacks celebrity figures with more reckless 
glee. He told of stunning a crowd to silence with a joke about Michael Jordan 
when Goldthwait opened for Nirvana in Chicago. "Oh, some punk rockers, getting 
upset when you make fun of a sports figure," he said. "Anarchy with a charge 
card." 
</P>
<P>
 His targets Friday ranged all over the map, from Sylvester Stallone to Axl 
Rose, from Michael Jackson to Bono. Even "Schindler's List" provided some 
grist: Goldthwait ridiculed the notion that director Steven Spielberg somehow 
had taken a big career risk by making the film ("bold statement -- Nazis are 
bad"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve's very interested in my crack-addicted nun story, the sequel to 'Shakes 
the Clown,' " Goldthwait added in a dig at his own commercial viability. ("I 
loved 'Shakes,' " someone in the audience yelled. "Thank you, sir," Goldthwait 
responded. "I haven't forgotten that $7.") 
</P>
<P>
 While on the subject of the Oscars, he even took a dig at little Anna Paquin, 
who won the best supporting actress award for her role in "The Piano." "How 
long you figure before she's knocking over convenience stores?" he asked. 
"Perhaps she can be the bag man on my next crime." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Goldthwait gave equal time to poking fun at himself and his own 
persona, expressing consternation at several points that his manhood might have 
been mistaken for a roll of antacid tablets. 
</P>
<P>
 There also was plenty of commentary on his new look, a virtually clean-shaven 
head. "Yeah, it's me. I got a haircut. Deal with it." He later added that it 
had been getting harder and harder to look cool with long hair and a receding 
hairline. "Every year, it looked more and more like I was in Fleetwood Mac." 
Now, he confessed, he looks like a cross between Rutger Hauer and Curly Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 He expressed concern for his two children, growing up with him for a father 
("That's your dad? I hate that guy"), and disappointment at their academic 
performance ("Every year, their grades keep going up. I had to tell them, 'When 
I was your age, I was in a band.' ") 
</P>
<P>
 And he told what he swore is a true story, about attending a Parents-Teachers 
Assn. meeting at his children's private school and being asked if he had any 
ideas for a fund-raiser. His reply didn't go over too well: 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't we sell crack?" 
</P>
<P>
 To which he added, after a pause for effect: "Not to our kids, to the public 
school kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait's sets don't have anything approaching formal structure, even on a 
good night, and he was even more scattered than usual on Friday -- which made 
for some uncomfortably dead spots, which the audience rushed to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone expecting a typical joke-joke-joke comedy set from Goldthwait is in 
the wrong crowd. What's he's selling is edgy attitude, a yelping protest 
against corporate-packaged and self-important celebrity, and at that, he 
succeeded as usual.

 KCET Pledge Drive Falls Short: KCET-TV Channel 28 racked up $1.45 million in 
pledges during the 23-day on-air fund-raising campaign that ended last week. 
This year's intake continued a decline that saw the public-TV station's March 
pledge drive fall from $1.9 million in 1992 to $1.6 million in 1993. About 
3,800 fewer pledges were made this year than last. KCET officials attributed 
the decrease to Southern California's continuing economic problems but added 
that KCET is making up the shortfall in other areas and remains on budget for 
the fiscal year.

 Play Ball: Acclaimed "Civil War" producer Ken Burns' long-awaited "Baseball" 
documentary series will play at least two hours each over nine nights -- each 
episode is dubbed an "inning" -- on PBS on Sept. 18-22 and Sept. 25-28. Burns 
says the story of baseball is the story of America, and among the subjects the 
nine innings will cover are the clash of labor and management, the search for 
heroes, the rise of popular culture and the quest for racial justice. The exact 
length of each inning will be known only after the series' final editing is 
completed this summer.

 New on Fox: While the three other major broadcast networks are evaluating what 
new series will be on their fall lineups, Fox is already announcing one of its 
series orders. "Mantis" is a one-hour action-adventure show about an African 
American hero with a disability who devises technology to battle evil-doers. 
Carl Lumbly, who was a regular on CBS' 1982-88 police series "Cagney & Lacey," 
stars. And Fox has disclosed plans for another summer series, an hourlong 
suspense anthology produced by Joel Schumacher, Aaron Spelling and E. Duke 
Vincent.

 Hey, Sports Fans: Good news for cable TV: ESPN topped the field with 22 
nominations for the Sports Emmy Awards. It was the first time the all-sports 
cable network has had the most nominations. NBC was second with 19, ABC and NBC 
each had 14, followed by HBO with 12. Perennial winner John Madden, who 
recently moved to Fox from CBS, was again nominated in the analyst category, 
where he will face three other former coaches -- Hubie Brown, Mike Ditka and 
Billy Packer -- and former baseball catcher Tim McCarver. Winners in all 
categories will be announced April 16 in New York City. MOVIES

 So You Wanna Be in Pictures: About 4,000 residents of South-Central Los 
Angeles gave their resumes to entertainment industry representatives Saturday 
at the daylong Job Fair Expo '94 held in the parking lot of the First AME 
Church. "This event will provide our community access to employment 
opportunities within the entertainment industry," said Rev. Cecil L. Murray, 
the church's senior minister. He said the fair was one step toward solving 
problems in the community, which is plagued by drug- and gang-related violence. 
The American Film Institute, MCA/Universal, MGM, Paramount, TicketMaster, Walt 
Disney Studios and Warner Bros. talked to prospective employees who were vying 
for 800 jobs ranging from $100,000-a-year professional positions to $7-an-hour 
clerical spots. MUSIC

attorney, Howard Price, demanded the theft charge be filed as a felony. 
Horovitz, 27, will be arraigned April 20. QUICK TAKES

POP MUSIC REVIEW; YET ANOTHER ROUSING SET FROM SANTANA

 Many years ago, a reviewer summed up a Carlos Santana show by noting: "He 
played some stuff before 'Oye Como Va' and some stuff after it." 
</P>
<P>
 Crassly stated, but still true.The celebrated guitarist, who played a concert 
celebrating the 25th anniversary of KLOS-FM at the packed Forum on Friday -- 
really has nothing in his repertoire that can top that jaunty, melodious, 
relentlessly infectious Latin-rock tune. It isn't a put-down of his other 
"stuff" to say that it all pales next to this show-stopper extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the other pieces Friday really were rousing. Santana's band, driven by 
a three-man percussion section, is still one of the powerhouses in the 
classic-rock field. No other band has ever fused Latin rhythms with blues, rock 
and jazz with such imagination and energy. Though two vocalists sang on some 
pieces -- mostly the pop-oriented, spiritual tunes -- it was primarily a 
vibrant instrumental show. 
</P>
<P>
 Santana, who has been experimenting with assorted Latin, jazz and rock fusions 
since 1966, has settled into a comfortable groove. In his younger days, he was 
a flashy showoff whose guitar playing annoyingly dominated most of his work. 
Now he lays back a lot more, doing casual riffing and leaving much of the meaty 
work to his sidemen. There's less fury and excess in his music, which has taken 
on a more pleasant, party-time feel over the years. DENNIS HUNT

POP MUSIC REVIEW; IGUANAS PERFORM ROOTS-ROCK MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Iguanas stand most roots-rock conventions on their heads. Rather than fast 
'n' flashy guitar heroics and faithful re-creations of traditional styles, the 
New Orleans quintet stresses understatement and a mixed bag of Caribbean 
rhythms.The assortment of slow, sinuous grooves in its two hourlong sets at the 
Alligator Lounge on Friday were designed for the long-distance dancer, and they 
clearly struck a chord with the packed house at the first of two nights there. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it roots rhythm -- the music may be grounded in New Orleans R&B but it's 
unpredictably seasoned with some cumbia here, some norten o there, and a few 
songs sung in Spanish. And everything is mixed together -- when the Iguanas 
ventured into a recognizable New Orleans parade beat, guitarist Rod Hodges had 
switched to accordion and Joe Cabral was playing bajo sexto.  
</P>
<P>
 The group's basic sound revolved around the twin saxes of Cabral and Derek 
Huston -- think of the tandem sax sound on Frankie Ford's "Sea Cruise" -- with 
Cabral taking the wilder, more venturesome solos. Hodges' guitar played a 
secondary role, but that made the showcases for his fluid solos doubly 
effective. DON SNOWDEN

MUSIC REVIEW; ST.CLAIR COMES UP WITH ODD MIX OF MOZART, TICHELI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mozart's sublime Mass in C minor was prefaced by two raucous contemporary 
works Friday on the Pacific Symphony program led by Carl St.Clair at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bizarre programming can be explained, if not robustly defended. 
</P>
<P>
 St.Clair and the orchestra have been recording two works by 
composer-in-residence Frank Ticheli. To keep the players focused on that task, 
the first part of the program was given over to the Ticheli pieces -- "Radiant 
Voices," commissioned by the orchestra and played for the first time last year, 
and "Postcard" -- both of which the orchestra played with facile familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
 But only a very few composers can be juxtaposed with Mozart with any impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 120-member Pacific Chorale outnumbering a reduced orchestra by more 
than two to one, this performance of the Mass became very much a choral one. 
The downside was that the singers, especially with the unstylishly lusty 
entrances of the men's voices early on, often reduced apprehensibility of the 
orchestra to pounding timpani and wheedling strings. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that the strings couldn't manage precise articulation even of the 
exposed falling eighth-note motif that opens the "Kyrie" (at a relatively 
moderate tempo, to boot), the loss wasn't exactly profound. But it did rule out 
expectations that the instrumental scoring would have anything to contribute 
toward reinforcing or commenting on the vocal lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The chorale did manage to be clear in communicating the text. But often, it 
also sounded compacted and sluggish, with contrapuntal lines dovetailing into a 
mass rather than maintaining independence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 St.Clair and the orchestra's most effective moments occurred in the delicate 
tone-painting that opened and closed "Et incarnatus est," sung by Virginia 
Sublett. 
</P>
<P>
 Having replaced the originally announced Young-Ok Shin on about a week's 
notice, Sublett sang with a slender, coolish soprano that blossomed in the 
heights, if not throughout the range. But she had all the notes, and was 
reasonably secure in the coloratura. 
</P>
<P>
 Mezzo-soprano Vivica Genaux, who had to sing up to an A in the "Laudamus Te," 
negotiated the top notes with bright, sometimes strident energy but her 
descending arpeggios sounded grievously coarse in the mid- to lower range. 
Neither of the women offered much in the way of a trill. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Mack provided a light lyric tenor and, in his brief duties, Michael 
Gallup contributed a strong bass line. Hanley Daws, associate concertmaster of 
the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, was guest concertmaster.

JAZZ; STRUNZ & FARAH: TIME TO PUMP UP THE FORMULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is success beginning to spoil Strunz & Farah? Maybe not quite yet, but the 
guitarists' performance at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts on 
Friday suggested that the perils of formula-style playing may be starting to 
affect their music. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that these guys can't play.There were times during the 
evening when they ripped off passages, individually and collectively, that 
seemed to require eight or nine fingers on each hand. At their best, when the 
Afro-Caribbean rhythms, flamenco chording and Middle Eastern melodies that are 
at the heart of their music were really cooking, the duo's performance more 
than justified the accolades and awards they've been receiving in the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, however, their tendency to play most tunes at a similar tempo, 
to articulate their themes in comparably harmonized, duo-guitar melody 
statements, and to employ the same rapid-fire, triplet-based runs in their 
solos underscored their need to steer clear of the siren call of commercial 
repetitiousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Bela Fleck & the Flecktones, who opened the evening, did 
precisely that. Playing a program of works that reached from "The Royal Garden 
Blues" to "The Arkansas Traveler," Fleck demonstrated once again the range and 
power of the banjo as an expressive musical instrument. The Flecktones remain 
one of fusion music's most talented ensembles. DON HECKMAN

JAZZ; MASEKELA, MAKEBA IN A CELEBRATORY MOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The joint appearance of Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba on Friday at the 
Wadsworth Theater was a celebratory affair, and why not? With elections due in 
South Africa next month, the country's two best-known musicians and longtime 
anti-apartheid voices -- both spent some 30 years in exile before returning in 
1990 -- turned the nearly three-hour concert into a triumphant display of their 
homeland's spirit and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two also used the occasion to note that the struggle is not over."We 
need your investments, your skills, your money," Makeba told the audience, 
after noting that at age 62 she would vote in the land of her birth for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were in fine form, with Masekela's fluegelhorn work especially sharp and 
revealing. Surprisingly, Masekela's voice played an equal role in his 
presentation, adding percussive coloring and scat-like declarations, sometimes 
in sweet harmony with a trio of backing voices. 
</P>
<P>
 Makeba's voice remains a fine instrument, capable of warmth and intimacy, 
strength and anger. Singing in Xhosa, Zulu and, less frequently, English, she 
developed a lively rhythmic presence filled with depth and dignity. Her least 
successful efforts came when she strayed from her roots, as on the murky pop 
ballad "I Still Long for You." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Masekela's weakest moment came during his signature tune, "Grazin' 
in the Grass," which seemed almost tired in its delivery. But he followed with 
his most moving effort, the moody "Stimela," a tune that evokes images of the 
trains carrying conscripted workers to the mines of South Africa. BILL

FAMILY; PARACHUTE EXPRESS DROPS IN FOR FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its solo debut at Universal Amphitheatre on Saturday, the nationally 
touring, locally based children's music trio Parachute Express proved why it 
belongs among the class acts in the field, along with such luminaries as 
Canadians Fred Penner and Raffi. 
</P>
<P>
 Dynamic harmonies, instrumental integrity, comic interplay and an enormous 
sense of fun galvanized more than 3,000 young children and parents into 
clapping and swaying along and acting out some of the smoothest lyrics in the 
business. And the warmth and enthusiasm of these 40-ish adults never rings 
false. 
</P>
<P>
 Living up to the promise the group showed when it opened for Fred Penner at 
the amphitheatre in 1992 and virtually stole the show, Parachute Express 
offered a mix of the familiar and the new in its Saturday concert. Parachute 
members Stephen Michael Schwartz, Janice Hubbard and Donny Becker led with this 
year's signature song, "Friends Forever," an upbeat affirmation of their 10 
years together. (The group began by recording music for Gymboree, the national 
movement/play program for parents and preschoolers.) 
</P>
<P>
 They then launched into "Happy to Be Here," the title song from last year's 
Walt Disney Records album, a joyous anthem that was greeted with shouts of 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Participatory favorites were "Polka Dots, Checks and Stripes," "When I Build 
My House," "Walkin' in My Neighborhood" and a masterpiece of the absurd, "Ups 
and Downs," that had the audience standing and sitting on cue to comic effect. 
For adults, the big hit was "Butterfly," the trio's memorable three-part vocal 
harmony, with deceptively simple accompaniment on bass, sax and keyboard.  
</P>
<P>
 The big difference in this concert compared to the group's past shows, 
however, is a confident new theatricality, with props, costumes and a central 
theme -- a mysterious gift that must be opened at the "right time." Known for 
their very physical performances, the singers' imaginative choreography, comedy 
bits and miming skills now inform the banter and tie the songs together, 
effectively complementing the sophisticated musicality.

COUNTERPUNCH: TELEVISION DOESN'T NEED ANY MORE WOMEN 'VICTIMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSANNE WELCH and CHRISTINE PETTIT, Rosanne Welch and Christine Pettit are 
free-lance scriptwriters who wrote the Beverly Hills, 90210 episode in 
question. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In today's entertainment world where female characters spend most of their 
time either naked or dead, we find it a pity that Judy Sklar Rasminsky finds 
pregnancy still such a tragic moment in one television character's life. So 
tragic in fact she doesn't believe any young girl in America should consider 
Andrea Zuckerman a role model ever again. 
</P>
<P>
 We disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as participants in creating this devastation, we felt it was necessary to 
say: Judy, get a grip. 
</P>
<P>
 When we were first given our assignment at "90210," we were thrilled by the 
prospect of dealing with such an important issue in this young character's 
life. If Andrea Zuckerman successfully has a child, a husband and a career, she 
should be canonized not vilified. 
</P>
<P>
 We want more television women who don't become victims. We want more 
television women who make their own choices in life. And we want more women who 
take an active role in directing their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 We want to see "Northern Exposure's" Maggie O'Connell, "Picket Fences' " Jill 
Brock and the "X-Files' " agent Scully -- and we want to see "90210's" Andrea 
Zuckerman, all of whom are accomplished in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
 Feminism isn't about pigeonholing women. Just because we don't agree with 
their choices doesn't make those choices invalid. All these characters have 
made choices that we didn't agree with but we love them for their independence. 
</P>
<P>
 What we found truly curious about Rasminsky's supposed feminist diatribe was 
her unwillingness to associate herself with the dreaded "f" word. We've never 
had any problem with that -- but then again we're feminists of the '90s. We're 
not anti-men. We're not anti-family. We're pro-choice in the broadest sense. 
And we realize we're lucky to be living in a time when the possibilities are 
endless. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Rasminsky may think it's unrealistic for Andrea to achieve all 
these things, she's discounting the fact that given the proper support, any 
woman could. The problem is that in real life that support network is still in 
the construction phase. But if women and men work together on this, it can 
become a reality.  
</P>
<P>
 And Rasminsky's cynicism only goes to show she's part of the problem, not part 
of the solution. OK, so maybe we're a little idealistic, but look how far it's 
brought us. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe role models come in all shapes and sizes and until Rasminsky 
accepts that, we suppose we should thank her for not calling herself a 
feminist.

COUNTERPUNCH: THAT '90210' PIECE -- IT'S RUBBISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES ROSIN, Charles Rosin is the executive producer of Beverly Hills, 
90210. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The commentary "On the Dumping of a '90210' Role Model" (Calendar, March 15) 
is so filled with inaccuracies that it is hard to know where to begin -- unless 
it is with the primary question of why the L.A. Times Calendar section would 
publish such a mean-spirited broadside by some free-lance writer in Canada 
without checking the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Sklar Rasminsky claims that we ("the people who make their ratings and 
their money off of teen-agers") have irresponsibly chosen to send a negative 
message to our daughters by our treatment of the real-life pregnancy of one of 
our stars, Gabrielle Carteris, in the plotting of her character, Andrea. 
</P>
<P>
 The commentary states that by having Andrea -- a bright, ambitious premed 
student -- meet a guy, have a baby, get married and "drop out of school," we 
are teaching the younger female members of our audience that "they must still 
seek their identities vicariously, through their men (and that) their place is 
still in the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing could be further from the truth. Andrea has not dropped out of school, 
and we have no plans to turn her into a "cartoon superwoman." Putting aside the 
question of whether we will be able to produce thought-provoking episodes 
dramatizing the struggles and emotional conflicts of a young couple going 
through school while trying to raise a baby, I wish our critics would wait to 
see what our future story lines are before they publish articles condemning 
(and misrepresenting) them. 
</P>
<P>
 It is interesting that Rasminsky doesn't object to Andrea's choice regarding 
abortion, when it is conceivable that this particular, politically active 
character would have opted for an abortion at this stage in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not even an option Rasminsky recommends -- rather than deal with 
the issue, she would rather see the character sent abroad or to Yale, since it 
was so "apparent" to her that with Gabrielle Carteris (the actress) clearly 
showing, "the writers would have to find a way to remove her for a while." What 
Rasminsky doesn't take into account is that by writing the actress out of the 
show for a season, we would be writing the character out too . . . and if 
that's not dumping a role model, I don't know what is. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did we wish to dump our actress. Gabrielle and her wonderful husband, 
Charles Isaacs, have been waiting to start their lives as parents for a while 
now. A valued and respected member of our cast, Gabrielle came to us with a 
request to have a baby and keep working, which we honored. How about that for a 
story to tell your daughters? That they can strive to work hard, become 
professionals and gain the trust and affection of their colleagues and 
employers, who will stand behind them when they dare to want to "have it all."

COUNTERPUNCH: ON ANDREA AND MOTHERHOOD 
</P>

By GABRIELLE CARTERIS, Gabrielle Carteris of 90210 is preparing for two firsts: 
a child, due in May, and the April start-up of 10 one-hour specialsLifestories 
With Gabrielle Carteris. The social activist-actress-mom-to-be hosts and

<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Judy S. Rasminsky's March 15 commentary regarding the character 
of my character, Andrea Zuckerman on "Beverly Hills, 90210," Rasminsky's facts 
are incorrect. Andrea has not dropped out of school.Rather, she has chosen to 
continue her education while realizing the difficult road she has chosen by 
keeping her child. 
</P>
<P>
 Intellect does not define one's sexual desire -- and perfection is an 
impossibility. However, through life's many roads, some better than others, one 
hopefully chooses to be the best they possibly can. 
</P>
<P>
 Life cannot be ignored nor shaped to our fantasy of what we "think" it should 
be. Young women are getting pregnant. Young women are choosing to keep or not 
keep their children. Young women can and do succeed without viewing motherhood 
as a curse or a failure. Gone are the days (for most but obviously not all) 
when a young woman is made an outcast or failure simply because she chooses to 
keep her child. To be a young mother does not mean one has forfeited her 
individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 How unfortunate for Ms. Rasminsky that she cannot acknowledge life's 
challenges and still strive toward her dreams. How unfortunate that she has 
such little faith in a woman's potential.

THEATER REVIEW; HEAVY-HANDED 'DIRT' A SHOWCASE FOR JAMES WHITMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Whitmore, the marvelous star of such one-man shows as "Will Rogers' USA" 
and "Give 'Em Hell, Harry," has carved himself another juicy part in "Dirt," 
which had its West Coast premiere at the Old Globe Theatre last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Whitmore's portrayal of an aging, ailing farmer in this 
three-character piece is the only one worth watching. Look past his passion and 
virtuosity and all you have is an "On Golden Pond" or "Foxfire" wanna-be -- a 
cliche-ridden play with stock characters and hit-you-over-the-head symbolism 
about intergenerational conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmore plays Sonny Hardman (and he's a hard man -- get it?), a tough old 
bird whose memory has begun failing him since his wife died. His estranged son, 
Zac (John Dennis Johnston), comes to check on him. They fight and reconcile. In 
between, Eleanor (Annette Helde), a waitress from the local diner, brings the 
old man a cherry pie and becomes the convenient love interest for the son. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is about the passing of the guard. Sonny needs to pass on his love 
for the land before he can die peacefully. The son's growing adeptness with 
farming shows he's on the way to becoming the father with whom he fights so 
bitterly. The woman wants to become the new woman of the house. The play would 
be as neatly turned out as a bed with hospital corners if the conflicts didn't 
seem so trumped up. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is the father mad at the son? A grab bag of reasons are offered: The 
son served in the Vietnam War (turns out the father was against the war -- a 
rather unusual point of view for a man of his generation and background), Zac 
didn't fight the father for control of the farm, Zac's young and the father's 
old. And why is the son in conflict with the waitress? Ostensibly because she 
thinks Zac's not being nice to his father, but really, it seems, just to make 
their attraction more exciting. In theory anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 What the play does offer is a showcase for Whitmore. And the veteran actor 
radiates a star quality that makes it hard to pay attention to anyone else when 
he's on stage. His bushy eyebrows stand sharply out like a challenge to all 
comers. His stooped, bow-legged walk suggests years of working the land. He 
speaks volumes with a look, a smile, a hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 A lucky thing, because the words could use a lot more work. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Andrew J. Traister has done more subtle work with other plays with 
more fully realized characters such as "Light Sensitive" and "Remembrance" at 
the Old Globe. But if his goal was to give Whitmore a chance to shine, he has 
accomplished that. 
</P>
<P>
 Odd that playwright Bruce Gooch, who grew up on a family farm before he turned 
to acting and play writing, doesn't give us any sense of the troubles family 
farmers have had in recent years. He captures the flavor of day-to-day farming, 
but doesn't make it clear what these people are living on until the crops come 
in -- the father's money? The son's? 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Funicello's set of weathered woods and hard-scrabble weeds pushing 
through the dirt works seamlessly with Robert Peterson's lush lighting and Jeff 
Ladman's sound. The worn, faded costumes by Deborah M. Dryden are similarly 
evocative. Valerie Mackend's composition enhances a romantic mood. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Gooch captures the romance between an old man and his land, it's not 
enough. Perhaps because Whitmore was involved in this project even before it 
premiered at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Mass., last 
season, the show was skewed around his character. But Gooch needs to create 
other compelling parts if he wants anything to bloom in this "Dirt."

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'HALF JAPANESE' LOOKS AT A FRINGE BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Feuerzeig's "Half Japanese: The Band That Would Be King" screens tonight 
through Wednesday at the Nuart at 7:30 p.m. followed by a live performance by 
singer Jad Fair and his band. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to tell how much of the 90-minute film is put on and how much of it 
is on the level -- it has been called the "Spinal Tap" for the '90s. One thing 
is for sure: It allows its interviewees to drone on interminably about a band 
formed in 1977 by brothers Jad and David Fair in the living room of their 
family home in Uniontown, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 We're told that David dropped out early but that Jad has persisted on the 
fringes of the music business, even performing at nursing homes. "Half 
Japanese" is more fun to listen to than former Velvet Underground drummer 
Maureen Tucker or Penn Jillette of Penn and Teller. (310) 478-6379. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in collaboration with the 
Getty Center, will present tonight at 7 an extraordinary double feature, the 
70mm director's cut of Jacques Tati's "Playtime" (1968) and Cuban filmmaker 
Tomas Gutierrez Alea's "Memories of Underdevelopment" (1968). 
</P>
<P>
 In the first, Tati brought back, after a 16-year absence, his beloved Mr. 
Hulot, the tall Frenchman -- played by Tati -- who lopes along at a slight 
forward tilt, forever running afoul of all manner of modern conveniences and 
gadgetry. This time he's job-hunting and gets caught up in a dehumanizing 
skyscraper city. This documentary-like account on 24 hours of life in a world 
of steel and glass is also an acute, surreal contemporary satire that emerges 
nevertheless as singularly affirmative. 
</P>
<P>
 Alea's film is a masterpiece of psychological drama, a stream-of-consciousness 
account, moving back and forth in time, of a handsome, wealthy 38-year-old 
Cuban's attempt to relate to Castro's revolution. As he confronts his 
"underdevelopment" -- his atrophied haute bourgeoise emotions and character -- 
the film, in turn, becomes an indictment of the evils of neocolonialism and the 
frivolity and corruption under Batista. 
</P>
<P>
 Alea also criticizes the isolation and ineffectuality of middle-class 
intellectuals whose embracing of European culture has cut them off from the 
needs of their own people. (310) 247-3000, Ext. 111. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmforum's "Scratching the Belly of the Beast: Cutting-Edge Media in Los 
Angeles, 1922-94" enters its final week at Hollywood Moguls, 1650 N. Hudson, 
Hollywood, with tonight's 8 p.m. program of subjective visions of mind and 
place, geography and landscape by local artists. Screening Tuesday at 7 p.m. at 
the Central Library, 5th and Flower, is James Benning's challenging "North on 
Evers," in which we are deliberately forced to choose between concentrating on 
the rich flow of images depicting his cross-country motorcycle journey or his 
diary-like writing that travels across the bottom of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The retrospective ends Wednesday at the Hollywood Moguls with a closing-night 
party hosted by Kenneth Anger and featuring a screening of Alla Nazimova's 1922 
"Salome," a bizarre, high-falutin adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play -- with an 
aura of stylized, decadent chic and inspired by Aubrey Beardsley drawings -- 
that nevertheless strikingly anticipates such experimental exotica as Anger's 
own shimmering "Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome" (1954), which also screens. 
Also on hand will be Cameron, who appeared in Anger's film, and Samson De 
Brier, who was in both films. 
</P>
<P>
 The series' final presentation is on Thursday at the Monica 4-Plex, where two 
major works of local independent cinema will screen, Pat O'Neill's stunning 
1988 experiment exploring the interplay of nature and industry, "Water and 
Power" (3:30 p.m.), and Charles Burnett's 1977 "Killer of Sheep" (5 p.m.), a 
beautiful and anguished documentary-like account of several days in the bleak 
life of an L.A. slaughterhouse worker (Henry Gayle-Sanders, in a remarkable 
portrayal). (213) 663-9568.

MUSIC REVIEW; SOUTHWEST CHAMBER SOCIETY UNITES CENTURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday in Pasadena Presbyterian Church, the Southwest Chamber Society dared 
ask the musical question: What do Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643) and Luigi Nono 
(1924-1990) have in common, besides Italian heritage? Is it possible to make a 
smooth transition from the lucid timeless elegance of the Renaissance master 
and the cerebral, atonal strategies of the modernist? 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, the concert made the programmatic leap over three centuries with 
integrity intact. One could point to the rationality of approach between early 
music and much 20th-Century work, leaving out the emotive gustiness that 
reached its peak in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, another part of the connective thread was supplied by the 
venue itself. Monteverdi's music, by divine right and historical precedent, 
plays well in a resonant chapel such as the Pasadena church, with its vaulting 
ceiling. On Monteverdi's secular and sacred music, soprano Mary Rawcliffe sang 
boldly -- if occasionally faltering in pitch -- confidently accompanied by 
lutenist James Tyler and viola da gambaist Robert Tueller. 
</P>
<P>
 In a very different way, that spacious cavity complemented Nono's spare and 
chilling " 'Hay que caminar' sonando," the composer's final work and the most 
memorable piece on this program. Here, violinists Peter Marsh and Annie Chalex 
gradually moved among multiple music stands, suggesting spatial and minimalist 
theater aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 They laid out spectral long tones, slathered in a slow vibrato interspersed 
with sudden gruff outbursts like unsettled spirits floating up into the space. 
Based on a very dismantled Verdi motif, the work left an impression of 
charged-up solemnity. Enigma was not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 In this program, the middle ground was represented -- oddly enough -- by the 
music of Arnold Schoenberg, via his 1905 String Quartet No. 1. This dates from 
the composer's era of transfigured romanticism, before he began tinkering with 
the molecular makeup of Western music. In this long, chameleonic piece, played 
with purpose here by Marsh and Chalex, violist Jan Karlin and cellist Roger 
Lebow, it's as if the composer looked in a cracked mirror at the century just 
passed and created a Cubist portrait thereof. 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring the evening's century-leaping design was the basic notion that 
music -- music worth knowing -- knows no borders of style or epoch. We have 
more in common with ancestral wisdom than we sometimes care to admit. JOSEF 
WOODARD

MUSIC REVIEW; KULESHOV DEBUTS WITH PASADENA SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the four-year breaks between the major international piano competitions, 
the musical world at large catches up on the big talents who win -- or, 
sometimes more often, lose -- those contests. Southern California caught up 
with the silver medalist of the 1993 Van Cliburn Competition, Saturday, when 
Valery Kuleshov made his local debut playing Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto 
with the Pasadena Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 But more was going on in Pasadena Civic Auditorium at this fourth concert of 
the 1993-94 season: Music Director Jorge Mester preceded the Tchaikovsky work 
-- which really ought to go last on any program, as it did here -- with worthy 
and unhackneyed pieces, Stravinsky's "Baiser de la Fee" Divertimento and 
Prokofiev's cherishable but usually neglected Seventh Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Both works benefited from a kaleidoscopic perspective and clarified continuity 
from the podium, wonderful ensemble skills from the orchestra and brilliant 
soloism, in particular from hornist James Thatcher, cellist Douglas Davis, 
trombonist James Sawyer and, substituting for the indisposed Dominick Fera, 
clarinetist Emily Bernstein, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 All parts of the orchestra -- resplendent brass, authoritative woodwinds, 
pungent percussion and the splendid core of the ensemble, the strings -- seemed 
to contribute equally. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuleshov, 32, proved a rarity among prizewinners: a virtuoso without 
mannerisms and a Russian conservatory product with middle-of-the-road musical 
sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 He accomplished the feat of playing this most familiar of concertos without 
strain or Angst, and of placing its dynamic peaks and valleys precisely where 
the composer indicated. His technique is unassailable, his tone multilayered. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides going straight to the heart of musical matters with a bracing 
directness, he produces a pianistic sound one can feel resonate in one's back. 
No doubt, a called-for recital appearance would tell us more about Kuleshov's 
individuality, but the name has already been imprinted. Mester & Co. 
collaborated fully in this success. 
</P>
<P>
 With some members of the audience screaming their approval, an encore seemed 
appropriate. Kuleshov obliged with the finger-busting, unpublished "Carmen" 
Fantasy by Vladimir Horowitz. After that, the yelling continued.

TV REVIEW; PBS' 'WOMEN' DOESN'T DEFINE SPIRITUAL MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canadian filmmaker Donna Read admits late in her three-part, three-hour film 
study "Women and Spirituality" that she and her crew at first felt 
uncomfortable shooting the ritual ceremonies practiced by feminist 
spiritualists, paganists and witches in North America and England. They got 
over it, she explains, understanding the purpose of the rituals as an act of 
reverence for the Earth -- the heart and soul of eco-spiritualism. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, to the casual viewer of Read's massive and beautiful film, whatever 
understanding Read gleaned to bridge that river of discomfort is never fully 
articulated. Against her obvious desires, the image of the ritualists on the 
screen suggests a bunch of white people going native. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only partly Read's problem. The movement itself has yet to describe its 
full meaning and foundation, despite a growing library of books on the subject 
by, among others, Charlene Spretnak, Susan Griffin and Starhawk -- all of whom 
the film prominently features. Especially in the first section ("Goddess 
Remembered") and the third ("Full Circle"), the religion's value -- "Do as you 
will, harm none" -- and its dominant terminology of "reverence" for the Earth, 
of a striving for "balance" and "wholeness," is so conceptually vague as to 
mean almost anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Much clearer is the middle section ("The Burning Times"), in which Read turns 
to history and such historians as Barbara Roberts and Irving Smith to tell the 
gruesome account of early Christian Europe's persecution of women, some of whom 
held to ancient pagan customs, as witches. Susan Trow's rich cinematography 
somehow makes the etchings depicting the witch burnings and the horrendous 
torture devices all the more blood-curdling. 
</P>
<P>
 But, even here, some skepticism is in order. The entire film's telling of 
history is remarkably slanted so that the military machine of the Roman Empire 
is described as respectful of nature-based religions, while the ancient Greeks 
come off as a dastardly lot of no-good men. Roberts astoundingly couches the 
Renaissance's scientific revolution as men using the Inquisition's torture 
machines to study nature. Christianity, material and industrial civilization 
and the culture of Aeschylus and Shakespeare get the same treatment that the 
old female pagans got: demonization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women and Spirituality," produced from 1989 to 1992 by the National Film 
Board of Canada, is, on one level, a gorgeous travelogue taking us to Avebury, 
Chaco Canyon, Palenque and other primeval sites. On a deeper level, though, it 
demonstrates how eco-spirituality is firmer about the history of such 
pre-Christian goddess-based societies as the Minoans, Celts and Urubans and the 
subsequent era of persecution than about its own content. Read's inquiry is 
spelled out in personal terms in the final hour, but what's heard is the voice 
of mystification. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the voice can't hide the contradictions. The values, for instance, of "the 
personal is the political" and "nature" were also shared by the Nazis, and the 
movement's equation of peace and nonviolence with nature -- which is seldom 
peaceful and endlessly violent -- will not square. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Women and Spirituality" airs in three parts on KCET-TV Channel 28, tonight 
through Wednesday at 10 p.m.

FANS WAIT, 1 MILLION CALL FOR O.C. STREISAND TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Barbra Streisand fans turned out in force at ticket outlets and tied up phone 
lines Sunday morning as three concerts at the Anaheim Arena sold out in less 
than half an hour, and three added shows were sellouts by noon. 
</P>
<P>
 TicketMaster reported the biggest response since it began operating in 
Southern California in 1983, with an estimated 1 million calls logged for the 
Anaheim shows. Fred Rosen, president and CEO of Ticketmaster, said the fourth 
and fifth concerts had been planned, if demand warranted, but the sixth show 
was spur of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 A source said the concerts on Streisand's five-city tour are expected to gross 
$2 million each, probably a record for pop music. The average sold-out arena 
concert grosses between $300,000 and $500,000, according to PollStar, a trade 
magazine that tracks the concert business. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the Anaheim shows -- May 25, 27, 29, 31, June 2 and 4 -- ranged 
from $350 down to $50, much higher than for most pop concerts but less than 
tickets to Streisand's comeback shows Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 in Las Vegas, where 
the top price was $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds numbering into the hundreds were reported at Ticketmaster outlets 
across Southern California, while the Anaheim Arena box office drew an 
estimated 4,000. People started lining up well before dawn; the tickets went on 
sale at 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Erlichman, Streisand's representative, said the singer was called at 
9:20 and was "very excited" to learn that the first three concerts already had 
sold out. She gave her permission to proceed with the plans for two additional 
shows -- only to be called back at 9:40 to be told those tickets also were 
gone. She was asked to do a sixth show and agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, 12 shows around the country had been announced. Tickets to all of 
them went on sale simultaneously. Nationally, Ticketmaster reported an 
estimated 5 million attempted calls in the first hour. In addition to the three 
new Anaheim shows, two shows were added in New York (for a total of five) and a 
second show was added in Michigan. About 250,000 tickets were sold in all 
(mostly through outlets, as opposed to over the phone). A spokesman for 
Streisand said no further concerts will be added. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour -- which comes in the wake of the Vegas shows, Streisand's first 
public concerts in 22 years -- will begin May 10 in Washington, and will 
continue in Auburn Hills, Mich., before coming to Anaheim. Then, it will move 
on to San Jose and will close at Madison Square Garden in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim is the only venue to land six dates -- a third of the new total. "I 
think it's a major coup for this building," said Alex Hodges, a vice president 
for Nederlander, the concert promoter. Nationally, according to a spokesman for 
Streisand, "more than 100 arenas tried to land these shows." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get to see Elvis, and I tried, so I have to see Barbra," said Fran 
Ellis of Costa Mesa, who said she had been in line since 4 a.m. "I've got 
(Streisand's) pictures all over my house. I've got a picture on my bathroom 
wall so when I put on my makeup I can see her in the mirror." Ellis ended up 
with tickets to the final show. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Low of Monrovia became an instant celebrity when he was the first to get 
tickets at 9 a.m. Television cameras, photographers and reporters were on him 
as he walked away from the box office with six tickets to Streisand's first 
concert here. Low admitted that he's not much of a Babs fan himself -- the 
tickets were to be a birthday present for his mother, although the surprise 
probably was shot by all the press attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Before tickets went on sale for the Anaheim show, the Ticketmaster limit was 
cut from six to four per person to give more fans a chance. At the Anaheim 
Arena box office, the limit was six until the last show was added, and then it 
was cut to two, after a vote by the more than 1,000 fans still waiting at that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters held back some tickets to the final show, making them available only 
to those who had been standing in line at the box office. Kelly McCullough of 
Santa Ana was so far back in the line that she figured she had no chance at 
getting tickets, but she stuck around anyway and was rewarded for her patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as tickets for the final show were dwindling down, she got to the 
window and scored two. "I am the happiest person on the face of this planet. 
Now I have to figure out how to pay for this," said McCullough, who is 
unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of relief seemed common among the last few ticket buyers. "I don't 
even care where I sit," said Danielle Austin of Orange as she walked away from 
the window. "I'll bring napkins in case my nose bleeds."

 TicketMaster reported the biggest response ever since it began operating in

 The Las Vegas shows marked the singer's return to live concerts after a 
22-year break. Streisand's Anaheim dates will be May 25, 27, 29, 31, June 2 and

GETTING SERIOUS?; SUCCESS OF 'PHILADELPHIA,' 'SCHINDLER'S' SENDS A SIGNAL TO 
HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, what now Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 The Oscars are over for another year. And the industry had a record 
$5.2-billion year at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 If 1993 -- when the major studios tried to "do the right thing" by releasing 
such consciousness-raising films as "Schindler's List" and "Philadelphia" -- 
proved anything, it was that quality can sell. 
</P>
<P>
 But, this is not a new concept. Any industry veteran will tell you that the 
majors have always made their share of provocative, issue-oriented movies. Some 
actually made money. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, you always did them with a sinking feeling that you were betting on a 
long shot," says John Calley, the new president of United Artists, who as 
Warner Bros.' head of production in the 1970s championed such risky pictures as 
Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, notes Calley, "there seems to be a market for the long shot and, if 
anything, film companies are more aggressively pursuing material of real 
significance." He says this is definitely the case with himself and his boss, 
MGM chairman Frank Mancuso, the former head of Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Calley, who dropped out of Hollywood for 13 years in 1980, admits that if 
someone had come to him 14 years ago about releasing "The Piano," he would have 
been "baffled -- and wondered, 'What do we do with it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1974, although Warners financed Federico Fellini's "Amarcord," of 
which Calley was a big fan, he said the studio's distribution executives 
refused to release the foreign-language movie domestically "because they didn't 
know what to do with it." (The film was released in the U.S. by Roger Corman's 
New World Pictures, and overseas by Warners.) 
</P>
<P>
 The major studios, says Calley, "are now honoring films of serious content and 
recognizing not only their value to society but their value as moneymakers." He 
claims that even a film like Columbia's "The Remains of the Day," which he and 
Mike Nichols co-produced with Merchant/Ivory and which cost around $10 million, 
"will (eventually) make a very significant amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's now a rational perception," Calley says, "that films of high quality 
have an audience waiting for them, and at the same time that doesn't diminish 
the potency of other kinds of (more commercial) films." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Dawn Steel, production president at Paramount Pictures and a former 
studio head at Columbia Pictures, says: "We've always known that if you make a 
good movie, the audience will come most of the time. That we could make movies 
that have something to say and that they can make money -- I never felt those 
things were mutually exclusive. . . . But, maybe, we've just lost sight of that 
in the last couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
 TriStar President Marc Platt, who had supported "Philadelphia" before any 
top-flight stars were attached, says he'd like to think that the past year 
proves that films can be provocative and emotional and find a mainstream 
audience all at the same time -- "and that would help similar films to evolve." 
</P>
<P>
 "Philadelphia," he says, proves that audiences are "intelligent and seem to be 
hungry for movies that deal with relevant, albeit difficult or sensitive, 
subject matter." 
</P>
<P>
 While it is not the first movie to deal with AIDS, "Philadelphia" is the first 
major studio release about the disease. Platt said he hopes the fact that the 
film was headlined by Tom Hanks, one of Hollywood's biggest stars, proved that 
a heterosexual actor "going outside himself to portray a gay man" will help 
break down barriers that exist in conventional Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 Both "Philadelphia," which has grossed $66.8 million domestically, and Steven 
Spielberg's three-hour, black-and-white Holocaust epic, "Schindler's List," 
which has already sold more than $100 million worth of tickets worldwide (and 
industry pundits predict that figure could double), attracted bigger audiences 
than even the studios that released them expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, because of their questionable commercial viability, neither came 
to the screen easily, even though each cost considerably less than the industry 
average of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With such serious movies proving good for the pocketbook as well as for the 
consciousness, it raises the question if 1993 is the wake-up call Hollywood 
needed? 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century Fox chairman Peter Chernin says, "Clearly, this has been a 
very encouraging year in terms of the quality of movies." He said "over and 
over again during the year, we learned there was a more sophisticated adult 
audience out there than many of us thought previously." 
</P>
<P>
 As the number of films pouring into the marketplace today increases 
(especially with Disney and Warners each releasing upward of 35 a year), 
Chernin says, audiences are saying, "We're not interested in volume, but in 
good movies that are unique." He said that includes issue-oriented movies such 
as "Schindler's List" and "Philadelphia" or pure entertainment offerings like 
"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "In the Line of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The message that audiences are giving to the studios, Chernin says, is "Don't 
make cookie-cutter formula movies," a goal he admits, "is easier said than 
done." Moviegoers are saying, "We want good movies, not necessarily art movies, 
but movies with character and dimension and uniqueness to them." And quality, 
the Fox movie chief concedes, is "a tough, scary word." 
</P>
<P>
 Because 1993 was a year that financially rewarded quality, Chernin says "it 
will push everybody to at least try for quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Pictures chairman Sherry Lansing said that although clearly the 
mandate of any studio head is to "make movies that make money," the kind of 
business that some of the serious subject films are doing "encourages us to 
know we can make all kinds of films now . . . . We can make movies for that 
intelligent, over-25 adult audience, who are going to the movies in spades, and 
justify it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Pollock, chairman of Universal Pictures, agrees: "You can do well by doing 
good." That notion, he says, becomes even more relevant "in a world where there 
are so many choices for moviegoers, and people are reluctant to spend money on 
films they may not feel they're getting their money's worth on." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ways a picture can stand out, he suggests, "is if it's good -- not 
that it has a marketing hook or a major star or that 600 people get gunned down 
in the first five minutes. Hey, how about that for a revelation?"  
</P>
<P>
 What is the lesson in all this? 
</P>
<P>
 "Make really good movies and most of the time they'll really work -- but not 
all the time," Pollock muses. 
</P>
<P>
 But UA's Calley warns of an inherent danger in Hollywood's tendency to jump on 
the now-vogue "quality sells" bandwagon. He fears studios will start churning 
out "an avalanche of oddball films, and probably a lot of them shouldn't be 
made . . . then the pendulum will swing back." 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, Hollywood is notorious for trying to imitate someone else's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran comedy director Ivan Reitman ("Twins," "Ghostbusters," "Kindergarten 
Cop"), who directed last year's "Dave" and is currently prepping the Arnold 
Schwarzenegger comedy "Junior," avows: "There's no such thing as a guy named 
Hollywood. There are thousands of people all hunting for their next movie and 
we all have individual desires and agendas for doing what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman says that for years he has been wanting to tell the story of his 
parents' survival from communism and the family's "harrowing" escape from 
Czechoslovakia in 1950, but "I have never felt emotionally ready to tackle it. 
I have to do what I feel is right for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The director pointed out that in addition to the serious hits of '93, "there 
was a great range" of comedies and action adventure movies -- from "Sleepless 
in Seattle" and "Dave" to "Jurassic Park" and "In the Line of Fire" -- all of 
which "had substance to them." 
</P>
<P>
 And as Universal's Pollock reminds, Hollywood should "never forget the 
message" in Preston Sturges' 1941 Hollywood satire, "Sullivan's Travels." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's central character, a commercial director, decides to go out and 
make a serious art movie only to realize that what people really want is 
laughter and escapism in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, it's not so bad making pure entertainment."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: CAT LOVER HAS TALES TO TELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's raining cats and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 More accurately, it's "Cats & Dogs," a two-hour special -- 60 minutes per 
species -- on cable's TBS channel tonight. Neither bark nor bite, it's lovable 
and slobbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Tuesday comes a special edition of "Rescue 911," animal-advocate 
Arnold Shapiro's "reality" series whose life-saving stories usually feature 
only humans. This time the entire hour grants more than equal time to animals, 
from four-legged patients at UC Davis' veterinary hospital to Wilma the 
pot-bellied pig in Oregon. Trapped in a burning house, she seems a goner until 
a cop plucks her from the flames and carries her to safety. She squeals, you 
squeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Always an upbeat series, "Rescue 911" on this occasion emphasizes the unique 
relationship between humans and their companion animals. And although the 
show's re-enactments continue to be problematic, your eyes mist as K-9 Officer 
Duke, a Modesto police dog, appears doomed after getting stabbed while taking 
down a knife-wielding lunatic. Things are looking grim for the critically 
wounded Duke until his compassionate partner, Officer Gene Ballentine, starts 
hanging around and cheering him up, even sleeping with Duke in his hospital 
cage for seven days. Is this great or what? There on the screen is Ballentine 
scrunched beside his friend, reading get-well cards: "This says, 'To Duke. . . 
.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Just as emotional is the way Corpus Christi, Tex., citizens mobilize on behalf 
of a tiny puppy that has fallen into a sewer and is about to be washed away. 
It's the humans who strategize, but who is the actual rescuer? None other than 
another dog, Annie Fannie, who's lowered into the sewer, crawls into a 10-inch 
drainpipe and returns with the puppy in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 All this fuss for a 2-pound animal? "A life's a life," someone says. 
</P>
<P>
 The point gets a big, bold exclamation point in tonight's "Cats & Dogs," whose 
first hour is devoted to canines. You're reminded, among other things, that 
Frisbee's best friend is dog. 
</P>
<P>
 And this program is a dogophile's best friend. From snooty dogs to sooty dogs, 
they're all here. There are foxhounds who (thankfully) never catch foxes. There 
are dog-show dogs, ugly dogs and therapeutic dogs that make hospital calls to 
sick kids. There are sled dogs, a snoring dog, a sheepherding dog and silky 
coated bluebloods that patronize the Taj Mahal of kennels. 
</P>
<P>
 The segment's occasional human voice-overs for dogs should have been cut off 
at the larynx, however, and let's be candid here: This is very lightweight 
stuff -- a toy poodle, a Chihuahua. But how many more documentaries about lions 
eating wildebeests can you take? And for animal lovers, substance is not always 
necessary. Just the sight of animals doing nothing in particular is joy enough. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of joy, there's the hour on cats, in which animal expert Roger Caras 
mingles mundane tips (if you have a cat, "love him") with an important message 
about spaying and neutering. He also provides a pretty fair definition of 
living with domestic felines, comparing the experience to going to a French 
restaurant: "You're going to be overcharged, you're going to be insulted. But 
somehow to you, it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are all kinds of cats and cat people here. Just look at poor Mingis the 
cat, who becomes an emotional wreck when the husband of the house leaves each 
day for work. So bring on the cat therapist: "What I'd like to do is tape this 
session. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 You see cat-obsessed eccentrics, too, and the latest in catwear, including a 
kitty biker jacket and kitty yarmulkes, or skullcaps, for devout felines of the 
Jewish persuasion. But when you see cats being walked on leashes, you begin to 
wonder. I mean, where does this happen, on Pluto? 
</P>
<P>
 But enough of these programs, which I chose to review only so that I could 
tell everyone about the cats in my life. Blabbing this kind of thing, as many 
of you will recognize, is the cat lover's compulsion. We can't help ourselves. 
We're driven to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheba, Dickens, Sheila, Blue, Otis? Forget 'em. They're the dogs on our 
cul-de-sac, nice pooches all, but completely eclipsed by Tiger Hoser, Cutie, 
Nick, B.C., Smokey, Mitten, Murray and, of course, his black magnificence, the 
maestro of the chaise longue, Sport Burns-Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, yes, the hyphenate. While we were grieving for Snoopy, our 14-year-old 
Tabby who died of cancer, our neighbors, the Burnses, granted us proprietary 
rights over Sport, which was nice because Sport was already living on our patio 
near Woody the guinea pig. We accepted, because our neighbors already had three 
cats. Knowing a good deal when he saw one, Sport now comes in when the sun goes 
down. He's a great cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though I was her personal serf and pleaded for her affection, Snoopy 
despised me. Go figure. But Sport worships me. To him, I am an icon. He looks 
up at me as if to say, "When I grow up I want to be just like you." Actually, I 
say it for him, in baby talk. If the walls could talk. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sport hated Snoopy, and vice versa. He hates B.C., too. For some reason, he 
doesn't hate Nick or Cutie, who is the brother of Murray. Sport does hate 
Murray, a big, furry, orange prowler who is the cul-de-sac bully. Except that 
in his own home, Murray is dominated by Mitten, whose son, Doodles, disappeared 
a few months ago. We still scan the horizon, hoping to see Doodles returning. 
But no luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Holly the pot-bellied pig. But that's another column. 
</P>
<P>
 I could go on forever. But I'll end this with a quote. In tonight's TBS 
special, a man says lovingly about his family dog: "He's the vice president of 
our company." See, that's the difference. A cat would never settle for the No. 
2 job. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Cats & Dogs" airs today at 5:05 and 9:05 p.m. on cable's TBS. "Rescue 911" 
airs Tuesday at 8 p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

 About 6 1/2 years after NBC first began trying to turn Randy Shilts' landmark 
book on AIDS into a TV movie, "And the Band Played On" finally makes it to the 
network tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the movie isn't really NBC's at all. It's HBO's, which picked up the ball 
when NBC abandoned the project about four years ago. The film debuted on the 
pay-cable channel last September. NBC has edited about 40 minutes from the 
original to fit it into a two-hour time slot and make room for commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great that we get to air this now," said Warren Littlefield, 
president of NBC Entertainment. "Our desire has never changed. We thought it 
was an important book and we always wanted to see that property on our air. Why 
would we want to change that goal? So what, that it left us; the fact is, it's 
still an outstanding property and we feel it is still important to get the 
message out to the American public." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC dropped the project in 1989 after two years of work that included buying 
the rights to the book and commissioning scripts. At the time, there was 
speculation that the network was fearful that there would not be advertiser or 
viewer support for what were -- at least by network TV standards -- the 
controversial elements of Shilts' book, which tracks the medical, scientific, 
political and societal saga of the first five years of AIDS in the United 
States, culminating in the announcement in 1985 that Rock Hudson was suffering 
from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The 613-page book, written by a San Francisco Chronicle reporter who was the 
first journalist assigned full time to the AIDS beat, is considered one of the 
quintessential depictions of gay life in America. (Shilts, who consulted on the 
movie's script, died of AIDS last month.) 
</P>
<P>
 Littlefield, however, dismissed the idea that NBC chickened out because of the 
gay content or fears of an advertiser boycott. He said the network had planned 
from the start to transform the book into a four-hour, two-part miniseries and 
ultimately decided that the material "did not hold up in that form." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Spelling, the producer behind such network series as "Dynasty" and 
"Beverly Hills, 90210," then picked up the project and, after overcoming myriad 
obstacles -- including three directors and at least 15 drafts of the script -- 
made a 2-hour and 15-minute film with HBO that focuses primarily on the 
medical, scientific and political elements of Shilts' book. The movie does 
feature gay characters, but the central character is a heterosexual doctor who 
directed laboratory efforts for AIDS research at the Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Spelling said that no matter the reasons it shied away from the project 
originally, he considers NBC courageous for making the film available to 
millions of people who were not able to watch it on HBO. Only about 2% of U.S. 
homes subscribe to HBO, and for the nine showings on the cable channel last 
fall, HBO estimates a cumulative audience of about 10 million homes. That 
leaves at least 80 million that didn't see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who can't afford cable, a lot of low-income groups 
and ethnic groups who didn't have a chance to see it," Spelling said. "And we 
want everyone to see it because everyone is affected by this catastrophe."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Spelling nor Littlefield believes viewers will miss any of the scenes 
cut from the movie to make way for commercials. Spelling said NBC gave no 
directives to reduce any of the gay content or to eliminate any specific scene 
because it might be controversial. The only requested trims, Littlefield said, 
were to avoid a couple of potentially offensive words. 
</P>
<P>
 Littlefield said NBC decided to broadcast "And the Band Played On" to heighten 
public awareness about AIDS. Advertisers have strongly supported the decision, 
he said, and the program will be a financial success for the network. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not holding a fire sale because this is an AIDS movie," Littlefield 
said. "And that is a terrific message for all the networks -- that we can 
tackle tough social issues and deal with AIDS without being afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 He conceded that he did not know if advertisers were more inclined to support 
this particular movie because it had been test driven, in a sense, on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a number of bad-to-lukewarm reviews when the film played on HBO -- 
some of which criticized it as being out-of-date for condemning the policies of 
the Reagan Administration when he was long out of office and his successors had 
not done a great deal more than he had -- Spelling said the film is still 
critically relevant today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Randy's band is still playing," he said. "We haven't yet done a damn thing 
about it and the message is exactly the same as when the book came out (in 
1987). Maybe this can help get some people off their ass. Maybe they will say, 
'OK, (Reagan) didn't do anything about it, but we haven't either.' Maybe it 
will alert some people that we have to do more than just pay AIDS some lip 
service. Imagine what could have been done, what could be done in research and 
care with just the price of one stealth bomber." 
</P>
<P>
 * "And the Band Played On" airs at 9 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

A DIRECTOR ON HEROES AND A HOPEFUL 'EPOQUE'; MOVIES: FERNANDO TRUEBA THANKED 
BILLY WILDER WHEN HE WON AN OSCAR FOR FOREIGN-LANGUAGE FILM, BUT HE ALSO DREW 
ON RENOIR AND MARCEL PAGNOL FOR INSPIRATION, HE SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 In the 66th Academy Awards' pithiest acceptance speech, Spanish director 
Fernando Trueba, picking up a best foreign-language Oscar for his sly, 
seductive "Belle Epoque," remarked that he "would like to believe in God so 
that I could thank him, but I just believe in Billy Wilder. So thank you, Billy 
Wilder." 
</P>
<P>
 "If I win, I think: I would be horrified to have to talk in front of so many 
people," said Trueba the morning after the big night. "I can't understand how I 
finally did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, Wilder really is the best director ever, a major direct influence on 
me. He's also the best screenwriter ever. He's made more masterpieces than 
anybody. If it were not for his movies, maybe I would not be a director today. 
He called me today -- and said, 'It's God.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish he hadn't said that," retorts Wilder, by phone from his office. 
"People start crossing themselves when they see me! 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Belle Epoque' is a picture with a lot of style -- it could be made here in 
English," Wilder continues. "Trueba is a very, very serious picture-maker. The 
Spaniards are so on top of everything: He and Pedro Almodovar know more about 
me than I do. Almodovar came by my office, kissed me on both cheeks and said, 
'Now I might as well turn around and go home.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For all his admiration of Wilder, Trueba, a slim man of 39, has taken as a key 
inspiration for "Belle Epoque" in its sensual mood and idyllic setting Jean 
Renoir's "A Day in the Country," as well as the films of Marcel Pagnol. Another 
inspiration for him and his distinguished screenwriter Rafael Azcona was the 
libertarian-spirited writings of Georges Brassens, whom Trueba regards as one 
of the most important poets of the century.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He and Azcona then picked a golden moment in modern Spanish history in which 
to tell their story: the end of the monarchy and the beginning of the Republic 
in the early '30s. "People had a lot of hope then," he said. "A lot of people 
believed in the possibility of a Utopia." 
</P>
<P>
 The starting point for "Belle Epoque" (now playing throughout Southern 
California), however, was his own relationship with his father-in-law. In the 
film, a rural landowner (the great character star Fernando Fernan Gomez) 
befriends a handsome young army deserter (Jorge Sanz), but is afraid that if 
the young man should fall in love with one of his four beautiful daughters -- 
the attraction between him and all four of them is steamily mutual -- he would 
lose a friend albeit gaining a son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 19 I met an older man -- he was 52 -- and we became very, very 
good friends," said Trueba. "He was a painter, a draftsman, and had a lot of 
humor. I never met anybody who read more books. He liked Italian neo-realist 
films, the French films of (Marcel) Carne and that generation, while I 
preferred the new wave and American films. We closed every bar in the 
neighborhood talking about politics and movies. Later, I married one of his 
four daughters. We've always been friends, but it isn't the same."  
</P>
<P>
 Trueba was a Madrid film critic when he made his feature debut with the 1982 
"Opera Prima," a delightful romantic comedy. Currently, he is preparing his 
next picture, an adaptation of the Donald Westlake thriller "Two Much," to be 
filmed in Miami this fall and produced by his savvy longtime colleague Andres 
Vicente Gomez (who joined him onstage Monday night to accept the Oscar). Gomez 
hopes the Oscar will trigger the release of some of Trueba's earlier films. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Two Much' has a lot of humor. It's very crazy," said Trueba, who made his 
English-language debut with "Mad Monkey" (retitled "Twisted Obsession" by 
Carolco and released in 1990). "The central idea is that the hero pretends he 
has a twin, and then he's forced to play both roles. It's a perfect idea for a 
screwball comedy. I got a letter from Westlake. He said that now that he's seen 
'Belle Epoque' he's not worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Trueba said he "absolutely" intends to remain a Spanish director, he 
concedes "I would like to work here also -- if I can do good projects. I never 
did a movie I didn't believe in. Maybe I made mistakes but I believed in what I 
was doing. Making an American comedy, 'Two Much,' is like a dream come true. 
Making a dream a reality is good, yes?"

MAGIC, LAKERS GET TO HAVE FUN AGAIN; PRO BASKETBALL: L.A.'S NEW COACH SAYS THAT 
HIS DEBUT, A 110-101 VICTORY OVER THE BUCKS, WAS EVEN MORE ENJOYABLE THAN HE 
HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE. 
</P>

<P>
 This Magic moment was not like the last debut, when he ran into the arms of 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to celebrate a buzzer-beating victory at San Diego, many 
years and one mini-dynasty ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night at the soldout Forum, Magic Johnson was wearing a dark 
pin-striped suit and running the show -- not Showtime -- from the sidelines. He 
was a coach, starting off his regime, however brief it might turn out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a 110-101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks for openers, propeled by a 
bygone atmosphere, a season-high 30 points from George Lynch and 19 rebounds 
and 18 points from Vlade Divac. He got some congratulatory handshakes walking 
off the court. Then, proving he is adjusting nicely to the new calling, he 
worried about the next game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed it more than I thought I would," Johnson said. "To see them play as 
hard as they played, that was enjoyable. No matter what happens, I'll always 
remember this day." 
</P>
<P>
 He enjoyed it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen this many happy people in Los Angeles in three years," said 
one of them, Laker owner Jerry Buss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what you saw tonight was a lot of respect for a legend." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lynch: "It was great. It was something we had not felt all year. It was 
great the fans didn't come in for Shaq. They came in to see the coach and the 
Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
 The buildup for the game easily surpassed anything this season, probably 
reaching the level of the 1991 NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was battling the same emotions by the afternoon, after showing up 
early at the shoot-around for some extra work with the rookies and then 
spending 45 minutes or so with the full squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so excited and wound up that I had to go lift weights and run a couple 
of miles," he said. "I tried to sleep a little bit, but I tossed and turned and 
dreamed about the game." 
</P>
<P>
 He had talked with one former coach, Mike Dunleavy, his counterpart for the 
debut, Saturday night and then again Sunday. Another, Pat Riley, called about 
an hour before tipoff. All Johnson had to worry about by this point was the 
fact that he barely knew the offense -- he told Nick Van Exel to call the plays 
on his own and for top assistant Bill Bertka to whisper in his ear what the 
Lakers were running. 
</P>
<P>
 As game time neared, the Lakers got a nice ovation when they came out for 
warm-ups, minus their coach. A video montage featuring Johnson and Larry Bird 
played on the scoreboard. Moments before tipoff, the coaches appeared and the 
familiar cheer of "Coooop!" filled the air to honor Michael Cooper's move from 
the front office to the bench. Johnson was next. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Lakers wanted Showtime back, they got it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Love L.A." blared from the loudspeakers and Jeffrey Osborne sang the 
national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographers recorded the meeting with Dunleavy like a summit between world 
leaders, then backed off only slightly as players huddled around Johnson for 
final instructions. Only the ending was missing, one the Lakers hoped would fit 
the occasion. A couple of hours later, they had it, that and an undefeated 
coach. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers began the night 5 1/2 games behind Denver for the eighth and final 
playoff spot with 16 to play. But the encouraging signs amid the long odds are 
that the teams still play twice more and the Nuggets' schedule starting today 
is: Seattle twice, Phoenix twice, Utah, San Antonio, Houston, the Clippers and 
the Lakers in the next nine games. "Is there enough time?" Coach Magic Johnson 
said. "It's going to be tough. They have to go on a hell of a losing streak and 
we have to go on a hell of a winning streak." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has decided to keep Doug Christie, a point guard and small forward in 
one calendar year as a pro, at shooting guard. "I'm tired of switching him 
around," Johnson said. "I think he's confused." This is good news to Christie, 
who has said all along that that is his natural position. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Bowie conceded that he probably won't return this season, adding that he 
had hoped to play for the new coach. "That's a concern, it really is," he said. 
"But at the same time, I feel as though I've got a few good years left in my 
career and I want to be realistic that, with the number of games we have left 
this season, I don't want to jeopardize the rest of my career. I would like to 
get some time with Magic, though." Bowie last played Dec. 21 and underwent 
arthroscopic surgery Jan. 5 to remove bone chips from his left knee.

MIKE DOWNEY: FOR HIM, A RARE CASE OF PREGAME JITTERS

 Coachin' time. 
</P>
<P>
 Last ones inside the Laker locker room as game time drew near were Coach 
Earvin Johnson, cabinet members Bill Bertka, Michael Cooper and Larry Drew, 
trusted First Friend Arsenio Hall, a couple of ballboys. A clock was ticking: 
7:16. 7:17. It ticked as loudly to Earvin Johnson as that one on "60 Minutes," 
a Sunday night show on a competing channel. Intro time was 7:20. Tipoff, 7:21. 
The anthem already was playing. The players already were out there. But Magic 
Johnson was still inside, being attacked by anxiety. What a concept -- a 
basketball game to be played and Magic Johnson, shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey. Happens to the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 7:05, he had assembled his team -- yes, his team -- for one last chalk 
chat. A few parting words. A pep talk. The sweet absurdity of it all suddenly 
struck him. Coach Johnson strolled to the center of a silent room and said, 
"Well, here we are." 
</P>
<P>
 And there he was, all right. Back where Winnin' Time was born. Back in the 
Forum. Back to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 All dressed up and no place to play. 
</P>
<P>
 No more tank tops with the big 32. No more golden trunks. No more rubber-soled 
Converses and sanitary socks. From now on, nothing but grown-ups' clothes. This 
was Johnson's first night of NBA coaching, a formal occasion. He even waited 
until a half-hour before tipoff before changing clothes. Took off his blue 
jacket and turtleneck. Put on a pin-striped beauty. Put on a necktie. First, 
Coach Earvin Johnson got his game face on. Then he got his game suit on. 
</P>
<P>
 And then his watch. Which wouldn't stop ticking. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is killing me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I can't be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he couldn't play. Because all he could do was "stand up and sit down, 
stand up and sit down." 
</P>
<P>
 It got to be 7:07. Johnson turned his dozen Lakers loose, by themselves, kids 
in the hall. They had a game to play, their 67th of the season, the coach's 
first. Against a wall the players leaned, stretching and laughing and waiting. 
James Edwards looked over his shoulder at Arsenio Hall and did the woof-woof 
lasso whirl with his wrist, the entertainer's trademark. Then he and the rest 
of the Lakers left for the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson stuck his head out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget to trap after those free throws," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them nodded. Magic said, "Don't forget now. Trap!" And he ducked back 
through the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the next corner were the Milwaukee Bucks, the opposition. There were 
cutouts of Jim Eyen's face, several of them, Scotch-taped to the hallway walls. 
Eyen is an assistant coach with the Bucks who previously spent three years 
assisting the Lakers. Arrows were drawn on his picture, to remind him not to go 
to the wrong locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 7:11. The trainer, Gary Vitti, took the new coach aside, told him to relax, 
stood there giving basketball advice to Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitti rested a friendly hand on Coach Earvin Johnson's shirt front and said, 
"You can always take a 20-second timeout if you need it. Look at me. I'll tell 
you when." Lean on me, he said. Then he, too, left. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the coaches and a companion or two remained now. Cooper sat, thinking. 
This was his big night, too. He, too, was a Laker again. He had spent the 
previous day drilling defense into young Laker minds at a practice some 
observers called the most comprehensive they have seen all year. Randy Pfund, 
naturally, would disagree. But there were two areas that the new coaches 
stressed above all else -- transition defense and "help" defense -- two areas, 
Coach Earvin Johnson was compelled to say, where "we are so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Tick, tick. 7:18. 7:19. Johnson gulped and said, "OK, let's do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Coachin' time. He had put it off as long as possible. He had tossed and turned 
until he finally told his wife, Cookie, that a pregame nap was out of the 
question. He spoke on the phone to Pat Riley. He spoke in person to Mike 
Dunleavy. They were no longer his coaches; they were his predecessors. It 
seemed strange, he said, getting tips from men who are now his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Into the hallway stepped Coach Earvin Johnson and staff. The significance of 
the moment dawned on Cooper, who turned to Bertka and Drew separately, hand 
extended, to say: "Thank you for having me here with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson gave a here-we-go hug to a friend, a writer, and squeezed his 
hand. It was the first time the friend had ever felt Magic's palm to be wet 
before a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was exquisite and the friend said, "You haven't got your uniform on 
under there, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said, "No way. First you'd kill me, and then Cookie would kill me." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hallway he went. Cameras rolling. Ready for his close-up. A walk he 
had made a thousand times. Suddenly, all new. He turned a corner. Into brighter 
lights. Forum fans spotted him. The noise rose. It became deafening. Magic 
Johnson was back where he belonged. Coach Earvin Johnson would have a different 
chair. He stood in front of it. He listened to the crowd. He listened to the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 A song blasted from the loudspeakers. Everyone clapped along. It was James 
Brown. It was, "I Feel Good." 
</P>
<P>
 He did.

ANDREWS MAKES SPLASH WITH FIRST MAJOR TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holding a one-shot lead and heading for her favorite hole, Laura Davies chose 
to play it safe. That probably cost her the Nabisco Dinah Shore Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-stroke switch on the 72nd hole gave Donna Andrews the $105,000 winner's 
prize, her first major and her second victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews officially won it when she sank a five-foot birdie putt on the 
par-five 18th to finish with a two-under 70 and a 276 total. Davies, who took 
the lead in the tightly contested duel with a par on the 17th, also had a 70 
but lost by a shot with a 277. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fans yelled for Andrews to jump into the lake in front of the 18th, 
she obliged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything for the fans," she said, laughing. "I wish Dinah had been with me, 
but I know she was here in spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a dip would have cooled off Davies. The Briton was a gracious loser, 
although inside she was obviously seething. She answered all questions 
politely, explained her round and praised the winner. But, after leaving the 
interview area, she stormed out, threw her visor in a trash bin and hurried 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Davies did not acknowledge making a mistake on the 526-yard 18th, the 
hole she reached in two on Saturday, she had to be wondering. 
</P>
<P>
 Her power gives her a decided edge over the other LPGA players. Davies 
finished 12 under for the tournament, nine under on the four par-five holes. In 
the first three par-fives Sunday, she went for the green each time and each 
time got a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the wind was against me today," Davies said, "and I was sure I couldn't 
reach (on the 18th)." 
</P>
<P>
 So she used a four-iron off the tee, but pushed the shot into the light rough 
on the right. On her next shot, she stayed in the rough with a two-iron. On her 
third shot she used an eight-iron. She hit it fat and it came to rest far left, 
60 feet from the cup and calling for an uphill, then downhill putt. If she hit 
it too hard, it would have gone off the green. She left it eight feet short, 
then missed her par. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews, thinking she needed a birdie to make a playoff, suddenly found 
herself with victory in her grasp. Without hesitation, she knocked her 
five-foot birdie putt into the center of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's awesome," she said as she wrung out her wet clothes and came barefoot to 
the interview room. "I don't think it will sink in for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I made the bogey on 17 to fall behind, I forced myself to relax. I felt 
sure she wouldn't go for the green in two, so I knew I had a chance to tie with 
a birdie. I didn't dream I had a chance to win until I saw where her ball was 
on the third shot. I knew that was three-putt range." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, playing with Davies and Michelle McGann, Andrews had 
simply played her game while the two long-hitters outdrove her by big yardage. 
On 18, she hit a three-wood off the tee and another three-wood to a position 
135 yards from the cup. She then hit a knockdown six-iron to within six feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I looked at the putt, I remembered I sank a similar putt for a par on the 
last hole yesterday," Andrews said. "I told my husband (her caddie) I wouldn't 
leave it short. I learned my lesson as a rookie." 
</P>
<P>
 Several players made a run at the two leaders, but from the time Andrews sank 
a 20-foot birdie putt on the 377-yard par-four 12th, it was like match play. A 
blunder by Andrews, when she picked a five-iron out of the bag instead of a six 
on 14, almost cost her. But Andrews, who putted well throughout, saved par with 
another 20-footer. Then, a fat five-iron shot on 17 put her behind but did not 
beat her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have felt terrible if that blunder on 14 had cost me," she said. "I 
have to take the blame myself. I pulled it out of the bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Tammie Green, who started the day five shots back, made a run at the leaders, 
but after getting within two shots with eight holes left, never made a move. 
She finished with a four-under 68 and third place with 279. Jan Stephenson, who 
played well on her comeback trail, barely missed a birdie putt that would have 
tied her for third. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandie Burton, the budding young star from Rialto, threatened early to run 
away with the event. After posting a 65, the best round of the tournament, on 
Saturday, Burton came back to birdie four of the first five holes on the final 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 With relatives and friends urging her on, she twice was within a shot of the 
lead. She finished with seven birdies, four bogeys, a double bogey and a 71.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; THE STY'S THE LIMIT FOR 
RAZORBACKS; MIDWEST: PRESIDENT CLINTON AND HIS FAMILY HELP CHEER ARKANSAS TO A 
76-68 VICTORY OVER MICHIGAN AND A BERTH IN FINAL FOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Arkansas chic, which has produced the nation's president, not to 
mention the Super Bowl owner and coach, added a Final Four entry to the list 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not just any entry, either, but the pre-tournament favorite, Arkansas' mighty 
Razorbacks, who smacked down Michigan's aging youths, 76-68, in the final of 
the Midwest regional before a crowd that included President Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton sat between his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea. During 
the game, he explained the finer points to Chelsea. After the game, he embraced 
Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we met at half court today, I think he was as proud of the Hogs as I was 
proud," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're a Hog, a Razorback, if they cut you open, you're going to bleed 
little pigs. That's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The President also said he would follow the Hogs to Charlotte, N.C., so if 
you're tiring of this subplot, you haven't seen anything yet. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arkansas, the power elite stay on familiar terms. President Clinton is a 
longtime Hog fan. Bud Walton, brother of the late Sam Walton, founder of 
Wal-Mart Stores, recently built the Razorbacks a 20,000-seat arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Hog chic spread easily to Dallas, what with Arkansas having won its last 11 
games in Reunion Arena, dating to its days in the Southwest Conference, which 
plays its tournament there. And for entertainment in Texas, the Razorbacks 
could follow the exploits of two more native sons, Cowboy owner Jerry Jones and 
Coach Jimmy Johnson, whose feud has been getting daily "team coverage" on TV 
stations and running on front pages. 
</P>
<P>
 True to form, the Razorbacks rolled over little Tulsa and were installed as a 
solid favorite over Michigan. The Fab Four, accustomed to dominating events, 
were obliged to answer questions about the Hogs' roster (bigger and deeper than 
theirs) and the Hogs' shorts (longer than theirs), not to mention the Hogs' 
presidential fan club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got our own President that's (sic) going to be pulling for us," 
Michigan Coach Steve Fisher said. "I don't know (if) he's going to make the 
game. Gerald Ford, a Michigan grad. I guarantee you, he knows everything about 
our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Tied in presidents, 1-1, the teams took to the floor to see who was best. 
</P>
<P>
 The Razorbacks, who start a freshman, two sophomores and two juniors, came out 
tight and missed their first six shots before they calmed down and began 
bringing to bear their 255-pounds-per-man front line and their nine-deep 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas trailed, 8-3, then went on a 20-1 run for a 23-9 lead and the game's 
tone had been set. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richardson wasn't fooled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watched Michigan play on tape," he said. "We knew their background. I 
remember when we were up 14, I thought, 'Wow, we must be doing something 
right.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very good Big Ten team. You can ask Dick Vitale and Billy Packer, 
they'll probably tell you the Big Ten has the best teams. And we think they're 
the smartest people in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 According, then, to the prophecy of Vitale, Packer and whoever else has ever 
said something Richardson didn't like, the Wolverines fought back. 
</P>
<P>
 It took all game but they kept coming, led by junior center Juwan Howard, the 
quiet member of the Fab Four, who would lead all scorers with 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Razorbacks led by as many as 12 points in the second half. The Wolverines 
were within two points at 63-61 with 5:00 left when Michigan's Dugan Fife 
stripped Arkansas' Corey Beck, triggering a three-on-one fast break. 
</P>
<P>
 Jalen Rose, bringing the ball up, took it all the way himself . . . and 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, definitely, I saw my teammates trailing," Rose said later. "But that was 
a three-foot shot that I make 99% of the time. It just didn't go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Either Rose should have passed or that 1% picked a fine time to kick in. The 
Razorbacks drew away again, but Rose, still aching to hit the big shot, 
continued to step up. With 1:04 left, he hit a three-pointer to cut Arkansas' 
lead to 71-68. The Wolverines got the ball back needing a three to tie. Again 
Rose took the shot. Again he missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the flashiest of the Fab Four shot five for 19, which would be a 
disappointing way to end a career that has been consistently colorful, if not 
always efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, personally, it would be selfish to think of myself right now," said 
Rose, a junior who is expected to enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a hard time for Michigan basketball. We've been kind of spoiled in 
Michigan basketball. This is a hard pill to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone else is getting the adulation now. Richardson was selected Naismith 
coach of the year Sunday. Of course, he wondered out loud why he can never win 
coach of the year in his own Southeast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But he laughed as he wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach of the year," he said. "The President comes to the game and hugs you. 
Going to the Final Four. That's one hell of a day, fellas." Midwest Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Blood on the shorts of Michigan's Juwan Howard set off an unusual sequence of 
events toward the end of the game. With Arkansas leading 71-68 and the 
Razorbacks dribbling downcourt, officials whistled play dead with 48 seconds 
left when blood was spotted on Howard's shorts. As Howard neared the Michigan 
bench, he slipped out of shorts, wearing underneath a pair of tight compression 
shorts. Then there was the problem of whose shorts he would wear. He was given 
one pair, but that player had to find someone else's. About three players ended 
up swapping pants before everything was resolved. Makhtar Ndiaye replaced 
Howard for a few seconds.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; FLORIDA REACHES NEW HEIGHTS; 
EAST: GATORS CLIMB LADDER TO THEIR FIRST FINAL FOUR APPEARANCE WITH A 74-66 
VICTORY OVER BOSTON COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Florida forward Dametri Hill . . . Your team just beat Boston College, 74-66, 
in the East Regional final Sunday at Miami Arena. What are you going to do now? 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, I was going to come back in the locker room," said Hill with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, somebody pointed him toward the wooden ladder situated underneath one 
of the baskets, handed him a pair of scissors and told him to snip away. Hill 
did as he was told, but the walk up the steps didn't come naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it was new to me," he said. "Like I said, I didn't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody has to go the Final Four, which is why the third-seeded Gators and 
the 10th-seeded Eagles were playing for a road map to Charlotte and the right 
to face Duke in this Saturday's semifinal game. One way or another, history was 
going to be made and as it turned out, Florida was the one to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since a basketball was dribbled at Gainesville in 1915, the 
Gators (29-7) advanced to the Final Four. In fact, every time the Gators do 
something these days, it sets some sort of record. Most wins in a season . . . 
most fans at a regional final . . . most preseason predictions proven wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really didn't have confidence in us," said point guard Dan Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 They do now. Or at least, they should. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross scored 14 points, but the smartest thing he did was find backcourt mate 
Craig Brown, who usually was positioned just behind the three-point line. Cross 
passed and Brown, as he has done during the Gators' remarkable run, shot away. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown led everyone with 21 points, 15 of them the result of threes. During one 
critical stretch, the Gators down, 56-53, and only 5:11 left to play, Brown hit 
three consecutive three-pointers and also punched the ball from Bill Curley's 
hands just as the Boston College center was ready to attempt a layup. Suddenly, 
the Eagles found themselves down by six with less than 3:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just feeling the shot at the time and my teammates were aware of that," 
said Brown, who wore the remains of the net around his neck. "After that, Dan 
just did a great job of continuing to look for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles trimmed the lead to four points with 27 seconds left, but it didn't 
matter. Boston College (23-11) was forced to foul and the Gators made enough of 
the free throws to keep the margin comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Brown's final three-pointer of the game, the one that gave Florida that 
six-point lead, that frustrated the Eagles the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a big play they called," said Gerrod Abram, who was assigned to 
guard Brown. "We knew what was coming, but it was hard to get over three 
consecutive screens. He just came off (the screen) and let them go. I played 
good defense, had my hands up, but it was just big shots by Craig Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 And missed shots by Boston College. Point guard Malcolm Huckaby, who averages 
10.5 points, didn't score a single field goal. In all, the Eagles shot a 
dreadful 38.5% from the field and were four of 15 (one of 10 in the second 
half) from the three-point line. Against top-ranked North Carolina and later 
Indiana, the Eagles had hit 12 and 10 three-pointers, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Abram kept clanging three-pointers off the rim in the second half, 
Eagle Coach Jim O'Brien didn't seem overly concerned. During a timeout late in 
the game, O'Brien told Abram: "Gerrod, keep shooting them. Those are good 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Good shots, but nothing to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of hard to accept," said Eagle guard Howard Eisley. "We had our 
chances to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Florida converted nearly 51% of its field-goal attempts, a number 
that caused O'Brien to do a double-take when he studied the postgame stat 
sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I felt we guarded them pretty good," said O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators were helped by a career day by center Andrew DeClercq, who made 
eight of 11 shots for 16 points and grabbed 13 rebounds. He said it was his 
best first-half performance of the season. Florida Coach Lon Kruger went one 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 "His best game of the season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the 6-7, 286-pound Hill, who battled Danya Abrams, a 6-7, 
265-pound forward. The earth moved. So did Abrams and Curley, who often bounced 
off the beefy Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same physique as me," said Abrams. "Now I know how other people feel at 
the end of games. He wears people down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators weren't tired. They took turns climbing that wooden ladder and 
peering into a crowd of 15,217, many of whom wore Florida orange and blue. 
</P>
<P>
 First to scale the steps was Cross, who looked over the scene and then planted 
a wet one on the glass backboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting to get to that ladder for 20 years now," said Cross, who is 
22. "It's just a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
 Kruger, who coached Kansas State to within a victory of the Final Four in 
1987, later made the same trip up the ladder. When he was done, he placed the 
net over Brown's head. 
</P>
<P>
 At celebration's end, the Gators returned to the locker room, where Kruger 
noticed something amiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "You forgot to cut down the other net," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown to his coach: "We're new to this."

DUCKS BEAT FLYERS IN OVERTIME, 3-2; HOCKEY: VALK SCORES HIS SECOND GOAL OF THE 
GAME AFTER ONLY 24 SECONDS OF THE EXTRA PERIOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The game was tense and tightly played, and after two periods, it was still 
scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
 And for most of the Mighty Ducks' 3-2 overtime victory over the Philadelphia 
Flyers at the Spectrum on Sunday night, Guy Hebert was facing the out-of-town 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw the San Jose Sharks trailing St. Louis by two goals, then one, then 
tied. He saw waves of Flyers swooping in on him. Eric Lindros, Mark Recchi, Rod 
Brind'Amour. He saw the Ducks' leading scorer, Bob Corkum, leave the ice late 
in the third period, his season over after a skate blade cut a tendon on top of 
his right foot near the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 And shortly before the Flyers forced overtime after rookie Mikael Renberg's 
35th goal of the season at 17:16 of the third, Hebert saw that San Jose had 
won. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouldn't have looked, but I did," Hebert said. "I saw it was a 4-3 final. 
That made the two points even bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert had already stopped 29 shots, and he got ready for overtime, hoping to 
keep the Ducks from falling another point or even two behind the Sharks in what 
could be the last gasps of a playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
 Turned out he didn't have to face another shot. Garry Valk ended it only 24 
seconds into the extra period by jumping on a rebound and lifting the puck high 
on Philadelphia goalie Frederic Chabot for his second goal of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great way to gut out a win," said Coach Ron Wilson, whose team would 
have fallen 10 points back with eight games left if it had lost, but instead 
trails San Jose by eight points for the final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Valk scored the winner on a goal assisted by rookie John Lilley, a small but 
hard-hitting forward who signed with the Ducks after playing for the U.S. 
Olympic team at Lillehammer and was playing in only his fifth NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
 Valk had also scored the goal that gave the Ducks a 2-1 lead at 8:09 of the 
third, on a 50-foot slap shot that was partially deflected by goalie Dominic 
Roussel before it found its way into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum got his 51st and apparently final point of the season with the assist 
after angling a pass across the neutral zone to Valk, but Lilley helped make 
the play by preventing Philadelphia from holding the puck in the zone with a 
big hit and knocking the puck out. That assist was his first NHL point, but he 
would have another before the game was done. 
</P>
<P>
 Valk's first goal chased Roussel, who had held the Ducks scoreless through two 
periods, only to give up two weak goals in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flyers -- also trying to avoid elimination from the playoffs -- scored the 
game's first goal at 1:55 of the third when Al Conroy picked up the rebound 
after Hebert's skate save on Rob DiMaio, then put it past Hebert. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks tied the score at 6:04 when Peter Douris' harmless-looking shot 
from the right circle got past Roussel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was definitely baffled," Douris said. "It was a bad angle, but I didn't 
have a lot on that shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert had kept the Ducks in it that long, and in the third period, they 
finally got some goals for him. In the first, they had a mere two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guy's right back on his game," said Wilson, who had benched his starter three 
games in a row, but now has played him three in a row -- including back-to-back 
games Saturday and Sunday. He didn't make the decision to send Hebert out 
instead of Mikhail Shtalenkov until the team was flying from Hartford to 
Philadelphia after beating the Whalers on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guy's always talking to us about letting him go back-to-back, so we said on 
the flight, if you feel you're physically capable, OK." 
</P>
<P>
 He was capable, and he got some help from some big plays. Bobby Dollas stopped 
a 3-0 rush in the second with a desperation play, hitting Recchi's stick enough 
to poke away the puck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked back and saw Lindros, Recchi and Renberg, and said, 'Geez, I've got 
to get back,' " Dollas said. "Guy played good for us, and tonight we showed a 
lot of character." Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Center Bob Corkum is expected to undergo surgery on his right foot today to 
repair a tendon that is at least 75% severed. Center Anatoli Semenov, who has 
been sidelined because of a sore left elbow and left hamstring, might return to 
replace Corkum. Otherwise, Jarrod Skalde probably will be recalled from San 
Diego. . . . Left wing Stu Grimson sat out a second consecutive game because of 
a gash on his right hand.

MORNING BRIEFING: TIGER FANS FENDING OFF A SHACK ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Ilitch, who owns the Detroit Tigers, wants to build a new stadium, 
abandoning Tiger Stadium, a site for baseball in the city since 1900. 
</P>
<P>
 His plan is opposed by the Tiger Stadium Fan Club, prompting Detroit Manager 
Sparky Anderson to say:  
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you something. Those people who want to preserve Tiger Stadium 
and keep it for their grandchildren have lost their marbles. If they had to 
live or work in someplace new and modern, or some old and rundown shack, where 
do you suppose they would want to live? 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't be no rundown shack." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What is George Raveling's NCAA tournament record as a coach at 
Washington State, Iowa and USC? 
</P>
<P>
 More madness: The Saturday event attracted 50,000 spectators and it was seen 
by an estimated 150 million television viewers in more than 20 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 140th renewal of "The Boat Race," the traditional rowing 
competition between Cambridge and Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cambridge won by 6 1/2 lengths, Cambridge Boat Club President Jon 
Bernstein of Bloomfield, Mich., said ecstatically: "This is 'March Madness' -- 
I'll never forget it. It beats hoops." 
</P>
<P>
 Premature analysis: Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe had apparently soured 
on Boston College Coach Jim O'Brien before the NCAA tournament began.  
</P>
<P>
 "As he prepares for the NCAA tournament, O'Brien is again twisting in the 
wind," Shaughnessy wrote. "Critics say he hasn't gotten enough out of the Fab 
Four. Not tough enough. Too nice. Not a great coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Good enough, however, to get his team to the Final Eight before losing to 
Florida, 74-66, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Air ball analysis: And now this pre-tournament comment from Dan Barreiro of 
the Star Tribune of Minneapolis on Duke: " . . . The Blue Devils are not Final 
Four material. Their guards are too soft and too slow, which is why the superb 
Grant Hill has to spend so much time back there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ho hum, Duke is in the Final Four again. 
</P>
<P>
 Dream course: An excerpt from "The Rules of Golf", according to the Bad 
Golfers Assn: -- Movable hazards: All movable hazards should be removed. These 
include dogs, cattle and people. Trees are also a movable hazard if you have a 
chain saw in your bag. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Out of bounds: There is no out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Raveling is 2-6: 1-2 at Washington State, 0-2 at Iowa and 1-2 
at USC.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under Magic Johnson, the Lakers beat the Milwaukee Bucks by nine points Sunday 
night at the Forum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Under Randy Pfund, the Lakers beat the Bucks by 22 March 7 at Milwaukee. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 But don't get down on Coach Johnson. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He just might have a future if the Lakers play with as much intensity and 
intelligence as they did in his debut before garbage time began early in the 
second quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This is a good Final Four mix -- a No. 1-seeded team (Arkansas), a regular 
(Duke), a stranger (Florida), and a team that hasn't won by fewer than 12 
points in the tournament (Arizona). . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If you think comparative scores are important, you have to like Arizona's 
chances to upset Arkansas Saturday at Charlotte. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas had trouble putting away Michigan, 76-68, before a pro-Razorback 
crowd at Dallas Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona whipped Michigan, 119-95, at Tucson on Dec. 30. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Razorbacks deserve to be favored. They are young, but physical 
and quick, well-balanced, and packed with potential NBA draft choices. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Krzyzewski bringing Duke to seven Final Fours in nine years is one of the 
greatest coaching achievements ever in sports. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Switch coaches and I guarantee you that North Carolina would be in Charlotte 
this week and Duke wouldn't. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom has a team had three guards the caliber of Arizona's Khalid Reeves, 
Damon Stoudamire and Reggie Geary. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It would be unwise to overlook Geary's contributions. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The quick sophomore from Mater Dei High was a defensive wizard at the Sports 
Arena, offering weakside help against Louisville center Clifford Rozier 
Thursday and blanketing Missouri guard Melvin Booker Saturday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad President Clinton didn't try to hide the fact that he was rooting for 
Arkansas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fifth consecutive year that the Big East, which had three teams in 
1985, will not be represented in the Final Four. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Remember when Marcus Allen, Vinny Testaverde, Ty Detmer, Desmond Howard and 
Gino Torretta, among others, lost games after winning the Heisman Trophy? Well, 
Glenn Robinson of Purdue and Lisa Leslie of USC were announced as winners of 
the Naismith Awards the morning after their teams were eliminated from the NCAA 
tournament. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What this tournament has lacked is a buzzer beater. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I can't remember one with fewer tight finishes or controversy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Most exciting comeback was Syracuse's that tied Missouri in regulation 
Thursday at the Sports Arena before the Tigers won going away in overtime. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Florida forward Dametri Hill would have made a hell of a defensive tackle for 
Steve Spurrier. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Purdue's women showed a lot more poise beating Stanford at Maples Pavilion on 
Saturday night than the men did losing to Duke a few hours earlier. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The three-point basket is so commonplace that announcers should always say 
that a team trailing by two points and in possession of the ball has a chance 
to go ahead. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to host USC for staging a smooth West Regional at the Sports Arena. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The 62 points Askia Jones of Kansas State scored in 28 minutes against Fresno 
State in an National Invitation Tournament game last week translates to 106 
points in 48 minutes, six more than Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 
Warriors scored against the New York Knicks on March 2, 1962.. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: New York Knick forward Charles Smith and Syracuse guard Lawrence 
Moten. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones will live to regret it if he lets Jimmy 
Johnson get away. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's first NFL telecast will be the San Francisco-Denver exhibition Aug. 12 
at Candlestick Park. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former bantamweight champion Albert Davila has done a fine job training 
unbeaten junior-welterweight David Kamau, who headlines the Forum card tonight. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 This probably will be remembered as the year that Wayne Gretzky broke Gordie 
Howe's goal-scoring record but failed to reach the playoffs for the first time 
in his career. . . . Black Coaches Assn. member George Raveling on the 
agreement brokered by the Dept. of Justice that sets a framework for increased 
dialogue between the coaches and the NCAA: "We've proved that we just weren't a 
bunch of people running around shouting and hollering."

<P>
 Glenn Robinson, the nation's leading scorer and Naismith college player of the 
year, indicated Sunday that he will stay at Purdue for his senior season rather 
than turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's hard to turn down money like that, but the money will be there 
when I want to leave," Robinson told CBS after being selected the Naismith 
Award winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who led the nation with a 30.3 scoring average, would probably have 
been the No. 1 pick in the June 29 NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robinson said that is not much of a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if I was the No. 1 pick now, then maybe I could be the No. 1 pick next 
year because, hopefully, my game will improve," he said with a laugh.

 Terzian held onto her first-run lead despite twisting her left knee about 
halfway through her second run.

 After posting a two-run time of 1 minute 20.99 seconds, she said she may have 
damaged the anterior cruciate ligament in her knee.

 The University of Maine athletic eligibility scandal continued to unfold, as

Orenduff. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest assertions came from Anne R. McCoy, an associate athletic director 
who also charged last week that Athletic Director Michael Ploszek planned to 
conceal eligibility problems from the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy was quoted by the newspaper Sunday Sun-Journal of Lewiston as saying 
that Stanley Tupper, a former congressman called in to investigate the matter, 
was using a tape recorder as he interviewed her, but that when she began making 
the allegation that Ploszek had told her he planned to conceal the infractions, 
Tupper shut off the recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "He turned around and shut it off," McCoy told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not true," Tupper said. "I don't want to be quoted as calling anyone 
a liar, but she was not taped." Soccer

LEADER AOKI DISQUALIFIED; WARGO WINS SANDERS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Isao Aoki, the second-round leader of the Doug Sanders Classic senior 
tournament at Kingwood, Tex., was disqualified Sunday for inadvertently 
breaking an obscure rule on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese golfer was informed of his disqualification after the second hole 
Sunday, when he still held a one-stroke lead over Tom Wargo.Wargo went on to 
shoot a par 72 and win the tournament by one stroke over Bob Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki's problem Saturday came on the par-four ninth hole when his ball was 
temporarily lost beneath the lip of a bunker. Players and caddies made numerous 
footprints in the sand before finding the ball. Before taking a one-shot 
penalty drop, Aoki's caddie raked the drop area. That was a two-stroke penalty 
because it improved Aoki's lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki then signed his incorrect scorecard at the end of the round, leading to 
the disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki said he didn't realize he was breaking a rule. He said several others 
told him it was OK to rake the area. "I misunderstood. I didn't know the rule," 
he said. "But it was my mistake. I'll follow the rules."

CASE OF BUTTERFLY MARS OTHERWISE PERFECT DAY; GOLF: NORMAN SHOOTS ANOTHER 67 TO 
FINISH 24 UNDER AND WIN THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP BY FOUR STROKES OVER ZOELLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although he failed to complete another bogey-free round, Greg Norman played 
yet another round of excellent golf Sunday, closing with a five-under 67 to win 
the Players Championship at Ponte Vedra, Fla., by four strokes over Fuzzy 
Zoeller. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third consecutive round, Norman set a scoring record on the home 
course of the PGA Tour, the TPC at Sawgrass, a course once cursed by players 
for its difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 But Norman, taking advantage of what he called soft conditions, turned the TPC 
at Sawgrass into his personal plaything. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the tournament with a 63 and set course records at 130 for 36 holes 
and 197 for 54. His final round produced a total of 24-under 264, six shots 
better than the course record set by Nick Price last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman ranked the runaway, wire-to-wire victory "very high" among his 66 
career victories around the world. And the timing couldn't be better. "It's a 
very important win for me, playing like I did and going into Augusta," he said. 
The Masters is April 7-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman had only one complaint Sunday. "I've never gone through 72 holes 
without making a bogey," he said. "That was my goal today." 
</P>
<P>
 His only bogey of the week came Sunday on the par-three 13th, where he missed 
the green. 
</P>
<P>
 He chipped to about eight feet and was standing over that par putt when a 
butterfly fluttered across his line. He didn't flinch or back away, but missed 
to the left.

WOMEN; VANDERVEER ISN'T TIMID AFTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 This much is sure about Stanford women's basketball Coach Tara VanDerveer: she 
shoots straight from the hip. 
</P>
<P>
 After Purdue defeated Stanford, 82-65, Saturday night in Maples Pavilion in 
the NCAA West Region final to advance to the NCAA final four, VanDerveer sized 
up the four teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Purdue can play with anyone, and I think North Carolina is in 
trouble," VanDerveer said. "I predict it will be Louisiana Tech and Purdue for 
the championship. Flip a coin for that one." 
</P>
<P>
 First, Purdue (29-4) must get past East Regional champion North Carolina 
(31-2) and Mideast Region champion Louisiana Tech (30-3) will have to get past 
Midwest Region champion Alabama (26-6) in the national semifinals on April 2 at 
Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Many coaches would have hesitated to make such predictions for fear of 
alienating fellow coaches. Not VanDerveer. 
</P>
<P>
 VanDerveer has led Stanford to seven consecutive NCAA tournament appearances, 
including national titles in 1990 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Key for this season's Stanford team were its post players, 6-foot-5 Anita 
Kaplan and 6-3 Rachel Hemmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why shoot the water pistol when you've got a cannon?" VanDerveer said earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But against Purdue, Hemmer and Kaplan got in foul trouble, Hemmer fouling out 
with 1:58 to play. Stanford (25-6) could not recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemmer led the Cardinal with 17 points and Kaplan had 12 points and a 
game-high 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Leslie Johnson scored 14 points for the Boilermakers, about five 
points below her average, against the Cardinal's man-to-man defense. Purdue 
guard Jennifer Jacoby picked up the slack, scoring a game-high 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal trailed by three points, 56-53, with 4:43 remaining when the 
Boilermakers pulled away. Johnson scored four points to lead Purdue on a 6-0 
run over the next 1:09 to make the score 62-53.

SHE'S THE LATEST EARLEY TO STAY ON BOARD; DIVING: ARIKA FOLLOWS HER FAMILY'S 
TRADITION TO BECOME A STANDOUT DIVER FOR MISSION VIEJO HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With bloodlines like hers, what else was Arika Earley going to do? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was always the thing to do," said Earley, the defending Southern Section 
Division I diving champion who has rarely strayed from a diving board in 17 
years. "I grew up hanging around the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Home at the Earleys was an ongoing conversation that centered around 
springboards, multiple back somersaults and degrees of difficulty. Earley, a 
junior at Mission Viejo High, has a former Olympian and USC coach for a father 
(Rick), the UC Irvine coach for a mother (Conni), an NCAA champion for a 
brother (USC's Brian) and another diving sibling, a sister who dives in 
television commercials (Wendy, also a former USC diver). 
</P>
<P>
 Arika, the youngest of the Earley clan, wasn't about to break with tradition. 
She inherited her family's love of the sport, and the talented gene pool that 
accompanied it. 
</P>
<P>
 Earley was so young when she first started competing, she had to have family 
members fill out her meet sheets. And she remembers meets where older divers 
would toss her up like a rag doll on sleeping bags while meet announcers would 
beg them to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the natural thing to do," she continued. "I did quit for a while when 
I was 10, 11, and tried all these other sports. It was quite a shock to the 
family, but my mom supported me." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before Earley tired of track -- she high jumped -- volleyball, 
softball and dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a horrible dancer," she said with a laugh. "The (other sports) were 
fun, but I missed diving." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure of keeping the family tradition of excellence alive, is sometimes 
too much for a young family member. But Arika doesn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I could have been successful in something else, like volleyball," she 
said. "But this is where I belong." 
</P>
<P>
 The sport would probably concur. According to her club coach, Hongping Li of 
the Mission Viejo Nadadores, Earley is one of the strongest one-meter 
springboard divers around. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of strength, she's one of the most powerful in her age group," Li 
said. "At the senior level, she's very athletic and has an extremely high 
vertical jump, which helps her." 
</P>
<P>
 What she doesn't have is the grace of a gazelle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to do with God-given talent," he said. "And you can't have everything. 
She has strength, but not a lot of grace." 
</P>
<P>
 But Li believes she has the proper tools to finish in the top four places at 
this weekend's Zone D Diving Championships, being hosted by the Nadadores. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a qualifying meet for this summer's senior nationals and is an 
especially crucial meet for Earley because it's her first meet of the season 
and because she has made a bad habit of barely missing a qualifying spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last three years, I've missed qualifying by a place or a point," she 
said. "It's been hard." 
</P>
<P>
 She is determined to make the cut this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I make seniors, that would be great," she said. "I'm putting a lot of 
pressure on myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Which, Earley said, isn't always a good idea: "Sometimes when I'm under a lot 
of pressure, I fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Li doesn't anticipate Earley falling apart and believes she can finish in the 
top four, but he does wish she had better practices in preparation for this 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Li said Earley sometimes loses focus because her mind is miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, she's on schedule in terms of her progress," he said. "But she has 
had a tough year training. She hasn't been training as well as expected. She 
realizes this. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's struggling a bit because there are distractions in her life. At her 
age, there are a lot of different things that draw you away from what you need 
to be focused on. It happens to a lot of girls. Once she's focused on what she 
wants to do, she'll be hard to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Li believes when Earley gets her focus back fully, she can be as successful as 
her father and brother. "It depends on how much she wants to succeed," he said. 
"But she loves diving, and she's very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 But Earley isn't looking ahead to NCAA championship and Olympic berths just 
yet. She wants to have good junior and senior seasons to attract college 
recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early, but I'd like to stay in California, maybe Berkeley or 
Pepperdine," said Earley, who doesn't feel the desire to flee the area and the 
family name. "Besides, if I wanted to do that, I'd have to leave the country." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Earley is eager to start competition. An athlete of Earley's 
temperament needs to be tested to stay motivated, Li said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She needs some sort of feedback to tell her how well she's doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next week and throughout the summer, Earley will get plenty of 
tests, including the section meet in May, where she will attempt to defend her 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mission Viejo's only diver, Earley is happy to contribute valuable points 
toward the Diablos' shot at the section title, but she feels ill at ease 
describing herself as the defending section champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time I won anything in a long time," she said. "It was 
exciting, fun. It's a weird thing though, to think about defending my title."

MAGIC WANTS PART-OWNERSHIP TO STAY AS COACH; PRO BASKETBALL: LAKER OWNER JERRY

 Owning a piece of the Lakers will be one of the conditions for Magic Johnson 
to return as coach next season, Johnson's agent, Lon Rosen said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Rosen said he and Johnson are not using that "as a bargaining chip" 
with team owner Jerry Buss and emphasized that all of their past conversations 
with Buss regarding Johnson buying part of the team have been cordial and on a 
"when you're ready" basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't want a deal where it's 'Here's a little percentage of the team.' 
He doesn't mind spending the money," Rosen said. "Jerry Buss has always been 
very fair to him. . . . Jerry has always stated publicly he wants his kids (to 
inherit the team). We won't be talking about this really until the season is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen said Buss was aware that Johnson's return might be contingent upon a 
part-ownership agreement being reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss said Sunday that Johnson has a standing offer to buy part of the 
franchise, but the two have not recently discussed how large a percentage 
Johnson would purchase or when he would exercise that option. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss said the offer has existed "for at least a year and a half, or two 
years," but without specific terms. Buss owes Johnson $17 million, including 
the last contract Johnson signed before retiring for the second time in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lakers are a very high-price franchise and what he wanted to do was get 
in on the ground floor in a different situation," Buss said, referring to 
Johnson's failed attempt to secure an expansion team in Toronto last year. "A 
couple of different opportunities passed . . . I don't have to tell him again. 
He knows it's there. If he's ready for that, he'll tell me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers have been valued at $150-175 million in financial publications. 
Rosen said he has seen the team valued from $175-$250 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss said his past conversations with Johnson concerning ownership had been 
casual and did not zero in on how much of the team Buss would be sell.  
</P>
<P>
 Buss, who did not attend Johnson's news conference Wednesday, was a happy 
spectator Sunday at the Forum for Johnson's triumphant coaching debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, it's been sensational," he said. "I can't think of any better way to 
start. This is a very special time in my life as a basketball owner. I always 
considered (appointing Johnson coach) but he never thought he was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he wanted to step in in the middle of the season, but I pointed 
out all the positives. I then had to push him and it finally got down to asking 
him for a favor."

HEART ATTACK CLAIMS CIF'S FAGANS AT 84 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenneth J. Fagans, a longtime commissioner of the organization that oversees 
Southern California high school sports, died of a heart attack Saturday at Hoag 
Hospital in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagans, a 30-year resident of Balboa Island, was 84. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the commissioner of the California Interscholastic Federation Southern 
Section office from 1951 until he retired in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 In his time, the Southern Section grew from 218 to more than 458 high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagans was born in Detroit in 1909 and moved to California with his family in 
1923. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a standout basketball player at Huntington Park High School and earned 
all-state honors as a senior center in 1927. Huntington Park won a Southern 
Section title that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagans went to Oregon State, where he was the leading scorer on the freshman 
team. For the next three seasons, he played in every varsity game. Fagans was 
president of his senior class in 1932 at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagans coached basketball at Compton High School from 1947 to 1953. He led his 
team to two Southern Section titles and his teams won 53 consecutive games 
between 1950 and 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by Norma, his wife of 52 years, two sons and his sister.

NBA ROUNDUP; KNICKS DEFEAT MAGIC FOR 13TH CONSECUTIVE WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Knicks are feeling pretty good about themselves these days, and 
with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks ran their winning streak to 13 games Sunday with a 111-90 rout of 
the Orlando Magic, their closest competitor in the Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing extremely well right now," said Knick center Patrick Ewing, who 
led all scorers at Orlando with 31 points and had 11 rebounds and five blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is contributing something," Ewing said. "I thought Charles Oakley 
did a great job getting us a lead in the first half and Anthony Bonner gave us 
a big lift in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal scored 30 points and had 16 rebounds for Orlando, which made 
only one serious run at New York in the game. The Magic cut a 21-point deficit 
to six, 79-73, with 18 seconds left in the third quarter, but a 16-1 run by the 
Knicks put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando came into the game as the second-best shooting team in the NBA, but 
the Knicks held them to 43%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks scored 29 points off Orlando's 17 turnovers while the Magic could 
get only seven points from New York's seven turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 New York was ahead throughout except for 25 seconds early in the first 
quarter. The Knicks had an eight-point lead by the end of the first period and 
stretched it to 15 before Ewing finally found the range. He didn't score in the 
first 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 113, Houston 98 -- Charles Barkley and Cedric Ceballos scored 20 
points each and Kevin Johnson had 15 points and 15 assists at Phoenix as the 
Suns qualified for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston's chances of coming back suffered a major setback when Hakeem Olajuwon 
was ejected midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon, who had 21 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks, spoke to referee 
Bill Spooner after Dan Majerle scored following an offensive rebound. Spooner 
reacted by sending the center to the showers. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 124, Philadelphia 122 -- Dino Radja scored 36 points and grabbed 11 
rebounds at Hartford, Conn., as the Celtics won in overtime to extend the 
76ers' losing streak to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Brown gave the Celtics a three-point lead on a jumper with 46 seconds 
remaining in overtime left and then Johnny Dawkins' tip-in narrowed the lead to 
123-122 with two-tenths of a second left. Brown was fouled on the inbounds pass 
and made the second of two free throws. The 76ers couldn't get a shot off on 
their last possession. 
</P>
<P>
 The game might have marked Boston's last regular-season appearance at the 
Hartford Civic Center, the team's home-away-from home since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a month, representatives of the team and the Civic Center have 
had discussions concerning a contract extension. The outcome of the talks won't 
be known until at least July. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 107, Portland 95 -- David Robinson, in foul trouble and cold from 
the field in the first half, scored 20 of his 36 points in the third quarter to 
lead the Spurs at Portland.  
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs, who moved into a virtual tie with Houston atop the Midwest 
Division, used a 10-1 run midway through the third period to take control. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 111, Detroit 99 -- Gerald Wilkins scored 28 points and Tyrone Hill 
grabbed 13 rebounds to pace the Cavaliers at Richfield, Ohio.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: UCLA'S REES MAKES UNEXPECTED MOVE TO NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A funny thing happened to former UCLA assistant football coach Bill Rees 
recently on his way to Lawrence, Kan., to begin a new job as recruiting 
coordinator at Kansas: He wound up back home in Manhattan Beach as the new West 
Coast scout for the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 years as the architect of UCLA's nationally recognized football 
recruiting success, Rees, a Chicago native, had agreed to take a similar 
position at Kansas. He booked a flight to Kansas City for Sunday, March 17, and 
was set to begin his new job the next day. Then, just before leaving his office 
at UCLA for the final time March 15, the Chiefs called and Rees fulfilled a 
goal of working for a National Football League team. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to establishing the Bruins as a recruiting power, regularly 
competing for (and signing) players against Notre Dame, Michigan, Ohio State 
and Texas, Rees was in charge of all in-state evaluations for the program. 
Before the start of last season, more players from UCLA appeared on NFL rosters 
(38) than from any other school in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Among current NFL players Rees signed during his tenure at UCLA were Troy 
Aikman and Frank Cornish (Dallas), Mike Lodish (Buffalo), Eric Ball 
(Cincinnati), Carlton Gray (Seattle), David Richards (Detroit), Kevin Williams 
(Green Bay), plus former pros Mel and Mike Farr and a probable first-round 
draft choice from the current Bruin roster, junior tackle Jonathan Ogden. 
</P>
<P>
 Rees said the rules changes adopted by the NCAA in recent years to limit 
recruiting and the evaluation process has limited the ability of college 
football coaches to make accurate judgments before signing players. There are 
tighter restrictions on in-person evaluations, telephone calls and campus 
visits. Thus, most recruiting coordinators now spend more time watching game 
film than games. It is the games -- the UCLA games, that is -- that Rees will 
miss most. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA was always a dream school to be associated with," Rees said. "I was 
fortunate to be part of perhaps the best era in UCLA football history, with an 
opportunity to work for one of the great coaches in college football, Terry 
Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'll miss most is the UCLA-USC rivalry -- the great games, the great 
players, the intensity and the atmosphere. It's the best rivalry in the 
country." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has completed its football recruiting with the signing of cornerback 
Aaron Roques (6-0, 180). Roques was a standout at Canyon Springs High in Moreno 
Valley three years ago, attracting attention from a number of colleges, 
including UCLA, before he signed a letter of intent with Nevada. However, he 
opted for professional baseball instead of college football. Last year, Roques, 
an outfielder, hit .165 in 32 games for Peoria, Ariz., a rookie league team in 
the San Diego Padres' organization. Before signing with UCLA, Roques turned 
down scholarship offers from California, San Diego State and Nevada Las Vegas, 
among others. The Bruins' incoming class now totals 18 players, including two 
community college transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoop report: Jelani Gardner, Bellflower St. John Bosco's heavily recruited 6-6 
point guard, will announce his college choice April 15, two days after the 
spring signing period begins. Gardner has narrowed his list to three schools: 
UCLA, Arkansas and Cal. He leaves Tuesday for New York, where he will play in 
the McDonald's All-American high school basketball game Sunday at St. John's 
University. Gardner was one of two California players selected for the game; 
the other was Duke signee Rick Price, a 6-5 guard from Gardena Serra. Gardner 
and Price will also play in Magic Johnson's high school all-star game April 10 
in Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Add UCLA: The Bruins are also recruiting two other standout players: Brandon 
Jessie, the 6-5, 215-pound forward from Edison High and Ventura College who was 
voted the California community college co-player of the year, and Jerod Ward, a 
6-8 forward from Clinton, Miss., who is the consensus choice among coaches and 
talent evaluators as the nation's No. 1 prospect. Jessie is considering Duke, 
Arizona State, Georgetown, Nevada Las Vegas and UCLA. Ward, a shooter with 
unlimited range, took an unofficial trip to Mississippi last weekend. He has 
also visited UCLA (his cousin, Annett Buckner, plays volleyball for the Bruins) 
and Cal, and taken another unofficial trip to Ohio State (he has relatives in 
that area, too). In addition, Ward may visit Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, with two scholarships available, is hoping to sign 6-6 swingman Joe 
Zaletel, an excellent shooter from El Camino College who averaged 28.2 points 
last season, second-best in the state behind Darryle Flicking (29.4) of 
Riverside. Zaletel, a sophomore from Torrance High who also attended Harbor 
College, has visited USC and Arizona State, and may take trips to Hawaii and 
Washington State. Kansas has also expressed some interest in Zaletel . . . Add 
Kansas: The Jayhawks, who tried hard to get Price before he signed with Duke, 
have received a verbal commitment from 6-4 guard Billy Thomas of Shreveport, 
La. 
</P>
<P>
 Another community college standout, 6-4 shooting guard Tes Whitlock of 
Saddleback, is considering New Mexico State, Long Beach State and Pepperdine, 
among others. Whitlock, from Loara High, played one season at Arizona State 
before he encountered academic difficulties and transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the top high school guard prospects in Southern California, 6-3 Jamie 
Gillin of Compton Dominguez and 6-1 Paul Pickett of Wilmington Banning, may be 
close to announcing their college choices. Gillin will probably sign with 
Washington State, while Pickett, if he qualifies academically, will likely 
attend George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., which is coached by former 
Lakers and Loyola Marymount Coach Paul Westhead. Another Southland guard, 6-1 
Sam Turks of Inglewood, recently gave a verbal commitment to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Pac-10: Cal Coach Todd Bozeman's reputation as a recruiter continues to 
grow. Bozeman has apparently persuaded 6-11 center-forward Eric Lee of 
Indianola, Miss., to take a recruiting trip to Berkeley. Lee made a verbal 
commitment in January to Nevada Las Vegas, but is reconsidering his decision 
and might also visit Mississippi.

<P>
 The Angels, deciding they must look outside the organization for a starting 
second baseman, are focusing their attention on Harold Reynolds of the San 
Diego Padres and Bill Spiers of the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi would not confirm or deny his interest in 
Reynolds and Spiers, but said that a trade could be consummated as early as 
today.The Angels, who had an organizational meeting Sunday night in which they 
decided to option pitcher Russ Springer to triple-A Vancouver and release 
reliever Lee Guetterman, remain divided whether Reynolds or Spiers would be 
best-suited for their needs. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With eight days remaining before opening day, Sunday was the first hint of 
anything going right for the Angels (4-18). They snapped their second nine-game 
losing streak of the spring with a 15-6 victory over the Seattle Mariners, and 
found a fourth starter in the process. John Dopson, who yielded nine hits and 
three earned runs in seven innings, was announced as the Angels' fourth 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson guaranteed his platoon job in left field Sunday, going three for 
three with four RBIs, hitting a double and three-run homer. Jackson is batting 
.372 this spring with a team-high three homers and 13 RBIs. Instead of being 
used exclusively as a platoon player in left field, Rodgers said that Jackson 
will bat primarily against breaking-ball pitchers while Dwight Smith faces 
mostly fastball pitchers. . . . J.T. Snow went three for five, including a 
double and home run, and had three RBIs Sunday. . . . Angel starter Chuck 
Finley awoke with a stiff neck and is expected to miss the next two or three 
games. Mark Leiter, who's vying along with Brian Anderson for the fifth 
starter's job, will start today against the Mariners. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Baltimore first baseman David Segui, who started 127 games last season but was

Rafael Palmeiro, was traded to the New York Mets for two minor leaguers, 
pitcher Tom Wegmann and shortstop Kevin Baez. . . . Baltimore pitcher Sid 
Fernandez, sidelined with bursitis in his left should, has been given the 
go-ahead to start throwing again. . . . The Braves placed reliever Gregg Olson 
on the 15-day disabled list because of a strained right elbow. . . . Michael 
Jordan, two days after suffering a knee injury, went one for five for Chicago's 
Class-A Prince William team in a 5-4 victory over Pittsburgh's Class-A Salem 
team. In four minor league games, he is three for 15 with two stolen bases and

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; SNYDER: DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME

 Cory Snyder, sidelined all spring with back and rib cage injuries, made his 
spring debut in a minor league game Sunday, and homered. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, who has seen his right field job seized by rookie Raul Mondesi while 
Snyder recovered from the injuries, has not yet appeared with the major league 
team and is not scheduled to travel to Ft. Lauderdale today for the Dodgers' 
game against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the most frustrating part is not even getting a chance to fight for 
the job," Snyder said Sunday. "I know I had two good seasons and I felt that it 
was my job to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get injured, he goes out and has a good spring, and that was it. It 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, who hopes to play a utility role for the Dodgers similar to the one he 
played for the Giants two years ago, said he plans on being ready for opening 
day. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the Dodgers' 4-3 loss to the Atlanta Braves and John Smoltz at Vero Beach, 
Fla., Mondesi had his nine-game hitting streak ended. But Mondesi recorded two 
more assists from right field Sunday, including an impressive throw from the 
right-center wall that caught Tony Tarasco trying to slide in for a double. The 
other assist came on a bloop that landed in front of Mondesi, who threw to 
force out Terry Pendleton going from first to second. . . . The team announced 
that it will bring 38 players west for the beginning of the Freeway Series -- 
33 of the players working with the major league team (including rookie pitchers 
Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort) and five players who will make the trip to 
Los Angeles before heading to their minor league assignments. . . . Left-handed 
reliever Drew Hall was reassigned from the major league camp to the minor 
league camp. TIM KAWAKAMI

SANTA ANITA; SAN LUIS REY IS A PIECE OF CAKE FOR BIEN BIEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Anita staged a brief but lucrative 39th birthday party for Chris 
McCarron on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bash was called the $262,000 San Luis Rey Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 All McCarron had to do to pick up his 10% of the winner's share of $149,500 
was guide Bien Bien in the right direction against four outclassed opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Never far off the slow pace being set by Navire, Bien Bien, the 3-10 favorite, 
took charge with about a quarter of a mile to run and coasted home by 5 1/2 
lengths in 2:26 3/5 for the 1 1/2 miles on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the eighth victory in 24 starts for the 5-year-old Manila horse and 
pushed his earnings past $2 million for owners Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Grade I race, the San Juan Capistrano on April 24, would seem to be 
his for the taking before Santa Anita concludes its winter meeting, but trainer 
Paco Gonzalez said he might rest Bien Bien until the Hollywood Turf Handicap on 
May 30, a race he won last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're leaning to that race (as) opposed to the San Juan Capistrano, but we 
don't know," Gonzalez said. "We'll see. 
</P>
<P>
 "He trained beautifully for this race and it was fortunate that we got a firm 
turf course. It was like a workout, really, I guess this is one of the easiest 
races he's won." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron was happy to be back aboard after skipping the horse's last three 
races because of suspensions and a commitment to Hill Pass in the Santa Anita 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 "That sucker is an iron horse," McCarron said. "This was testimony to how well 
Paco keeps this horse conditioned. He's run hard and often this winter (four 
times), and he's still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse doesn't cheat at any time anymore. He's out there giving 110% 
every time he runs and to (have) him over fresh every time he runs is a 
difficult job." 
</P>
<P>
 Navire, the reluctant pacesetter in a race devoid of front-runners after the 
scratch of Fanmore, held second, a neck in front of Grand Flotilla. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Four Santa Anita Derby candidates worked Sunday morning at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Second in the San Felipe Stakes in his 1994 debut eight days ago, Brocco went 
five furlongs in 1:02 3/5 under Gary Stevens. Strodes Creek worked a mile in 
1:38 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous, who, like Strodes Creek, is trained by Charlie Whittingham, worked a 
mile in 1:38 2/5. Robannier, well-beaten in the Florida Derby in his last 
start, went the same distance in 1:41 3/5 for trainer Mel Stute. Horse Racing 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 King's Blade, an easy winner of the Bolsa Chica in his California debut for 
trainer Richard Mandella, was among eight 3-year-olds entered for Wednesday's 
$82,125 Baldwin Stakes at about 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf. . . . There were a 
total of 21 claims in Sunday's seventh race, a $16,000 claimer. Fourteen of the 
claims were for Color Me Speed, who finished third. Ron Ellis won the shake.

MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP; EARNHARDT EASILY SCORES NINTH DARLINGTON VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dale Earnhardt, the six-time and defending NASCAR Winston Cup champion, 
overpowered the field Sunday while winning the TranSouth Financial 400 at 
Darlington (S.C.) Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, who won this race a year ago when it was 500 miles, led 10 times 
for 166 of the 292 laps, including the final 33 in an event shortened by 100 
miles in the interest of competition and fan comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, Earnhardt's first in 17 races, moved him within one victory of 
David Pearson's record of 10 on the 1.366-mile Darlington oval and was the 60th 
victory of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt's black No. 3 Chevrolet Lumina, fielded by Richard Childress Racing, 
came across the finish line 7.4 seconds -- nearly a straightaway -- ahead of 
Mark Martin's Ford Thunderbird. Bill Elliott was third, also in a Thunderbird. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28 lead changes and 11 different leaders were records for a 400-mile event 
at Darlington, as were the seven drivers finishing on the lead lap. Earnhardt's 
winning speed of 132.432 m.p.h. was shy of Pearson's record 132.703 set in May, 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victory lane hasn't changed a bit," said Earnhardt, who won $70,190. "This is 
where our run (to the championship) started last year. This racetrack is tough 
to beat." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Germany's Michael Schumacher took advantage of superior work by his crew and a 
spin-out by favored Ayrton Senna to win the season-opening Formula One 
Brazilian Grand Prix in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher took the lead after he and the Brazilian stopped on the 21st lap, 
then was virtually guaranteed victory when Senna -- in a desperate attempt to 
catch up -- spun out with 15 laps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher, driving a Benetton-Ford, completed 71 laps around the 2.637-mile 
Interlagos circuit in 1 hour 35 minutes 38.759 seconds -- averaging 119.7 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing better than winning not by luck, but by fighting," the 
25-year-old German said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senna, the pre-race favorite in his first ride for Williams-Renault, locked 
himself in the team's motor home after the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's Damon Hill, Senna's teammate, was second. Jean Alesi of France was 
third in a Ferrari.

RUNNING; MACHUKA, DE REUCK WIN TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Josephat Machuka wasn't satisfied with his easy victory in the ninth annual 
Carlsbad 5000 Sunday. He wanted a world record. 
</P>
<P>
 Machuka, an 18-year-old from Kenya, fell 9.3 seconds shy of the record with 
his winning time of 13 minutes 20 seconds over the 3.1-mile road course. He 
finished three seconds ahead of Jabbour Brahim of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Machuka said: "I'm unhappy. I knew I was going to win, but I came 
here to break the world record." 
</P>
<P>
 The record of 13:11.7 was set in this race two years ago by another Kenyan, 
William Mutwol, who finished fourth Sunday in 13:31. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen De Reuck of South Africa won the women's race in 15:20. Annette Peters 
of Eugene, Ore., was second in 15:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Each winner received $5,000 of the $40,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Machuka ran the first mile in 4:02. He slowed to 4:25 for the second mile, but 
was never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked behind, hoping somebody would push me, but I couldn't see anybody," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two veteran runners felt that Machuka might have cost himself a world record 
by setting such a fast early pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Steve Scott, 37, of Leucadia, who won the first three Carlsbad races but 
finished 31st Sunday in 14:26: "I don't agree with his racing philosophy. To 
break a world record, you have to run even splits. Three 4:12 miles would have 
given him a very good chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Frank O'Mara, 32, an Arkansas alumnus from Ireland, who ran 10th in 
13:43: "His pace was suicidal, completely nonsensical. He hurt his chance for a 
record and took everybody else out of the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one American, Matt Giusto of Portola Valley, Calif., who placed sixth, 
made the top 10 in the world-class field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never ran in a field this fast," Michael Bartoszak of Poland said. "I 
finished second last year, and today I was 11th in almost the same time."

SOCCER / JULIE CART; WORLD CUP '94 REPORT REVEALS 1993 FINANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ongoing saga of World Cup '94's books, and who has the right to review 
them, continues. But at least some critics were hushed when World Cup President 
Alan Rothenberg on March 22 released the Organizing Committee's 1993 financial 
statements to the World Cup's board of directors and to state association 
presidents of the U.S. Soccer Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures, while not noting specifically where the money was spent, are 
revealing. According to the revised budget report ending Dec. 31, 1993, the 
single-largest revenue source was from ticket sales, more than $90 million. The 
single-largest expense was some $20 million for general management, presumably 
staff salaries, etc. Fixed and variable expenses came out to $20 million, and 
professional fees for the year cost $8.6 million. Special projects cost $9.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts receivable shows $15 million for the Premier Ticket program. By World 
Cup's own projections, based on selling 100% of the Premier Ticket base 
packages, the net profit from the program will be nearly $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance sheet shows "advances to Major League Prof. Soccer" in the amount 
of $932,000 for the year. World Cup lists its current assets as $64.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to soccer officials, Rothenberg again pledges a surplus of $20 to 
$25 million, to be used to provide a legacy for soccer in the United States. 
From the looks of things, that is likely to be a vastly underestimated figure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Interior ministers of seven European nations sent out mixed signals last week 
in a flap about World Cup security arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of European nations in Brussels, the minister of justice for 
Ireland suggested that police in the United States lack the experience to 
handle hooligans and other potential soccer-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Having said that, the European officials then refused to provide the very 
information that could help World Cup security keep the peace. At least seven 
nations said they would refuse to provide American authorities with lists of 
known hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials in many countries keep lists of hooligans -- persons 
convicted of crimes involving soccer violence. Such lists are passed all around 
the Continent before matches where there is potential for trouble. Hooligan 
lists were provided to the organizers of the 1990 World Cup in Italy and also 
to organizers of the 1993 U.S. Cup. The list helped authorities detain English 
hooligans at Logan Airport in Boston and preempt trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Now these lists are sacred documents? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to be stool pigeons," said the Belgian interior minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the Belgian minister forgot that his team is in the same group as the 
Netherlands, a nation with a reputation for wonderful soccer players and some 
misbehaving fans. 
</P>
<P>
 What the European ministers missed but should have noted with dismay was the 
Los Angeles police union's launching of an anti-tourism campaign, timed to 
disrupt the World Cup. Officers have been working without a contract for 21 
months and, in order to force the situation, have been mailing letters and 
brochures around the country and world warning visitors "not to come to Los 
Angeles because it is not safe." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our intention to carry out a systematic publicity campaign designed to 
affect tourism in the Los Angeles area, especially as related to the upcoming 
World Cup," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge ruled last week that World Cup '94 sold the same rights twice 
in a case involving two sponsors, Sprint and MasterCard. The exasperated judge 
noted the case was of "little overriding legal significance" but cited all 
parties for cruel and unusual use of hype. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parties' assertion as to the importance of this issue may reflect a 
certain amount of hyperbole," the judge stated. "For example, Sprint states: 
'It is estimated that 32 billion viewers throughout the world will watch the 
games.' This is indeed an extraordinary assertion given the current estimation 
of a world population of only 5 billion, and no reliably verified evidence of 
interplanetary travel." 
</P>
<P>
 They must have meant cumulative viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Switzerland's coach, Roy Hodgson, has announced his no-sex policy for 
his players during the World Cup, other abstinence reports are trickling in. 
It's all very amusing, if not futile, and it's a topic that comes up at every 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic says he favors a more relaxed approach, reasoning 
that normalcy is the best policy to offset nerves. Wives and families will be 
welcome to visit U.S. players during appointed hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic has guided two teams in the World Cup, and his experience will be 
a key element in the U.S. team's campaign. But, even with his lack of World Cup 
experience, 1990 U.S. coach Bob Gansler handled himself with great aplomb when 
a similar story broke at the Italian World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his policy regarding sex, Gansler answered, "Not at halftime." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed, Gansler said that while players' wives and girlfriends were not 
allowed at camp, the players were free to visit them in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the moments of pleasure that concern me," Gansler said. "It's the 
hours of pursuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Again Gansler was asked about his policy and reminded, by an Italian 
journalist, that "sex is very important to Latin peoples." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sex is very important to Americans, too," Gansler said. "That's why there are 
250 million of us."

NHL ROUNDUP; SHARKS WIN, WIDEN LEAD IN RACE FOR PLAYOFF SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sergei Makarov's power-play goal with 11:35 left in the game gave the San Jose 
Sharks their first franchise victory over the St. Louis Blues, 4-3, Sunday 
night at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The win moves the Sharks eight points ahead of the Mighty Ducks and 10 points 
ahead of the Kings in the race for the final playoff spot in the Western 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we couldn't win this game 6-5 or 7-6, but I felt we could win it 4-3 
if we kept the Blues from scoring any more," Shark Coach Constantine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks have won three in a row and earned seven of a possible eight points 
on a trip that ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Hull scored his 52nd goal for St. Louis in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 4, New York Islanders 1 -- Alexander Mogilny sat out Friday night's 
game against Hartford while police staked out the Aud for a man who threatened 
to shoot and stab him if he didn't pay $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mogilny returned in grand style Sunday, getting a goal and an assist to 
lead the Sabres at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Russians were arrested outside the Sabres' locker room after Friday's game 
and one, Segey Pavlosky, was charged with attempted grand larceny. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 3, Chicago 1 -- Goaltender Bob Essensa won his first game for the Red 
Wings as Detroit moved into a first-place tie with Toronto in the Central 
Division with the victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Fedorov scored his 52nd goal for the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 6, Washington 4 -- Al Iafrate's second goal of the game broke a 
third-period tie at Landover, Md., as the Bruins clinched a playoff spot and 
moved into fourth place over Montreal in the race for home-ice advantage in the 
Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg 3, New York Rangers 1 -- Goaltender Tim Cheveldae stopped 33 shots 
and the Jets relied on their special teams at Winnipeg. The Jets scored two 
power-play goals and one shorthanded to prevent the Rangers from topping the 
100-point mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton 5, Pittsburgh 3 -- Brent Grieve scored early in third period to start 
a three-goal outburst by the Oilers at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the win, Edmonton was officially eliminated from playoff contention 
when the Sharks won. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 5, Quebec 2 -- Minnesota natives Corey Millen and Mike Peluso 
scored during a four-goal first period to lead the Devils in a neutral ice game 
at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 2, Tampa Bay 2 -- Shane Churla's goal with 39 seconds remaining in 
regulation gave the Stars a tie at St. Petersburg, Fla.

CORKUM INJURED, OUT FOR SEASON

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks have lost leading scorer Bob Corkum for the rest of the 
season after a skate blade cut a tendon in his right foot Sunday during the 
third period of the team's game against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Jack Ferreira said Corkum will probably undergo surgery today 
to repair the tendon on top of his foot near the ankle. The examining doctor 
said the tendon is at least 75% severed. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum, 26, had never scored more than 10 points in an NHL season before this 
year, but he scored his 51st point with an assist Sunday before being hurt.

 The "amphitheater thing" has been getting embarrassing. So have the

every time he shows up at a social event with a designer-clad beauty on his

 So Mark C. Johnson has decided to go public -- about his social agenda, that 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 Sole owner of the Chapin Medical Co. in Corona, the twice-married, 
twice-divorced 47-year-old with a net worth of $20 million has begun to make 
waves in social circles because: 
</P>
<P>
 * He has an 8,000-square-foot mansion-cum-amphitheater in North Tustin that 
has recently been the site of some high-level arts parties. 
</P>
<P>
 * He has been tossing megabucks at charities -- $50,000 to the Pacific 
Symphony Orchestra, $25,000 to the Alzheimer's Foundation, $5,000 to the Laguna 
Art Museum -- while most of his peers are tightening their money belts. 
</P>
<P>
 * He's single, available, and his dates, ferried to galas in one of his five 
red Ferraris, are usually the most beautiful women in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Johnson -- who calls himself "an open book who doesn't drink, smoke 
or do drugs" -- sat poolside at his Mediterranean-style digs to clear the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, in general, people are sensitive to big spending these days," said 
the CEO whose 20-year-old critical care pharmaceuticals company does $50 
million in annual sales. "A lot of people in this community have turned out not 
to be what people thought they were. 
</P>
<P>
 "What sets me apart from what I call 'plastic Newport, down there' is that 
everything you see is bought and paid for. I don't buy anything unless I can 
write a check for it. I have no debt." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his social agenda: "When I turned 40 that 'brevity of life' thing set 
in and I asked myself, 'What do I do now?' "he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I wanted to donate money to causes I cared about but it's only been 
since 1990 that I have really felt secure and comfortable enough to give back." 
</P>
<P>
 His donations have included $200,000 to the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, $100,000 to Children's Hospital of Orange County and thousands to Opera 
Pacific, the March of Dimes and the Assessment and Treatment Services Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, he has kept a low profile because he's not into visibility, 
"believe it or not," he said. But recently, center chairman Thomas Nielsen 
invited Johnson to become a center vice chairman. (The news will be officially 
announced next month.) 
</P>
<P>
 So, bring on the spotlight. "Now, I want to help the center reach into the 
community; I don't think it's nearly as visible or understood by our community 
as it needs to be." 
</P>
<P>
 And he's hoping to meet his next wife. Soon. "Just this bluntly -- I'm in the 
market, looking for another spouse," said the red-haired entrepreneur. "I feel 
like a pinball in this house all by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has two grown sons, wants a woman who "would want me as opposed 
to need me," he said. "If I can buy a woman -- and I'll take the time to find 
out if I can -- I don't want her. I don't need a gold-digger." (In an aside, 
Johnson said he's willing to spend "upward of $40,000 per year on designer 
clothing" for his wife.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a woman who can share my life, but have her own life -- not be in my 
shadow." 
</P>
<P>
 In his previous marriages he thought he had it all -- passion, romance and 
affection. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has found it takes more. "I've learned about the value of tranquillity 
and equanimity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wife No. 3 will love to dress up, whirl about in his wide-body helicopter, 
attend about two black-tie galas a week and share his enthusiasm for "an 
eclectic, adventuresome lifestyle," he said. "She'll have to participate with 
me in all of that. Basically, I'm a teddy bear who won't grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 And if he loses it all tomorrow? "People would be surprised if they knew I was 
as simple and genuine as I am. People are often intimidated by what I have. 
What they don't understand is that I'm still pumping gas at a Standard station 
in Pasadena where I started out 25 years ago. There was never any silver spoon 
in my mouth. I loved pumping gas so I don't have any fear in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and one more thing from the man who was raised on Emily Post and could 
place all the silver on the table by the time he was 3: "I want to open my 
house regularly to charity parties, the way the Creans (John and Donna Crean of 
Santa Ana Heights) do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can handle up to 100 people per party several times a month. That's what 
this house is for -- entertaining." 
</P>

 Dining at Patina: Fresh from catering Willie Brown's 60th birthday bash 
(attended by Barbra Streisand, Clint Eastwood, et al) chef Joaquim Splichal -- 
owner of Patina restaurant in Los Angeles -- met with Newport Harbor Art Museum 
activist Alison Baker-Frenzel last week to discuss plans for the Art of Dining. 
The annual museum benefit is scheduled for April 24 at the Four Seasons in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after Baker-Frenzel took her place at Patina -- a Melrose bistro 
favored by the likes of Warren Beatty and Henry Kissinger -- Splichal presented 
her with the carpaccio of ahi tuna with chilled tomato mousse he will prepare 
for the $300-per-person French-themed gala. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmmmmm, light and lovely," said Baker-Frenzel, chairwoman of Art of Dining. 
"This gala is all about dining in the French style -- lightly ."  
</P>
<P>
 Other menu items will include spiced corn chowder with smoked shrimp from the 
Four Seasons and galantine of rainbow trout and lobster from Mille Fleurs 
restaurant in Rancho Santa Fe. Former museum board chairman Jack Shea and his 
wife, Marion, will be honored at the event. For tickets, call (714) 759-1122.
