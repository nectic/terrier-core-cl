 SUCKER PUNCH: What's a more powerful lure for the average American taxpayer 
than the prospect of a refund from the government? . . . That was the bait in a 
Ventura County district attorney's sting operation that reeled in -- among 
others -- 41 parents who owe back child support. (B1) . . . Children's 
advocates say they support such measures to catch deadbeat parents. "We're very 
supportive of things they do to track down absent parents," said Jerry Blesener 
of county child protective services. 
</P>
<P>
 GET IN LINE: It's not the catchiest title in the world . . . But "Spoiled 
Rotten," a 15-minute video on the Medfly, has been flying off the shelves at 
the Camarillo Public Library. The educational film stars the winged pest and 
features maggot-infested produce and other horrors wrought by the crop-chomping 
insect. Health and agriculture experts appear in cameo roles . . . The video's 
available by loan at 10 county libraries. Demand is high in Camarillo, where a 
second round of aerial malathion spraying is set for next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 HIRSUTE PURSUIT: For bald men who embark on a hair-replacement quest, the way 
can be fraught with turmoil, insecurity -- and bills that total thousands of 
dollars. (Ventura County Life, Page 8) . . . Even the pain of transplants 
hasn't stopped some men from trying to regain youthful, flowing manes. For 
Ventura County's hair-challenged, options can include skin grafts, scalp 
reductions -- and wigs. Said one transplant client: "You go through this once 
in your life, and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 LONG HAUL: Two Westlake High School football players recall the trauma of 
being shot during an off-campus fracas in February (C6) . . . David Behling and 
Scott Smith have recovered from their physical wounds and are back on the 
playing field . . . But for young victims of violent crimes, emotional healing 
can be slow and a sense of trust can be hard to regain, said Ventura 
psychologist Susan Leznik. "It's harder for them sometimes than it is for 
adults," she said.

IDEAS TAKE STAGE WITH GUARNERI STRING QUARTET; MUSIC: THE CELLIST FOR THE GROUP 
SAYS IT'S 'LESS CONCERNED WITH MECHANICAL THINGS' AND MORE INTERESTED IN 
CONCEPTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In an age of quick turnover, the Guarneri String Quartet has remained intact 
for 30 years. The group now stakes its claim as the oldest active string 
quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hardly imagined lasting this long," Guarneri cellist David Soyer said in a 
recent phone interview from his home in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, here we are, trudging along. The secret? I don't know. One of the 
elements is respect for each other as musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Another must be their fine playing, which has earned them numerous awards. 
Even so, they still rehearse diligently, although "not as much as we used to 
when we were in our early days. We know a hell of a lot more repertory. We're 
not learning Beethoven string quartets for the first time. We do most of it in 
the early fall, when we do repertory, and we rehearse on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're less concerned with mechanical things -- ensemble, bullet-like 
precision, things of that sort," he added. "Now we're more concerned with 
musical ideas, presenting an overall concept, then we were when younger. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet -- Soyer, violinists Arnold Steinhardt and John Dalley and violist 
Michael Tree -- opens the Laguna Chamber Music series tonight at the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre with a program of Haydn, Bartok and Debussy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to offer a balanced program of works that we like and like to play," 
the cellist said. Of Debussy's G minor Quartet: "I don't know how many times 
we've played it. It still remains very fresh. That's one of the wonderful 
things about the repertory for string quartet." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that Bartok's Fourth Quartet, written in 1928, still presents 
tough going for a portion of their audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people find it hard listening. Some find it interesting and 
exhilarating. It depends on their tolerance. Of course, it's old stuff by now. 
The Fourth has a lot of motor energy and a beautiful slow movement. It's quite 
an attractive piece." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Haydn, "What can one say of Haydn -- he was a very good composer?" he 
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guarneri plays about 75 concerts a year these days, having cut down from a 
peak of about 120 because "we also record and teach. It's a pretty busy 
existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Soyer enjoys teaching -- the quartet is on the faculty at the University of 
Maryland -- but he has modified his methods over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teachers were very severe in the old-fashioned way, really severe, even to 
the point of being physical," he said. "When I first began to teach, that was 
the way I taught. Someone who did that told me his students used to cry a lot, 
but didn't learn a lot. (So) I no longer teach in that way. I probably am 
rather strict, but hopefully I'm kindly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soyer isn't so kind in his opinion of the value of musical competitions. They 
are not "a particularly good thing. Judges always seem to pick the same sort of 
players. The really original ones are not the ones who win the competitions. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 There is emerging talent, however. "There are some very good young quartets 
we've heard and some we've taught," he said. He named the Orion and the 
Shanghai quartets, but was not making an exclusive list.  
</P>
<P>
 They also face more career hurdles than the Guarneri ever did. "It's a bit 
more difficult to make a career these days," he said. "The number of 
(presenters) is about the same, but the number of groups are more -- many more 
-- than when we first began." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, today's quartets must face "a trend in concert series of having mixed 
things, including jazz and rock and what have you," Soyer said. "I don't 
particularly like rock. Jazz I'm very fond of. It's not an unhealthy idea, (if) 
it is of good quality." 
</P>
<P>
 The ones who have succeeded in marketing themselves in this way, such as the 
Kronos Quartet, are a different kind of fish, he said. "Kronos is not a string 
quartet in our sense at all," he said. "They're a performing group that does, 
(pause) whatever they do. Others are like that now, too. They do have a 
following." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Soyer is not ready to ring down the curtain on the traditional string 
quartet. "I don't think music is in any kind of crisis," he said. "The 
audiences are turning grayer in certain areas, but then again we play a great 
deal of universities, and it's encouraging to see students at concerts. We 
recently played a concert in Taipei and the audience was huge, the hall was 
huge. They were almost all young." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Guarneri String Quartet will play Haydn's String Quartet in G, Opus 77, 
No. 1; Bartok's Quartet No. 4 and Debussy's Quartet in G minor tonight at the 
Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. 8 p.m. $14 to $25. The 
program is jointly sponsored by the Laguna Chamber Music Society and the Orange 
County Philharmonic Society. (714) 854-4646

THEATER REVIEWS; MUSICAL 'NINE' ADDS UP TO LESS THAN FELLINI'S '8 1/2' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Peel back the dull score and only sporadically clever lyrics of "Nine" and 
what's left is the show's flamboyant imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not much to build a powerhouse musical around, and even the most costly 
and lavishly imaginative staging risks leaving an audience feeling 
impoverished. Put "Nine" in a campus theater like the one at Cypress College, 
and the limited resources just make the show's failings all the more glaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Diana Polsky and her plucky student cast can bear only so much 
responsibility for the less-than-engaging production that opened at the college 
last weekend. The look is often rudimentary, and the singing is spotty, but 
they don't have much to work with, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine" must have seemed like a stellar idea prior to its New York City 
premiere in 1982. It's not hard speculating on what went through the heads of 
creators Arthur Kopit (book) and Maury Yeston (music and lyrics): Hey, musicals 
are supposed to be visually exciting experiences, aren't they? Well, let's 
adapt one of the most visually exciting movies ever.  
</P>
<P>
 They turned to Federico Fellini and his autobiographical masterpiece, "8 1/2." 
"Nine" follows the film's plot closely, even though it only gives superficial 
attention to the life of the disenchanted, womanizing director, Guido, whom 
Fellini examined so thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical ostensibly is set in an Italian spa, where the libidinous and 
indulgent Guido (the stand-in for Fellini) has been exiled to sort out his 
swirling mid-life crisis and disappearing movie career. The real locale, 
though, is Guido's mind, where all the women from his pressurized life come to 
charm and scold. 
</P>
<P>
 As the arena for all this, set designer Nanci Sroga has built an expansive and 
reasonably luxurious re-creation of a spa courtyard. It's a comfortable place 
for the large cast to move through, but it lacks the needed panache to help 
jump-start our visual connection to the show. Robert Mumm's lighting is equally 
competent but also could take more risks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for Guido, Darren C. Buckels offers a rather tame version; it's a pleasant 
performance, but one that only hints at the complexities within. We'd like him 
to open up, to show more of a blaze even when brooding, but Buckels plays it 
cool. He does have the production's strongest voice, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there could be more fire, or at least a smoldering sense of 
decadence, throughout the cast. Laura Gregory is just too understanding and 
mild as Guido's long-suffering wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cindy Acevedo as Guido's lingerie-clad mistress and Natalie May Carter as 
his hot-blooded producer bring a few juicy moments to the production. So does 
Brenda Ivelisse Pacheco as Sarraghina, the local hooker who shows young Guido 
the facts of life. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; LAUGHS ARE MAJOR STRENGTH OF IRVINE'S 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Some people love small talk. Others can't stand it. You know who you are. 
"Steel Magnolias" is a play made of small talk. That ought to tell you whether 
Robert Harling's chatty Southern comedy, set in a rural beauty parlor and 
tinged with rue, is your dish of grits. 
</P>
<P>
 Given its many revivals, the show clearly appeals to a wide audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season there had been at least 10 productions in Orange County and 
the greater Los Angeles region since the original New York staging in 1987, 
including a national touring version. There also was an all-star movie that 
launched Julia Roberts' screen career. (Or perhaps you remember it as the one 
that helped keep Dolly Parton's alive.) 
</P>
<P>
 All these offerings apparently have not sated the public appetite for a 
Louisiana kaffeeklatsch that convenes every Saturday in Truvy's converted 
carport to get the latest stylings in "Southern hair" while dishing the town 
gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago the Garden Grove Community Theatre opened its current season 
with "Steel Magnolias." Now the New Community Center Theatre has inaugurated 
its maiden season with yet another revival, bringing the number of regional 
productions I know of to an even dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, the small talk in "Steel Magnolias" doesn't wilt as readily as 
most. It comes preserved in hair spray, not unlike the teased curls that Truvy 
(Bonnie M. Mikoleit) washes and sets. She has an endless supply of cute 
zingers. "I gotta tell you," Truvy says, "when it comes to suffering, she's 
right up there with Elizabeth Taylor." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouiser (Norma Binmore), a temperamental crank, also is full of quips. "I'm not 
crazy," she says. "I've just been in a very bad mood for 40 years." And Clairee 
(Denise Needham), the late mayor's wealthy widow, is catty. About an older 
woman suspected of playing around with a married man, she remarks: "At her age 
she should be playing 'Beat the Clock.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The main plot, which develops offstage, revolves around Shelby (Valerie 
Swaim), the prettiest girl in town. It is her wedding day when the play opens, 
and she has come in to have her hair done. Without ever leaving Truvy's shop, 
we follow Shelby through marriage, motherhood and more, until -- in the second 
act -- the comedy turns into a tear-jerker and the focus shifts to Shelby's 
self-sacrificing mother M'Lynn (Corrine Ehlers). 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the play's women has a story. For instance, Truvy's assistant, Annelle 
(Bonnie Kovar), starts out as a waif who has just moved to town after being 
abandoned by her husband and ends up becoming a born-again Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 The playwright has insisted in a note to his published text that these women 
"in no way, shape or form are meant to be portrayed as cartoons or 
caricatures." Ironically, he has written a play that begs for that treatment. 
It's the laughs that keep "Steel Magnolias" from sinking in bathos. 
</P>
<P>
 New Community's revival gets its biggest boost from Mikoleit, whose comic 
timing and Southern accent as Truvy lend the production buoyancy and flavor. 
Binmore is another major asset as Ouiser, largely for her authoritative 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Swaim has the right look for Shelby but doesn't do much with what is basically 
a dull role. Kovar's Annelle is strictly caricature, with a little too much 
mugging. Needham gets by adequately as Clairee. And Ehlers needs to loosen up 
as M'Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the production values are fine. Kudos to the designers for the 
detailed sets and costumes.

THEATER REVIEW; 'SAMOS,' 'CASINA': ANCIENT COMEDIES WITH A LOT OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The J. Paul Getty Museum is hosting a rare and intoxicating event. Two ancient 
comedies, which are sometimes read but hardly ever played, are onstage in the 
Getty's inner peristyle garden. 
</P>
<P>
 If all this sounds serene and stately, think again. The farcical 
misunderstandings, low-down ribaldry and plain-spoken English adaptations of 
these plays are in stark contrast to the architectural majesty of the Getty. 
</P>
<P>
 This juxtaposition is also reflected in Nathan Birnbaum's entrancing music. 
Albert Vartanyan uses a variety of Armenian wind instruments to create a frenzy 
of orgiastic wailing (meant to suggest Aegean sounds), while solemn drummers 
maintain deadpan stares that are worthy of Buckingham Palace guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first play, "The Woman From Samos," is by Menander, a Greek from the 3rd 
Century BC. Menander's reputation far surpasses theatergoers' actual knowledge 
of his works, most of which aren't intact. But this one, in a translation by J. 
Michael Walton that confidently fills in a few of the missing passages, is 
fast, funny and surprisingly tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Before wealthy Demeas (Jay Bell) and his neighbor Nikeratos (Larry Randolph) 
went away on business, Demeas ordered his mistress (Tressa Scarbrough), the 
title character, to get rid of her pregnancy. Meanwhile, Demeas' adopted son 
Moschion (Jon Matthews) has impregnated Nikeratos' daughter (who remains 
offstage). 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, complications stack up, thanks in part to the stock-character servants 
(Robert Machray and Kathy Kinney). But, amid the whirlwind, a few moments of 
genuine human feeling surface, not only in Menander's lines but also in the 
actors' faces -- which would have been covered by masks in ancient Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 During breaks in the action, a chorus line entertains with simple little 
dances, provocative masks and outlandishly graphic outfits designed by Alex 
Jaeger. But these costumes are mild compared to the enlarged phalli that are 
carried onstage after intermission, during the bawdier, more cartoonish 
"Casina," by the 2nd Century Roman playwright Plautus. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Casina," translated by Richard Beacham, Randolph plays a classic dirty old 
man, Lysidamus, who lusts after the unseen title character, a ward of his wife 
(Hope Alexander-Willis). The spouses try to outfox each other by setting up 
their respective servants (Machray and Matthews) as Casina's would-be groom, 
the better to control Lysidamus' access to her. Not surprisingly, the frisky 
old man gets his comeuppance. 
</P>
<P>
 This one is a rowdy, raucous party, lacking the more rounded characters of 
"Samos." Like many such parties, it goes on too long, but it's a gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hackett briskly directed professional casts. UCLA, which co-produced 
with the Getty, provided students for the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this production was designed to accompany the current exhibition "A 
Passion for Antiquities" (open during intermission, if you can tear yourself 
away from the free baklava and wine), the Getty should consider keeping a 
permanent resident company devoted to performing classics. Judging from this 
production, actors can animate an era and add another dimension to the museum 
experience. 
</P>

 * "The Woman From Samos" and "Casina," J. Paul Getty Museum, 17985 Pacific 
Coast Highway, Malibu. Thursdays-Sundays, 7:30 p.m. Ends Oct. 30. $35. (213)

 Measuring Black Viewers: Nielsen Media Research said Wednesday it will change 
the way it measures TV ratings to better account for African American viewers. 
The changes would primarily impact local and syndicated markets and could 
result in more advertising and programs targeted at black audiences. The 
announcement coincided with the release Wednesday of a report commissioned by 
Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-Ill.) that found that black consumers spend $252 
billion in the United States each year and watch 49% more television per 
household than non-blacks. John Dimling, president of Nielsen Media Research, 
said the company will work "to improve the way black American audience data is 
reported . . . especially in central city areas." He said Nielsen would also 
"consider the possibility of larger sample sizes needed to generate more 
demographic breakouts among African Americans and other minority audiences."

 Miramax Suit: A moviegoer has sued Miramax Films in Alameda County Superior 
Court for false advertising, contending the company lied about ticket sales on 
"Pulp Fiction" to promote the film. Jane Cutolo, who had not seen the movie, 
filed suit over claims that "Pulp Fiction" was the country's most-watched film 
over the weekend. The suit asks that Miramax pay restitution to those who had 
seen the film and to its competitors for lost profits. Raising its own earlier 
estimate on ticket sales, Miramax said Monday that the Quentin Tarantino crime 
drama grossed $9.3 million from Friday to Sunday, topping sales for Warner 
Bros.' "The Specialist," which reported a gross of $8.97 million. Several media 
outlets questioned the figures, but since no independent box-office audit was 
available, there was no way to verify the reported grosses. Cutolo's lawyer, 
Donald Driscoll, called Miramax's figures "classic false advertising." A 
Miramax spokesperson denied the charge. THE ARTS

 Union Takes On Joffrey: Citing non-payment of Joffrey Ballet dancer salaries 
for two weeks this year as well as similar defaults in two past seasons, the 
American Guild of Musical Artists has filed a demand for arbitration with the 
American Arbitration Assn. The union also cites unpaid medical reimbursements, 
severance pay and pension contributions. In response, C.C. Conner, executive 
director of the Joffrey, issued a statement saying that the company "had hoped 
to settle many of these claims in 1993-94" but that plans "were thwarted by the 
failure of presenters in Cleveland, Memphis and Atlanta to pay $255,000 in 
contracted performance fees this year." A decision from the Arbitration Assn. 
was pending. QUICK TAKES

POP BEAT: KORN: EMPTINESS BEHIND THE FURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week's column reviews the CD debut of Korn. This local band sows in anger 
as it seeks to harvest the burgeoning audience of mosh-pit denizens who seek 
catharsis in get-it-off-your-chest rants set to jackhammer beats. Ratings range 
from * (poor) to **** (excellent). Three stars denote a solid recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Korn, "Korn" Immortal/Epic Mick Jagger sees a red door and he wants it 
painted black. All the exits from Korn's insulated nightmare universe already 
have been painted over and sealed up, leaving the Huntington Beach foursome to 
slam its collective head repeatedly against doors it can't even see. The 
process gets Korn almost nowhere, and it must really smart. 
</P>
<P>
 If you accept the aesthetics of the thrashing, metallic, incessantly wrathful 
rock style that Korn plays, this debut is a smashing success. The idea is 
indeed to keep banging until it hurts, and to channel the rage born of inner 
pain and frustration into the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindred to such bands as Tool, Rollins Band and Rage Against the Machine, Korn 
and its singer-lyricist, Jonathan Davis, make their core ethic fairly explicit 
in songs like "Predictable," "Lies" and "Fake": the world is a torment-filled 
morass that leaves us seething with deep, internalized fears; virtue lies in 
confronting those painful truths unflinchingly and screaming them to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there is a kernel of merit in that approach, but it has more to do with 
psychotherapy than art. 
</P>
<P>
 Korn's high-impact delivery of its rage-rock may provide a helpful, cathartic 
experience for listeners who can identify with the scars Davis reveals. But 
music's ability to be an emotional touchstone is by itself no sensible measure 
of its artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Korn's ability to connect with listeners through cathartic rage is exactly 
parallel to the process of identification that takes place in country music, 
when fans respond to some of the manipulative, superficial and cliched treacle 
that oozes out of the Nashville song mills. For all their flaws, some of the 
most obvious tear-jerkers by Billy Ray Cyrus or Tim McGraw nevertheless touch 
many listeners deeply and wind up getting played at weddings and funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 Korn and its brethren bands imply that the expression of darkness and pain is 
inherently more truthful than the expression of brighter emotions. I think such 
bands merely suffer from a failure, or at least a crippling narrowness, of 
vision.  
</P>
<P>
 Great art, rock included, can't be monolithic. Capturing how it feels to be 
torn apart inside is part of the job, and Korn, in its overstated, operatic, 
ultra-obvious way, certainly accomplishes that. What's missing is a vivid 
evocation of the ideal that has been corroded, of the paradise that has been 
lost. It's that glimpse of the good, and the knowledge of the void left by its 
absence or its defeat, that tears us apart as witnesses to a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, Korn's methods hold interest. Davis mixes his madman ranting with 
passages of baleful, but more controlled semi-singing and with the taunting 
singsong refrains that crop up like mantras in several songs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opening tracks, "Blind" and "Ball Tongue," and on "Helmet in the Bush," 
such elements as the low hissing of white noise and the scraping of jagged 
guitars in the margins and corners of the recording's stereophonic space convey 
a vivid, tensely claustrophobic feeling similar to the one that envelops a 
listener on "The Downward Spiral" by Nine Inch Nails. As the album goes on, 
Korn's blasting and hammering become more head-on, the results less 
distinctive. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis plays with fire and gets burned on one number in which his repeated 
screaming of the song's titular anti-gay epithet could well offer comfort to 
haters who want to turn the song to their own purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 A close listening, and the album's overall context, make it clear that he 
isn't lashing out overtly at homosexuals, but trying to recapture how he felt 
as a teen-aged misfit being humiliated by taunting bullies who flung sexual 
aspersions. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Bruce Springsteen couldn't get a contextually aware listening (at least 
in some quarters) for "Born in the U.S.A.," it's doubtful Davis will here. 
Unfortunately, a member of Korn casually and disparagingly uses the same 
epithet in a snippet of studio-byplay that precedes the song "Clown." Good luck 
conjuring a social-realism explanation for that one. 
</P>
<P>
 In the closing epic, "Daddy," Davis goes through self-administered 
primal-scream therapy, recalling horrific childhood abuse before collapsing in 
hysterics, then quiet sobbing. Cathartic indeed, and also a very pat 
explanation for all the rage that has preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope Korn has succeeded in purging itself with its first album. Maybe 
then it can find some subtler, more artful means with which to channel its 
undeniable intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Korn plays Friday at Club 369, 1641 N. Placentia Ave., Fullerton. 8 p.m. 
(714) 572-1816.

ART REVIEWS; FINLEY'S LOW-TECH, HIGH-TOUCH 'CONTROL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Finley's wall-mounted sculptures consist of an eccentric inventory of 
plastic containers packed inside each other like those hollow Russian dolls 
that open -- again and again and again -- to reveal an identical, slightly 
smaller doll nestled inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than suggesting infinite regression (and mirroring the Kafka-esque 
experience of living in a bureaucratic state), Finley's art celebrates 
unpredictability. Titled "Cruise Control," his quirky exhibition at the newly 
opened Acme Gallery offers a hands-on demonstration of spontaneity's place in 
an increasingly regimented world. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Finley's works have the presence of gerrymandered computer 
technology. About the size of desk-top hard-drives and monitors, each of his 
piecemeal units seems to have been rigged to perform a specific, if unknown, 
function. All five cubical structures present elaborate variations on the 
molded, synthetic skins that ordinarily protect the chips, circuits and 
software enclosed within. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike computers, however, whose programs are engaged only through keyboards 
and screens, Finley's user-friendly sculptures invite viewers to disassemble 
their loosely conjoined components. Once you begin unpacking, unwrapping and 
unfolding, a seemingly infinite array of interactive possibilities opens up. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the removable face of "Wet and Reckless" is a plastic car caddie 
whose compartments for drinks, coins, pencils and cassettes have been filled 
with cut-up place mats and bits of synthetic rubber that are themselves 
removable and rearrangeable. Before you lift off this part of Finley's 
interlocking sculpture, you must set aside a yellow plastic dish that was 
designed to hold a single cob of corn but is currently filled with kitty litter 
and whittled stubs of pencils. 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath is a Ziploc sandwich bag containing ties for garbage bags and 
fragmented images snipped from magazines. Under that is a plastic storage bin 
stuffed with scraps of perforated plastic, foam and rubber that dangle from the 
wall like synthetic intestines. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pieces, like "World's Greatest" and "Closer Than They Appear," are 
chock-full of hidden surprises, including life-size plastic squirrels, tiny 
giraffes, ducks, inflatable owls, six-pack rings and photographs of kids in a 
tree-house. No object's position is permanently fixed, and your memory is 
tested when you try to return the pieces to their original configuration. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley's compact sculptures deliciously confuse the 3-D space of tactility 
with the untouchable space of computer technology. More importantly, they 
conflate both of these realms with the invisible space of the human 
imagination. Finley's loaded, low-tech instruments take place at the 
intersection between cyber space and old-fashioned American ingenuity, where 
adaptation, flexibility and trying things out for yourself count above 
everything else.

 Old Mold: Soap scum and Wonder Bread are the main ingredients of Yolande 
McKay's predominantly monochromatic sculptures. Titled "Family Crust," her 
amusing exhibition at Ovsey Gallery pits symbols of aristocratic identity 
against slices of bland, mass-produced bread. The artist's earnest works also 
play architectural ornamentation against congealed wads of bathtub residue. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than bringing art down to earth to infuse it with vitality, McKay's 
resin-coated pieces of moldy, rotten bread contend that attempts to make 
beautiful objects are based in the misguided desire to deny organic life's 
messy underside. Her fiberglass-reinforced swirls of soap scum, formed into 
frothy patterns of wainscoting and wall-molding, imply that high art is little 
more than a manipulative attempt to wash away real life's lowly dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 McKay's conceptual decorations are meant to undercut the ideal of aesthetic 
purity first put forth in the 19th-Century and promulgated by a small band of 
formalists in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the debate over the viability of art-for-art's-sake has not 
been articulated in terms of purity for more than two decades. Even though 
McKay's attack on this outdated position is accurate, the staleness of the 
argument dulls the critical edge of her sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 They try to resuscitate an anachronistic viewpoint only to make fun of its 
limits. Today, that is more manipulative than trying to make an object of 
beauty.

 Sweetly Sinister: Adam Ross' new oil, alkyd and acrylic paintings on wood, 
iron and porcelain put a palette of delicate pastels to such perverse use that 
these ordinarily saccharine-sweet colors look sinister. At Sue Spaid Fine Art, 
14 small abstractions pack the same sort of punch possessed by cotton candy 
laced with strychnine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross still builds his images by pouring dozens of layers of noxious, 
industrial-strength paint over variously shaped panels and then violently 
sanding their surfaces down, like a mad archeologist more enthralled with the 
incessant whirl of his power tool than anything he might discover in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Intensifying the destructive side of his creative project, the artist also 
employs a router to carve spiraling incisions into his most recent paintings. 
Their surfaces no longer have the glassy, super-smooth feel of TV screens but 
are sometimes punctured by holes, interrupted by indentations and marred by 
tiny gullies. These textures give Ross' fluid images the presence of contour 
maps that seem to have been transmitted from outer space by some 
high-resolution, heat-sensitive device. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the matte finishes and pastel tones of Ross' poisonously beautiful 
paintings downplay their high-tech, sci-fi edge, and catapult them into a 
strange realm of their own, where metaphors mix promiscuously and unanticipated 
hybrids take shape.

 Feminine Forms: Sally Elesby's shamelessly decorative sculptures at Food House 
look like a group of floozies ready to go out on the town in search of fun -- 
or trouble, if it happens to come their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Made from sheer swathes of lavish fabrics stretched taut and suggestively 
bundled over wire ribs protruding from the wall, the L.A.-based artist's 
abstract sculptures initially appear to address currently fashionable ideas 
about social mores and feminine identity. Adorned with fake flowers, feathers, 
jewels, sequins, beads, lace, ribbons and glitter, her insistently frilly works 
do indeed seem to take an active stance in the charged debate over the body, 
sexuality and artifice. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Elesby's second solo show, titled "Incidental Form," forgoes this 
sort of direct political posturing, instead exploring such formalist issues as 
the relationship between surface and volume, excess and necessity, presence and 
absence, as well as positive and negative space. 
</P>
<P>
 Her superficially feminine pieces are most effective when they almost vanish, 
appearing to be less substantial than their shadows. Elesby's art brings 
obliqueness and indirection back into the picture, suggesting that discretion 
is sometimes more persuasive than a straightforward assault, and that a whisper 
sometimes speaks more powerfully than a shout.

CLUB REVIEW; FOOTHILL: FROM COUNTRY TO MIDWEEK ALTERNATIVE HEAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Foothill is a club connoisseur's dream. The beautifully aging venue in 
Signal Hill opened its doors in the early '40s as a country & Western club, and 
since then little has changed visually.The stage, which in its heyday featured 
such stellar country artists as Hank Williams and Johnny Cash, faces a spacious 
dance floor and is flanked on three sides by dozens of tables. 
</P>
<P>
 The sightlines put those of most live music halls to shame. And although the 
red felt on the walls and pillar of the 450-capacity club has seen better days, 
the timeworn effect sets a sumptuous, surreal mood, somewhere between "Twin 
Peaks" and "Barton Fink." 
</P>
<P>
 It's still a country hangout on Saturdays -- the house band, the New 
Tennesseeans, took its name from a Foothill staple of yesteryear -- and on 
Sundays the venue is transformed into a Brazilian dance club. But the most 
exciting aspect of its current metamorphosis is the new booking policy on 
Thursdays and Fridays, when booker Steve Zepeda transforms the Foothill into 
rockabilly, punk and alternative-rock heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists such as the Reverend Horton Heat, the Cadillac Tramps and Jawbreaker 
have graced the antiquated stage in recent weeks, providing Hollywood's clubs 
with some much needed competition. A recent set by the Supersuckers was the 
perfect melding between the club's old and new school. After the Seattle-based 
group performed a cowpunk version of the Patsy Cline hit "Crazy," it took 
five-dollar requests from the wildly enthusiastic audience.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BOOTSY COLLINS THROWS A WILD PARTY FULL OF VINTAGE FUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the planet Funkatron, his otherworldliness . . . Bootsy Collins! 
</P>
<P>
 That would have been the perfect intro for funk master Collins, who looked as 
if he'd dropped in from another world to do his midnight show at the House of 
Blues on Tuesday.Everything on his outlandishly garish, high-tech suit was 
speckled and spangled, and he spouted funkisms -- things like "Funk is its own 
reward" -- as speedily and deftly as he strummed his bass. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, who played with James Brown and George Clinton and was a solo star in 
the late '70s, is enjoying a resurgence now that a new generation has been 
turned on to funk, thanks to its prevalence in rap. But you forget what an 
urgent, powerhouse force true vintage funk can be until you hear it played live 
by a master like Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 With the scintillating support of his New Rubber Band -- a merry group of 
funksters including keyboardist supreme Bernie Worrell -- Collins swept the 
crowd into his frivolous, funkdafied world. Using songs anchored in steamy, 
bass-heavy rhythms and littered with nonsense lyrics and long, joyous jams, 
Collins presided over a wild, two-hour party. It helped that his musicians, who 
capably took over the show during his breaks, apparently come from the same 
planet as their leader. DENNIS HUNT

FAMILY; NO-FRILLS RED HERRING PUPPETS FULL OF CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shabby little black box East Theatre in Hollywood may look like an 
unlikely place to take young children for an hour's entertainment, but 
appearances can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Herring Puppets' opening matinee there on Sunday suffered a few 
mishaps -- the tops of the puppeteers heads made a few inadvertent appearances, 
a smoke effect was a scene too early, the opening act was briefly in the dark 
thanks to tardy spotlights and a few unintentional thuds sounded behind the 
curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing spoiled the show's comfortable, relaxed charm and creative whimsy. 
Puppeteer Bill Frischman and artistic director, puppeteer and puppet builder 
Lisa A. Sturz put on a quintet of humorous vignettes, using varied hand and rod 
puppets, painted and quilted backdrops and taped music and narration. Oscar 
Ostrich, a hand puppet with a fluffy top knot, a wry wit and an occasional air 
of distraction, bantered with the audience between plays. 
</P>
<P>
 In the show opener, "Dogs," a tribute to filmmaker and comic actor Jacques 
Tati, people and their canine pets take a stroll in the park. Created by French 
animator Francois Manavit, the short piece is a parade of comical, unexpected 
cartoon characters on rods. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to two other shorter works -- "The Three Little Pigs" and "Alpha," 
a hip presentation of the alphabet song -- two longer pieces round out the 
program. "The Drum," an adaptation of a Himalayan folk tale with music by Lynn 
Anderson, uses brightly costumed wooden puppets. A Celtic "Jack in the 
Beanstalk," by popular storyteller-musician Robin Williamson, uses hand 
puppets, including a satisfyingly giant Giant. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-frills, family-friendly show's only real problem? It's over too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Red Herring Puppets, East Theatre, 6468 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood,

CYBER-DINING ON THE INTERNET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN KOSUDA and REPLACEMENT  
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Along the information superhighway, a few truck stops have opened up -- 
cyber-diners, where culinary travelers can drop in to ask a question, find a 
new recipe or recommend a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The journey starts with the Internet, a global collection of interconnected 
computers that makes up a virtual community. A community with a healthy 
appetite. Databases have files with a wide range of recipes, and on-line news 
groups answer all types of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, "I'm posting to get some opinions on the various uses of 
different kinds of oils," one man recently asked. "With so many different kinds 
of oils to choose from, one has to have a sense of why one oil is appropriate 
over another." 
</P>
<P>
 Replies included: "A good cannola and vegetable oil blend, low in saturated 
fat, should meet nearly all your needs unless company is coming and you want to 
use a little olive oil. Such a simplistic approach is healthy, thrifty and 
saves space in the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 And: "Peanut oil is also often used for stir-frying. Peanut oil's high 
smoke-point makes it good for this." 
</P>
<P>
 When a woman posted a message that she was at her wits end trying to clean her 
stainless-steel teapot, someone helpfully suggested a small amount of baking 
soda, a "nylon scrubbie" and elbow grease. 
</P>
<P>
 When a man wrote that he wanted to keep fresh pesto over the winter, he asked 
if it was possible to store basil, soaked in vinegar and topped with oil, in a 
jar in his refrigerator. Several people answering his post suggested freezing 
the pesto as "pesto cubes," while others affirmed that it was possible to 
acidify the basil in vinegar and then set it in oil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In cyberspace, someone seems to have an answer for almost any question. Some 
cooks have found this out and now are using their keyboards almost as often as 
their cutting boards. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best ways to start on the Internet is with an alt. or rec. news 
group. News groups, or users' groups as they are sometimes called, are areas of 
the Internet used for posting messages. By first accessing a news service 
program such as NN -- a program usually issued by an Internet access provider 
-- a specific address can be used to get to the message list. Once there, the 
messages appear, usually with the name of the author and the subject of the

<P>
 What's most interesting about computer messages is that they're not just dry 
questions and answers. Instead, the postings are lively and active -- like 
sitting around a kitchen table with a group of friends. They can be caring, 
interesting, funny and intimate. There's always a personal tone to them. 
</P>
<P>
 When one man asked where to buy 26 pounds of bacon, a woman responded with a 
cheery: "Say hey Ray! Well, there's that pig meat palace at the Housewife's 
Market in Oakland. Twenty-six pounds of bacon. What a lot of grease!!! 
Sooo-weee!" 
</P>
<P>

 When he wrote back, he began with the greeting: "Bless your little 
cholesterol-impaired heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman, after posting a long list of her favorite foods, logged off 
with: "See you in alt.recovery.dieting ."  
</P>
<P>
 There is a news group on the Internet for almost any topic or hobby, but the 
groups can be very specialized, and that can be a problem to the uninitiated. 
For instance, rec.food.drink.beer is a group that covers ales and beers. 
Dropping in on their news group is like landing in a different country. 
</P>
<P>
 "GB is actually much more boring, and less imaginative than TH," wrote one 
poster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boring if you don't like Exports and Dunkels and Doppels!" Came the reply 
from someone else.  
</P>
<P>
 Rec.crafts.brewing is a news group that focuses on home brewing. The group 
answers questions about yeast, making Trappist Ale or, as someone asked on a 
recent post: "What exactly happens to make beer acquire this unwelcome 
character of 'skunkiness?' Is this phenomenon specific to green bottles?" 
</P>
<P>
 A chemist wrote back: "The skunking reaction is photochemical, and it's real." 
He said that he only uses brown bottles and described his own experiment when 
he left a clear bottle out in direct sun for two weeks. "Whew! The odor was not 
subtle. It smelled like a dead cat."  
</P>
<P>
 Rec.food.veg is a news group for vegetarians, and some are quite passionate 
about their life style. When one woman discovered she had accidentally bought a 
sausage-flavored vegetable protein round, she said "fifty hail-lentils as 
penance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other news groups include rec.food.sourdough , a group dedicated to baking the 
perfect loaf of bread; alt.coffee for coffee lovers; and both alt.bacchus and 
rec.food.drink for wine drinkers. Most groups have dozens of messages posted. 
</P>
<P>
 The rec.food.cooking group is a news group that answers questions about 
cooking . . . any question about cooking. "Has anyone accidentally (or even 
purposely) put metal in a microwave? What really happens?" One answer: "If the 
metal is near the side of the oven, the sparks can jump to the wall of the oven 
and cause damage." 
</P>
<P>
 In this group, a series of messages on the same topic, called a "thread," has 
been debating what is the most useless kitchen gadget. "A pineapple peeler and 
corer," replied one woman. "Mine is shaped and colored like a pineapple. A John 
Waters film is the only place for this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman had no use for a ginger grater. "I defy anyone to grate sensible 
quantities of ginger on one of these and not lose a knuckle," she grumbled. 
"Mine is made of bamboo -- how appropriate for a device that seems to be 
designed as an instrument of torture." 
</P>
<P>
 Rec.food.recipes is a group where cooks freely post their favorite home 
recipes. The recipe selection is an eclectic mixed bag, with a recipe for 
escargot butter followed by a recipe for pasta e fagioli . Cooks are very open 
about sharing their recipes. Either someone will post their favorite recipe, or 
a request will be made for a specific dish. Usually within a few days, an 
answer for the request will be posted. Rec.food.recipes is one of the easiest 
ways to find recipes on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also available on-line on the Internet is the USENET cookbook, a collection of 
recipes previously posted in the rec.food news groups. After you access the 
cookbook, a list of food titles appear. The titles are listed by subject -- 
appetizers, barbecue, beef/veal and so on. Make a choice and you get a list of 
previously posted recipes. One of the most interesting topics from the USENET 
cookbook is "miscellaneous," where you can get recipes for any type of 
celebration, and from various countries. A Mardi Gras menu is listed alongside 
recipes from Mexico and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Internet is so vast, several search programs, which help find 
files online, have been developed. The most-used search programs are Gopher and 
its sub-program Veronica. They both operate in roughly the same way. Depending 
on the Internet carrier used, you either call up the search program by name at 
the prompt, or choose it from the Internet menu. The program asks for a 
subject. After you type in a word or two, the program searches the computer 
databases for the files or titles. 
</P>
<P>
 When using the search programs, it definitely helps to be specific. When the 
word "food" was used as a topic search on Veronica, a list of more than 200 
entries scrolled down, with an additional 3,852 entries available. Not only 
were there recipes, but articles that just happen to have "food" in the title. 
Some were quite obscure: "Effects of Different Types of Food on Fecundity of 
Predacious Mites," and "Reaction of Young Carp to Food Flavors." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Food history is also covered on the Internet; simply access the news group 
rec.food.historic . "I have some 18th-Century English recipes that ask for a 
quarter-pint or a pint of 'ale-yeast,' " said one message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect what they mean is the sludge left in the bottom of the brewing 
vessel after the wort has been drawn off," someone offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good friend of mine would like to do a banquet with a Byzantine theme," 
asked another poster. 
</P>
<P>
 The only reply? "Me too!" 
</P>

 If the Internet seems too complicated, then try using one of the more 
commercial computer networks such as Prodigy, CompuServe or America Online -- 
which just recently added its own Internet gateway. Like the Internet, these 
networks have messages and files, but they're not as vast and are easier to 
move around in. 
</P>
<P>
 Each network offers a distinctive service. America Online has a celebrity 
cookbook in which users find recipes such as "Petula Clark's pots de cre me au 
chocolat ," or the diet hints of such stars as Lauren Hutton (she skips lunch) 
and Linda Evans (she has light beer with dinner). 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy features a special guest chef whom users can message directly. This 
month, Nancy Harmon Jenkins, author of "The Mediterranean Diet," is answering 
questions, as is Border Grill chef Mary Sue Milliken, who has been asked 
questions about black bean cake recipes and chiles verdes. Not all questions 
are so up-scale. Michael Roberts, then chef at Trumps, was once asked to supply 
the recipe for the "Bob's Big Boy fudge cake." 
</P>
<P>
 All three services offer a "chat" section, in which users can talk to each 
other in "real time" -- directly typing messages to each other. It's similar to 
talking on the phone, but all words are typed. Of the three services, only 
CompuServe has a chat line that is specifically set in the Cooks' forum. 
</P>

<P>
 With words such as "byte" and "menu" now common computer terms, it isn't a 
surprise that the culinary and on-line worlds would meet. A byte in cyberspace 
is as likely to mean something to eat as it is a piece of information.

THE INFINITE VEGETARIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What better vegetarian food is there than that of India?" asks Neelam Batra. 
"Indians can cook vegetarian every day of the year and not have to repeat a 
recipe." 
</P>
<P>
 This Santa Monica-based author and cooking teacher is loyal to her native 
cuisine -- and with good reason, having just written "The Indian Vegetarian" 
(Macmillan; $25) for those who want to incorporate new flavors in their own 
meatless cooking. The book is subtitled "Flavors for the American Kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 'I'm not aiming at the Indian market," says Batra. "They know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Batra includes fusion recipes such as paneer cheese fajitas (paneer is 
Indian-style homemade cheese), raita with avocado and toasted slivered almonds, 
and upside-down basmati rice cake with crispy ginger and onion. She suggests 
that certain sauces be served over pasta. It's a liberal approach that grew out 
of comments from her students and from her own experiments with the produce she 
buys each week at the Santa Monica farmers market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Batra fills her cloth shopping bags with green and yellow zucchini, lettuce, 
carrots, sugar snap peas, cauliflower, Asian pears, cilantro and whatever else 
is in prime shape, then incorporates these into Indian-style dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mushrooms go into grilled-mushroom-and-cheese sandwiches lightly flavored with 
curry powder. Apricots, peaches, kiwi and summer berries inspire a fruit salad 
seasoned with Indian chaat masala. And purple and gold potatoes wind up in a 
saute with dill or cilantro. In addition to these recipes, Batra also includes 
some for classical Indian dishes, many of them from her family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New Delhi, Batra moved to Los Angeles with her husband 21 years ago. 
At that time, Indian restaurants were rare in this city. Although she had never 
formally studied cooking, Batra had watched the preparation of dishes at home. 
Her mother had insisted on it. "I tried to recapture all my memories and 
started cooking," she said. She did it so well that a friend suggested she 
teach. For years now, Batra has taught cooking classes at Santa Monica City 
College and Montana Mercantile. 
</P>
<P>
 During lunch at Nawab in Santa Monica, Batra nibbled on grilled shrimp and 
chicken with saag (spiced greens); clearly, she is not a vegetarian. Batra had 
intended to write a comprehensive book including meats, but her publisher 
wanted the vegetarian angle. That was fine with Batra. "I have a way with 
vegetables," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Batra hopes to perk up the standard American "light" diet (which relies on 
salads and plain steamed vegetables) with nutritious, flavorful legumes, breads 
and paneer dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 In India, paneer is a plain, white cheese, but Batra has come up with 
innovative herb and spice-flavored variations. She uses basil-flavored paneer 
in a tossed green salad and suggests adding this low-fat cheese to pizza, pasta 
and stir-fries. She calls it "today's guilt-free cheese." 
</P>
<P>
 Batra's chapter on sauces departs from Indian custom. In India, sauces are 
part of each dish and are not prepared separately. Western cooks, on the other 
hand, create sauces to drizzle over food or serve on the side. Batra combines 
the two approaches with Indian-flavored sauces that can accompany a variety of 
dishes. Recipes range from classic curry sauce to a yogurt sauce with 
caramelized onion that can be used on pizza instead of tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Batra does adhere to some traditions. She came to lunch dressed in a lacy 
cotton sari trimmed in burgundy and gold and printed with peacocks, the 
national bird of India. And, like her mother, she uses a pressure cooker. As a 
matter of fact, she has five of them. 
</P>
<P>
 In India, where hospitality is a way of life, it is necessary to cook quickly 
for unexpected guests. Batra recalls her mother would expand a meal in a few 
minutes, using the pressure cooker. Batra uses hers for legumes, curries and 
even for caramel custard, a recipe included in the dessert chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although she nibbled with apparent immunity on a slice of raw serrano chile, 
Batra plays down the spiciness of Indian cuisine. "Contrary to popular belief, 
the vegetarian food cooked in homes in India as well as here is not very 
spicy," she said. "And it is not heavy on the stomach." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pistachios and almonds add rich taste to this unusual version of spinach 
salad. Batra credits the idea to Sunil Vora of the Clay Pit restaurant in Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 FRESH SPINACH SALAD WITH CUMIN-YOGURT DRESSING 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup shelled raw pistachios 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup nonfat plain yogurt, whisked until smooth 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup low-fat milk 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon ground roasted cumin seeds 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1 bunch spinach, trimmed of tough stems, rinsed and coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon paprika 
</P>
<P>
 Place pistachios in small saucepan and add water to cover. Bring to boil over 
high heat, then remove from heat and let soak 30 minutes. Drain. Transfer to 
kitchen towel and rub gently to remove skins. Set aside for garnish. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine yogurt, milk, lemon juice, cumin, salt and pepper. Place spinach in 
salad bowl and drizzle half of yogurt mixture on top. Top with pistachios and 
almonds. Sprinkle with paprika. Serve with remaining dressing on side. Makes 8 
servings.

 These mashed potatoes appear twice in Batra's book, first as a vegetable side 
dish, then as part of a spinach and cheese casserole.  
</P>
<P>
 CILANTRO MASHED POTATOES 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 pounds potatoes

butter, yogurt, cilantro, pepper and salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer to serving bowl. Garnish with cilantro sprigs, chives and serrano 
chiles. Makes about 6 servings.

 Colorful zucchini from a farmers market inspired this dish. Batra recommends 
buying whole coriander seeds -- the slightly green Indian variety -- at an 
Indian market and grinding them. "Ninety-nine percent of the time, packaged 
ground coriander does not have much flavor," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 BABY ZUCCHINI WITH SPICES 
</P>
<P>
 25 to 30 baby green and yellow zucchini, to equal 2 pounds 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon ground coriander 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon mango powder 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon dried mint leaves 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon paprika 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups 2-inch julienne strips sweet red and yellow peppers 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro, soft stems included 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse and dry each zucchini. With sharp knife slit each vertically from tip 
end to within 1/2 inch of stem, leaving stem intact. Do not cut zucchini in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 In small bowl mix coriander, cumin, mango powder, mint, paprika, cayenne and 
salt. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat. Add zucchini and 
cook, gently turning with kitchen tongs, until lightly browned on all sides. 
Cook in batches if necessary. Sprinkle over 3/4 of spice mixture and cook, 
shaking pan, 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove zucchini to serving platter, cover lightly and keep warm. Place 
julienned sweet peppers in same skillet and cook over moderately high heat 
until barely tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in remaining spice mixture and 
cilantro. Garnish zucchini platter with sweet peppers. Serve at once. Makes 8 
servings.

RABELAISIAN PLEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACQUELINE FRIEDRICH, Friedrich, who lives in the Loire, is working on a 
book about the food of the region. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I was born and raised in the garden of France, that is the Touraine," wrote 
Francois Rabelais, the author of "Gargantua and Pantagruel" and one of the 
fathers of the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabelais set much of the action in his books in Touraine, an ancient province 
that straddles the Loire River about 150 miles southwest of Paris. Gargantua 
drank in Chinon's wine cellars; Panurge sought "the truth" in the clear waters 
of the fountain of the town's Caves Painctes, or painted cellars, and the 
Picrochole war was fought on its surrounding hills, between the "kingdoms" of 
Seuilly and Lerne -- in reality, two farming villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabelais, born 500 years ago at La Deviniere, his family's country home just 
outside of Seuilly, was the complete Renaissance man. A Franciscan, then a 
Benedictine monk, he was also a doctor, a diplomat, a lecturer in Greek, an 
astrologer and, above all, a humanist. 
</P>
<P>
 And he was always in trouble. His books, thinly veiled satires of the pillars 
of society -- from Sorbonne academics to Vatican clerics -- were routinely 
censored (Calvin declared one "impious"), and Rabelais was occasionally exiled 
or imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when most of us think of Rabelais we think of bawdy feasting. A reliable 
chronicler of all things gastronomic, Rabelais describes meals with 
encyclopedic lists of dishes. What's surprising -- as well as heartening for 
those of us with a gloom-and-doom outlook for French cooking -- is that many of 
the regional foods described by Rabelais in the 16th Century are precisely the 
ones that figure most prominently in today's Sunday dinners in south-central 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite wars and revolutions, not to mention the banalization of many French 
foods, the Ur -Touraine meal still includes the rillettes , chevre and matelote 
de lamproie (wine stew of lamprey) that Rabelais noted. And they are washed 
down with Vouvray or Chinon, direct descendants of the wines his characters 
guzzle so zestfully. 
</P>
<P>
 " Rillettes are as old as the pig itself," claims Jacques Hardouin, a leading 
Tourangeau charcutier . This rough-textured mash of pork conserved in its own 
fat is documented as early as the 11th Century. In his painting "Les Heures 
Peintes Pour Anne de Bretagne," a 15th-Century artist chose the slaughter of 
the pig to illustrate the month of December and depicted, among other things, 
stoneware pots for rillettes . Another renowned Tourangeau, Honore de Balzac, 
speaks of rillettes with relish, noting that this "(brown confiture) formed the 
principal element of a Tourangeaux midmorning snack." 
</P>
<P>
 Rillettes are a style of charcuterie born in the western Loire, between 
Touraine and Anjou-Maine, whence come the two varieties -- the fine, burnished 
rillettes de Tours and the chunkier, fattier rillettes du Mans. To see how 
rillettes were made -- if not in Rabelais' time, perhaps in Balzac's, 250 years 
later -- I visited Marie Turpault on her farm in Anjou, some 20 minutes from 
Saumur, the town in which Balzac set his novel "Eugenie Grandet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1903, Turpault moved to her current home in 1923 and ever since has 
harvested its grapes and its wheat and tended its hens, cows, rabbits and pigs. 
While she no longer churns her own butter or grinds her own flour, Turpault is 
nearly as self-sufficient today as she was 50 years ago. Germain, her bachelor 
son, kills a pig a year. Turpault carves out cutlets, conserves the thigh in 
salt, puts it in a burlap sack and hangs it up the chimney where it will spend 
six weeks drying over the fire. From other morsels she makes boudins , 
andouilles and other sausages. Each pig also provides about 30 pounds of scraps 
and fatty parts, which Turpault puts in a cast-iron kettle with water and salt 
to cook before the fire for five or six hours to make rillettes. These 
rillettes are meaty and good and probably taste much as they did to Rabelais. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this kind of self-sufficiency is rare these days. As farming has 
become increasingly specialized since the end of World War II, farmers have 
focused on either wine or cheese making, cattle or cereal. At the same time, 
charcuterie has become ever more exclusively the business of the professional, 
a trend reinforced by European Community laws that regulate everything from 
feed to slaughter to the size of buildings, methods of manufacture, modes of 
sale and hygiene, hygiene, hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
 Rillons , an equally ancient Touraine staple, are large cubes of pork, salted 
and cooked for two hours until golden. In the neighboring province of Anjou, 
rillauds are made from the same components, simmered slowly in water and lard 
until the meat is fork-tender. Anjou claims that its gogue is among the first 
pork dishes ever created. Basic gogue consists of 15% to 20% each of blood, 
diced fat and lean pork and up to 60% onions, the whole then stuffed into a 
skin and simmered for four hours. More elaborate versions add Chinese cabbage, 
leeks and spring onions. Spicy and dense, with the bloody richness of boudin 
noir , gogue is usually grilled or sauteed and served with potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fressure , an ancient specialty of the Vendee region that makes delicious use 
of "variety cuts," was among the dishes Rabelais' "Gastrolatres" offered to 
their god Manduce. Head, heart and lungs are cooked with stale bread and onions 
and thickened with blood, forming a terrine-like block. It is served hot, like 
a hash. 
</P>
<P>
 It is natural that a moist, mild type of charcuterie developed in the moist, 
mild climate of Touraine, tempered by ocean air sucked up the Loire corridor. 
Loire goat cheeses tend to be moist too, softer, milder and fleshier than the 
herbal mountain chevres of Provence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fossils found near Vouvray indicate that goats have inhabited Touraine since 
before recorded history. Cheese-making became part of daily life during the 
Arab occupation. The Saracens brought their herds with them, and legend has it 
their women taught the craft to the inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days of mixed farming, goat cheese was made by farmers with small 
herds. You can still find them. One night I went in search of a hauntingly 
delicate chevre I'd tasted. As I entered a barn near Chinon, the last rays of 
sun outlined a man leaning against a pile of hay, languidly smoking a cigarette 
while his wife milked her goats by hand. The cheese I bought was aging on a 
basket hanging from a pulley in a cool shed. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, these rustic cheeses are not invariably the hauntingly delicate 
embodiments of our cheese fantasies. They range from exquisite to nearly 
inedible -- bitter or raunchy. Now, though, most agree that the qualitative 
differences between chevres have been leveled -- glorious cheeses are difficult 
to come by, but outright failures are rare too. Increasingly, chevres range 
from bland to very good, and a few are excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 Today there are more than 300 chevre producers in Touraine. An average farm is 
run by a couple with 60 milkers and 75 acres of land on which to grow clover, 
hay and barley to feed their herd. (Some goats pasture, but the trend is to 
keep them penned and feed them crops raised on the farm or locally.) Most milk 
or fresh cheese is sold to cooperatives or to the cheese merchants and dairies 
that dominate the business. But a growing number of producers age part of their 
output to sell at the farm and at markets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These chevres may be fresh and yogurt-y, firm and creamy or even hard as rock. 
They may be shaped like logs, pyramids, bricks or disks -- forms that date from 
the 19th Century. Some have no name, others have brand names, and still others 
claim an Appellation d'Origine Controllee or a Label Rouge, such as the 
log-shaped Ste. Maure, the Eiffel Tower-shaped Pouligny-St. Pierre, the 
disk-shaped Selles-sur-Cher, and the truncated pyramid Valencay. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Rabelais' day both goat's and cow's milk entered into many recipes such as 
leek fondues and spinach flans," notes Marie-Therese Renault, who, as a 
librarian for Chinon's schools, has researched the foods of Rabelais. "They 
were used to soften the flavor because the greens were nearly wild and were 
very strong." Also a caterer, Renault has prepared numerous Rabelais dinners. 
Spinach tart, a frequent starter, is often followed by civet d'oeufs , eggs 
poached in a red wine sauce, a dish that sounds like Rabelais' barbouille.  
</P>
<P>
 Local wine appears in many traditional dishes, from fish, poultry or game 
stews to cold soups of red wine, sugar and stale bread. One of the most popular 
dishes throughout the Loire is matelote , a stew of eel or lamprey in red wine 
that is nearly identical to Rabelais' lamprey in hippocras sauce, made from 
spiced and sweetened wine. ("Using hippocras was necessary in Rabelais' time 
when the wines were thin and acid," notes Renault. "Today's wines are richer 
and mellower.")  
</P>
<P>
 The Tourangeaux often garnish their matelotes with prunes and croutons fried 
in walnut oil. The Loire and its tributaries still supply eel and lamprey -- as 
well as the carp, pike and shad noted by Rabelais. But salmon, once the king of 
the Loire, is now rare, the victim of pollution, overfishing and excavations of 
the river bed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prunes and walnuts have suffered similar fates. Prunes, once a specialty of 
Chinon (where they predate those of the more famous Agen, says Renault), are no 
longer produced in the region, though they still figure in Tourangeau dishes 
such as noisettes of pork with a sauce of prunes and Vouvray. Hard frosts, 
followed by the reorganization of fields into large parcels (to accommodate new 
farm machinery), have killed off most of the walnut trees -- which, with the 
picking, shelling and pressing of oil, once set the winter calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Touraine remains, however, the garden of France -- or one of them. Some of the 
nation's most celebrated varieties of apples, pears and plums -- such as 
Reinette, Doyenne de Comice and Reine Claude, respectively -- were developed in 
the Loire's nurseries. (Rabelais, also a bit of a horticulturist, sent seeds of 
lettuces -- romaine and cress -- and melons from Italy.) Sadly, many of the old 
varieties of fruit have been eclipsed by the ubiquitous Delicious, and the 
slopes of Rabelais' Seuilly, once home to wine grapes, now produce the kiwis of 
nouvelle cuisine. But the ancestral fruit tarts, pastes and pies live on, as 
does the practice of cooking fresh fruit in wine or honey, or steeping them in 
eau de vie.  
</P>
<P>
 And while spices such as cinnamon, mace and saffron, used abundantly in 
medieval cookery, vanished from the kitchen in the middle of the 17th Century, 
Renault notes that they are beginning to come back. Other ancient foods are 
returning to the local menu too, such as pear and apple tapees -- fruit sliced, 
dried in ovens and reconstituted in spiced wine. More salmon are fished than 
were a decade ago. Gelines de Touraine (rustic, fine-boned black hens), nearly 
extinct until several producers began raising them, are now served by many of 
Touraine's top chefs. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rabelais' fouace bread appears with increasing frequency. No dish is more 
central -- plot-wise -- to Rabelais than the fouace . In "Gargantua," the 
fouace bakers of Lerne are transporting their goods to market one fine day when 
the shepherds of Seuilly stop them, asking to buy bread. The bakers refuse to 
sell, and war breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rabelais' recipe for a deluxe fouace -- an ancient bread whose name derives 
from panis focacius (dough cooked on the hearth) -- includes "fine butter, fine 
egg yolks, fine saffron, fine spices." Jacques Mahou, a baker in Tours, 
recreated the recipe in 1980 using bergamot, saffron and orange blossom water. 
Renault substitutes cinnamon for bergamot. The epicerie in Seuilly offers a 
simpler fouace -- a plain, oblong loaf. The Nantes fouace is a slightly sweet, 
dry cake shaped like a five-pointed star. 
</P>
<P>
 Related breads include the fouee , bits of leftover dough that puff as they 
cook, leaving hollow centers like pita, which are often filled with chevre or 
rillettes. The sweet fouace , now eaten at breakfast or tea, was traditionally 
linked with the harvest and new wine: The shepherds of Seuilly, after all, 
planned to eat their fouace with ripe Chenin Blanc grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine and Rabelais. Pick any chapter. Gargantua is born bawling "A drink!" An 
"eternity" of wine punctuates each epic course: claret, Beaune, Graves, and 
always the wines of Touraine. It is the Truly Drunk of "Gargantua," who, 
delighting in a suave white, swear: "That's a wine from La Deviniere, from the 
Pineau grape. By my soul, it's a wine of taffeta, well woven and of good yarn." 
No less appreciated is Rabelais' fresh "wine of Breton, which doesn't grow in 
Brittany but in this good land of Veron." 
</P>
<P>
 Five centuries later, Pineau de la Loire (Chenin Blanc) and Breton (Cabernet 
Franc) are still Touraine's leading grapes, and Veron is part of the Chinon 
appellation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chenin Blanc is the base of much of the Loire's sparkling wine. More 
significantly, it is the sole grape permitted for Vouvray and Montlouis as well 
as for the great whites of Anjou, among them Bonnezaux, Quarts de Chaume, 
Coteaux de Layon and Savennieres. These come in a range of sweetness, from 
bone-dry and off-dry to sweet and luscious as Sauternes. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Chenin Blanc wine is charming -- floral, honeyed, with scents of quince 
and apricot. It passes quickly from nubile youth to ornery adolescence. After, 
say, a decade it begins to reveal its endless complexity and succulence -- and 
keeps getting better. (I've sampled as far back as the 1890s.) Simultaneously 
taut and luscious, austere and voluptuous, it is constantly appetizing. You 
never get to the bottom of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabernet Franc is the principal grape of Chinon, Bourgueil, Saumur-Champigny 
(the current darling of Paris wine bars) and Anjou rouge. At the northern 
limits of viticulture, Loire reds tend to be lighter, brighter, less tannic 
than those from southern climes. A young one sometimes tastes of bell pepper, 
but more often surges with flavors of berries, cassis, plum and cherry. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinon and company age beautifully, too -- though not like Bordeaux. Chinon 
passes through a secondary phase when it fairly reeks of hung game. Then it 
seems to shed its baby fat, to be constantly refining itself, becoming a 
distillation of scents and nuances -- cinnamon, cre me de cassis , prunes, 
anise and sandalwood, dried flowers, mint and truffles, all the while retaining 
its vigor and mouth-watering freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Were Rabelais to taste modern Pineau and Breton, he wouldn't recognize the raw 
wines of his day. In the past century alone, numerous upheavals have shaken the 
foundations of winemaking -- from phylloxera to mechanization to the advent of 
artiste-vignerons . 
</P>
<P>
 He would feel right at home, however, in the caves of Chinon, where he has 
become a sort of patron saint, giving locals a license to eat, drink and be 
merry. His Caves Painctes is the home of the wine society, Les Entonneurs 
Rabelaisiens, which has turned organized carousing into a cottage industry. And 
despite a France with a strong "neo-prohibition" movement (not bad in a land 
that has never had a Prohibition to begin with), the Chinonais have adopted, 
literally, Rabelais' dictum: " Beuvez tousjours, vous ne mourrez jamais. " 
("Drink always, never die.")

 This cross between a brioche and a French country walnut bread is adapted from 
Jacques Mahou of Le Vieux Four, Tours. Mahou, whose family has been baking in 
Touraine since 1620, created this recipe from Rabelais' guidelines. Fouace is 
delicious at breakfast or tea time and is wonderful with fresh goat cheese.  
</P>
<P>
 RICH WALNUT BREAD (La Fouace de Rabelais) 
</P>
<P>
 2 packages dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups lukewarm milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon coarse salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 heaping tablespoon honey 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 3 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon orange blossom water 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon bergamot, or ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 Dash saffron, crumbled 
</P>
<P>
 4 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 7 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened to room temperature 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 In large mixing bowl combine yeast and milk, stirring to help dissolve. When 
milk begins to take on color of yeast, stir in salt and honey. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually stir in 3 cups whole-wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour. Add 
orange blossom water, bergamot and saffron. Add eggs one by one.  
</P>
<P>
 Turn onto floured board and knead 10 to 15 minutes. Add flour if dough is too 
sticky to work, but dough should be somewhat sticky and soft. Work in butter by 
tablespoon as for brioche dough. Knead to incorporate. Add walnuts and knead 
another 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Place dough in floured bowl, turning to cover all sides with flour. Cover bowl 
with plastic wrap. Let rise 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn bread out on board and divide. Form each half into ball or dome and place 
on baking sheet. Cover with kitchen towel. Let rise for another hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place ramekin with boiling water on bottom of 
oven. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to bake, dust top of each round with whole-wheat flour and, using 
sharp knife or kitchen shears, cut cross into top of each bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Place loaves in center of oven and reduce temperature to 425 degrees. Bake 30 
minutes, or until bottom of each loaf sounds hollow when tapped and tops are 
crusty and browned. Makes 2 loaves of about 8 servings each.

 "Cooking rillettes without a cover is what distinguishes rillettes de Tours 
from those of le Mans," maintains charcutier Jacques Hardouin. Hardouin uses 
only salt, Vouvray wine and Marc (brandy distilled from grape skins) to flavor 
his rillettes. You may want to add more spices. Traditionally, this would be 
made with half pork shoulder and half pork breast, but the latter is almost 
impossible to find in the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 RILLETTES DE TOURS AU VOUVRAY 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds pork shoulder 
</P>
<P>
 10 ounces fatback 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon coarse salt, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup dry Vouvray, or other white wine 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon Marc, or other brandy 
</P>
<P>
 Remove any remaining skin from pork and discard. Cut meat away from large 
bones. Cut in cubes of 1 inch or less. Cut fatback into 1/2-inch dice. 
</P>
<P>
 In cast-iron pot melt fatback over medium-high heat. Add cubes of meat 
gradually, stirring to color without burning. Stir in salt. Reduce heat as low 
as possible. If you cannot get heat low enough (fat should not come to boil), 
create double-boiler by putting pot inside larger pot filled with water. Let 
cook over extremely low flame 4 hours, stirring occasionally, about once every 
20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When big pieces of meat break apart easily, increase heat and stir 
continuously. Add white wine and Marc. Let wine evaporate, stirring 
continuously, 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from heat. Drain rillettes in sieve, separating fat from meat and 
reserving some fat. Pour rest of fat back into cast-iron pot. Let meat cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove any small bones and cartilage from meat. Coarsely crush pieces of meat 
with fork. Return meat to pot with fat. Bring back to boil. Let boil 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool mixture, stirring regularly so fat and meat blend and fat whitens. When 
mixture becomes homogenous but still soft, ladle rillettes into pots or 
conserve jars. 
</P>
<P>
 Melt reserved fat and pour thin film over each pot. Covered with film of fat, 
rillettes will keep in refrigerator 1 month. Bring to room temperature before 
serving. Makes 3 1/2 cups. Each 1-tablespoon serving contains about:

 Replacing figs with prunes, Marie-Therese Renault adapted this recipe from a 
cookbook written by the great medieval chef Taillevent . She serves the pears 
with dry, spiced cookies at medieval dinners. They would go well with biscotti 
and ice cream too. Make this the night before and bring to room temperature 
just before serving.  
</P>
<P>
 SPICED PEARS (Poires aux Epices) 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups water 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons honey 
</P>
<P>
 7 sticks cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon ground mace 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon anise seeds 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons raisins, steeped in hot water 
</P>
<P>
 15 prunes, pitted, steeped in 1/2 cup tea 
</P>
<P>
 6 pears, peeled, cored and cut into quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 In pot, boil water with honey 10 to 15 minutes so mixture reduces slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Add cinnamon, mace, anise and clove to honey syrup. Let reduce 15 to 20 
minutes. Add drained raisins and prunes, cut into 2 or 3 pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Add pears and gently baste with cooking juices without stirring. Let mixture 
simmer until fruit is firm but knife can easily be inserted, about 10 minutes, 
depending on type and ripeness of pears. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 275 calories; 3 mg sodium; 0 cholesterol; 1 gram fat; 72 grams carbohydrates; 
2 grams protein; 4.08 grams fiber.

 Insects have nothing to do all day but find ways of getting into grain, so 
grain nearly always contains some insect stuff. Above a certain level, it 
becomes unfit for human consumption. The usual inspection method (checking 
samples with a microscope) has flaws, though -- it counts a large insect 
fragment the same as a small one, and it can't find eggs and larvae tucked 
inside kernels. Now researchers at the University of Texas have developed a 
more accurate test based on measuring the amount of myosin, a muscle protein 
present at all stages of an insect's life. It works sort of like a home 
pregnancy test: Inspectors add a reagent to a sample and observe how much the 
color changes. Happy Birthday, H.J.

 This year is the 125th anniversary of H.J. Heinz Co., which makes a lot more 
than 57 varieties these days. In the beginning, of course, there was only one 
variety -- horseradish -- and the Heinz company actually went broke for a while 
in 1875. It shrewdly added ketchup to the lineup the next year, though, and 
never looked back. Coke au Vin

 "Classic Cooking With Coca-Cola" (Hambleton-Hill; 1994) is a follow-up to 
Elizabeth Candler Graham's book "The Real Ones," which was about her family, 
the descendants of Coca-Cola mogul Asa Briggs Candler. The new book is a 
collection of 300 Coke-oriented recipes. Just under half call for Coke itself, 
the rest using Coke-owned products such as Sprite, Tab, Fresca or Minute Made 
orange juice -- but there certainly are recipes for goulash, gumbo, a meat 
marinade and even microwave French onion soup made with Coke, plus lots of 
knowledgeable lore on the Coca-Cola Co. In bookstores. Strictly Transcendental

"Tell me what you eat and I shall tell you what you are"). How deluxe? Every

 It's generally illegal to kill hippopotamus these days, but some people used

 The city of Los Angeles has already been wired onto the information highway. 
La.eats, a news group on the Internet, covers local restaurants and dining in 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelenos enthusiastically share the names of their favorite restaurants. Care 
for some prime rib? Several people recommend Lawry's on La Cienega, or Tam o' 
Shanter in Los Feliz. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sushi, Ike's, located "on the northeastern corner of Hollywood and Gower, 
between a Domino's outlet and a schwarma joint," receives rave reviews. "Ike's 
ROCKS!!" exclaims the post. "Not cheap, but incredibly high-quality fish. I 
wouldn't call him conservative, just traditional. His special dishes are always 
elegant and surprising -- you'll find yourself eating and liking things you 
never thought you'd put in your mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 One vegan poster gives a nod to the Golden Health Foods Cafe, which 
specializes in raw/live food and serves no meat. Raw/live refers to food that, 
if planted, could actually grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there's more than one L.A. Eats available on-line. On the Los 
Angeles Macintosh Group bulletin board, there's a folder called "On The Town," 
which is where members post recommendations about various businesses. A 
sub-folder in the same section, called "L.A. Eats," covers the same topics as 
the Internet la.eats news group. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded only about six months ago, the LAMG "L.A. Eats" has members asking for 
a list of non-chain restaurants open 24 hours (the Pantry, Canter's, Ben 
Frank's, Larry Parker's, Pacific Dining Car, Izzy's Deli, Santa Monica Cafe and 
Jerry's Delis got the most responses), the best Mexican and Indian restaurants, 
and even where to eat in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Others share tips. Old Town Pasadena is frequently mentioned as a good dining 
spot. A recent message recommended Kansai on Fair Oaks for traditional Japanese 
food and offered a glossary of terms to help translate the menu. ELLEN KOSUDA

WINE: THE SLOWLY CHANGING WORLD OF SACRAMENTAL WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the priest offers the chalice at Communion, chances are the wine inside 
is not a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon but a sweet blended wine, fortified 
with brandy, from the San Joaquin Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Sacramental wine, which has been part of religious ceremonies for centuries, 
has changed very little over time. And Napa Valley Specialty Wines, the 
national leader in sales of altar wine, says trends in this tiny and nearly 
invisible segment of the wine business move as slowly as the wines do. 
</P>
<P>
 Napa Valley Specialty Wines distributes about 65,000 cases of Mount LaSalle 
Altar Wine nationally, an 8% increase over 1990. You've probably never seen a 
bottle, though, since it is sold almost exclusively at church goods stores. All 
Mount LaSalle wines are sealed with screw caps, and most are sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, however, Napa Valley Specialty Wines will release a small amount of 
1992 Mount LaSalle Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and a 1992 Sonoma County 
Chardonnay. The bottles have corks. And the wines are dry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We think these wines will serve the domestic needs of priests and other 
clergy," says Napa Valley Specialty president Jim Cox. "As the clergy gets 
younger, the older tastes for sweeter wines may fade, and we want to have a dry 
wine for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cox holds little hope this move toward dry wine will invade the church: 
"Sacramental wine is an amazingly conservative business," he says. "It changes 
very little." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramental wine has been around for centuries, but its only real heyday in 
this country came during Prohibition, between 1920 and 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were certain permitted uses for 'non-beverage wine' during 
Prohibition," says Thomas Pinney, an historian of the early U.S. wine industry 
and professor at Cal Poly Pomona. "There were medicinal uses, sacramental uses 
and wine for flavoring food." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the sacramental use of wine became widely popular. "Suddenly a 
lot of religious communities sprang up," Pinney says, "and the use of 
sacramental wine rose."  
</P>
<P>
 However, even at its height, altar wine sales never exceeded more than about 1 
1/2 million cases in a single year, Pinney says. And even that figure plummeted 
when authorities cracked down on the dubious use of the product in communities 
that were clearly not primarily religious. 
</P>
<P>
 Although altar wine wasn't a huge industry, it did save a number of wineries 
during Prohibition. Beaulieu Vineyard in the Napa Valley, for instance, 
remained in business by making and selling altar and kosher wines. "(BV owner 
Georges) de la Tour had excellent connections with the Catholic hierarchy," 
says Pinney. BV made altar wine well into the 1950s, before refocusing on dry 
table wine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Brothers winery also flourished during Prohibition by making 
altar wine. This Catholic teaching order, formally called the Brothers of the 
Christian Schools, used profits from the sale of all its wines to fund more 
than a dozen schools. In fact, the altar wine business, which became so 
substantial during Prohibition, remained a major part of the company's business 
until Heublein Wines acquired the company in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was this sacramental wine business, including the use of the Mount LaSalle 
brand name, that was bought from Heublein by Cox, Hardy and two partners in 
January, 1990. It was a gamble, says Hardy, because church attendance was in 
decline and some inner-city churches were closing, which could have reduced 
altar wine sales. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sales never dropped. Hardy attributes that to two factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (the Catholic church) reformed the Mass," he says, "they went to an 
optional Communion where the parishioners can actually drink from the chalice. 
That meant they began to use a greater volume of wine than when the priest was 
simply dipping wafers in it. And what has happened too is that as some of these 
churches closed, the people simply moved to the neighboring church." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the altar wine business remains quite small. There are no firm figures, 
but most agree that no more than 150,000 cases of sacramental wine are sold in 
the United States annually -- a tenth of its Prohibition-era peak. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second largest altar wine firm in the nation is Los Angeles' San Antonio 
Winery, which bottles about 50,000 cases of such wine under its own brand as 
well as for the Cribari family. Between them, Napa Valley Specialty and San 
Antonio account for about 80% of all the sacramental wine sold in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, most altar wine was called Angelica or Muscatel or Tokay or Port. 
Steve Riboli, vice president of San Antonio, says there is a recent trend to 
lower-alcohol wines, and to lighter-styled pink and red wines. "And (the 
priests are) using them other than in the Mass," he adds. "They're having them 
at the table too." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of Napa Valley Specialty's sales are in table wines, but almost 
all are fairly sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles firm of Cotter Church Goods, Mike Cotter says there is 
little demand for dry table wine for sacramental use. He says his typical altar 
wine client still likes the sweeter, heavier, fortified wine for sacramental 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy said 85% to 90% of his firm's wine is sold to Catholic clergy, with the 
remainder sold to Lutheran, Orthodox and Episcopal churches. Cribari and Hardy 
say Lutherans and Episcopalians use more Port than drier wine, and that Spanish 
and Italian priests prefer red wine. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hardy adds, "What the priests buy for their table and for their 
chalice may be two different things." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy says his firm's altar wines generate about $1.6 million in gross sales 
and that the firm has been profitable from the day his company bought it. "But 
there aren't many people who want to compete in this area, because the (profit) 
margins are considerably lower than most wineries would expect," he says. "We 
are in the 20% profit range, and most wineries shoot for 30% to 35%." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy says his company considered making kosher wine, but found that "though 
the American Jewish community has a long tradition of wine use, it's primarily 
in the home, not in the house of worship. So it was not a market for us to move 
into." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there are more restrictions in making a kosher wine than in 
making an altar wine. Kosher wine must be made according to strict guidelines, 
some of which are open to interpretation, depending on who's making the wine. 
Hardy said the definition of an altar wine is simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a section in canon law that defines altar wine, but basically it 
must be pure wine made only from grapes, so technically most wines made in 
California would qualify," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It can never be known how much wine is actually used for sacramental purposes, 
since a priest could buy wine from a local grocery store, if he desired, and 
use it sacramentally without violating canon law. In fact, says Riboli of San 
Antonio, a number of churches regularly order a few bottles of a fine Chianti 
along with sweeter wines. "They like the way it tastes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet wine, however, remains the traditional wine for the Communion chalice. 
Says Hardy: "If a pastor starts out using Mount LaSalle Angelica at the altar, 
chances are he'll use it for his entire life." Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Vegni Rosso ($7) -- The hills of Tuscany are strewn with vineyards canted 
at odd angles. The larger wine producers have buildings with distinctly Tuscan 
architecture, but one Chianti landmark is a plain brick block schoolhouse. 
Capezzina-Cortona is an enology school founded in 1885 by Dr. Angelo Vegni and 
now operated by Domenico Petracca. The enology students here make small amounts 
of commercial wine every year. In the last few vintages, production not only 
has expanded, the product has become excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 Made almost entirely of Sangiovese grapes, Vegni Rosso might be compared to a 
fine, lighter-styled Chianti. However, the label (which depicts a drawing of 
the school's main building) says simply Vino da Tavola di Toscana . 
</P>
<P>
 There is a light red color, a marvelously fruity nose with slight plummy, 
anise and black-cherry notes, and a soft taste and tart finish -- a perfect 
foil for tomato-based dishes. Though 1992 wasn't a great vintage for Chianti, 
this wine is a tasty treat and occasionally may be discounted to $6 or so. A 
companion wine, 1993 Chardonnay ($10), has lovely melon, lime and spice 
components and a delicate, crisp finish. Imported by Monte Bianco Imports of 
San Francisco.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trip to a local farmers market provided much of the inspiration for this 
dish. Sweet red peppers, zucchini, yellow squash, a bunch of chicory and 
bouquets of fresh rosemary were abundant. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, I combined these ingredients with carrots, leeks, potatoes and celery 
from my refrigerator and cannellini beans from my cupboard. The vegetables, 
simmered in chicken stock flavored with a little tomato puree and spicy 
seasonings, were fork-tender after an hour of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 To go with the soup, serve a salad of spinach, sliced sweet red onions and 
artichoke hearts, all tossed in a lemon-garlic dressing, served with a loaf of 
crusty sourdough bread bought at a local bakery. VEGETABLE SOUP WITH PARMESAN 
CHEESE 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup diced carrots

 1/4 cup tomato puree 
</P>
<P>
 2 sweet red peppers, stems and seeds discarded, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 3 medium red potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups packed chicory, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 small zucchini, cut in half lengthwise and then cut into 1/4-inch slices 
</P>
<P>
 2 small yellow squash, cut in half lengthwise and then cut into 1/4-inch 
slices 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 1 (4- to 6-ounce) piece imported Parmesan cheese, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
 6 fresh rosemary sprigs, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil in large heavy pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 
carrots, leeks and celery. Cook, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes. Add 
garlic, thyme, rosemary, salt and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir 1 minute. 
Add stock, tomato puree, red peppers, potatoes and 1 cup chicory. Stir to 
blend. Bring mixture to simmer. Reduce heat. Cover and cook at simmer until 
potatoes and sweet red peppers are tender, about 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove 1 1/2 cups of soup and puree in food processor, blender or food mill. 
Stir puree into soup. Add zucchini, squash, beans and remaining 1 cup chicory. 
Cook until vegetables are tender, 6 to 10 minutes more. Adjust seasonings to 
taste. Soup can be made 2 days ahead, cooled, covered and refrigerated. Reheat, 
stirring often, until hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladle soup into 6 individual soup bowls. Shave strips from Parmesan cheese, 
using vegetable peeler. Arrange 4 to 5 cheese strips on top of soup in each 
bowl. Garnish each with fresh rosemary sprig. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : Extra tomato puree can be frozen and saved for another use.

AMERICA'S BEST: CAL'S CURDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After Calvin Coolidge was sworn in as our 30th President in 1923, he and his 
father strolled down the street for a bottle of soda pop to celebrate. When 
they finished, the new President set a nickel on the counter and said to his 
father: "Here, this is for my share." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coolidge family still practices such fiscal conservatism. At Plymouth 
Cheese, the company founded in 1890 by Col. John Calvin Coolidge (the 
President's father) and now owned and managed by John Coolidge, the President's 
88-year-old son, the wonderful, old-fashioned cheese is shipped wrapped in 
layers of newspaper and packed in a recycled cardboard box.  
</P>
<P>
 The handmade, granular-curd Plymouth cheese is made with all natural 
ingredients and unpasteurized milk. The flavor is tangy and rich, with the fine 
bite of Cheddar, but the texture is a bit more crumbly because the curds aren't 
as compressed. Plymouth cheese comes in mild, medium and extra-sharp or with 
sage, garlic or caraway added. A five-pound wheel of extra-sharp costs $32.35 
delivered west of the Mississippi -- a luxury even the thriftiest shopper would 
appreciate.

GARDEN FRESH: PARADISE PRESERVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quinces, Aphrodite's apples, are at once patrician and earthy. The fruit, 
golden as the sun, resembles a rumpled pear covered with downy bloom -- the 
dust of centuries. A ripe quince's perfume is a mix of musk and jasmine, 
lilacs, guavas and apples. The scent from a bowl can fill a room and drive you 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 How is it that a fruit the ancients revered, a fruit still esteemed around the 
world, is neglected here? Probably because the pale flesh of raw quinces is 
rough and astringent. But poach slices in syrup, stew chunks with honey, brush 
halves with sweet butter and slowly roast them, and their rosy color and 
complex perfume will fill your senses. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether in leaf or winter's bareness, the quince tree makes a fine specimen. 
Limbs are dark and lightly crooked; fruit dangles * Jonathan Gold and Counter 
Intelligence are on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 brightly on the bough. Trees grow slowly to 10 feet, but you can keep them at 
six to seven. And you can grow a tree in a half-barrel. In spring, there are 
cream-to-blush blossoms the size of a doll's teacup. Spring through fall, broad 
oval leaves are new-green -- in late autumn, they turn pumpkin and flutter to 
the ground. Don't have a place for a tree? Coax yours into a handsome shrub, 
perhaps against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quinces are self-fruitful and need no pollinizer -- one tree alone makes 
fruit. Quince has modest chilling requirements, so it's that rare pome fruit 
that thrives in balmy climates. Quinces actually prefer moist, heavy soil -- 
clay people, rejoice! 
</P>
<P>
 An old wives' tale has it that quinces thrive on neglect. Forget it -- nothing 
and nobody does! All they ask for is sun and a fair amount of water. Happily in 
Southern California, the trees are little bothered by disease. Should you have 
a problem, consult a local county agricultural adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Now's a good time to buy a potted tree and set it in the garden, or (less 
expensive) order bare-root for delivery in spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinces ripen in September and October. Orange quinces are large and roundish, 
with deep golden flesh that turns the richest red of all when cooked. Pineapple 
quinces have a hint of pineapple in their white flesh. Less tart than 
Pineapple, Smyrna has pale-yellow flesh and keeps especially long. Green-gold 
Champion has delicately flavored flesh. Van Deman, Burbank's cross between 
Orange and Portugal, produces ample spicy fruit. Cook's Jumbo has white flesh 
and is enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the turn of the century, quince trees flourished in America's gardens 
and quinces were common in the kitchen. In "The Joy of Cooking" editions of the 
'30s, '40s and '50s, Irma S. Rombauer had a recipe for a quince liqueur she 
described as "given by a French priest to his friends." As a recipe in a book 
ought, it mirrors the times: Four quarts of ground quinces stirred into three 
gallons of rye whiskey. Along with cherry bounce, blackberry cordial and peach 
brandy, the cleric's liqueur was pulled from later editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Though one quince recipe was ejected, another was added. To me, paradise jelly 
has only one rival -- the fabulous currant preserve from Bar-le-Duc in northern 
France. Over the years, as cooks do, I've fiddled with Rombauer's recipe. I use 
crabapples for their incomparable jelly-making quality, and I add tiny seeds of 
vanilla bean. The whiff of vanilla is marvelous, and the specks suspended in 
the rose jelly are enticing. Sometimes, instead of vanilla, I lay a lemon, rose 
or nutmeg geranium leaf in the jar before pouring in the jelly. 
</P>
<P>
 These days you won't find many recipes for quince in books, but you can use 
quinces in any recipe calling for apples. For example, inspired by Cecil 
Beaton's iced apples in "The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book," I made a divine 
dessert by poaching thin slices of fruit -- half-apples/half-quinces -- in 
lemon-flavored syrup until translucent, chilling them 24 hours in a deep dish, 
then unmolding them. Their pectin holds the shape and their color is 
breathtakingly rosy. Serve with custard sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember to add gratings of quince to compositions of apples or pears -- 
particularly pies, tarts and puddings. They'll turn it rosy. And don't forget 
the exotic uses of fruit with meats -- quinces are superb with lamb and beef. 
Then look into chutneys and pickles, liqueurs and cordials, quince wine . . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you've never tasted quince, get yourself to a market with a European, 
Latino or Middle Eastern clientele and ask for a tin of Mexican dulce de 
membrillo , French cotignac or Greek pastokithonia -- or there may be ayva 
helvasi from Turkey or something from Morocco. This is the quintessence of 
quince, a sweetened puree slowly cooked down to jellied candy. My husband has 
made it, a labor of love. But then, it is Aphrodite's fruit.

discolors as quickly as apple and pear, so keep pieces in a bowl of water with 
a splash of lemon juice. Do not core fruit, as stems and seeds have pectin and 
will be removed during draining anyway.  
</P>
<P>
 To waste not one whit of paradise jelly makings, I make paradise jam with the 
contents of the dripping bags. It's homely but delectable. Puree the leftover 
fruits together, then press them through a fine sieve to retrieve the gritty 
bits. Combine in a heavy saucepan: four measures puree, three measures sugar, 
and a small lump of unsalted butter. Stir with a wooden spoon over low heat 
until thick -- watch so it doesn't scorch. A scented geranium leaf in the jar 
is a fine addition. Pot up and process as you do the jelly.  
</P>
<P>
 PARADISE JELLY 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/4 pounds quinces, fuzz rubbed off 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds crabapples or use juicy, slightly tart apples such as Gravenstein, 
McIntosh or Jonathan 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup picked-over cranberries 
</P>
<P>
 Cool water 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 vanilla bean, slit in half lengthwise, seeds scraped out 
</P>
<P>
 Coarsely chop quinces and crab-apples separately, cutting pieces same size.  
</P>
<P>
 Separately cook quinces, crab-apples and cranberries in 3 nonreactive 
saucepans, with water to barely cover each fruit. Bring to boil, turn heat to 
low and simmer until fruits are soft but not mushy. Overcooking reduces pectin. 
</P>
<P>
 Line each of 3 strainers with dampened kitchen cloth and set over 3 bowls. 
Turn in fruits and let drip. When dripping slows, tie cloths into bags and 
suspend over bowls to finish dripping overnight. Do not squeeze bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine sugar and vanilla seeds, using back of spoon to separate clumps and 
mix seeds evenly through sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 In large, heavy, nonreactive saucepan, combine 2 cups crabapple juice, 1 1/2 
cups quince juice and 2/3 cup cranberry juice (reserve excess juice for another 
jelly). Bring to boil over medium heat and simmer 5 minutes. Skim off froth. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn heat to low and mix in sugar. Stir with wooden spoon, meanwhile washing 
down any sugar crystals that form on sides of pan with brush moistened with 
cold water (this keeps crystals from forming in jelly later). 
</P>
<P>
 When sugar has dissolved, raise heat until syrup simmers rapidly. Cook without 
stirring until syrup reaches 222 degrees on candy thermometer, or until 
spoonful of syrup, turned on its side over pan, slides off in sheet, about 12 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from heat and skim off any foam. Immediately pour into sterilized 
canning jars, leaving 1/4-inch head space. Wipe rims, set on new lids and screw 
rings on tightly. Set in kettle and cover with hot water by 1 inch. Cover, 
bring to boil and boil 5 minutes. At high altitude, add 1 minute for every 
1,000 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
 Lift out jars and set away from draft to cool undisturbed overnight. Check 
seal; center of lid should not wobble when pressed. If it does, replace lid and 
boil jar as before or keep jar refrigerated. Store in cool, dry place. Makes 5 
(8-ounce) jars.

GOOD COOKING: STEAK AND BAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two great aspects to family dinners -- togetherness and home-cooked 
food. Many families have their own favorite family-dinner dishes; so does ours. 
</P>
<P>
 Baked steak used to be one of those main dishes reserved for family dinners, 
especially Sunday-night suppers. Basically, it's a thick sirloin or T-bone 
steak that is well seasoned, quickly seared by broiling and then baked with a 
topping of seasoned-up ketchup, sliced onion and green pepper. The steak bakes 
until medium rare with a delicious flavor and exceptional juiciness. More than 
that, it bakes without much attention from the cook and can be completely set 
up in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 To balance today's steak plate, consider the recipe for a tasty grain pilaf of 
bulgur wheat and rice with mixed vegetables. No need to overload on the steak. 
If you prefer something simpler than the pilaf, buttered noodles (even 
macaroni) or baked potatoes work well. A green Romaine salad with robust 
dressing completes the dinner menu. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Streusel pear kuchen with fresh ginger is a homey dessert that always hits the 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The success of this recipe depends on a top - quality 1 1/2-inch - thick 
sirloin or T-bone steak. The steak can be seasoned and the sauce made ahead, 
refrigerating both until the final cooking just before dinner. Alternately, the 
steak can be seared and refrigerated overnight with the sauce spread over it.  
</P>
<P>
 FAMILY BAKED STEAK 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1 1/2-inch-thick) sirloin or T-bone steak, about 2 3/4 pounds, well trimmed 
of all fat on outer edge 
</P>
<P>
 Ketchup Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 In small bowl combine garlic, pepper and salt. Rub over entire surface of 
steak. Place steak in plastic food bag, seal tightly and refrigerate 2 to 24 
hours.  
</P>
<P>
 Remove steak from plastic food bag and place on shallow broiling pan. Sear 
steak on both sides under hot broiler 4 inches from flame, about 2 to 3 minutes 
per side. Transfer to 2-quart shallow baking dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour Ketchup Sauce over steak. Steak can be baked immediately or refrigerated 
overnight. Bring to room temperature before baking. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake steak on center oven rack at 375 degrees 30 minutes, basting midway with 
juices that collect in bottom of dish. Use sharp knife to cut through steak and 
to check for medium rare. If steak requires more cooking, lower temperature to 
325 degrees and continue cooking until meat is cooked as desired, basting once. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from oven. Allow to stand 10 minutes. Slice and serve with sauce 
spooned over top. Makes 6 servings.

</P>
<P>
 1 large onion, quartered and thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 green pepper, cored, quartered and thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup ketchup 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
 Dash Louisiana-style hot sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Combine onion, pepper, ketchup, Worcestershire, cumin, hot sauce and ground 
pepper in 1-quart saucepan. Simmer gently until onion and green pepper are 
cooked through, about 7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rice perks up the texture and appearance of the bulgur wheat, a brown grain 
with a tender texture. Bulgur wheat consists of wheat kernels that have been 
steamed, dried and crushed.  
</P>
<P>
 BULGUR WHEAT AND RICE PILAF 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups chopped onions 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup chopped carrots 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup chopped celery 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup bulgur wheat 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup rice 
</P>
<P>
 2 2/3 to 3 cups low-salt chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, add onions, 
carrots and celery. Cook until very hot and fragrant, about 4 minutes, stirring 
often. Add bulgur wheat, rice and 2 2/3 cups broth. Bring to boil. Simmer, 
covered, until liquid is absorbed and grains are tender, about 15 minutes. Add 
remaining broth, if needed. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  
</P>
<P>
 Pilaf can be made day ahead and refrigerated. Let come to room temperature 
before reheating. Reheat, covered, in 350-degree oven until hot, about 20 
minutes, adding water if pilaf becomes too dry. Alternately, gently reheat in 
microwave oven. Adjust seasonings to taste. Makes 6 servings.

 Here, fall pears take center stage in a baked dessert that looks like a tart 
but is much easier to prepare. The dough is patted into the pan, no rolling 
necessary. Be sure that the pears are ripe but firm, not squishy. You may have 
to leave them out on the counter for a day or two. Rock-hard pears will not 
become tender in this recipe.  
</P>
<P>
 STREUSEL PEAR KUCHEN WITH FRESH GINGER 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>

uniformly crumbed.  
</P>
<P>
 Pat all but 1/2 cup mixture evenly onto bottom and up sides of greased 9-inch 
tart pan with removable bottom. Place on baking sheet. Set in freezer 10 
minutes to firm up crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, add remaining 3 tablespoons light-brown sugar to 1/2 cup mixture 
remaining in food processor. Pulse until combined but still coarsely 
granulated. Refrigerate until ready to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake tart shell on center oven rack at 375 degrees until lightly browned, 
about 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange pear slices overlapping each other in spiral pattern on bottom of hot 
crust, starting with outer edge and working toward center. Ladle Custard 
Filling into tart around edges and into any spaces. It is OK if filling spills 
onto pears. Sprinkle reserved crust mixture evenly over top. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake until custard sets and pears are lightly golden, about 50 minutes. Remove 
from oven. Cool on rack 10 minutes. Remove sides of pan. Cool completely. Serve 
at room temperature with whipped cream. Makes 1 (9-inch) kuchen, or about 8 
servings.

GENTLE BEANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New York author Rynn Berry is so intent on researching vegetarianism that he 
lived for three months with a Jain family in Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
 The most distinctive feature of the Jain religion, founded in the 6th Century 
BC by an elder contemporary of the Buddha, is its single-minded devotion to the 
principle of ahimsa (non-injury to animate beings). This has made the Jains 
India's most rigorous vegetarians. Their regime even prohibits eating root 
vegetables, for fear some tiny animal might be injured when the roots are 
pulled from the earth. Jain dishes must be eaten within 24 hours of preparation 
because of the danger of consuming microorganisms that would start to appear in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dishes from Berry's Jain hostess, Shakuntala Jain, appear in his book, 
"Famous Vegetarians and Their Favorite Recipes" (Pythagorean Publishers: 
$14.95). They are dal bhaat (rice with lentils) and spiced green beans. Both 
are in the chapter devoted to Mahavira, the founder of Jainism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jain food "has a reputation for being among the most exquisite of Maharashtran 
cuisines," says Berry. (Maharashtra is the Indian state in which Bombay is 
located.) Although Jains cannot season with onion and garlic, the cooking is 
not flat-tasting. "They compensate in other ways," Berry says. "They are expert 
in spicing." Oddly, Jains are willing to use ginger, although it too is a root 
crop. Only dried ginger is allowed, however. RICE WITH LENTILS (Dal Bhaat) 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup moong dal (mung beans) 
</P>
<P>
 Water 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon dry ginger 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon garam masala 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Large dash asafoetida 
</P>
<P>
 1 tomato, chopped, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 
</P>
<P>
 Chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 Cooked basmati rice 
</P>
<P>
 Clean and pick over dal by hand. Rinse dal and place in pot. Add 4 1/2 cups 
water, bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer over medium heat until dal begins 
to disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Use fork or spatula to mash dal until consistency of thick soup. Add 
coriander, ginger, turmeric, garam masala, pepper, asafoetida and tomato. 
Season to taste with salt. Cook 5 minutes longer. Add more water if mixture 
becomes too thick. Consistency should be soft. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in small pan. Add cumin seeds. When seeds begin to splutter, remove 
pan from heat and quickly pour over cooked dal. Garnish with cilantro. Serve 
over hot basmati rice. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

SCALLOPS COOKED JUST RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are only two ways to ruin the tender, sweet scallop -- cook it too long, 
and let it sit after cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 With that said, scallops are the perfect base for a 15-minute spaghetti 
dinner.Unlike reputedly fast recipes in which the sauce is started before the 
pasta, this recipe requires the reverse, since the seafood cooks in minutes. 
Remove scallops from the heat as soon as they've turned from milky to chalk 
white and feel firm to the touch. Do not overcook. 
</P>
<P>
 In about the time it takes to read the directions for a frozen dish and zap 
it, you can have a sweet, hot and slightly nutty-tasting spaghetti dinner. 
SCALLOPS WITH BACON AND SPAGHETTI 
</P>
<P>
 8 ounces spaghetti 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 4 strips bacon 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound scallops 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup minced watercress 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cook spaghetti in large pan of boiling salted water according to package 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fry bacon in medium skillet until crisp. Remove bacon to 
paper-towel-lined plate. Set aside. Discard all but 1 tablespoon bacon fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut scallops in half or into bite-size pieces. Add to skillet along with 
crushed red pepper flakes. Cook over medium-high heat until scallops are white 
and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When spaghetti is tender but slightly firm in center, drain well. Add 
spaghetti to skillet. Add watercress. Crumble bacon and add to skillet. Season 
lightly with salt and generously with white pepper. Serve immediately. Makes 2 
servings.

MORE MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for the delightful memories you brought back with the articles on 
wonderful Las Angeles restaurants of the past ("Celebration of Restaurants 
Past," Sept. 29). May I add two of my old-time favorites -- the Spanish Kitchen 
on Beverly Boulevard and the "old" Taix French restaurant. The section was a 
grand trip down a gastronomic memory lane. 
</P>
<P>
 -- PATRICIA BERMAN, Oceanside 
</P>
<P>
 Your article proved nostalgic to so many of us. Many a night our motorcycles 
headed out to Lincoln Heights to Ptomaine Tommy's open-all-night restaurant. 
We'd cross the sawdust-covered floor to the captain's chairs stationed at 
wrap-around counters and feast on their chili size, a huge hamburger smothered 
with mouth-watering chili, topped with chopped onions and served with oyster 
crackers. And what about the Chili Bowls (shaped like real bowls) located all 
over Los Angeles. If Jonathan Gold's cast-iron stomach ever gives out, I'll 
join his many fans and contribute to getting him back on his feet, so he can 
eat and eat! 
</P>
<P>
 -- HENRIETTA MANCHEL, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 In reading Colman Andrews' article on old restaurants today, I got a sudden 
rush of nostalgia when he referred to "something called farmer's chop suey." 
This dish made a wonderful supper on a hot summer day, and I thought your 
readers might enjoy the recipe as my parents prepared it: 
</P>
<P>
 Cut up equal parts of the following and combine in a salad bowl: head lettuce, 
cucumbers, radishes, green onions. Remember, equal parts; this is not a lettuce 
salad trimmed with other vegetables. Tomatoes (you might want to add them after 
the salad is tossed) or a little celery would also be OK. If you've got black 
olives on hand, you can throw some in. No carrots and no mushrooms. Toss with 
some salt, then add copious amounts of regular cottage cheese and sour cream in 
equal parts and toss again. (Low fat in either didn't exist yet.) When you've 
added enough, everything will be bound together. Serve with fresh buttered 
pumpernickel or corn rye bread. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BLANCHE THOMAS, Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 What delicious memories the fabulous "Restaurant History" articles brought 
back! Although my eating at any of these wonderful restaurants was usually a 
happy accident (my parents would never have brought me to these expensive 
places on purpose!), I guess that is the reason why I love those memories all 
the more. 
</P>
<P>
 A sweet-16 party at the Luau (the next year it was gone, and being that it was 
my first and last time there, I sometimes wondered if I hadn't dreamed the 
whole thing, often times confusing it with the Tahitian Terrace restaurant in 
Disneyland, yet another long gone favorite). 
</P>
<P>
 My aunt Milly's gift to me of a sweet 16 all my own at Robaire's, (my first 
real French food), my parent's indulgent engagement party for my future husband 
and me at Scandia (yes, they did finally take me to a forbiddenly expensive 
restaurant, and it was so delicious that I can still taste the gravad lax 16 
years later).  
</P>
<P>
 But surely the most wonderful long-lost restaurant memory is when, in my 
senior year at Beverly Hills High School, my best friend's mother took us for 
dinner at the Tail o' the Cock. Don't ask me what we ordered, don't ask me what 
I ate. I can't remember a thing about that evening except that I was sitting 
next to Barbara Bernstein (my best friend) and her mom (Florence Henderson), 
and I couldn't swallow a bite!

 DEAR SOS: The Sicilian rice balls served at Drago restaurant in Santa Monica 
are delicious. Is there a way of obtaining the recipe? 
</P>
<P>
 -- CARI 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR CARI: Celestino Drago shared the recipe with us in 1988, at the height of 
the modern Italian cooking craze. The rice balls make excellent appetizers, as 
well as a buffet side dish. CELESTINO'S RICE BALLS 
</P>
<P>
 5 ounces arborio rice 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 2 egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped shallots 
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces ground veal or beef  
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 Dash nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon canned tiny peas 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons canned tomato sauce or puree 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon diced mozzarella cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1 hard-cooked egg, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg, beaten 
</P>
<P>
 Fine dry bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil for frying 
</P>
<P>
 In pot cook rice in chicken broth to cover, adding more broth as it is 
absorbed, until all chicken broth is used and rice is tender. Let rice stand 10 
minutes to absorb excess moisture. Add egg yolks and Parmesan cheese. Season to 
taste with salt. Mix well. Set aside to cool. 
</P>
<P>
 In skillet saute shallots with veal in butter until veal is crumbly and 
browned. Add wine and simmer until wine is absorbed. Add nutmeg, peas and 
tomato sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper, if needed. Simmer few 
minutes until liquid is absorbed. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine mozzarella cheese and egg in small bowl. Roll 2 tablespoons cooked 
rice into ball. Make cavity in ball and insert scant tablespoon veal mixture, 
then small amount of mozzarella cheese and egg mixture. Cover with another 
tablespoon rice and seal cavity to make ball or pyramid shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Dip rice ball in egg and roll in bread crumbs. Heat 1 1/2 inches olive oil in 
skillet to 400 degrees. Add rice balls, few at time, to avoid overcrowding pan. 
Fry until golden brown on all sides, about 3 minutes, turning often to brown 
evenly. Makes 8 rice balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Each rice ball contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 180 calories; 361 mg sodium; 131 mg cholesterol; 7 grams fat; 18 grams 
carbohydrates; 7 grams protein; 0.14 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : Arborio rice may be found at most Italian grocery stores and 
supermarkets. When cooked, texture will be soft and mushy.

COOLING OFF WITH CUCUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people use cucumbers as pickles, or as a cool complement for rich foods, 
such as poached or smoked fish. But around the world, cooks have developed many 
other ways to take advantage of cucumbers' refreshing qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 In India, where cucumbers originated, they are tossed with yogurt and toasted 
cumin seeds to make raita , a dish designed to soothe the fires of hot curries. 
A cucumber-yogurt salad seasoned with garlic is popular in Greece and much of 
the Middle East. For the French concombres a la creme , the sliced vegetable is 
mixed with creme fraiche. My favorite version of these creamy salads comes from 
Afghanistan, where cucumbers are mixed with yogurt, walnuts and raisins for an 
intriguing appetizer salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Austrians, Hungarians and Germans enjoy cucumbers in a tangy dressing with 
plenty of vinegar. In Central Europe, cucumber slices are sometimes briefly 
sauteed like zucchini and sprinkled with chopped dill or parsley. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomatoes are a favorite companion for cucumbers all around the Mediterranean. 
Whether the vegetables are diced or sliced, all they need is a sprinkling of 
extra-virgin olive oil and either wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice to make a 
delectable summer salad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To peel or not to peel cucumbers is a matter of taste. I peel the common, 
short cucumbers found at the supermarket, but I usually don't peel the long 
European ones. With other cucumbers, if the peel is not bitter or waxed, I 
leave it on. 
</P>
<P>
 Some recipes call for salting the cucumber slices and letting them stand, to 
soften them and remove any bitter juices. These days, many people prefer 
cucumbers crisp and do not salt them. 
</P>
<P>
 Choose firm, fairly slender cucumbers with smooth skin. When the small, ridged 
cucumbers sold as either Armenian cucumbers, Iranian cucumbers or ghoota are 
available at our local farmers market, I grab them. I also like thin Japanese 
cucumbers, sometimes found in the exotic produce section of supermarkets. 
During the rest of the year I find the long European cucumbers that come 
wrapped in plastic and the small pickling cukes tastier than common cucumbers. 
Use any type of cucumber in the following recipes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This festive salad was inspired by a first course I enjoyed at an Afghan 
restaurant in Paris. A similar salad is made in Iran and is flavored with dill 
rather than the dried mint of the Afghan version. Usually the salad is made 
with a rich yogurt resembling sour cream that you can buy at Iranian specialty 
shops, but it's also delicious with low-fat and even nonfat yogurt.  
</P>
<P>
 AFGHAN CUCUMBER SALAD WITH YOGURT, WALNUTS AND RAISINS 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium cucumbers, coarsely grated 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups plain yogurt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup dark raisins 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup coarsely chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 2 green onions, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 teaspoons dried leaf mint, crumbled, or 2 to 4 teaspoons chopped fresh 
dill 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Drain grated cucumber in strainer. If there is water in yogurt, pour out. If 
raisins are very dry, soak in bowl of hot water until softened, then drain. 
Reserve 2 tablespoons raisins, 2 tablespoons walnuts and 2 tablespoons parsley 
for garnish. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix yogurt with cucumbers, green onions, mint and remaining 2 tablespoons 
raisins, 2 tablespoons walnuts and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Serve cold in bowl, with reserved raisins, walnuts and 
parsley sprinkled on top. Makes 4 servings.

<P>
 With this zesty salad, cucumbers will never seem boring again. The olive oil, 
cilantro and mint dressing is a favorite match for cucumbers in North Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 ALGERIAN CUCUMBER, PEPPER AND OLIVE SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 1 large European cucumber 
</P>
<P>
 1 sweet red or green pepper, cut into 2x1/4-inch-thick strips 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup pitted and halved black or green olives 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint 
</P>
<P>
 Peel cucumber, if desired. Halve cucumber lengthwise and cut into thin slices. 
Mix slices in shallow serving bowl with sweet red pepper and olives. 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk olive oil with vinegar and salt and cayenne to taste in small bowl. Toss 
dressing with salad. Add cilantro and mint and toss lightly. Taste and adjust 
seasonings, adding more vinegar if desired. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This salad is prettiest if you use plum tomatoes, so that the tomato and 
cucumber slices are the same size.  
</P>
<P>
 SPANISH CUCUMBER AND TOMATO SALAD WITH CAPERS 
</P>
<P>
 5 plum tomatoes, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 long European cucumber or 1 cucumber, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 red onion, sliced and separated into slivers 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons Sherry vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons capers, drained 
</P>
<P>
 Mix tomatoes, cucumber and onion slices in shallow bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk olive oil and vinegar in small bowl and add to salad. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Toss gently. Sprinkle with capers. Serve. Makes 4 
servings.

HIGH ON LOW FAT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many thanks to Donna Deane for the "Low-Fat '50s Tuna Noodle Casserole" recipe 
that appeared in the Food Section on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 When my husband and I met in 1960, he was a single guy doing a little cooking 
but looking for someone else to fix his meals.Part of his limited repertoire 
included tuna noodle casserole, and he actually thought he'd invented it 
himself (not realizing it was on the label of every Campbell's Cream of 
Mushroom Soup can)! 
</P>
<P>
 We got married eight months later, and I've been cooking ever since. For a 
long time, tuna noodle casserole continued to be one of our favorites, but in 
recent years, various health concerns forced me to eliminate it because of the 
fat content. So when I saw this recipe in the paper, I knew I had to try it. 
I'm happy to say that this version, although more work, is every bit as good as 
we remembered the original one being.

 Baby Doe Productions: That's what we're calling the new creation of moguls 
David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg -- at least until our 
contest to name it is over. Only in L.A.'s plea to help out the indecisive trio 
has prompted so many suggestions that we've decided to run the finalists over 
the next several days before notifying Price-Waterhouse of our decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And the nominees are . . . Here's our first set of finalists in the 
studio-name search. 
</P>
<P>
 * Speffenkatz Studios (Paul Benson) 
</P>
<P>
 * United Artless (Albert Cardenas) 
</P>
<P>
 * Reel Men (Barbara Joan Grubman) 
</P>
<P>
 * Mother of All Studios (Mark Wisbaum, who sent the mother of all entries -- 
it contained 46 suggestions). 
</P>
<P>
 * The Billionaire Boys Club (Russell Bernberg). The last group to use this 
name has folded, as we recall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rough sailing for Columbus: Locals know that the Marina Freeway used to be the 
Nixon Freeway. But did you know that the Christopher Columbus Transcontinental 
Highway had been re-christened in Santa Monica? Actually, the name change, 
photographed by Gary Rosenblatt of Venice, was an anonymous Columbus Day 
gesture, an annual rite for that sign. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's any comfort to protesters, a Caltrans director's plan to have Columbus 
Highway signs stretch across the nation along Interstate 10 came to an abrupt 
halt years ago when Arizona refused to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now it can be told: Whimsical Will Simpson, KSCA-FM's "Demented News" 
broadcaster, says the mainstream media were wrong in reporting that a jam-up on 
the Ventura Freeway was caused by movie-prop message signs flashing such 
warnings as "Gang War Riot Ahead."  
</P>
<P>
 Simpson says it wasn't until motorists found out that a "Brady Bunch" movie 
was being taped "that terror and panic ensued." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Freeway transition: "The Brady Bunch" tailgates some other movies that have 
entered freeways, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Terminator 2," Terminal Island Freeway (appropriate, don't you think?). In 
the original "Terminator," indestructible Arnold was afraid to leave L.A.'s 
surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * "To Live and Die in L.A.," also the Terminal Island Freeway. A wrong-way 
chase really fouls up traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lethal Weapon 3," responsible for a cinematic SigAlert on the Century 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Air America," Terminal Island Freeway, where a helicopter traffic pilot 
hovers above a truck driver, who swings a crowbar at him. Over and out! 
</P>
<P>
 * "Speed," a bus chase on the Century Freeway, not to mention a Red Car crash 
that prophesied the sinking of Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Wonder if there's a Ford Bronco freeway chase in the cinematic future? 
</P>
<P>

SCOTT HARRIS: HE'S FITTEST IN SURVIVAL OF THE FUNNIEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is painful to watch Christopher Sylbert walk, because he doesn't walk so 
much as struggle, inching along with the aid of a metal walker. He moves with a 
slow, halting rhythm, nudging the walker forward, then leaning against it, 
nudging and leaning, nudging and leaning. 
</P>
<P>
 We waited silently, patiently, expectantly. We didn't know if he was crippled 
by accident or illness. Sylbert grimaced as he moved at his snail's pace to the 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 His body is weak, but his voice is strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry Parker got me $2.1 million!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Sylbert does stand-up -- but just barely. The walk isn't an act; 
the grimace might be. He nailed that first punch line, and from that point on, 
the only question was whether he could hold on to us, whether he could make us 
laugh harder and longer than Joel Lindley had. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy is the survival of the funniest. This was the L.A. Cabaret's 10th 
annual "Funniest Person in the Valley" contest. Of the nine previous winners at 
the Encino club, several are successful comics, but none are household names. 
Perhaps the best known is Tommy Davidson, who went on to become a regular on 
the TV show "In Living Color." 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, the emcee joked that more people come to see the judges than 
the comics. Milton Berle, no less, sat in the second row, a few seats from 
Shirley Jones. Uncle Miltie and Mrs. Partridge! Why, it was an honor just to be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Could Sylbert top Lindley? A few comics struggled, but Lindley was on. One bit 
concerned his hatred of racism. He bragged about an encounter with a van loaded 
with skinheads. He took them on, one against six, and kicked their butts. It 
didn't bother him much when he found out they were chemotherapy patients, 
because they were still skinheads. And he hates skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
 The civilities of everyday life do not apply in a comedy club. Cancer, murder, 
suicide -- any uncomfortable subject can be a source of humor here. Sex, of 
course, is another staple. Much of what was said there cannot be said here. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sylbert hobbled to the stage and told a few jokes, I caught myself 
thinking that it didn't seem fair. Would Sylbert be awarded sympathy points? 
Was Lindley handicapped? 
</P>
<P>
 The concern quickly passed, because Sylbert was on a roll. He has presence and 
he has polish. He is a 43-year-old man who wears his hair spiky and long and 
has the gaunt look of an aging Rolling Stone. His accent is a streetwise New 
York hybrid, so that "first" comes out "foist" and "that" comes out "dat." 
</P>
<P>
 He told about his brief career as a gigolo: "Dat broad was so big she was 
protected by Greenpeace." 
</P>
<P>
 Not once in his allotted seven minutes did Sylbert explain the source of his 
disability. Perhaps he's discovered that it's better for people to wonder. And 
he's obviously discovered that his wit reaches beyond his own predicament to 
the predicaments we all share. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dis is a dumb state," he observed. The audience was hanging on every word, 
every pause, every inflection. "They got no money for schoolteachers. They got 
no money for cops. But let 'em find one Medfly -- suddenly, they got nothin' 
but money. They bust out helicopters, for crissakes, and they start spraying 
poison all over the place. And they tell you don't worry about a thing. You and 
the kids will be just fine. . . . But cover your car." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only later, when Christopher Sylbert was handed the $1,500 winner's check, did 
he explain to the audience that he was found to have multiple sclerosis 15 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't talk about the fact that he's an ex-heroin addict who has done 
prison time for burglary -- a crime to support his habit. He didn't explain how 
he polished his act "running my mouth" before drug rehab groups. All that he 
told me later. 
</P>
<P>
 But on stage, the tough-guy facade slipped and Sylbert soaked in the applause. 
Like an actor accepting the Oscar, he glowed and thanked his friends, including 
the late Chris Collins, a comic who had won this contest last year, when 
Sylbert was the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are you never heard of Collins. Sylbert says he was "brilliant." He 
died earlier this year at age 44 of an aneurysm, leaving a wife and two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like something popped in his brain and it was like goodby," Sylbert 
recalled later. "He used to take me around with him when I didn't know what the 
hell I was doing. . . . It just just broke my heart. But being disabled and 
having a progressive disease, I'm very aware of my mortality and everybody 
else's. You know what? Tomorrow you could be hit by a car and be in the shape 
I'm in, and you have to live it one day at a time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "They call it a progressive disease," Sylbert went on. ". . . I can wrestle 
with this. . . . I didn't let it kick my butt. I didn't quit. I'm still in the 
game."

NO PUZZLES, PLEASE, ON THE BALLOT; L.A. COUNTY VOTERS WILL FACE CONFUSING 
NUMBERING ON PROPOSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a Los Angeles County voter and you're puzzled by a part of the Nov. 
8 ballot, don't worry -- you're not alone. Because of a chance error, the 
numbers of yes/no punch holes are the same as the numbers of two important 
ballot propositions.Surely that will lead to some voter confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem may be unique to Los Angeles County in this election. However, it 
conceivably could tip the vote on either of two controversial and -- as we see 
it -- misguided statewide ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, for instance, would cut schooling, health and social services 
for illegal immigrants. Proposition 188, with strong tobacco company backing, 
seeks to overturn a tough and eminently sensible statewide workplace smoking 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Some groups are demanding that L.A. County reprint its ballots. The registrar, 
in addition to citing the huge cost that would entail, says there's not enough 
time before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 County election officials will attempt to remedy the problem by posting 
notices explaining the ballot numbering at each of the county's 6,104 polling 
places. Given the absence of alternatives at this point, that seems logical. 
</P>
<P>
 This embarrassing episode reveals flaws in the election process that should be 
addressed. Ten counties -- including Alameda, San Diego and San Francisco -- 
currently use a machine-readable single ballot card system similar to Los 
Angeles'. As proposition numbers continue sequentially, the odds increase that 
confusing numerical mix-ups could recur (the Nov. 8 ballot stops at Proposition 
191; next election's propositions would start with 192). 
</P>
<P>
 California's secretary of state and county officials ought to look into ways 
to avoid the problem in the future, even if that means remodeling the balloting 
system.

A LITTLE REMINDER, MR. PRESIDENT; WITH DEADLINE PASSED, CLINTON SHOULD KEEP 
BOSNIA ARMS EMBARGO PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last summer, President Clinton promised that if by Oct. 15 the Bosnian Serbs 
had not accepted the peace plan for Bosnia backed by the "Contact Group" of 
five major powers, he would "introduce formally and support a resolution at the 
United Nations Security Council to terminate the (arms) embargo on Bosnia and 
Herzegovina." That deadline has now passed. The Bosnian Serbs continue to 
reject the plan. The President should keep his word. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, the Contact Group -- Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the 
United States -- delivered its own ultimatum to the warring Serbs, Croats and 
Muslims. It threatened the Muslims and Bosnian Croats with a lifting of 
economic sanctions against Serbia. The Bosnian Serbs it threatened with a 
lifting of a blanket arms embargo that has preserved a Serb military advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs, as noted, rejected the ultimatum and continue to reject it. 
The Croats and Muslims accepted it. Unfortunately, compliance has been punished 
and defiance rewarded. The arms embargo remains in place, but economic 
sanctions against Serbia are being lifted, despite continued, well-documented 
support by Serbia for the Bosnian Serbs.  
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday 50 senators -- including, along with many Republicans, such 
Democratic stalwarts as Joseph R. Biden, Bill Bradley and Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan -- sent a letter to the President reminding him of his commitment. The 
letter quotes the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 1995: "If the 
Bosnian Serbs do not accept the Contact Group proposal by . . . Oct. 15, 1994, 
. . . the President (or his representative) should not later than 14 days 
thereafter introduce and support in the . . . Security Council a resolution to 
terminate the Bosnia arms embargo." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government recently agreed that implementation of a resolution 
lifting the embargo could be delayed for six months. But the senators note: 
"Some of our allies seem to be deliberately misinterpreting this compromise, 
describing it as a request to deter any action on the embargo for six months." 
We trust that, with this timely reminder now delivered, President Clinton will 
make no similar misinterpretation.

TRUST, MAYBE -- BUT DO VERIFY; N. KOREAN DEAL IS PROMISING, BUT INCONCLUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 16 months of complex and frustrating negotiations the United States has 
struck a deal with North Korea that, if Pyongyang does what it seems to have 
committed itself to doing, could in time eliminate the budding nuclear threat 
in Northeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Harsh experience, however, demands that the uncertainty implied by that "if" 
be emphasized. North Korea under Kim Il Sung was routinely contemptuous of such 
basic conventions of international behavior as keeping one's promises. Whether 
things will change under the apparent new leader, Kim Jong Il, has yet to be 
shown. At a minimum, it would be premature to see the accord that's to be 
signed in Geneva on Friday as anything more than a possible hopeful departure. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for North Korea to freeze its nuclear program. Then over a 
period of up to a decade it will swap its nuclear reactors -- one operational, 
two under construction -- for oil to revive its largely moribund industries and 
for two 1,000-megawatt light-water reactors. Reactors of this kind are far less 
capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium than the reactors North Korea 
would discard. South Korea and Japan are expected to cover most of their 
$4-billion cost. The oil will come from the United States and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Only toward the very end of the phased exchange process would North Korea 
yield control over the 8,000 nuclear fuel rods it has been holding in storage. 
Those rods contain material that could be processed for weapons; earlier 
reprocessing may already have given Pyongyang one or two nuclear devices. The 
International Atomic Energy Agency is supposed to have full access to North 
Korea's nuclear facilities. In the past, however, IAEA inspectors were denied 
entry to several suspect sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gallucci, the chief U.S. negotiator with North Korea, insists that 
adequate inspection and verification procedures are built into the agreement. 
But the text of the accord has yet to be published, and some serious doubts and 
questions have been raised. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea, when all is said and done, will retain possession of nuclear 
material for many years to come. For at least five years it can continue to 
deny inspectors entry to a number of sites that have figured in its efforts to 
divert material from spent fuel rods to weapons use. Meanwhile, it will soon 
begin getting the oil it so desperately needs and a start on two modern 
reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 Does all this signal a North Korean shift to moderation and true international 
cooperation? Certainly that's the implicit promise. But North Korea's promises 
by themselves are without value. The proof of its intentions and its 
trustworthiness can come only from its deeds.

COCKBURN ON CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Alexander Cockburn's Column Left of Oct. 6, regarding our 
embargo against Cuba: 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if Cockburn was as consistent in denouncing our boycott against South 
Africa in the '80s. And as for his gushing praise of the Cuban health care 
system, all I can say is "so what?" Since when does that excuse totalitarian 
and oppressive government? 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than rail against the U.S. embargo and cry crocodile tears for the 
poor, deprived citizens (maybe that should be "subjects"?) of Cuba, why doesn't 
he instead call for the one step which will put an end to the problem -- namely 
for Fidel Castro to do the responsible thing for his people and allow for 
democratic elections, and then, if the Cuban people so desire, step down from 
power after three decades of absolute rule.

SCHOOL VS. HEALTH COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "What If Health Care Were Run Like the Schools?" Commentary, Oct. 10: 
</P>
<P>
 Like physicians who just spent millions lobbying Congress, I really do 
understand Dr. Karen Engberg's fears of Proposition 186, but I suspect that my 
opposing motives are different than hers. Living in La Jolla, I observe the 
lifestyles of physicians.Also, my wife is a teacher. Engberg fortuitously chose 
teachers and education as her scapegoat in the health-care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's debate! First, consider that private hospitals charge patients daily 
what the state pays schools per student for a year in the classroom. Then 
society demands that teachers try to teach 25-45 active students simultaneously 
while doctors treat passive patients individually. Also, doctors have a better 
union (the American Medical Assn.) than teachers, which results in doctors 
being paid a salary 10 times, or more, that of teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious that children of the affluent do well in either private or public 
schools. It is unfortunate for both society and schools that all children are 
not blessed with good homes and future horizons. 
</P>
<P>
 I pose the following question for Engberg: Would the quality of public schools 
rise if privately managed by the AMA, or would their high cost have everyone 
scrambling for a $5,200-a-year school? Another question: Will global 
competition force Americans to seek affordable medical treatment abroad?

<P>
 Re Rush Limbaugh's "Why I Am a Threat to the Left," Column Right, Oct. 9: 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Rush Limbaugh is the leader of mainstream conservatives is because, 
better than anyone else, he articulates the beliefs, values and goals of 
hard-working, tax-paying, play-by-the-rules Americans. It isn't any more 
complicated than that. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * I noted in Limbaugh's nine-paragraph article that he used the words I 21 
times, me five, my five and I'm four. 
</P>
<P>
 What he left out of his column of enlightenment is, I distort the truth for my 
own pretentious glory. I'm now earning millions of dollars by degrading, 
humiliating and making fools out of anyone who does not agree with me.  
</P>
<P>
 As a liberal Democrat, I do not fear Limbaugh and his lies. I , I'm , my and 
me will do him in sooner than he thinks. As well they should.

 * Limbaugh claims, "The truth is, I provide information and analysis the media 
refuses to disseminate," after stating in the previous paragraph, "Twenty 
million people a week listen to my radio show on 695 stations nationwide, on 
shortwave and Armed Forces Radio worldwide, while millions more watch my 
television show on 250 stations nationwide. Add to that 6 million copies sold 
of my two books and 475,000 monthly subscribers to the Limbaugh Letter." It's 
obvious to me that the media (i.e., radio, television, print) aren't refusing 
to disseminate anything Limbaugh says. 
</P>
<P>
 Later he states, "Americans feel lied to by the so-called experts." Then he 
proceeds to explain what he does. "I use facts. Statistics. I run the numbers . 
. . I sift through newspapers, newsmagazines, miles of videotape, books and 
speeches in a relentless pursuit of the truth." Isn't that exactly what 
"so-called experts" do? 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that Limbaugh's "real agenda" is "How can we fool 'em today?" 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Limbaugh's program usually contains about 30 seconds of something poignant 
and 29 minutes, less commercials, of entertainment and self-aggrandizement. 
Further, Rush's latest tactic of making caricatures of certain American 
political leaders trivializes them and their efforts at governing, when in fact 
they need to be taken seriously and their agendas need to be weighed upon their 
merits. This then makes dialogue between opposing political points of view more 
difficult. Thus the real tragedy of Limbaugh's demagogic tactics is that he 
creates an air of divisiveness which in turn increases the polarization taking 
place in American politics. 
</P>
<P>

 * Limbaugh should be careful not to confuse his high ratings with political 
support. I watch his show regularly, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who 
watches because it's one of the funniest things on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry Rush, a lot of people watch you for the same reason we watch the Three 
Stooges.

PAYING OFF CEDRAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Why Reward These Thugs?" editorial, Oct. 15: 
</P>
<P>
 I believe you do your readers a disservice when you frame the question of the 
payoff to Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras in the terms that you did in your editorial. To 
say that Washington's deal with Cedras is baffling begs the more important 
question: What cards does Cedras hold that would make the U.S. want to give 
away our honor to him? Is it possible that making public the links Cedras and 
his gang had to the CIA would be too embarrassing for those with whom we have 
entrusted the mantle of power? I don't know, but I have good reason to suspect 
that we are tripping over our own feet here. 
</P>
<P>
 I congratulate you on expressing the anger many must feel after such a 
travesty of justice; but please, if our leaders are going to be irresponsible, 
don't do them the honor of not asking the difficult questions.

 * Regarding your Oct. 14 article on the lucrative deal given Cedras to leave 
the country: This must rank with one of the dumbest and most immoral deals this 
country has every made. To buy off a man whom President Clinton and other U.S. 
officials have described as "thug," "stooge" and "killer" is an unconscionable 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 One would imagine Cedras uses only one word to describe President Clinton and 
that is stooge . As defined by the dictionary, "one who serves as the butt of 
jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the leadership our country and the United Nations needs?

PERSPECTIVE ON JOHN PAUL II; ON THE THRESHOLD OF GREATNESS; THE POPE HAS 
REDEFINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND MODERN LIFE BY ARTICULATING A 
BOLD CHRISTIAN HUMANISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WEIGEL, George Weigel is president of the Ethics and Public Policy 
Center in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only two of 264 popes have been honored with the title "the Great" -- Leo, 
440-461, and Gregory, 590-604. On the 16th anniversary of his installation as 
Bishop of Rome, I suggest that it is not too early to consider the possibility 
of John Paul the Great.  
</P>
<P>
 The very notion will strike some as bizarre: Why celebrate a misogynist Polish 
authoritarian who may have been useful during the collapse of communism, but 
who now has devolved into an impotent King Lear, raging against the modern 
world and all its works and pomps? But the myth of John Paul's political 
inconsequence should have been dispelled by last month's Cairo population 
conference, which made plain that the Pope remains a powerful voice for 
universal moral reason. And the myth of the authoritarian Polish misogynist 
ought to be buried once and for all by the publication today of "Crossing the 
Threshold of Hope," the first book in which a sitting Pope writes about his 
life and ministry in intimate, even familial terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Threshold" is many things: a survey of world religions on the edge of the 
21st Century, a glimpse into the mind of a religious leader who is also a 
distinguished philosopher, a miniature catechism of Christian doctrine. But 
above all, "Crossing the Threshold of Hope" is a deeply personal statement of 
faith -- faith in God, to be sure, but also faith in the human capacity for 
greatness, under the influence of God's grace. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most compelling moment in the Pope's book comes when he reflects 
on his experience in Krakow, helping engaged couples prepare for marriage: "As 
a young priest, I learned to love human love." That human love, the Pope 
suggests, is an intimation of God's abiding love for the world; everyone 
desires a "beautiful and pure love," and that desire can be satisfied only in 
communion with God. Thus the antiphon of "Threshold," taken from the Gospel of 
Mark, is "Be not afraid." Be not afraid of "the truth about ourselves." Be not 
afraid of God. Be not afraid of Christ, the icon of the invisible God. 
</P>
<P>
 By exploding the caricature of John Paul the anti-modern misanthrope, 
"Crossing the Threshold of Hope" should compel a more serious exploration of 
the accomplishments of a singular pontificate. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Paul II has redefined the papacy for the third Christian millennium. 
For most of the second, the Pope was, essentially, the chief executive officer 
of Roman Catholic Church Inc. No more. Through his pastoral journeys, John Paul 
has revitalized the ministry of Peter, whom Luke reports as the apostle 
commissioned by Christ to "strengthen your brethren." The era of the Pope as 
chief bureaucrat has ended. The era of the Pope as chief evangelist and 
defender of human dignity on a world scale has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Paul II has reversed Catholicism's 300-year-long contest with 
modernity. As "Threshold" and the new Catechism of the Catholic Church 
illustrate, John Paul II has boldly articulated a dynamic Christian humanism 
that embraces the scientific, social, political and cultural achievements of 
modernity without falling into the quicksand pits of skeptical relativism and 
political correctness. For 250 years, church and modernity were in conflict. In 
the 1960s and '70s, the call went out to open the church to the modern world. 
John Paul has answered that call, but he has also completed it, by challenging 
modernity to open itself to the world of transcendent truth and love. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Paul II has secured the legacy of the Second Vatican Council. He 
inherited a church bitterly divided between those who thought the council a 
dreadful mistake (the "conservatives") and those who thought Pope Paul VI had 
been laggardly in implementing the council's reforms (the "progressives.") By 
wholeheartedly welcoming the council as a gift of the Holy Spirit -- while 
grounding the ongoing renewal of Catholicism in a deeper appropriation of its 
ancient tradition -- John Paul II has transcended the sterile 
liberal-conservative dichotomies, challenged Catholics stuck in ecclesiastical 
power games and reminded the church that its mission is, as Luke's Gospel puts 
it, to be a "light for the nations."  
</P>
<P>
 The Roman press believes that John Paul's papacy is over. But those who have 
seen the Pope recently find him vigorously focused on the future and especially 
concerned about Christian unity. My impression is that the surprises of this 
extraordinary pontificate have yet to be exhausted.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, I attended hearings by the Commission on Civil Rights examining the 
exclusion of ethnic minorities from the entertainment industry.  
</P>
<P>
 (Afterward, CBS began) a staff "access program" for Latino writers.I was 
stunned to learn that under this program, Latino writers would be hired at half 
pay. Half! 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of my guild setting a lower wage for writers on the basis of 
ethnicity seems a perversion of the whole purpose of a trade union. Such 
practices make it more difficult for writers -- Latinos or whatever -- to get 
any work at all.  
</P>
<P>
 I was further dismayed to learn that my union had agreed to this as a 
"training program" for Latinos. The guild invoked an article in our contract 
that allows for companies to enhance "training opportunities" for writers in 
federally protected classes. But it was never intended to permit a two-tier 
wage system for professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Affirmative action may be one approach to healing the disease of racial 
prejudice, but I can't believe that it can be called on to create a caste 
system based on national origin. Common sense would tell you that doing so 
would constitute a denial of that very basicprinciple.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS CALDERA, Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles) is chairman of the Assembly's 
Select Committee on Gun Violence, which will begin hearings on gun violence 
today in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's gun-violence problem involves far more than the misuse of guns by 
career criminals and repeat violent offenders. By passing a tough "three 
strikes" law cracking down on these career felons, the Legislature and the 
governor have done the easy part of addressing the problem. Now they need to 
take on the much more difficult but equally important task: cracking down on 
the easy availability of cheap handguns and high-powered assault weapons being 
used by people other than career criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 2,609 people were murdered with handguns in California. But laws 
meant to protect society by locking up career criminals will have no effect on 
those committing the vast majority of gun-related assaults and homicides: the 
enraged, the distraught, the despondent and the disturbed. Contrary to public 
perception, only 13% of homicides in California in 1993 were committed in 
connection with crimes such as rape, robbery or burglary. The other 87% were 
committed in connection with violent personal confrontations, frequently by an 
acquaintance such as a family member, neighbor, friend, co-worker or ex-spouse 
-- and usually with a handgun. More and more, the perpetrators of those 
homicides are younger and younger -- schoolchildren whose neighborhoods are 
awash with cheap handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 California must take steps to prevent the growing gun-violence epidemic and 
not just deal with it after the fact. The stakes are tremendous. A recent study 
by the California Research Bureau puts the cost of firearms-related violence in 
California at more than $18 billion a year: more than $1.1 billion in medical 
care, 80% of which is at taxpayer expense; almost $4 billion in lost 
productivity, and $13 billion in pain, suffering and lost quality of life for 
victims and their families. To put it another way: The annual cost of gun 
violence is more than six times the reputed annual cost of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, California businesses, including the California tourism 
industry, are losing hundreds of millions in patronage even as they are forced 
to spend tens of millions in increased security costs. 
</P>
<P>
 These social and economic stakes demand a thorough assessment of ways in which 
we can address this complex problem. Short of a ban on the private ownership of 
handguns, we can prohibit the sale of cheap, easily concealable "Saturday night 
specials" that are used to commit the vast majority of gun-related assaults. We 
also might consider eliminating the state preemption against local gun-control 
laws and let each community write the gun laws its citizens want to live by. 
</P>
<P>
 These and other proposals will be considered when concerned members of law 
enforcement, legislators and citizens embark this week on public hearings to 
develop a legislative approach to ending the epidemic of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Targeting career criminals after they have victimized society was only the 
first step. Keeping guns out of the hands of irresponsible people is the 
necessary second step. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope California is ready now for meaningful reform.

MORNING BRIEFING: HANKS, BROWN AND KENNEDY? A DYNAMIC TRIO FOR MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Kevin Kennedy was named manager of the Boston Red Sox, Dan Shaughnessy 
of the Boston Globe had his own candidates. A sampling:  
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tom Hanks. He was great as Jimmy Dugan in 'A League of Their Own.' 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Larry Brown. He could use another team on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Ted Kennedy. Why not? He knows the region and his grandfather threw out 
the first ball when Fenway Park was dedicated in 1912." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What is the NCAA Division I-A record for most punts in a game? 
</P>
<P>
 Grow up: Steve Jacobson of Newsday on excessive showboating in the NFL:  
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine Gene Sarazen dancing a jig in his knickers when he made his double 
eagle."  
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson added that Paul Brown, the famous football coach, had simple advice 
for his players who reached the end zone:  
</P>
<P>
 "Act like you've been there before." 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinary people: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Jeff Tarango, 
losing to Michael Chang in Tokyo, drops his tennis shorts to his knees, 
apparently a sign of surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we've been trying to tell you about those star athletes: They're 
human, they pull their pants down two legs at a time, just like the rest of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hold the pickles: Croatian-born Vladimir Cerin, one of the leading trainers at 
Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting, earned a graduate degree in kinesiology at UCLA 
and helped train such athletes as Tracy Austin, Jamaal Wilkes and Bill Walton 
before turning to horses. 
</P>
<P>
 He says training horses is trickier than humans, but that it is much easier to 
watch their nutrition. "It's very difficult for a horse to sneak out to 
McDonald's," Cerin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't be done: Billy Cunningham, general manager of Avilla (Ind.) Motor 
Speedway, on a proposal to put mufflers on dragsters because of complaints from 
neighbors about the noise: 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be like watching figure skating without music." 
</P>
<P>
 Flash! Bob Kravitz in the Rocky Mountain News: "I went to a hockey game and a 
labor fight broke out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ho hum: It's doubtful the NBA will expand to Pittsburgh. A recently scheduled 
exhibition between the New Jersey Nets and Atlanta Hawks at the city's Civic 
Arena was canceled because only 1,000 tickets had been sold.  
</P>
<P>
 Selling point: The Chicago Wolves of the International Hockey League aren't 
shy about capitalizing on the major league labor problems in their promotions. 
Or, as they said in a recent print advertisement:  
</P>
<P>
 "Introducing a revolutionary concept in professional sports: actual games." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: 77 -- 39 by Texas Tech and 38 by Centenary on Nov. 11, 1939. 
Note: The game was played in a rainstorm in Shreveport, La.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: TRACY JOINING MICHAEL ANDRETTI IN PURSUIT OF OLD 
PENSKE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canadian Paul Tracy, who helped make Roger Penske's team the most dominant in 
Indy car racing this season, will join forces with Michael Andretti next year 
in an attempt to short-circuit his former team. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement that Tracy and Andretti would become teammates on the Paul 
Newman-Carl Haas team -- replacing Nigel Mansell and Michael's father, Mario -- 
ended weeks of speculation about Tracy's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Would Penske hold him to his contract for another year? Would he accept an 
offer from Benetton's Formula One team? Would he go to Newman-Haas? 
</P>
<P>
 Haas had scheduled a news conference Oct. 8 at Laguna Seca Raceway, the day 
before the season-ending race, to make his announcement, only to have Penske 
block it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if something happened to one of our other drivers (Al Unser Jr. and 
Emerson Fittipaldi) in the race?" a Penske aide said. "If it did, we would 
exercise our option for Paul's services next year. It was rather presumptuous 
of them to plan such an announcement when he is still under contract to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing happened to either Unser or Fittipaldi, so Penske gave Tracy his 
release. Unser, Fittipaldi and Tracy, who won the Laguna Seca race, finished 
1-2-3 in the PPG Cup championship season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, things got pretty frustrating the last couple of months," Tracy 
said. "There was a lot of poker playing going on. Roger really wanted to run a 
third car again, but it wasn't feasible from a business standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to play a waiting game, but I think I have a better situation here with 
Carl and Paul. Running three cars is a tremendous strain on a team. It looked 
great from the outside, but from within it was a struggle. Two cars is much 
more practical." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy and Andretti will have new Lolas, powered by the latest Ford Cosworth 
engine, for the 1995 season. It will be a change for both. Tracy drove a Penske 
the last three seasons, while Andretti drove a Reynard for Chip Ganassi after 
returning from Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have Chip to thank for giving me an opportunity to get back in an Indy car 
after my year in Europe, but the move to Newman-Haas is like going home again," 
Tracy said. "We had great success together and I am looking forward to working 
with my old engineer, Peter Gibbons. We were together when I drove for Kraco 
(in 1988) and we won a lot of races together." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Andretti drove for Newman-Haas from 1989 to 1992 with his father as a 
teammate and won the PPG Cup championship in 1991. In 1993, he tried Formula 
One with McLaren, with disappointing results that led to his returning to Indy 
cars this past season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will feel funny to be at the races without Dad," Michael said. "He has 
been to all the Indy races I've been in except one. I'm going to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Andretti retired after the Laguna Seca race, and Mansell is leaving Indy 
cars to return to Formula One, where he won the championship in 1992. For the 
first time since Newman-Haas entered Indy car racing in 1983, the team failed 
to win a race this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Tracy won three for Penske and Michael Andretti won two for Ganassi 
-- two of the four not won by the Penske trio. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both hard chargers, aggressive and competitive, and we expect to have 
them around for a long time," Haas said. "There will be no No. 1 and No. 2, 
they're both No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 The new teammates represent a generation change for Newman-Haas. Tracy is 25 
and Michael 32, replacing Mansell, 41, and Mario, 54. 
</P>

 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- The final round of the Toyota Sportsman Challenge will be Sunday 
at Willow Springs Raceway. Steve Anderson, who has won the pole for every race 
in his Pontiac, is expected to win the championship. All the Las Vegas driver 
needs is to finish in the top five to hold off Steve Rzesnowiecky's Buick for 
the title. . . . The second race of the Telles Industries series for pro stocks 
is Saturday night at Bakersfield's Mesa Marin Raceway. Mesa Marin will become 
part of the NASCAR Winston Racing Series next season. . . . Street stocks run 
Saturday night at Sunrise Valley Raceway in Adelanto. . . . Two destruction 
derbys have been scheduled for the Farmers Fair on Sunday at Lake Perris. 
</P>
<P>
 MIDGETS -- In addition to local favorites Johnny Cofer and Billy Boat, 
Saturday night's U.S. Auto Club race at Ventura Raceway has attracted 
Indianapolis drivers Kenny Irwin Jr. and Tony Stewart, who finished 1-2 in last 
week's Silver Crown dirt-track race in Bakersfield. Jimmy Sills of Placerville 
won his second USAC Silver Crown championship with a fifth-place finish. 
Western States TQ midgets will also race at Ventura, with Western Racing Assn. 
vintage cars taking exhibition laps. 
</P>
<P>
 DRAG RACING -- Former world top fuel champion Shirley Muldowney will face Mike 
Ranney in a match race Saturday night during the World Series of Drag Racing at 
Firebird Raceway, near Phoenix. She won her last national event on the same 
strip in 1989. . . . The NHRA Chief Nationals, rained out last week in Dallas, 
have been rescheduled for Friday and Saturday at Texas Motorplex, with the 
Winston Select Finals starting next Thursday at the Pomona Fairplex. 
</P>
<P>
 SPORTS CARS -- Southern Pacific Division drivers returned with only two 
second-place trophies from the Sports Car Club of America's Valvoline Runoffs 
at Mid-Ohio last week. Bill Gilcrease of Costa Mesa, in a Minicomp Mini in 
GT-5, and Steve Kelso of Sherman Oaks, in a Camaro in Showroom Stock GT, had 
the seconds. . . . The Cal Club will hold its sixth and final regional 
championship of the year Saturday and Sunday at Willow Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 SPRINT CARS -- Ron Shuman, four-time champion of the defunct California Racing 
Assn., is closing in on the inaugural Sprint Car Racing Assn. championship. The 
Arizona veteran will be favored Saturday night when the SCRA races at Manzanita 
Speedway in Phoenix, Shuman's home track. 
</P>
<P>
 MOTOCROSS -- Roger DeCoster, who won five world 500cc championships for Suzuki 
in the 1970s, is returning to Suzuki as manager of its motocross racing team 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 MOTORCYCLES -- Scott Parker's wire-to-wire victory in last Sunday's Del Mar 
Mile, coupled with Chris Carr's fifth-place finish, enabled Parker to win a 
record fifth American Motorcyclist Assn. dirt track championship. He edged Carr 
by three points, 292-289. 
</P>
<P>
 POWERBOATS -- Tom Gentry and Richie Powers set a world offshore record of 
157.428 m.p.h. in Gentry's 40-foot Skater Catamaran last Tuesday on a 
five-eighths-mile straightaway on San Diego Bay. Using two 1,100-horsepower 
Gentry turbocharged engines, they broke the record of 145.16 m.p.h. set last 
December by Andres Ugland of Norway and Fabio Buzzi of Italy. . . . After 
winning their class in the Powerboat Magazine Ventura Offshore Challenge last 
Sunday, former speedway motorcycle champions Bruce Penhall and Dennis Sigalos 
are installing new engines in Ocean Spray, their 37-foot Scarab, for the world 
offshore championships, Nov. 9 and Nov. 13, off Key West, Fla. Ocean Spray won 
D class and finished second overall to Karl Koster's Kal Kustom, which ran in 
the modified class.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

 John Robinson smiled and jotted down the suggestion from a couple of 
sportswriters. . . . "Have players shadow box in dressing room like fighters so 
they will work up a sweat and be ready for the first quarter." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The USC coach said he might as well try it before the California game Saturday 
at the Coliseum because nothing else has worked. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' last five opponents have scored a touchdown or field goal on 
their first possession and the other, Washington, got a touchdown on its second 
possession. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 USC has been outscored, 71-40, in first quarters despite compiling a 4-2 
record. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I have absolutely no explanation for it," said Robinson, whose 1993 team 
outscored opponents, 90-52, in first quarters. "We're just trying not to make 
it into something bigger than it is." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson can't say enough good things about the recent play of his 
All-American tackle, Tony Boselli. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Boselli is playing as well as anybody I've ever been around," Robinson said. 
"He has taken his game up a notch. He reminds me of Jackie Slater, a good 
tackle who became a great one." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Mike Garrett has this banner displayed above the entrance to 
Heritage Hall: "GEORGE OLAH Nobel Prize Winner FIGHT ON!" . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was an emotional time Tuesday at Heritage when Coach George Raveling spoke 
to the Trojans' basketball news conference on a speaker phone from USC 
University Hospital, where he is recovering from serious injuries suffered in 
an automobile accident. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The response has been incredible," Raveling said. "I've gotten more than 400 
floral displays, plants and fruit baskets. They're not even sending them up to 
the room now, they're keeping them refrigerated downstairs. I also have 
received more than 4,000 cards and letters." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I was in intensive care one day when I woke up and saw (Georgetown Coach) 
John Thompson. He had flown all the way out here to see me. I wasn't supposed 
to have visitors, but I guess the security guard was afraid to say no to him." 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Raveling said he wanted to thank all the people who have tried to lift his 
spirits. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He also said how much he missed the sportswriters and began to cry. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State quarterback Kerry Collins is that rarest of species -- a legitimate 
Heisman Trophy candidate who isn't getting hyped enough. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In leading the top-ranked Nittany Lions to six consecutive victories, he has 
completed 88 of 130 passes for 1,451 yards and 14 touchdowns. He has thrown 
only three interceptions and is No. 1 in the NCAA Division I-A passing 
rankings. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But another member of the Penn State backfield, tailback Ki-Jana Carter, has 
received more publicity than Collins. . . . Kerry is one of five Nittany Lions 
named Collins. Included are brothers Aaron, Jason and Phillip Collins. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Gary Bettman and Bob Goodenow hate negotiating sessions as much as 
Richard Ravitch and Donald Fehr. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't realize how much I missed hockey until I watched those Kings' playoff 
games from 1993 on Prime Ticket. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC forward Lorenzo Orr is engaged to Lisa Leslie, the former Trojan 
All-American center who is playing pro basketball in Italy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ivy League schools don't award athletic scholarships, but Pennsylvania might 
have the nation's best backcourt in Jerome Allen and Matt Maloney. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA men's and women's teams will make their first public appearance Nov. 
6 on Family Day at Pauley Pavilion. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers lead the NBA in one department -- luncheons. The one at Anaheim 
recently was a sellout and there will be another Nov. 9 at the Biltmore. It's 
co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Sports Council and L.A. Area Chamber of 
Commerce and tickets are still available. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Roberto Duran (94-10) keeps fighting opponents like Heath Todd, his 
victim in the sixth round on Tuesday, it won't be long until the four-time 
world champion gets his 100th victory. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Davey Lopes deserves a chance to manage in the major leagues. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire should re-sign third baseman Tim Wallach, who had a terrific 
season for the Dodgers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Aqueduct drew only 6,695 fans on opening day Tuesday and concern is being 
expressed for the future of the racetrack in New York. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If I'm staging a World Cup or an Olympic Games, I want somebody from L.A. 
running it. . . . 
</P>

 Rice's victory over Texas proved that anything can happen in college football 
on any given Sunday.

 Shawn Kemp had 31 points and eight rebounds in 25 minutes and the Seattle 
SuperSonics shot 59.2% Wednesday night to send the Lakers to their first loss 
of the exhibition season, a 131-113 decision before 13,843 at the San Diego 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Van Exel made 12 of 18 attempts, including four of seven three-pointers, 
en route to a game-high 33 points for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought at the outset our players were timid," Coach Del Harris said after 
the Lakers committed 20 turnovers against the SuperSonics' trapping, pressing 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting with three consecutive exhibition victories for the first time 
since 1989 -- beating the lottery-bound Clippers and Sacramento in all three -- 
the Lakers dropped to 3-1. Their next game is Friday night against the Orlando 
Magic as part of the four-team GTE Everything Pages Shootout at the Forum.

 Matt Fish, a hustling free-agent center from North Carolina Wilmington, 
livened up the Clippers' 96-90 exhibition loss to the Denver Nuggets before an 
announced crowd of 5,049 Wednesday night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish, at 6 feet 11 and 265 pounds, challenged Nugget center Dikembe Mutombo as 
the Clippers overcame a 21-point deficit with a 20-4 run in the first 10 
minutes of the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish had seven points and three rebounds and nearly outplayed starting center 
Elmore Spencer, who had had seven points and four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed, 86-69, going into the final quarter, tied it at 
90-90 on a three-pointer by rookie swingman Eric Piatkowski with 2:20 left. But 
the Nuggets pulled it out with six consecutive free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Dehere led the Clippers with 21 points. CHRIS BAKER

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; ALL EYES ON FT. COLLINS THIS WEEK

<P>
 The best game in the country this week isn't in Ann Arbor, or Tuscaloosa, or 
South Bend, or any of the other usual stops along the way to a national 
championship. This time you need directions to Ft. Collins, Colo., which is 
where 18th-ranked Utah plays No. 12 Colorado State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, the Utes (6-0) vs. the Rams (7-0) . . . from the Western 
Athletic Conference, that cute little league that until recent months hardly 
bothered anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's be honest: If you wanted your kid to become a fighter pilot, a Mormon 
missionary or to get a real nice tan, you'd send him to the WAC. But if you 
wanted him to play elite level Division I-A football, you'd look elsewhere. Not 
even Brigham Young's strange national championship in 1984, Ty Detmer's Heisman 
Trophy in 1990 or Marshall Faulk's abbreviated but electrifying stay at San 
Diego State could change the perception that the WAC was, well, Sta-puff soft. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this will help: The WAC is 6-2 against its West Coast big brother, the 
Pacific 10 Conference, and 18-10 overall against nonconference opponents. 
Colorado State beat Arizona at Tucson. BYU beat Notre Dame at South Bend. San 
Diego State and Hawaii both beat California. Utah beat Oregon at Eugene. Do you 
notice a trend? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen this coming for two or three years and I've said that," Air Force 
Coach Fisher DeBerry said. "The football in this conference doesn't have to 
take a back seat to anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the WAC's move to the front seat is simple: defense. When Sonny 
Lubick arrived at Colorado State last season, he brought with him the same 
defensive schemes he used as Miami's coordinator. When Ron McBride went to 
Utah, his first priority was finding defensive linemen. When BYU's pass-happy 
LaVell Edwards decided he was tired of losing, 52-51, he began searching for a 
defense and running attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has recognized the need to put more quality players on defense," 
DeBerry said, "and recognized the fact that you win big games and championships 
with defensive football." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah did its part by finding Luther Elliss, a senior defensive end who should 
make some NFL team very happy next season. The minute McBride heard about 
Elliss during spring recruiting, the Ute coaching staff never let up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to have him," said McBride, who considers defensive linemen 
the most difficult players to find and successfully recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of Elliss' emergence as a star, Utah leads in eight of the 10 
WAC defensive categories. The Utes also find themselves in the rarefied air of 
the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, defense isn't sexy. But upsets are. The WAC victories over Notre 
Dame and Arizona and the rest of the Pac-10 did wonders for the league's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I've been saying for years," BYU's Edwards said, "the thing we have 
to do is win big games." 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, the WAC wins believers. MR. CONFIDENCE BUILDER 
</P>
<P>
 We admit it: We were completely fooled by the supposed love-fest going on 
between Florida Coach Steve Spurrier and senior quarterback Terry Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Dean's teammates talk, you would have thought the Gator quarterback 
wished he had a sixth, maybe seventh year of eligibility--all so he could learn 
from the great offensive master, the one and only King Spurrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quarterback controversy is over," wide receiver Aubrey Hill said last 
week, referring to last season's tag team of Dean and then-freshman Danny 
Wuerffel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (Spurrier is) tougher on Terry than anybody else," wide 
receiver Ike Hilliard offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came last Saturday's 36-33 upset loss to Auburn at Florida Field, where a 
nervous Dean had four passes intercepted and fumbled once. The mistakes cost 
the Gators 12 points, to say nothing of their No. 1 ranking, their hopes of an 
undefeated season and a possible national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry did not play all that poorly," Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 He played poorly enough to get pulled before the Gators' second series of the 
second half. Wuerffel came on and completed 10 of 13 passes for 171 yards and 
three touchdowns, with one interception, which means you can pretty much forget 
those "Dean for Heisman" campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Spurrier declined to name a starter for the Oct. 29 game against 
Georgia and hasn't addressed the subject since. Then word leaked out that 
according to Dean, Spurrier had told him last Monday and Friday that Wuerffel 
would play against Auburn if Dean struggled. So much for positive thoughts 
heading into the biggest game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurrier and Dean have had their problems before. They have vastly different 
backgrounds and different styles, but they also have similar personalities: 
borderline arrogant, egotistical, smart and headstrong. Spurrier has told 
friends that, in essence, Dean thinks too much on the field. Dean has told 
teammates and reporters that he could do without the constant threat of losing 
his starting job. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, Dean has had eight passes intercepted in his last three games, 
which has sent Spurrier's visor flying. Dean also didn't earn many admirers for 
his sideline behavior after being benched. He mostly stood by himself and 
offered only a half-hearted clap when Wuerffel's third scoring throw put 
Florida ahead, 33-29, with 5:51 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it all mean? Only Spurrier knows for sure. But a good guess would be 
that coach and quarterback are counting the nanoseconds until season's end. ONE 
HACK, ONE VOTE 
</P>
<P>
 Our half-season awards ballot: 
</P>
<P>
 Coach of the Half-Season  
</P>
<P>
 The Nominees--Auburn's Terry Bowden, Kansas State's Bill Snyder, Colorado 
State's Lubick, Utah's McBride, Duke's Fred Goldsmith and Nebraska's Tom 
Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden, reportedly being scouted by some NFL general managers for future 
openings, has proved the Tigers are no fluke; Snyder has done what no one 
thought possible: brought respect to Kansas State football; Lubick has made 
believers out of his team and the nation; McBride quietly has built a solid 
program in Salt Lake City. Does Duke Athletic Director Tom Butters know how to 
pick coaches or what? He hired Mike Krzyzewski, Spurrier and now Goldsmith, who 
has the Blue Devils unbeaten and in foreign territory--the top 25. Osborne is 
the Energizer Bunny of coaches. Even with a third-string quarterback, he keeps 
winning and winning and winning. 
</P>
<P>
 And the winner is . . . Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 Even his peers marvel at Kansas State's turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody has ever approximated what he has done," said Colorado 
Coach Bill McCartney, who should know. It was McCartney who rebuilt the 
Buffaloes' program into a perennial powerhouse. "What happened at Kansas State 
is unprecedented. I don't think anybody in college football has done a job 
rebuilding a program to compare with what's being done at Manhattan." 
</P>
<P>
 Flop of the Half-Season  
</P>
<P>
 The Nominees--Pac-10, Notre Dame, Wisconsin, Texas wide receiver Mike Adams, 
Kentucky, Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pac-10 is 14-10-1 in Division I-A nonconference games, with half of the 
victories supplied by three teams--Washington, Washington State and Arizona. 
UCLA and Stanford, a combined 3-9-1 overall and 0-7 in the league, deserve 
special mention for embarrassing themselves almost weekly. If it weren't for 
Navy and Air Force on the schedule, Notre Dame might not earn enough victories 
to receive a bowl invitation. Wisconsin fans won't have to worry about Rose 
Bowl ticket scams this season. Texas' Adams, who began the season as a Heisman 
candidate of sorts, now leads the Longhorns in receptions and suspensions. Yes, 
we picked Kentucky (1-5) as a preseason breakthrough team. No, we weren't 
hooked up to Bill Walsh's electrode machine when we made the failed prediction. 
The midseason slogan for Clemson (2-4): "Tiger Football--More Fun Than 
Rickets!" 
</P>
<P>
 And the winner is . . . the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Every preseason Heisman candidate, with the exception of Washington's Napoleon 
Kaufman, is either injured or a bust. The nonconference record is almost as 
funny as a Walsh news conference and the postseason bowl possibilities are 
frightening (perhaps as few as two league teams). 
</P>
<P>
 Player of the Half-Season  
</P>
<P>
 The Nominees--Alcorn State quarterback Steve McNair, Washington's Kaufman, 
Colorado tailback Rashaan Salaam, Nebraska I-back Lawrence Phillips, Miami 
defensive tackle Warren Sapp, Penn State tailback Ki-Jana Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if McNair played for UCLA, he'd still be the best quarterback in the 
country. Miami Coach Dennis Erickson said he was amazed by Kaufman when 
Washington beat the Hurricanes. If it's good enough for Erickson, it's good 
enough for us. Colorado's Kordell Stewart and Michael Westbrook are amazing 
players, but Salaam is the reason the Buffaloes are undefeated. That, and a 
Hail Mary. Phillips gains an average of seven yards per carry. No wonder 
Osborne isn't panicking with the loss of quarterback Tommie Frazier. Sapp 
renders offensive linemen useless. Carter is the Salaam of Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 And the winner is . . . Salaam. But only by the smallest of margins over 
Kaufman and McNair. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 McNair needs only 256 total yards Saturday against Southern to become the 
NCAA's all-time offensive leader. BYU's Detmer is the current leader with 
14,665 yards. . . . Miami's Erickson on Sapp's Heisman chances: "It's just not 
an award for a (defensive) player," he said. "I just don't think that would 
ever happen." . . . Missouri Coach Larry Smith is busy working on his game plan 
for Saturday's game against Nebraska. When that fails--and it will--Smith is 
hoping for Cornhusker hunger pangs. "Hopefully, they'll all take a break and go 
to the concession stand," Smith said of the Cornhuskers. . . . For what it's 
worth, Colorado's McCartney said he voted Nebraska No. 1 this week. . . . If 
not for a reported disagreement over sites, Colorado State and Colorado would 
have played this season. Instead, the two teams don't meet until next year. . . 
. Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney said no team blocks lower or more viciously 
than wishbone-oriented Oregon State. Top 10

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcy Crouch, a three-sport standout from Marina High, orally committed to 
play softball at Stanford, Marina girls' volleyball Coach Jason Bilbruck said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior pitcher last season, Crouch, twice a Times All-Orange County 
selection, led the Vikings to the Southern Section Division I championship.She 
pitched a one-hitter and struck out 10 in the Vikings' 2-0 victory over 
Foothill in the title game. Crouch finished last season with a 22-2 record, 
0.24 earned-run average, and she hit .337. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch is also a standout in soccer and volleyball. Last soccer season, she 
was the defensive co-player of the year in the Sunset League and she had two 
assists in Marina's 3-0 victory over Palos Verdes Peninsula in the Division I 
championship game. The Vikings finished 28-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
 In volleyball, Crouch helped Marina to a fast start and a county top-10 
ranking early this season. She was named to the all-tournament team of the 
Orange County Championships. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Kamm and Sean Murphy shot 64s but shared the spotlight with two big 
names Wednesday in the first round of the five-day, 90-hole Las Vegas 
Invitational over three courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamm, who hasn't finished higher than sixth in a five-year career, had a 
10-foot eagle and no bogeys, and Murphy birdied the last two holes for a share 
of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the attention, though, went to Greg Norman and Paul Azinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, making his first American tour start in almost two months, served 
notice his health problems were at an end with a solid 67. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian had played only once since the World Series of Golf in August. 
He was forced out of the Presidents Cup with intestinal problems, causing him 
to lose 13 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 His only other appearance was in the team Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews, 
Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger, on a comeback from cancer treatment, continued to have problems with 
back spasms and was unable to play for the second consecutive week. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman is pointing toward next week's season-ending Tour Championship in an 
effort to overtake Nick Price in the money race. Price, who is not competing in 
this event, leads $1,442,927 to Norman's $1,255,164. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman also leads in the race for the Vardon Trophy, which goes to the player 
with the lowest adjusted scoring average for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 His opening 67 improved on the leading 68.42 adjusted average he had coming 
in. Tom Lehman was second at 69.10. 
</P>
<P>
 The 144 pros play with a different, three-man amateur team each day of the 
tournament, playing one round on each of three courses before the field is cut 
for the final two rounds Saturday and Sunday at Summerlin.

WESTSIDE WATCH: JOY TO RODEO DRIVE . . . THE HARLEYS HAVE COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Move over, red sleigh and eight tiny reindeer. The Rodeo Drive merchants 
association in Beverly Hills has decided to sell a hipper mode of Yuletide 
transit -- the Harley-Davidson motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters hope "Happy Harley Days" on Dec. 4 will attract a younger, more 
festive Christmas clientele to Rodeo Drive. Portions of Rodeo Drive will be 
used for a Harley-Davidson bike show and boutique, while another section of the 
street will be blocked off for a parade of the Santa bikers -- complete with Ma 
Clauses along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The merchants' association picked the Harley-Davidson theme after the 
organization's public relations firm got a look at the demographics of Harley 
owners, two-thirds of whom have household incomes topping $100,000. And 
included among Harley owners are numerous celebrities -- among them Cher, who 
will serve as the event's grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Christmas affair has not gone totally commercial. There will still be 
the usual warm and fuzzy hot-chocolate-and-roasted-chestnut fixings, a 
Christmas tree-lighting ceremony and choirs singing Yuletide favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't expect sleighs: The jingling bells would be drowned out by the 
high-performance bikes. 
</P>

 FLASH OF GREEN: During the primary, the California League of Conservation 
Voters characterized state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) as an 
environmental fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the group is endorsing him over his Republican opponent, David Barrett 
Cohen, in the race for a state Senate district that includes Marina del Rey, 
Venice and Playa del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills "has shown this year that he became a very good vote on the 
environment," said Doug Linney, political director for the group. "He's been 
very straightforward and sincere with us. We're going to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 The group based much of its opposition to Dills during the primary on his 1993 
record: He voted for legislation that the group supported only 39% of the time, 
Linney said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he scored "in the 90s," Linney said. Among other things, Dills 
backed a ban on offshore oil drilling in state tidelands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to improve their scores, and he certainly has shown he has 
improved his," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills has said that he's been going green because he's in a new district with 
more eco-conscious constituents. His old district was carved up in 
reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cohen says the group's about-face "proves they are a partisan 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing," he said. "They have a huge credibility problem."

 FREE SPIKE?: A hefty old lobster -- named Spike by fans with a crush on the 
crustacean -- has gone from meal to mascot. Spike won't be scalded and 
buttered. And the creature won't be raffled off Nov. 1, as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead the 12 1/2-pound Maine lobster, estimated to be 65 years old, will get 
his own tank at Gladstone's 4 Fish, a popular Pacific Coast Highway restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that nobody wanted Spike to become a dinner. We got a lot of calls 
to save Spike, so we are going to save him," restaurant manager Kerri Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spike was scheduled to be the main course at $9.95 a pound during a fall 
Gladstone's lobster-fest. The gentle giant has his own section of the 
restaurant's lobster tank and he will soon get his own tank, the restaurant 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 No word yet on whether this will satisfy Spike's supporters.

LIQUOR AGENCY BIASED AGAINST GAY CLUBS, BAR OWNERS CLAIM; DISPUTE: STATE 
OFFICIALS INSIST REGULATIONS ARE APPLIED FAIRLY TO ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Jesse Arias hung a drawing by a well-known gay artist in 
the West Hollywood nightclub he manages. The picture isn't there anymore, but 
it may be getting even more attention as exhibit A in a feud between owners of 
gay bars and state liquor regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, officials from the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control ordered Arias to remove the drawing -- a life-size portrait of a nude 
man -- from the wall at The Eagle, a gay bar on Santa Monica Boulevard. The 
drawing was by the late Tom of Finland, a Los Angeles artist who specialized in 
homoerotic nudes and whose works are sold in many gay and lesbian shops and 
bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators said the picture violated 24-year-old state codes against offensive 
"visual displays" in places that serve liquor because it depicted male 
genitals. But, according to Arias, West Hollywood bar owners and city 
officials, the incident is the latest chapter in a history of regulatory 
harassment directed against gay-oriented nightspots. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent meeting, a group of nightclub owners belonging to the West 
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce reportedly aired concerns about overzealous and 
hidebound enforcement from liquor regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like, gimme a break," Arias said. "If straight people want to come into 
our bar, fine. We don't discriminate. But this is the kind of art we like to 
look at. If I walked into a straight bar and saw art that offended me, I would 
just leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Said West Hollywood City Councilman Steve Martin: "I think it's an incredible 
coincidence that the (gay) clubs on Santa Monica Boulevard are complaining 
about harassment, while we aren't hearing any complaints from the (straight) 
establishments on Sunset Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoholic Beverage Control officials vigorously deny allegations that they 
have an anti-gay bias. One top regulator ascribed the accusations to paranoia 
in the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scratching my head wondering how anyone would think this (incident) is 
part of a mass Gestapo action to put these (nightclubs) out of business," said 
Carl Falletta, assistant director at the department. "Every day we're out there 
citing places for violations." 
</P>
<P>
 State codes passed in 1970 give regulators the power to deny a liquor license 
to any establishment that, among other things, features films or pictures 
showing full nudity or sexual acts.  
</P>
<P>
 Falletta said liquor stores and bars statewide are routinely cited for 
violations of the codes. In several recent cases, he said, liquor stores have 
been cited for offensive visual displays. But he could not immediately provide 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood nightspot operators have aimed much of their criticism at 
Falletta's deputy, Jane Hernandez, who they claim harbors a bias against gay 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very slick and hides behind a cloak of regulation," said Michael McVay, 
the co-owner of Capone's, an upscale restaurant and gay bar in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said she has been going by the book: "Any time we detect a 
violation, we take some type of action to have it rectified. . . . It doesn't 
matter where the violation is."

WEST HOLLYWOOD TO GET 7 NEW DEPUTIES; LAW ENFORCEMENT: CITY'S SUBSTATION WILL 
RECEIVE ABOUT $635,000 FROM FEDERAL CRIME BILL. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WILL GET 
$3 MILLION TO SPEND COUNTYWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 West Hollywood has become the first Westside city to get a law enforcement 
boost from the crime bill recently signed by President Clinton, but other local 
communities may not be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $200 million allocated nationwide in the first round of funding, West 
Hollywood will receive $635,828 for seven new officers. City officials say they 
will use the money to hire officers for the Los Angeles County sheriff's West 
Hollywood substation. 
</P>
<P>
 The first round of crime bill funding will also yield $3 million for the 
Sheriff's Department to spend countywide. Some of that money may eventually 
benefit the Westside because the sheriff's office plans to use the money -- 
enough to hire 33 new officers -- to boost law enforcement in unincorporated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's spokesman said the department has not decided exactly which areas 
will be targeted for more policing, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's crime bill, signed into law last month, sets aside $8.8 billion in 
grants to law enforcement agencies to hire police officers and implement 
community policing programs. The money is being allocated based on applications 
that law enforcement agencies submit to the U.S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the $200 million in grants announced last week will be used to 
help more than 385 jurisdictions across the nation hire 2,770 new officers -- 
the first of 100,000 new police that the crime bill will help put on the 
country's streets over the next six years, according to the Clinton 
Administration. The grants will be distributed in the same amounts next year 
and in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 California is expected to receive about $900 million over the next six years 
under the crime bill, about 85% of which could be used to hire about 10,200 
more police officers, according to the Justice Department.  
</P>
<P>
 The 33 new officers that the Sheriff's Department plans to hire under the 
program will be deployed in some of the 2,672 square miles of unincorporated 
county land, not in any of the 42 cities that contract with the department for 
policing, said Lt. Jeff Springs, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to economic reasons, over the past several years we have had to cut back 
in our patrol of non-contract, unincorporated areas of the county," Springs 
said. Cities that contract with the department have suffered no cutbacks 
because their agreements with the agency establish a minimum level of patrols, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 To police an area with about 2.5 million people, the Sheriff's Department 
currently employs about 8,000 sworn officers, including those who staff courts 
and jails. Among the unincorporated areas the agency serves are Baldwin Hills, 
Marina del Rey and Windsor Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood, though it contracts with the Sheriff's Department, applied for 
its own federal grant and was awarded three years of funding for seven new 
officers. In its successful application to the Justice Department, the city 
touted its community policing program and enumerated some of its special needs, 
said Nancy Greenstein, West Hollywood's public safety administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The city could decide to focus on preventing gay-bashing, for example, or on 
conflicts that have been occurring between Armenian and Russian immigrant 
youths, she said. Ultimately, however, the use of the new officers must be 
worked out with the Sheriff's Department, Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we already have good patrol coverage," Greenstein said. "So this 
gives us the opportunity to establish teams to respond to specific problems 
that we're not now able to respond to." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Los Angeles Police Department was not one of the agencies to 
receive crime bill money, it plans to apply for three-year grants that would 
begin to be paid out in July, 1995, said Bayan Lewis, a deputy chief with the 
department.

DECISION '94: SPOTLIGHT ON LOCAL ELECTIONS; CHILD OF '60S FACES MAINSTREAM GOP 
IN 41ST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how you look at it, voters in the 41st Assembly District have a 
clear choice on Nov. 8: They can send Democrat Sheila James Kuehl, a child of 
the '60s, to Sacramento, or opt instead for Republican Michael T. Meehan, a 
member of Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl is unapologetically liberal, a feminist and a law professor. She gained 
early fame as the brainy Zelda on the television sitcom, "The Many Loves of 
Dobie Gillis," and later acclaim as a nationally known expert on domestic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan is a mainstream, law-and-order Republican who works as a reserve 
sheriff's deputy. Though Meehan cannot boast of a hit sitcom, he did serve as 
student body president at UCLA, where Kuehl also earned her bachelor's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 The shared alma mater is a rare piece of common ground in their campaigns for 
the open seat in the sprawling 41st, which hugs the coast from the southern 
border of Santa Monica to the Ventura County line, pairing Westlake Village and 
Calabasas with Pacific Palisades and Malibu. They are joined in the race by a 
third candidate -- Libertarian Philip W. Baron of Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent records from the county Registrar-Recorder's office show 51% of 41st 
District voters are Democrats, 36% are Republicans, with the remaining 13% 
either independents or members of small parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered a swing district in which either a Republican or Democrat could 
win, voters two years ago supported liberal Democrat Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood) against moderate Republican Christine Reed, a former mayor of 
Santa Monica, who is directing Meehan's campaign. Friedman gave up the seat to 
run for a Los Angeles County Superior Court judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl, who steamrollered over her five male opponents in the Democratic 
primary, is widely considered the favorite over Meehan, who is campaigning 
vigorously but so far lacks the money for a single districtwide mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Kuehl will be the first openly lesbian or gay member of the state 
Legislature, a point that does not come up on the campaign trail -- nor should 
it, both candidates say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sexual orientation is not relevant," Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl agrees, though she has drawn much of her campaign funding from the gay 
and lesbian community, which provided about 40% of her primary war chest, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a lesbian is not a qualification for office," she said. "I'm not 
running as a lesbian candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl does, however, think it is imperative that voters know about her sexual 
orientation. She has gotten the word out in news interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Kuehl trumpets her accomplishments on women's issues -- nearly all 
California legislation on spousal abuse bears her mark -- as well as a slew of 
endorsements ranging from Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina to 
Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
 While Meehan has a decidedly shorter resume, he, too, has law enforcement 
support, notably the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which speaks for the 
LAPD rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan hopes to paint Kuehl as a leftist, pointing out she was quoted in a 
book describing herself as a "radical." Kuehl says she never made the 
statement, but Meehan says he would use it as the centerpiece of a campaign 
mailer -- if only he had the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he were to send such a mailer, it would backfire among district 
voters, responds Kuehl, who refers to her political stance as "progressive." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing that people call the kinds of issues I work on 'radical,' " she 
said. "My ideas are not radical. . . . If you're calling me a 'lefty,' you're 
saying women's issues are 'lefty.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl opposes both Proposition 187, which would deny state services to illegal 
immigrants, as well as the "three-strikes" initiative aimed at repeat felons 
because it is not limited to violent crimes. Meehan is hoping these positions 
will become her Achilles' heel.  
</P>
<P>
 Meehan, who supports both propositions, is also trying to make an issue of 
Kuehl's conflicting statements on Proposition 186, the single-payer health care 
initiative. In one debate she spoke against it, in another in favor.

DECISION '94: SPOTLIGHT ON LOCAL ELECTIONS; CANDIDATE HOPES TO CREATE STATE 
ASSEMBLY'S 1ST FATHER-SON TEAM; ELECTIONS: WITH A WIN IN THE HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC 
47TH DISTRICT, WINDSOR HILLS LAWYER KEVIN MURRAY WOULD JOIN HIS DAD, WILLARD 
(D-PARAMOUNT), IN SACRAMENTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Confident of joining his father in the state Assembly after the November 
elections, Windsor Hills lawyer Kevin Murray is already looking ahead to rising 
to a leadership role in the political vacuum expected to result from term 
limits for legislative offices. 
</P>
<P>
 But first Murray will have to beat Republican challenger Jonathan Leonard and 
two minor-party candidates for the seat vacated by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore, 
who made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for Secretary of 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray has reason to be confident -- 76% of the 47th District's registered 
voters are Democrats. Only 14% are Republicans. In the 1992 election, Leonard 
won only 14% of the vote against Moore's 81%. And this time around, Leonard 
does not appear to have the resources for an aggressive, districtwide campaign. 
He reported no campaign bankroll in his most recent finance statement, while 
Murray has reported raising $108,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent most of that in a tough, nine-candidate primary. With the help of his 
father, Assemblyman Willard Murray (D-Paramount), and supporters including 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, Murray beat primary opponents who included a 
candidate backed by the powerful political machine of Reps. Howard Berman 
(D-Panorama City) and Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 He had something else going for him, he says. He knows the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very important for me and my peer group, my friends, to run in an area 
where I grew up, where I rode my bike, where I had my first job," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47th District covers parts of Baldwin Hills, the Crenshaw district, Culver 
City, Palms and South-Central Los Angeles. Its heart is predominantly black, 
upper- and middle-income neighborhoods, and it also has less affluent areas and 
a significant Jewish population, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts consider the district a sure win for Democrats. Leonard acknowledges 
that his challenge is to persuade voters to look beyond the party labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get a lot of crossovers," he said. "People realize it's time 
to vote for the best person for the job." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Murray did not take a traditional career path for a politician. He 
said that unlike the African American politicians of a previous generation, 
many of whom came from the church and the civil rights struggle, his experience 
is in business. 
</P>
<P>
 While a talent agent for the William Morris Agency, he studied comparative 
Asian economic systems for his MBA and then studied law. He received his 
business degree in 1983 and his law degree in 1987, both from Loyola Marymount 
University. In 1989, he began working in entertainment law and as a children's 
court advocate.  
</P>
<P>
 At first, he said, his father was skeptical about his run for office. "He 
wanted to make sure that I really wanted to do it, and he wanted to make sure I 
had what it took," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his father eventually helped run the campaign, lined up support in 
Sacramento and put him on his slate mailer. Murray won 21% of the primary vote, 
four points ahead of Ed Johnson, an aide to U.S. Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los 
Angeles) who was backed by the Berman-Waxman machine, and teacher Jimmie Woods 
Gray. 
</P>
<P>
 In the general election campaign, Murray expects to spend only a fraction of 
the $83,000 he spent on the primary race. From July 1 through Sept. 30 he 
raised $17,000, he said. During that period, his biggest contributors were two 
$1,000 donors: Continental Cablevision and the Berman for Congress Committee, 
Johnson's allies in the primary. He also collected $975 from the California 
Real Estate PAC and $750 from United Teachers-Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Willard Murray said he expects to continue working closely with his son in 
Sacramento, where they would be the first father-son team in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can take credit for anything, I have more credit as a father who helped 
raise a person who developed into a fine citizen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They do have differences. Willard Murray said his son supports strict gun 
control, while he does not, and in general his son is more liberal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They're both hoping Kevin will rise to leadership roles in the Assembly. 
Because of term limits, one of the new Assembly members elected in November 
will be a speaker in six years. But "we're not looking that far ahead," Willard 
Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard, 63, a retired firefighter and lifelong resident of the area, said he 
believes he can appeal to Democratic voters with his ideas for improving 
education through increased community involvement and improving the economy 
with enterprise zones. 
</P>
<P>
 California's social problems, he said, cannot be resolved by the state's 
massive increase in prison construction. "We need to get jobs for this 
community," Leonard said. "(Prisons) are not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The similarity of Murray's name to that of a third-party candidate in the 
race, Libertarian Kevin Murphy, could confuse some voters.  
</P>
<P>
 A supporter of a cautious approach to such Libertarian policies as 
legalization of drugs, Murphy said he hopes to show that voters will respond if 
the Libertarians target less controversial issues such as lower taxes. Murphy, 
a computer programmer, also opposes restrictions on smoking and supports 
privatization of government services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peace and Freedom candidate in the race is Tamara Taleebah, a teacher. In 
the primary, both Murphy and Taleebah ran uncontested.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; TOYS R US REACHES PACT TO BUY PROPERTY

 Business: Agreement will allow the chain to take over site of Henshey's 
Department Store building, severely damaged in January quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys R Us has reached an agreement with the owners of the landmark Henshey's 
Department Store building in Santa Monica under which the toy chain will buy 
the 30,000-square-foot property on Fourth Street and Santa Monica Boulevard, a 
Henshey's official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Henshey's went out of business two years ago. But it took the Northridge 
earthquake to officially retire the building, which was severely damaged in the 
Jan. 17 temblor, dashing the hopes of preservationists who had wanted to 
restore it. 
</P>
<P>
 William A. Spurgin, an adviser to the owners, refused to comment on the amount 
of the sale agreement, reached this week as demolition crews dismantled the 
store's venerable sign. He said only that the property was sold at "market 
value." In 1991, Henshey's President Ralph DeMeglio was quoted as saying the 
property was worth "somewhere around $12 million." 
</P>
<P>
 The sale to Toys R Us, Spurgin said, is "ideal for the community and for the 
revitalization of Fourth Street." He said architectural plans for the new toy 
store will be submitted in 30 days and construction should be completed by 
September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The new building, Spurgin said, will be one or two stories high, "compatible 
with the neighborhood and reminiscent of the historical character of the former 
Henshey's building." He said Henshey's will be involved in planning the 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, the condition of the Henshey's building steadily 
worsened to the point that engineers decided it was a danger, and the city 
declared it a public nuisance. Demolition began in late August and should be 
completed in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 When the department store opened in 1925, it was called Bay Department Store. 
It was renamed Henshey's in the 1930s, when one of the owners, Harry C. 
Henshey, bought out his partners. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Santa Monica Historical Society, the store's arrival in Santa 
Monica made it possible for residents to do more of their shopping in town. 
Declared a local newspaper: "Santa Monica is a big city now." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the store was 25,000 square feet, which was considered enormous at 
the time. It was only the second building on the Westside to have elevators. 
Its motto was: "Always a salesclerk, never a line." LINDA FELDMAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; SOCIETY PLANS VIDEO HISTORY OF LOCAL FILMMAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Vivian Leigh met her match -- Clark Gable -- in "Gone With the Wind," she 
was nowhere near a plantation in Georgia. Her fits and flirtations were filmed 
in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just one of many notable movies Culver City can claim as 
home-grown. "Citizen Kane," "King Kong," and portions of Sylvester Stallone's 
first "Rocky" were also shot there. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as the movie industry's foothold in Culver City continues to loosen, 
the Culver City Historical Society is attempting to preserve on video the 
city's history as a company town, filming interviews for what it hopes will be 
a two-hour documentary: "Reel Life in Culver City." 
</P>
<P>
 The project will cost the historical society about $250,000, which the group 
hopes to raise through donations. The society is currently discussing the 
project with film and television companies, including the Arts & Entertainment 
channel, said Hal Horne, the society's president. 
</P>
<P>
 In its film, the Historical Society plans to look at Culver City's movie 
industry through the eyes of the people who worked behind the scenes or played 
bit roles -- drivers, stunt people, artists, cinematographers and extras. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the stories no one has heard, like the stunt man who told us that 
one time he waited with Greta Garbo in a boat out in the middle of a lake until 
the weather cleared and they could start shooting," Horne said. "They joked 
around and swapped stories about their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Just weeks before his death earlier this year, former Culver City Mayor Dan 
Patacchia described his experience on camera of trying to manage the city from 
1962 to 1968, when the movie industry still dominated the local culture.  
</P>
<P>
 "Milton Berle wanted to bring gambling to the city, but the city didn't want 
it, so Patacchia told him, 'You may be a funny man, Mr. Berle, but this is no 
laughing matter,' " Horne said.  
</P>
<P>
 Added Ross Hawkins, producer of the project and a Culver City resident: "The 
movies influenced people on how they dressed, how they smoked, how they talked 
and probably even who they voted for."  
</P>
<P>
 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the biggest force in the area from 1924 until it sold 
some of its property to Sony in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the heyday of MGM, all the people who worked on the sets -- the 
craftspeople, the stunt people -- everyone lived in Culver City," said Horne. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had a direct impact on the economic vitality in the city. You had people 
who worked at the studio for 40 or 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
 One of MGM's longtime employees was the late Ben Carre, who for 35 years 
designed sets for some of the studio's box office smashes. Among his finest was 
the backdrop for the 1923 version of "Phantom of the Opera."  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, because of weather, they had to finish a location shot in the 
studio and, if he didn't design the backdrops, they wouldn't have been able to 
complete the picture," said his wife, Anne Carre, 87. MARY MOORE

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>

 BEVERLY HILLS: Cigarette vending machines have gone up in a puff of smoke in 
Beverly Hills. This week, the city became the second on the Westside to adopt 
an outright ban on use of the machines for cigarette sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to join Santa Monica 
and 98 cities nationwide in eliminating cigarette vending machines from local 
stores, restaurants, bars and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they took action out of concern that the coin-operated 
vending machines were easily accessible to youths under 18, who are prohibited 
by state law from buying cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills officials cited a recent survey by the Los Angeles Regional 
Tobacco Control Community Linkage Project that found a majority of tobacco 
retailers are willing to sell cigarettes over the counter and through vending 
machines to underage youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vending machines are the first places kids actually buy cigarettes," said 
Beverly Hills anti-smoking activist Dr. Trisha Roth. "Although they may not 
make up the biggest sales, it's where they make their first purchase."  
</P>
<P>
 By making it harder for children to buy cigarettes, a generation of potential 
smokers will be stopped, said Patrick Reynolds, an anti-smoking activist who is 
the grandson of tobacco company founder R.J. Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty percent of all smokers begin smoking by the age of 14, said Reynolds, 
and 90% of all smokers become addicted by the age of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how many cigarette vending machines are in Beverly Hills because 
business owners are not required to report them. Beverly Hills officials said 
they sent notices on the pending vending machine ban to about 400 local 
restaurants and stores, but no one spoke in opposition to the prohibition 
during Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Santa Monica became the second city in the state to ban the vending 
machines. But it has not enforced the law since a similar law enacted in Rancho 
Mirage came under a court challenge, Santa Monica City Councilman Kelly Olsen 
said. In June, however, a federal judge upheld Rancho Mirage's prohibition on 
cigarette vending machines, and Santa Monica plans to begin enforcing its own 
ordinance, Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on the Westside, West Hollywood does not ban cigarette vending 
machines, but only allows them to be placed in bars, a city official said. Los 
Angeles and Culver City, meanwhile, neither restrict nor ban the machines. 
</P>
<P>
 SANTA MONICA: Hoping to drive homeless feeding programs indoors, the Santa 
Monica City Council voted this week to regulate charitable meals programs by 
requiring that food preparation and serving meet strict county health code 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The action Tuesday was the latest attempt by politically liberal Santa Monica 
to reconcile the nutritional needs of the city's estimated 2,000 homeless with 
residents' worries about the presence of large numbers of homeless people in 
city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The new measure, supporters said, does not prohibit serving food on city 
parkland. But it gives homeless services a strong incentive to conduct feeding 
programs indoors because the county food preparation and serving standards 
would otherwise be difficult to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of people spoke out against the measure, however, with many calling it 
mean-spirited and saying it would undermine aid to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 One longtime volunteer in the feeding programs, Dr. Gary Spivey, said he 
believed most charitable organization would not be able to meet the health code 
standards -- indoors or outdoors -- and would stop their meal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starvation and malnutrition are bigger problems than food-borne illnesses," 
Spivey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Health and Safety codes set standards for food storage, 
preparation, handling and transport. They also require that food be maintained 
at certain temperatures and address the dating and packaging of foods for box 
lunches, according to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 A February, 1993, city ordinance addressing the feeding of homeless people 
required that groups had to obtain a permit if more than 35 people gathered in 
a city park. A federal judge overturned that law in April, ruling that it was a 
violation of 1st Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Mayor Judy Abdo cast the sole vote opposing the new food standards 
ordinance, commenting that some homeless people may be reluctant to eat indoor. 
The law is expected to take effect in late November after it receives a second 
reading before the council next week. SUSAN STEINBERG

HABITAT: RESTORATION WORK CUT OUT FOR AIRPORTS ON THE EL SEGUNDO DUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Deborah Schoch's fine article on the past, present and future 
of the El Segundo Dunes habitat ("Butterfly Safety Net," Oct. 13th), there is 
good reason for concern about the area's ongoing restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Department of Airports, now in charge of the vastly 
improved 200-acre preserve, lacks the expertise, as well as the honest desire, 
to provide the maintenance that has been carried out for the past five years by 
qualified biologists and enthusiastic environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy to be reckoned with is that the fruits of this dedicated and 
caring labor could easily be destroyed not only by insufficient funds but also 
by disinterest and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1985, the California Coastal Commission admonished the Airport 
Department for allowing the acreage to lie fallow and barren for a dozen years, 
even though it was the known habitat of the federally listed endangered El 
Segundo blue butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 This must not be repeated. The re-establishing ecosystems can be an invaluable 
resource to scientists and an educational tool for school children about sand 
dunes and what makes them special places in our environment. 
</P>
<P>
 As the new custodian of this treasure, the Department of Airports has its work 
cut out for it. If it can't do the job properly, then the decision makers 
should turn the preserve over to someone, or some agency, that can.

SCHOOLS: PROP. K'S IMPACT ON THE FUTURE OF A QUALITY SCHOOL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have worked in the Santa Monica-Malibu School District, in good times and 
bad, since 1965 as librarian and teacher at Cabrillo, John Adams, Lincoln and 
SAMOHI. We have the finest students, the best teachers, staff and 
administrators, the most dedicated parents and the most giving community in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica and Malibu parents and community members have supported teachers, 
librarians and students in all the tough times since Proposition 13. We hope 
they will continue to do so by voting YES on Proposition K. (The K is for 
Kids.) We need to educate our students now for their future and ours. 
</P>
<P>
 When we were young, learning the three R's was enough. Now we have added IT, 
information and technology. No child currently enrolled in our schools, whether 
preschool or senior high, will be able to get along in life without knowing how 
to access, evaluate and use information, whether it's available in print or 
electronically on CD-ROM or the Internet. We need the success of Proposition K 
not only to maintain the classrooms and libraries we have now, but also to 
extend our limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Our books are wearing out. The children, from kindergarten to high school, 
have read them to shreds. I wish you could see some of the picture books and 
easy-to-read books in our elementary school libraries that are falling apart. 
Dr. Seuss would weep. We need to replace outdated science, geography, biography 
and history books in all our school libraries. We need to add technology to our 
libraries and classrooms. ES is bringing us updated facilities. Now we need 
updated resources to put in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who work in the schools are becoming experts in fund raising and 
grant writing. Thanks to generous gifts from parents, alumni and community 
members, we are dog paddling in the oceans of the future. What we'd really like 
to do is swim. Please help us do that by voting yes on K.

COUNCIL: PLUSES, MINUSES OF HIGH-PROFILE YAROSLAVSKY NAME IN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can we get real about Barbara Yaroslavsky for just a moment? I don't know her 
as well as I do her husband, but she's probably a very nice person and 
dedicated to doing good in her community. However, the thought that she is 
simply another City Council candidate on some imaginary level playing field is 
naive and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara has about as high-profile a name as one could have in L.A. politics. 
She will use it freely. She will get votes from those who see a vote for her as 
the equivalent of a vote for Zev. She will get campaign money from those who 
know that a donation to her is a donation to Supervisor Zev. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is illegal and one should expect a politician to do it. But if 
Barbara is going to benefit from Zev's drawing power, she ought to suffer for 
the destruction he has left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Westsiders should think of Barbara Yaroslavsky when they watch Westside small 
businesses and jobs leaving the area, when they struggle with burgeoning 
traffic congestion, and when they lock their doors and stay off the streets at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelenos should put Barbara's face on years of grinding City Council 
gridlock, huge financial settlements to incompetent and larcenous City 
functionaries and outrageous boondoggles like our never-to-be subway system. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's not so bad that at least one candidate has a history we can attach 
her to. On the other hand, maybe she was out of the loop.

 What's the latest scoop on President Clinton or O.J. Simpson? Just ask Paul 
Krassner. 
</P>
<P>
 Satirist Krassner, along with other 
</P>
<P>
 top comedians, will kick off "Cabaret Au Lait" tonight in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening is appropriately named since the comedy, music and theater take 
place at the French Roast Coffee House. 
</P>
<P>
 A benefit for Turning Point Shelter of Santa Monica, which is sponsoring the 
show in cooperation with Parlor Performances, the hourlong program includes 
music along with performances by other local comedians. Krassner headlines this 
evening's show. Considered by many to be the Bob Hope of counterculture, 
Krassner will deliver a routine filled with biting commentary on current news 
events as well as some of his standard material. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a lot of money, I would donate that," said Krassner, 62, a resident 
of Venice. "All I can do is donate my talent. The cause is good." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of generous performers who will donate their time, event 
organizers hope this inaugural event will brew into a monthly series. Proceeds 
will benefit Turning Point, a project that provides transitional housing for 
people seeking permanent jobs and housing. It is a part of the Ocean Park 
Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "(We hope) this is a way to introduce more people to Turning Point," said 
Kathryn Turpin, a Santa Monica resident and longtime volunteer for the 
nonprofit organization. "We want to develop support in the community and 
provide informal, inexpensive entertainment." CHRISTINA V. GODBEY The show

<P>
 Although only four weeks remain in the high school football season, that is 
plenty of time for a team such as Palisades to reverse course and become a 
playoff contender. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever twists and turns are in store for City Section teams, a trip to 
the City title game will follow a different course thanks to a radical change 
in the playoff system. That change has some coaches pleased and others 
scratching their heads in bewilderment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the revised playoff system, teams are no longer designated to be in the 
4-A or 3-A division at the beginning of the season. Instead, a selection 
committee will meet at the end of the season and select the top 16 teams to 
compete in the 4-A playoffs and a second 16 to compete in the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the six conference champions will gain automatic berths and the remaining 
10 at-large spots will be determined by a nine-member selection committee. 
Those at-large teams and all of the 3-A playoff teams will be selected based on 
record, strength of conference and strength of nonconference schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 49 City Section schools, 32 will make one of the two playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades (1-4), which normally competes in the 4-A division, would be out of 
playoff contention after losing its first four games. But under the new format, 
the Dolphins could win their remaining four games and be selected as at-large 
3-A team. Friday's 21-20 win over Fairfax has given Coach Russ Howard and the 
Dolphins new hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we win three of our next four games, I think we have a shot at making the 
playoffs," Howard said. "I look down at the standings and I see 17 teams that 
are weaker than us." 
</P>
<P>
 With a month left in the regular season, a division has been formed between 
the haves and the have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at the possible playoff teams. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 4-A Division, Sylmar (6-0) is the only City team ranked in the State by 
Cal-Hi Sports magazine. The 1992 City 4-A champions are ranked 14th and will be 
the top-seeded team if they remain undefeated. Taft (5-1) is another powerhouse 
team from the San Fernando Valley and will most likely win the Northwest Valley 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Conference champion should be determined Friday when Westchester 
(5-1) plays host to University (4-2). Even if they lose, the Comets have 
regularly made the 4-A playoffs and are a sure bet to receive an at-large 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Pacific Conference has dominated the City playoffs for the past 
three decades. Although they have mediocre records, Banning (3-2-1), Carson 
(2-4), Crenshaw (4-2), Dorsey (4-2) and San Pedro (4-2) should make the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell (5-1), Fremont (4-1) and South Gate (5-1) are in a dogfight for supremacy 
in the Southeastern Conference, and any one of the three could drop to the 
bottom of the pack during the next four weeks. But as it stands, all three will 
make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson (5-1) and Franklin (5-1) play for the Northern Conference lead Friday, 
but the loser will have a realistic shot at receiving a wild-card berth. The 
other wild-card berths should go to Granada Hills (4-2) and Van Nuys (5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 But there is plenty of time left for upsets and change of fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see a conference with a lot of super teams," Westchester Coach Larry 
Wein said. "There is a lot of evenness unless I'm missing something." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 3-A playoffs, 18 teams are competing for 16 openings. Although Manual 
Arts (3-3) upset Dorsey, the Toilers would be best served competing in the 
lower division. With games left against Westchester and Venice, they might not 
have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Venice (4-2) also has an uphill battle with games left against Westchester and 
Manual Arts. Friday's 19-17 loss to University cost the Gondoliers a realistic 
chance to make the 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Southern Pacific Conference, Gardena (3-2-1) and Washington (2-4) 
appear to be in and Narbonne (1-5) is out. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three teams from the Southeastern Conference will make the 3-A 
playoffs. Among the contenders are Garfield (3-3), Roosevelt (3-3), Locke (2-4) 
and Jefferson (2-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle Rock (4-2) and Belmont (3-2-1) should represent the Northern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland (4-2), Kennedy (3-3) and San Fernando (3-3) should qualify from the 
Northwest Valley and Birmingham (3-3), Chatsworth (2-4) are on the bubble. From 
the Valley Pac-8 conference, Poly (3-3), Reseda (3-3) and Monroe (2-4) are in 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood (2-4), Palisades, Fairfax (1-5) are Westside schools that appear to 
be long shots at making the playoffs. BRAGGING RIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa has lost only two games in two seasons, both to Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centaurs, behind the receiving of Jasiri Rodell, beat the defending 
Southern Section Division VII Mustangs, 33-21, on Friday to gain the upper hand 
for first place in the Ocean League. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodell caught nine passes for 220 yards and four touchdowns. He also had an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "We jelled at the right time," Culver City Coach Robert Moore said. "Jasiri 
Rodell and (quarterback) Damon Williams came ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaching staff also did a great job preparing the team during the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams passed for 268 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, inside linebacker Thaddeus Morrison, defensive lineman Vince Sims 
and strong safety Rashad Stroops were lauded by Moore. GAME OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 When Westchester plays host to University on Friday, it will be a game 
matching a big-play offense against a ball-control team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors are led by running back Marco Pleas, who rushed for 171 yards and 
two touchdowns in a 19-17 victory over Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets are led by tight end Tony Griffin, who had 230 all-purpose yards 
and two touchdowns, and quarterback Damion Ward, who passed for two touchdowns 
in the first half of a 46-8 Coastal Conference victory over Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes down to which team gets to play their type of game," Wein said. "We 
need the ball to run our big-play offense. They need to control the ball and 
run time off the clock." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the best record in the Coastal Conference and a potential 
automatic berth in the City 4-A playoffs. TEST OF TIME 
</P>
<P>
 After relinquishing a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, St. Monica came 
back on Dwight Carter's touchdown and two-point conversion to beat St. Anthony, 
29-28, in its Camino Real League opening game. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter caught a 12-yard touchdown pass and the two-point conversion from Steve 
Pulley to make the score 29-22 with 5 minutes 23 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But St. Anthony, which overcame a 21-7 deficit, scored when quarterback Joshua 
Zak threw a 64-yard pass to receiver Brian Walsh with four minutes remaining. 
The Saints failed to make the two-point conversion after an illegal procedure 
call pushed them back to the eight yard line. Carter and inside linebacker Mike 
Bailey made the tackle at the one-yard line to thwart the two-point conversion 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first season as quarterback, Pulley continues to be St. Monica's most 
outstanding player, completing 15 of 26 passes for 213 yards and three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has surprised a lot of people because he is so poised," Coach Norm Lacy 
said. "The fact that he can throw on the run makes him hard to defend." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be overlooked is the play of the Mariners defense, especially Bailey, 
who leads the team with 78 combined tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bailey has the speed to be an exceptional pass rusher, the Mariners 
need him inside to stop the run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We designed our defense around his capabilities," Lacy said. "He doesn't get 
the glory like an outside linebacker. (But) he makes our defense click."

tax form, plus the status of its minority/women employment and the publisher's

CARL SHARSMITH; YOSEMITE NATURALIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carl Sharsmith, the ranger-naturalist whose nearly six decades at Yosemite 
National Park made him a national attraction in his own right, has died at his 
San Jose home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharsmith was 91 when he died Friday -- the National Park Service's oldest 
ranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharsmith's first park job was as a ranger-naturalist in Yosemite's Tuolumne 
Meadows in 1931. He became an alpine botanist who took visitors through 
Tuolumne Meadows, advising them to "look down, you might see something." 
</P>
<P>
 The park service said Sharsmith, who was interviewed by many newspaper and 
magazine writers over the years and was the subject of the book "Mountain Sage" 
by Elizabeth O'Neill, had "explored every nook and cranny of the park" during 
his lengthy career. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York, Sharsmith moved to California, where he taught school during 
the winter and began using his summer vacations to work as a ranger. He joined 
the National Park Service permanently in 1953 while teaching at Cal State San 
Jose, where he was a botany professor from 1950 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired as a permanent park employee in 1973 but continued as a seasonal 
ranger until his death.

ANNA HAUPTMANN; WIFE OF MAN CONVICTED IN LINDBERGH MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anna Hauptmann, the wife of the man executed for the kidnaping and murder of 
aviator Charles Lindbergh's infant son, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Her death Oct. 10 in New Holland, Pa., was reported Tuesday by the Lancaster 
New Era newspaper, a nearby neighborhood publication. 
</P>
<P>
 She insisted for more than 60 years that Bruno Richard Hauptmann was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 She had spent much of her life trying in vain to clear her husband of what was 
called the Crime of the Century: the 1932 killing of the 20-month-old namesake 
of Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauptmann, a German immigrant carpenter, was accused of kidnaping the 
Lindbergh boy from his nursery in Hopewell, N.J. He denied it, and his wife 
insisted that he was with her the night the child was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Hauptmann made a ladder to reach the nursery window and the 
child died when the ladder collapsed. Two months later, the body was found in a 
shallow grave several miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence against Hauptmann included ransom money found in his garage and a 
handwriting analysis that indicated he wrote 14 ransom notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauptmann was convicted in 1935 and executed in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 "God knows that my husband was innocent," she said in 1986 in one of her final 
interviews. "I'm going to fight for him until the very last. He had to die 
because people lied. My husband's blood is on their hands in New Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer said documents released in recent years showed that police and 
prosecutors threatened and bribed witnesses to testify against Hauptmann. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mrs. Hauptmann's lawsuits against the state of New Jersey, alleging 
fraud and wrongful death, were rejected because of the immunity conferred on 
prosecutors and because the statute of limitations had run out. 
</P>
<P>
 She also appealed in 1986 to the New Jersey Legislature, which said the matter 
was better left to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 She had recently asked New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, who took office in 
January, to reopen the case. Whitman has not done so. 
</P>
<P>
 Most scholars believe that Hauptmann was guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely convinced of her sincerity, which is really a testimony to how 
a person can delude themselves into a false belief," said James Fisher, author 
of the 1987 book "The Lindbergh Case." "She simply could not accept the fact 
that she had been married to a man who had done something so despicable."

META WILDE; WROTE ABOUT FAULKNER AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Meta Carpenter Wilde, whose Southern roots formed the basis of an 18-year 
intimacy with William Faulkner that she portrayed in a best-selling 1976 
memoir, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Orin Borsten, her co-author in "A Loving Gentleman: The Love Story of William 
Faulkner and Meta Carpenter," said Wednesday that his longtime friend had died 
Tuesday while visiting relatives in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 86 and had been living in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of a successful cotton planter in Tennessee, she was trained as a 
concert pianist before coming to Hollywood, where she became a model and music 
librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 She also became secretary to film director Howard Hawks, who in 1935 made her 
his script supervisor. When she retired in 1976, she had succeeded in forming a 
Script Supervisors Union and in 1985 was honored with the lifetime achievement 
Crystal Award by the Los Angeles-based group Women in Film. 
</P>
<P>
 But her relationship with Faulkner was what had made her a national figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Her forebears, like Faulkner's, lived on a family plantation, owned slaves and 
fought in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner had come to Hollywood in 1935 to work on the Hawks film "The Road to 
Glory." He loathed Hollywood but needed the income to maintain his home in 
Oxford, Miss. Mrs. Wilde, who was single at the time they met but married 
later, was attracted to the seemingly aloof and aristocratic author even though 
he had a wife and daughter in Oxford and her traditional Southern instincts 
were to avoid involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 What resulted was an intimate relationship that lasted 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unpublished chapter from her book, she recalled how they had "grown up 
on the same (Southern) soil . . . had rolled in its rich mud, sprawled on its 
offerings of fern, clover and wild violet. I could make him forget for hours on 
end that he was so far from home." 
</P>
<P>
 Their relationship became widely known and after the death of Faulkner and his 
wife, Borsten encouraged her to write about their years together. 
</P>
<P>
 She agreed, she said later, out of concern that a third party would emerge and 
set forth what she and Borsten feared could be a lurid, dramatized account of 
their involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said she wanted to present a more balanced view of the Nobel 
Prize-winning writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many don't want to see any change in the public image of Faulkner as an 
antisocial, hard-drinking, cynical, bitter, dour, unpleasant, sometimes rude, 
sometimes crude, man," she told one interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this wasn't the William Faulkner I knew. He was a loving, gentle man. My 
lover, my friend, a great joy in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 By then she was married to Arthur Wilde, a film publicist, who survives her 
and who encouraged her writings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some critics were dismayed that she had publicly shared her 
relationship with the acclaimed author, others were enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Carvel Collins, a Faulkner biographer, found the correspondence a valuable aid 
and even Malcolm Cowley, the editor and writer who helped reintroduce Faulkner 
to the world in the 1950s and who would have preferred that Mrs. Wilde remained 
silent, confessed "to having read (the book) with sharp interest and not a 
little profit."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: A DYING TRADITION MAY GET MOUTH-TO-MOUTH RESUSCITATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 KISSING COMEBACK: A wave of communicable diseases long ago spoiled the fun of 
kissing booths, a fund-raising gimmick common to clubs and county fairs a few 
decades ago. Now a Hawthorne group is reviving the tradition, but the only 
threat to smooch seekers may be getting a few cavities. 
</P>
<P>
 American Legion Post 314 plans a kissing booth for its Auxiliary Halloween 
Dance and Party on Oct. 28. But partly because of the same health concerns that 
put the kibosh on earlier kissing booths, the group hasn't decided whether to 
peddle real kisses or the more tame Hershey's variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could very well be that they get the candy one," said Lois Moore, junior 
past president of the post's auxiliary group and an organizer of the event. "We 
haven't finalized it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has had kissing booths in the past, though not for about 10 years. 
Moore said event organizers might bring back the custom "so we don't fall in a 
rut all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore added that the booths generated good business before the group stopped 
using them. But she declined to guess how popular the '90s version would be. 
</P>
<P>
 If the auxiliary decides on the real thing, it must round up volunteers of 
each gender. "We don't know who the designated (kissing) people are right now," 
Moore said.  
</P>
<P>
 If tradition gets the nod, live smackers will sell kisses for the bargain rate 
of $1 each. The auxiliary will vote this week on whether to go live or to fudge 
it.

 SKIP THE BOOK. SEE THE MOVIE: Remember your high school yearbook? Remember the 
drudgery of actually having to turn pages and read things in it? Well, today's 
high school soon-to-be graduates can avoid all that through a new concept that 
just landed in Southern California: video yearbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years, a company called International Video Yearbooks has been 
producing videotape highlights of high school days in the Eastern United 
States. But this year, North High School in Torrance will be one of five 
schools in Southern California to have one of the company's video yearbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The company surveys students to find their favorite music, television and 
movie clips, and then edits them into the video along with footage of 
homecoming and other school events. Student producers help the company decide 
what to shoot to customize the video. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-minute video is sold for $15 in a promotional deal with the school's 
printed yearbook. The promotional jingle: "Read the book -- see the movie."

 TAKING BITES OUT OF CRIME: A Dutch-born German shepherd named Quinn has become 
the newest member of the Palos Verdes Estates Police Department, replacing the 
late and much-lamented Bandit, who went to that Big Dog House in the Sky in 
July after he failed to fully recover from back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Gary Johansen said the $7,500 needed to buy and train Quinn came 
almost entirely from donations. The city will pay for the K-9 cop's yearly 
upkeep, which ranges from $20,000 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn is attending the K-9 academy in Riverside County with his PVE Police 
Department handler, Officer Joe Hall. If he graduates from the six-week course, 
he would immediately begin sniffing out crime in the South Bay. In addition to 
patrolling in Palos Verdes Estates, Quinn could be loaned to area cities that 
don't have police dogs. Although Palos Verdes Estates is not known for its high 
crime rate, officials say a police dog helps educate children about police 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dog is very much a public relations tool for us, as well as a crime dog," 
Johansen said. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "According to (state Sen. Ralph C. Dills campaign), I must be the world's only 
Christian fundamentalist who's Jewish." -- Republican candidate David Barrett 
Cohen, on claims by the Dills campaign that Cohen appeals to the radical right.

CITY HALL NEWS: COVINA; NEW COMMITTEE WILL EXAMINE POTENTIAL MERGER OF 2 CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Would you call it Covina Valley? Covina Heights? 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest outgrowth of merger mania to fight hard times, a former mayor of 
West Covina and a former Covina councilman are forming a committee with an eye 
to merging the two neighboring cities by a vote of residents. They see it as a 
natural reuniting of conjoined twins who perhaps never should have separated; 
the two were once one, but West Covina seceded in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Covina City Council decision Tuesday to approve an 8.25% utility tax 
to maintain services and West Covina facing the possible closure of the BKK 
landfill that provides millions of dollars to the city in fees, former West 
Covina Mayor Forrest Tennant and former Covina Councilman Chris Lancaster said 
both communities are facing tough times and a new solution is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 So Tennant and Lancaster are creating a citizen's committee of local leaders 
and former officials to examine the economic benefits of unifying the two 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The two former leaders said they will campaign to put the issue on the ballot 
in both cities if the committee finds the merger would make a 30% savings 
across the board in expenditures and the 44,000 Covinians and 94,000 West 
Covinians show interest in a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you merge you are going to eliminate a lot of bureaucracy. You've got two 
of everything," said Tennant, a physician who specializes in drug 
detoxification. "Look at businesses today . . . even the local hospitals 
merged," he said, referring to the merger of Covina's Inter-Community Medical 
Center and West Covina's Queen of the Valley Hospital in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster, who was recalled from Covina's council in July, 1993, because of 
his vote for a 6% utility tax, said the two cities would no longer waste money 
competing against the other for new businesses. "Covina simply can no longer 
afford to compete with West Covina. It cannot put up the millions for car 
dealerships," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan came to fruition, it would create a city of nearly 150,000 
residents. The pair argue that only a city this size can afford to have its own 
police, fire, parks and recreation departments and library. Size has other 
advantages, they said. "A city of that size would have a lot more political 
clout in the San Gabriel Valley," Lancaster reasoned. "When it came to 
reapportionment, we'd get one assemblyman, one senator and one congressman." 
</P>
<P>
 They said the alternatives are bleak for smaller cities with declining 
revenues and increasing bills; often such cities are forced to contract out 
services or impose new taxes or fees, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials in the two cities dismissed the chances of merger, saying 
neither city would want to take on the problems of the other. 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina Mayor Bradley McFadden said of Covina: "Their financial position 
is so bad I don't know if it would be wise. I don't want a utility tax coming 
to West Covina. I don't think there's an outcry for us to join with Covina." 
</P>
<P>
 He said West Covina at this time is in a far stronger position financially 
than its neighbor and thus would have little to gain from merging. McFadden 
added that he does not expect his city to face a financial crisis when the 
landfill closes. 
</P>
<P>
 But McFadden said he would be interested in the results of any study by the 
committee and could see such a thing happening in the next century if cities 
face even tougher times. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina City Manager Fran Delach said the effects of merging the cities can be 
achieved by merging services but not the political control. "We can contract 
with each other for things we do well," he said. "You can have your cake and 
eat it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Delach said he would recommend against a merger because of West 
Covina's possible liability for the cleanup the BKK Landfill if the site is 
declared a Superfund site by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The site 
could get such a designation if the owners cannot afford to pay for the cleanup 
themselves.

MAINLAND STUDENT DRESS CODE CROSSES GULF TO CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People on quiet Santa Catalina Island putter around town in their golf carts, 
shake their heads at the silly tourists and thank God that 26 miles of deep 
water separate them from the rest of crime-infested, smog-shrouded Southern 
California, which they refer to as "over town." 
</P>
<P>
 But lately life on the island hasn't been so uniformly sedate: In a roundabout 
way, the Southland's gang problem has found its way across the water to 
Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, school officials have told the island's 641 public 
schoolchildren that they cannot wear the traditional surf T-shirts and faded 
jeans to class anymore. Instead, it's light-colored shirts and dark blue or 
black shorts, pants or skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80-campus Long Beach school district, which includes Catalina's two 
peaceful public schools, has mandated a dress code to curb gang violence and 
boost academic performance. The rule is being applied to the island's two 
schools, where the main turf war erupts when uppity sophomores dare to set foot 
on the seniors-only lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule went into effect last month. Catalina Principal Mark Ur, adopted the 
policy, citing a study that indicates dress codes improve students' behavior, 
boost self-esteem and attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like dressing up and going to work," he said. "Their job is learning." 
</P>
<P>
 But many who moved to Catalina for a laid-back life among the swaying palm 
trees and gently rolling hills disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no fights here," said senior Steven Gonzalez, 18, who, in his blue 
shirt and white shorts, didn't quite match the policy's color codes. "Who are 
they to tell me what to wear? Do they really think it will solve any problems?" 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has divided many in the resort town of Avalon, where nearly all of 
the island's 3,300 residents live among the colorful minibuses, T-shirt shops 
and ice cream stands. 
</P>
<P>
 When the issue arose earlier this year, opponents circulated petitions, school 
officials called a special meeting with parents, and the post office, where 
residents gather to collect their mail, buzzed with the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a school survey found that a majority of parents favored the rule, 
officials decided to broaden the policy to include the island's high school 
students.  
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, only elementary and middle school students are required to 
follow the dress code. But Catalina officials say all students should be 
included. Most of the island's students -- from kindergarten to high school 
seniors -- attend Avalon School. The tiny, one-room schoolhouse across the 
island in Two Harbors has only 13 students enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the district do have one way out. But their parents must file for 
an exemption, meet with the principal and then talk to a district official. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, the deadline to file for such an exemption, parents of 242 students 
throughout the nearly 60,000-student Long Beach district had asked that their 
children be excluded. More than half of those complaints -- 143 -- came from 
Catalina, including the parents of six children in Two Harbors.  
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the least sense here," said Anni Marshall, 42, who filed for 
exemptions for her two children in the Avalon school. "If I lived with gangs in 
Long Beach, I may look at it differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who don't comply could be disciplined, Ur said. They and their 
parents will be asked to meet with the principal. Eventually, students could be 
ordered to serve detention after school, and in extreme cases, could be 
suspended, he said. But Ur suspects that won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a year we'll all say, 'Jeez, what was all the fuss about?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the schools' younger students are saying that now. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Allegria, an eighth-grader who strolled by Avalon shops recently after 
school, said she likes the dress code because students no longer have to worry 
about styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty cool, I guess," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents are participating despite their opposition. George Marshall Jr., 
43, opposes the dress code but he made a special trip to the mainland to buy 
his 8-year-old son the proper outfits. "It cost me 160 bucks," he said. "I 
can't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Marshall said he moved to the island five years ago to raise George 
Marshall III in a safer environment, and he will put up with the policy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Over town, kids are killing each other over tennis shoes and jackets," he 
said. "But this is L.A.'s best-kept secret."

ELECTIONS; HARMAN TO END CAMPAIGN WITH A TV AD BLITZ; THE COMMERCIALS, COSTING 
$220,000, WILL AIR ON MAJOR STATIONS THROUGHOUT THE L.A. BASIN. SHE HAD USED 
THE EXPENSIVE TECHNIQUE IN HER 1992 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) plans to spend more than $220,000 on an 
advertising ad blitz on almost all of Los Angeles' major television stations in 
the last week of her reelection campaign against Rancho Palos Verdes 
Councilwoman Susan Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads, scheduled to begin on Halloween and be seen throughout the Los 
Angeles basin, will allow Harman to reach the broadest possible TV audience in 
her South Bay district. She is spending almost half the cash she had on hand 
Sept. 30 on the commercials, which will air primarily during local newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just stay tuned" is all she will say about the advertisements. Her campaign 
also plans to send out mailers, but will not distribute lawn signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman is one of the few congressional candidates to take to the airwaves in 
recent years, given the high cost of advertising in such a large market. She 
advertised on TV in 1992, when she scored a surprise victory over then-Los 
Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 "She looked pretty good on the tube, talking straight to the camera," said 
political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, senior associate at the Center for 
Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate School. "It was sort of an 
outsider theme. It was the right approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign is trying to raise enough money to advertise as well. Its ads 
will more likely air on local cable franchises, which do not reach as broad an 
audience. They are also considering radio ads. Former Housing Secretary Jack 
Kemp taped a radio commercial on a campaign swing for Brooks on Tuesday, in 
case the campaign decides to air it.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, Harman has a much larger trove to spend in the final weeks of the 
election. She had $469,468 in cash on Sept. 30, compared with Brooks' $70,174, 
according to campaign finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman has spent $160,321 since July 1, and Brooks has spent $87,162, 
according to the reports. Most of the expenditures were for fund-raisers, 
consultants, brochure printing and polling. Harman's figures, however, did not 
include the cost of her ads, bought after the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Both campaigns got boosts from their parties or other candidates. Harman 
received $5,000 from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Brooks 
got $10,185 from other candidates, including Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach), Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.) and House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). 
She also got $2,000 in loans from Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's (R-Huntington Beach) 
reelection committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Harman raised $223,231 in the three-month period to Brooks' $155,068. 
Harman's contributions included $87,150, or 39%, from political action 
committees such as those formed by aerospace firms, communications companies, 
teachers and labor unions. Brooks took $32,366, or 21%, in PAC money, including 
those backed by real estate companies, petrochemical corporations and the 
Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent campaign brochure, the Brooks campaign accuses Harman of breaking 
her promise by taking the PAC money: "Harman said she would not accept campaign 
contributions from special interest PACs that have business before her 
committees." They base the claim on a 1992 Harman campaign flyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not only broken those promises, she's done just the opposite," said 
campaign manager John Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harman's campaign spokesman, Roy Behr, said that the 1992 flyer does not 
exclude all PAC money. Harman has refused contributions from companies with 
business before her committees and that have no employees in the district. 
"It's in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest," he said.

TRIAL ORDERED FOR 3 IN SLAYING OF 2 YOUTHS AT GRADUATION PARTY; SAN MARINO: 
WITNESSES TESTIFY THAT GANG MEMBERS CAME HEAVILY ARMED, INTENDING TO BATTLE 
RIVALS ALREADY THERE. ARRAIGNMENT IS SET NOV. 2 IN SUPERIOR COURT. 
</P>

<P>
 Heavy security marked a weeklong court hearing that ended with three Asian 
gang members ordered to stand trial in the shooting deaths of two high school 
students at a San Marino graduation party. 
</P>
<P>
 During the preliminary hearing in Pasadena Municipal Court, three young people 
who attended the party testified that gang members came to the party armed with 
an AK-47 assault rifle, a .380-caliber handgun and a baseball bat. They 
intended to battle "enemies" -- rival gang members already at the party, the 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight sheriff's deputies guarded the courtroom and used a metal detector to 
screen visitors. A court order prohibits the disclosure of the names of 
witnesses who testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra precautions were taken after 10 alleged gang members showed up en 
masse during earlier proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects -- Cuong Chan Phan, 18, of Monterey Park; Vi Quoc Chauc, also 
known as Peter Chau, 18, of Rosemead, and Don Sam Ha, 19, a Los Angeles County 
resident, were scheduled to appear Nov. 2 in Pasadena Superior Court for 
arraignment on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The three are accused of being part of a gang that discovered rivals at the 
party and then left, organized at an El Monte gang house and returned in three 
cars to attack the home in the 600 block of Lombardy Place in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang members confronted two partygoers at the entrance, chased them to the 
back and opened fire, police and witnesses said during the preliminary hearing. 
Slain were Dennis Buan, 18, of South Pasadena, and David Hang, 14, of San 
Marino. Seven other youths were wounded. It was not known whether the victims 
were intended targets or bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings prompted a wide-ranging investigation that culminated Aug. 9 in 
raids on several San Gabriel Valley homes and numerous arrests. In addition to 
the three in court Tuesday, three other youths face criminal charges stemming 
from the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Tam Thi Tran, 19, of Westminster, pleaded guilty earlier to accessory to 
murder, which carries a penalty of up to three years in state prison. No 
sentencing date has been set and Tran could still be charged with the murders, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Teri Schwartz, who is prosecuting all the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suspect, Mia Quiocho, 18, of Rosemead, faces a preliminary hearing 
Nov. 15. Meanwhile, a 17-year-old, whose name has been withheld because he is a 
minor, faces a juvenile court hearing to determine if he should be tried as an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Murder charges against a seventh person, Hau Tac San, also known as John Chan, 
20, of South El Monte, were dropped after investigators determined that he was 
not at the party, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the hearing, Phan and Chauc appeared solemn, but Ha twisted often 
in his chair, grinning at spectators in the courtroom.

 One witness, an associate of the gang, testified that she brought a baseball 
bat to the party and smashed a car window because she "just wanted to have some 
fun." She also told prosecutor Schwartz that she is now afraid. During her two 
days of testimony, she kept her face turned downward and spoke in a monotone. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys tried to attack the credibility of the witnesses, some of 
whom face criminal charges themselves in connection with less serious 
troublemaking at the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these people were all involved in a shark frenzy of (criminal) 
activity," said M. R. Ward, Chauc's attorney, after the hearing Tuesday. "Now, 
some have decided to look out for themselves and save their own hides."

RUNNING ON EMPTY; EMERGENCIES: WATER DISTRICT CAN'T AFFORD EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD 
HELP FIGHT A BLAZE LIKE LAST YEAR'S FIRESTORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A year after a fire destroyed 126 homes in the Altadena area, the tiny 
Kinneloa Irrigation District, which suffered water shortages that may have 
contributed to the damage, cannot afford the equipment that would prevent a 
similar disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrants dried up after water tanks in the upper part of the region were 
depleted, and pumps that could have refilled them failed when the fire tore 
through electric lines. The small, semiprivate district still has no new tanks, 
pumps or backup generators. The district's manager, Gene W. Burt, said the 
district cannot afford to purchase the costly equipment itself. However, its 
board is working with other agencies to develop plans for emergencies, and the 
district has applied for state and federal grants to build extra water tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The district formerly served 550 homes, but lost 120 homes to the fire -- 
nearly all of the houses that burned in the Altadena blaze. The three highest 
tanks in the district hold a total of less than half a million gallons -- 
plenty for residential use, but not enough for a firestorm, said Chris Burt, 
the district's facilities supervisor and Gene Burt's son. 
</P>
<P>
 And when flames severed electric lines, water could not be pumped uphill from 
the lower reservoirs to the empty tanks. By the time two auxiliary generators 
borrowed from Southern California Edison restored the water pressure -- about 
eight hours later -- nearly a quarter of the homes had burned. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey Fire Department Battalion Chief Gail Crook, who was supervising a crew 
when the hoses ran dry, said recently that he saw serious flaws with the area's 
water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system wasn't designed for such a large fire," he said. "Their supply was 
not adequate to keep those engines all being supplied up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Burt, however, said there is no chance the district will purchase the 
backup generators by itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Burt added that even if the generators worked the pumps, which are 
designed for residential use, could not provide the volume of water needed to 
fight a blaze such as last year's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 And the district cannot afford generators or larger pumps and tanks, Gene Burt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The equipment costs around $40,000 per unit," he said. "We would need five." 
</P>
<P>
 The annual budget for the district is about $500,000, Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public won't stand for the charge that we'd have to make." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the district has arranged with other agencies to rent generators in an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the availability of leasing that equipment now," he said. "And we've 
also modified our facilities to accept the input from the generators." 
</P>
<P>
 "We could probably get equipment within 10 hours," he said. "But we could 
always rely upon Edison to give us support, which they did last time." 
</P>
<P>
 Crook said, though, that 10 hours would be far too late in an inferno such as 
last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homes were burned within hours," he said "Ten hours and there won't be 
anything there."  
</P>
<P>
 Linda Williams, president of the Pasadena Glen Improvement Assn., which 
represents a small, canyon community devastated by the fire, said the district 
is doing its best to restore what was damaged in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now they're still recovering from the fire," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has fireproofed the new power shed in an attempt to avert the 
kind of electrical failure that happened last year.

HOGE FACES SHARP DUEL IN 44TH DISTRICT RACE; ASSEMBLY: THE REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT 
HAS PLENTY OF CAMPAIGN MONEY. BUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE 
LAST-MINUTE FUNDS TO CHALLENGER BRUCE PHILPOTT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was Democratic candidate Bruce Philpott, former police chief of 
Pasadena, in a commercial on cable television, blasting Assemblyman Bill Hoge 
(R-Pasadena) for taking campaign contributions -- more than $100,000 -- from 
gambling interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The message is in words and pictures on a billboard in Pasadena for all the 
world to see: Bill Hoge loves dice, cards and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge fired back with a mailer accusing Philpott of being soft on illegal 
immigration at the expense of California taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer notes that Hoge authored pending legislation to put the National 
Guard on the border to stop illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after narrowly winning his first term against a weak Democratic 
candidate, Hoge is facing a stiff challenge for his 44th District seat in the 
Nov. 8 election. The district includes Altadena, La Canada Flintridge, 
Pasadena, San Marino, South Pasadena and parts of Arcadia, San Gabriel, Temple 
City and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott has raised $100,000 for his campaign so far, not a lot of money for a 
legislative race. But the Assembly's Democratic leaders, who have targeted Hoge 
as one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the state, are expected to pour 
plenty of cash into the race in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hoge is) clearly, as far as incumbents are concerned, extremely vulnerable," 
said Gale Kaufman, Assembly Democratic campaign strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge declined numerous requests to be interviewed. He also has declined at 
least 10 invitations to appear with Philpott at candidates' forums, Philpott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But campaign disclosure statements show that Hoge clearly is prepared for 
battle: As of Sept. 30, he had raised nearly $500,000. A political action 
committee headed by Minority Floor Leader Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) has 
contributed $70,000 to keep the Republican seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said Hoge's seat is one that Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) has 
consistently expressed interest in taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultants and party strategists agree that the race will go to the 
wire. Registration in the district favors Democrats over Republicans by 45% to 
42%. That's not much of an edge for Philpott, because Republicans traditionally 
turn out to vote in higher numbers than do Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott is basing a large part of his campaign on attacking Hoge for his fund 
raising in the "Third House," lobbyists and special interests. In particular, 
he has focused most of his attack on contributions from gambling interests, all 
of which do business outside the 44th District. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge has received more than $107,000 from gambling interests, including 
$24,000 from the Los Angeles Turf Club, which operates Santa Anita Race Track, 
$20,000 from Hollywood Park and $14,500 from Caesars World, a casino operator 
headquartered in California. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been a strong supporter of the industry. Hoge was the leading 
Republican supporting a bill by Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) 
that would allow racetracks to have video gambling machines. The bill is 
pending in committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge was author of a bill that, among other things, would have made it more 
difficult to obtain voter approval for new card rooms. In effect, the bill 
would have reduced the competition for existing card clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor vetoed the bill on the advice of the state attorney general's 
office, which called it a "veritable grab bag of special-interest gambling 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott theorizes that Hoge has courted gambling interests "to build a huge 
campaign chest to intimidate a challenger." 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the financial help Philpott can expect from the Assembly's 
Democratic leadership, which also taps into special-interest money? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a maverick," said Philpott, now a businessman. "I don't care what the 
speaker says. I'll work hard on campaign finance reform." 
</P>
<P>
 In his campaign literature, Hoge presents himself as a strong law-and-order 
candidate and a backer of the recently passed "three strikes" legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote a number of get-tough-on-crime bills that failed in the Assembly and 
once called for the death penalty for anyone committing three violent offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his successes, signed into law last month, requires people convicted of 
arson to register so that local law enforcement agencies can keep track of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling himself "the cop's candidate," Hoge has the endorsements of the 
California State Sheriff's Assn., the Glendale Police Officers Assn. and other 
law enforcement groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge started early in the campaign to chip away at Philpott's standing as a 
former police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman put out two mailers before last June's primary criticizing 
Philpott's behavior during a traffic stop for supposedly speeding in Glendale 
in 1990, when he was still Pasadena's police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer accused Philpott of abusing the power of his position to give the 
Glendale officers a tongue-lashing before he was allowed to leave without being 
cited. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing we need is another politician in Sacramento who thinks he's 
above the law," the mailer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott complained to Glendale's police chief that the traffic stop was 
racially motivated because his date was an African American woman. He says he 
was not speeding. 
</P>
<P>
 He points out that he has the endorsements of various statewide and local law 
enforcement groups, including the Police Officers Research Assn. of California 
and the Pasadena Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Philpott pledges to work on legislation to limit contributions 
from individuals and PACs to candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his other priority would be to reduce prison costs, in part by housing 
nonviolent offenders in tents surrounded by barbed wire in the desert, similar 
to the way U.S. armed forces held prisoners after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

POLITICAL NOTES; DILLS LINKS OPPONENT TO RADICAL RIGHT; COHEN SCOFFS AT THE 
CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 MODERATE OR CONSERVATIVE?: According to state Sen. Ralph C. Dills(D-El 
Segundo), the radical right is alive and well in the South Bay, and they are 
chipping in to opponent David Barrett Cohen's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills officials made the charge last week because of a $20,000 contribution 
from the campaign of state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) to Cohen, a Redondo 
Beach attorney. Hurtt is a conservative, evangelical Christian who is a leader 
in the party's efforts to reclaim the Senate and Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen "is trying to portray himself as a moderate Republican," said Tim Mock, 
Dills' campaign coordinator. "He has positions on issues that are very 
favorable (to the political right)." Among them: Cohen supported last year's 
failed school voucher initiative, a conservative goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cohen said that Hurtt has a leadership post that makes it necessary to 
give to conservatives and moderates alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his job to give money to strong Republican candidates, be they moderate 
or conservative," Cohen said. "Anyone who claims Rob Hurtt and I are not 
different is a liar." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Cohen favors abortion rights and opposes Proposition 187, 
which would deny services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to (the Dills campaign), I must be the world's only Christian 
fundamentalist who's Jewish," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats hold a 53%-to-33% edge in voter registration in the 28th State 
Senate District, which includes the beach cities, Torrance, Carson and Compton.

 PHOTO REDUX: Republican Susan Brooks' campaign has changed its caption on an 
infamous photo of Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills), beaming at President 
Clinton at a White House ceremony. Brooks is challenging Harman for the 36th 
Congressional District seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Harman chided Brooks, a Palos Verdes councilwoman, for saying 
the photo was taken at the signing of President Clinton's budget plan, which 
included taxes and spending cuts. Harman voted for it. But the photo was taken 
at another White House ceremony, where Clinton issued an executive order on 
deficit reduction.  
</P>
<P>
 The new caption reads: "Having cast the decisive vote, Jane Harman beams with 
approval at Bill Clinton who signed the largest tax increase in history." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, many Republican challengers across the country say their opponents 
cast the decisive vote. It passed by a 218-216 margin in August, 1993. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 GATT SPAT: United We Stand America opposed the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and now they oppose the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. So 
it's no surprise that when it sponsored a recent forum, the group grilled the 
congressional candidates on the trade pacts. 
</P>
<P>
 But they might have a tough time choosing between Harman and Brooks. Harman 
opposed NAFTA but supports GATT. With Brooks, it's vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks said GATT would remove the United States' sovereignty. "I am not about 
to let us become one of 120 nations and stand the United States of America next 
to Rwanda as one vote." But Harman's camp said that she is convinced there's 
enough protection in the pact. "It requires consensus and therefore the U.S. 
can veto," said Harman spokesman Roy Behr.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QUARTERBACKING FOR BROOKS: Former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp stumped for 
Brooks' campaign -- one of dozens of candidates he has visited this election 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 But he called Brooks' chances against Harman "very favorable." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a fighter, she's a tiger, she's a quarterback," Kemp said at a local 
fund-raiser.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was for NAFTA, Jane was against NAFTA," he said. ". . . How can you 
believe in free enterprise in California and not be for exporting computers and 
agriculture and widgets to Mexico. It just doesn't make sense. Jane Harman 
voting against NAFTA is a vote against the working man and woman of the South 
Bay district." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they didn't agree on everything. Kemp supports GATT. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unity does not require unanimity," he said.

LATINO STUDENTS STAGE WALKOUT, DECRY PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Protesting a range of issues from discrimination to Proposition 187, a large 
group of Latino students at Inglewood High School walked out of class Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students at Leuzinger High School in Lawndale tried to do the same, but 
campus officials stopped the protest before it began. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, if passed by voters in November, would bar illegal immigrants 
from public schools, non-emergency health care and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said the protests were planned because their opinions on issues 
important to Latinos, including bilingual education and the proposition, have 
been largely ignored by school administrators and the local community. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials agreed that student opinions should be expressed, but they 
disagreed with the students' strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the right to protest and I support their right, but the way in 
which they protested was not the proper way to voice their dissent," said 
Inglewood High Principal Kenneth Crowe. 
</P>
<P>
 A student who was caught organizing the Inglewood walkout was suspended for a 
day and tried to call the protest off. But 120 to 150 students left campus and 
walked three blocks to the school district office, Crowe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who followed the impromptu march disputed Crowe's estimate, saying 
there were hundreds of students involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors called the police and complained of youths running through 
their yards and jumping on the hoods of cars, Crowe said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 District officials refused to meet with the students and told them to return 
to school. Although many returned to class, 71 students who did not were 
suspended and their parents notified, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a district board meeting that night, several students told board members 
they are upset because the school is lacking in bilingual teachers and Latino 
representation in the administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowe said that the school, which is 50% Latino, is in compliance with state 
laws on bilingual education and that a bilingual administrator was recently 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
 The same morning, student organizers at Leuzinger also hoped to rally students 
to leave campus to protest Proposition 187. But campus security guards, in an 
attempt to avert a repeat of last month's racial brawl on campus, quickly 
detained about 20 organizers and sent them to the administration for 
discipline, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of suspending the students, however, Principal Sonja Davis, Centinela 
Valley Union High School District Supt. Joseph M. Carrillo and a district 
mediation specialist met with them for an hour and a half to discuss their 
concerns, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good learning experience. More importantly, those who were serious 
about protesting learned there are other ways to get their point across," Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who tried to organize the protest said they think the proposition 
would discriminate against Latinos. Some feared that family members and close 
friends would be deported. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my parents are illegal and they go back, I can't go to school and I can't 
get a diploma," said 17-year-old senior Salvador Velez. 
</P>
<P>
 Velez also complained that commercials and campaign literature supporting the 
proposition have unfairly singled out Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "TV is blowing it up, giving Mexicans a bad name. If they show one (race), 
they should show them all or not at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also said state officials lack an understanding of the people whom 
the proposition will most affect, citing the correlation between the 
proposition's number and the California Penal Code section number for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "To (politicians), 187 may just be another number, but around here, to 
Latinos, it means you're dead," Velez said. "What does that tell us? That we're 
out?"

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; COUNTY RESTORES FUNDS TO BRANCH LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Bay branches of the Los Angeles County Library will be open longer and 
have more books, after the Board of Supervisors voted last week to restore 
$22.5 million to the county library system's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, hundreds of library workers countywide were expected to be 
rehired, returning library service to the level of two years ago before cuts 
were made.  
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to find new sources of support, the supervisors had established a 
special tax district to fund libraries. Cities then were to decide whether to 
join the district and support the tax. In the South Bay, only the Lomita and 
Carson city councils supported the tax, which would have cost homeowners about 
$28.50 per year. Avalon, Gardena, Hermosa Beach, Lawndale and Manhattan Beach 
opposed the tax. Hawthorne's council decided not to vote on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 But as county officials moved forward with the tax district plan, reports of a 
surplus in the county's general fund caused taxpayers to balk. Carson changed 
its position and withdrew from the district. The City Council said the county 
was not acting in good faith when it proposed the tax without knowing whether 
the system could be supported without it, said Carson Councilwoman Mary Anne 
O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the supervisors allocated $22.5 million from the general fund, but 
retained the ability to levy the tax in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will allow the libraries to resume buying books and other materials, 
and rehire staff to keep the 87 libraries in the system open five days a week. 
Some of the larger branches could be open six or seven days, County Librarian 
Sandra Reuben said this week. Because hiring has to be done by exam, the 
service hours probably won't be expanded until early November, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although she said she was pleased to be in a position to restore library staff 
and materials, Reuben warned that the problem of long-term funding for the 
system has not been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the public understands that we need a permanent solution to our 
funding problems," she said. MARY GUTHRIE

EDUCATION; BUDGET WOES MAY FORCE WORKMAN HIGH TO CLOSE; DISTRICT OFFICIALS CITE 
DWINDLING RESOURCES AND DECLINING ENROLLMENT. STUDENTS, PARENTS AND TEACHERS 
ARE PREPARING TO FIGHT DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the fourth time since 1980, the Hacienda-La Puente Unified School District 
is finding itself forced to close yet another school because of declining 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have not decided which school to close, but teachers and students 
from Workman -- the district's smallest high school -- are prepared to fight a 
decision they are certain will target them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been rumors for many years that they were going to close our 
school," said Joan Lavey, a Workman history teacher. "But this is the first 
time it's a real threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Blaming a poor economy and a loss of 11,000 students in the district since 
1971, Assistant Supt. John Rieckewald said, "We're in a constant state of 
having no resources." 
</P>
<P>
 The district cut $7 million in expenditures in the last two years, eliminating 
librarian, counselor and assistant principal positions, as well as stripping 
health services "down to the bare bones," Rieckewald said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've cut everything we can cut," he said. "The reality is that it didn't 
give us flexibility or surplus. It just kept us from running into the 
reserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Integrating Workman's 1,145 students into the district's three other high 
schools could save the district up to $700,000, but parents and students are 
concerned the decision will lead to overpopulated classrooms and increased gang 
violence. 
</P>

 "No one is going to get any schooling done," said Heidi Lopez, a recent 
graduate of Workman who attended a Save Our School meeting last week along with 
hundreds of parents, students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is worried about her twin sisters, who are freshmen at Workman but would 
attend La Puente High School if Workman is closed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are gangs that hang out at both schools," she said. "If Workman kids go 
to La Puente, there's going to be more violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Because almost half of Workman students are from La Puente, it is widely 
assumed that many of those Workman students will transfer to La Puente High 
School, which has 1,638 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it is, La Puente is overcrowded," lamented Diana Marquez, who has three 
young children. "As soon as I rise in income, I'm taking my kids out of this 
district." 
</P>
<P>
 Rieckewald said that even if every Workman student transferred to La Puente 
High School, there would still be 77 fewer students than the school had in 
1981. "I'm not saying they'd all go to La Puente, but I am saying it would be a 
manageable number if they did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials also are considering the integration of elementary schools 
with junior high schools or junior high schools with high schools. The district 
can save $250,000 for each elementary school closed and up to $550,000 for each 
junior high school closed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators will make their recommendation to the Board of Education in 
early December so that they can close the school or schools before next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rieckewald said, "There's nothing etched in stone that it has to be Workman," 
but students and teachers are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students feel they're being robbed of what's theirs," said Workman senior 
Xochitl BautistaC in a speech to cheering supporters. "And we're not willing to 
give it up."

ENTERTAINMENT; PARADE FREE AGAIN -- DOO DAH, DOO DAH; FOUNDER OF THE SCREWBALL 
PASADENA EVENT HOPES TO RECAPTURE SPIRIT OF THE PAST. HE'S JOINING FORCES WITH 
ARTS GROUP IN AN ATTEMPT TO DRAW MORE LOCAL ENTRIES, SPECTATORS AND SPONSORS.

<P>
 After last year's revamped Doo Dah Parade went bust, it's back to basics for 
the annual screwball event, back to the free streets of Old Pasadena, back to 
policing for unruly, tortilla-tossing spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Nov. 27 parade, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, will try to 
recapture the spirit of Doo Dahs past, said parade founder Peter Apanel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can make it come back and work, and turn the momentum around, with the 
participants and crowd control, and the tortilla situation, we have a pretty 
good chance of winning back all the supporters," said Apanel, who runs the 
parade as a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for the first time, Apanel changed the Doo Dah format, partly with 
an eye toward profits. He also wanted to control the growing number of surly 
spectators, some of whom hurled wadded-up, stale tortillas at parade entrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 parade charged admission and switched to a small, festival-style 
event with a mini-procession around Pasadena City Hall. The parade drew a 
disappointing 2,500 spectators and 30 entries. Admission was $7 in advance and 
$10 at the entrance, but revenue was barely enough to cover expenses and the 
loss of KCOP-TV's contract fee to broadcast the parade. The TV station opted 
not to televise the parade in its new format. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Apanel is organizing the parade with a partner, the Light-Bringer 
Project, a nonprofit arts organization in Pasadena. Apanel hopes that the 
group's support will attract more local entries, spectators and sponsors. The 
group is helping Apanel recruit parade entries from Pasadena's 1,200 nonprofit 
groups. With more local involvement, Apanel said, the parade is less likely to 
get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders "didn't have any attachment to the community," he said. "The 
perception developed among a lot of those people that this was simply an 
'Animal House' event where anything goes. It was never that way." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 40 entries have signed up for the parade, and Apanel expects 
about 40 more; past parades have drawn about 100 entries and 40,000 spectators. 
KCOP-TV officials originally had signed a contract to televise this year's 
parade but reneged when they could not sell enough ads. In a settlement to void 
the contract, KCOP paid Apanel an undisclosed fee. Doo Dah's other revenue 
comes from entry fees, program ads and souvenir sales.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REDONDO BEACH; CANADIAN IS CHARGED IN CONDO RENTAL SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Canadian man has been charged with grand theft in connection with a scam in 
which prospective condominium renters were bilked of nearly $10,000 by a man 
posing as a building manager, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Charles Reid, 36, also was charged with carjacking and assault with a 
deadly weapon after he stole a car to escape police and tried to run down an 
officer, said Detective Mark Sturgeon.The officer fired a shot at Reid and 
missed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid, also known as Paul Clarkson, is suspected of taking at least 10 deposits 
for three luxury condominiums in Redondo Beach, Sturgeon said. Police had been 
investigating Reid since August. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Reid identified condominiums for sale, then advertised them for 
rent in a local newspaper. When prospective tenants arrived, Reid took rental 
deposits, then disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 When he noticed officers near his Rancho Palos Verdes apartment Oct. 12, he 
fled on foot and then told a woman in an idling Mercury that he needed to use 
her car, Sturgeon said. She screamed and jumped out of the car, and he sped 
away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers followed Reid but lost sight of him in the area's winding residential 
streets. After a four-hour search, a police canine sniffed out Reid hiding in 
thick brush in an undeveloped canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Reid is suspected of committing similar crimes in San Diego and 
Canada. He is being held in Los Angeles County Jail on $300,000 bail. JAMES

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; TRASH PICKUP CLAIM SAYS CITY OVERCHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A longtime city resident and a local businessman have filed a claim against 
the city, saying officials have overcharged residents and businesses for trash 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Francis Stiglich and pool hall owner Jerry Jamgotchian filed the 
claim Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say refuse charges are added to residents' property tax bills, 
and businesses are charged directly. After deducting a 25% franchise fee, 
officials said, the money is forwarded to H & C Disposal Co., the city's trash 
hauler. Each year, the fees are increased according to the cost-of-living 
index. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the claim, the city has miscalculated the cost-of-living increase 
and has overcharged customers by 37%. In addition, the claim alleges that the 
city has imposed a 33% franchise fee that adds more than $2 million to city 
coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiglich and Jamgotchian say the franchise fee is a hidden tax and violates 
California's anti-tax Proposition 13 passed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials declined to comment on the claim.  
</P>
<P>
 Although franchise fees are generally paid to cities by businesses that hold 
city contracts, Stiglich and Jamgotchian say H & C Disposal has not paid any 
fee and that the cost, instead, is being added to customers' bills. Because the 
money collected is placed in the general fund, the claim alleges, the fee is 
actually a tax.  
</P>
<P>
 Stiglich is asking for a $500 refund for overcharges dating to 1988. If the 
city agrees to refund the money, Jamgotchian said, it would have to give a 
refund to all residents and business owners. The cost to the city, he said, 
could be millions of dollars. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: ROLLING HILLS ESTATES; LAND DONORS ARGUE AGAINST REZONING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may be a technical, legal matter, but to the grandchildren of gravel 
magnate Linden H. Chandler, it could mean millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling Hills Estates wants to rezone about 20 acres owned by the Chandler 
trustees from residential to open space or parkland. But trustees say the 
bureaucratic tuneup could reduce their tax write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees have agreed to donate the acreage, to be used as parkland, to the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy over the next 20 years. The Chandlers 
will receive an estimated $3.6 million in tax benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 The trustees have argued against the zone change because land zoned 
residential is worth more because it is easier to develop than land zoned open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney, however, says the Chandler rezoning should not affect land 
values because the December, 1993, agreement calls for the acreage to be used 
as parkland anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Planning Commission deadlocked 3 to 3 on whether to rezone the 
land. The commission has one vacant seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the commissioners said that private property should not be rezoned 
against the wishes of the owners, while other commissioners said rezoning would 
make it clear the land cannot be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will reconsider the issue Nov. 14. The City Council, which has 
the final say, plans to vote on the issue by January, said Planning Director 
Richard Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 The land borders the Dapplegray school site and the Empty Saddle Club. The 
original Chandler parcel was 27 1/2 acres, but the city bought 7 1/2 acres, 
also to be used as parkland, for $1.4 million. The trustees then donated 6.8 
acres and $100,000 to the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy says it has no plans to develop the land, but supports the 
Chandlers because it does not want to upset current, or potential, donors. JEFF 
KASS

HEALTH; USC MOBILE DENTAL CLINIC TO VISIT SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC's Mobile Dental Clinic will set up shop outside the Pasadena Unified 
School District Building beginning Friday to examine and provide free treatment 
for 120 district students with dental problems but no medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic is being sponsored by the district's Young and Healthy program, 
which provides free medical, dental and psychological services to students 
whose families cannot afford health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Healthy has 28 affiliated dentists who provide similar services on a 
volunteer basis, but organizers said it would take them years to address all 
the problems that the mobile clinic's 100 dentists will handle Friday and the 
following week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a total of 700 appointments with the 120 students, the dentists will 
diagnose and treat a wide range of needs, from cavities and crowns to 
extractions and root canals. Many of the students have never been to a dentist 
before, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Free flu shots will be available from Tuesday through Dec. 9 to Los Angeles 
County residents who are 60 years old or over. 
</P>
<P>
 At special county flu clinics, the shots will also be provided without charge 
to people with chronic diseases, which increase the risk of flu complications. 
</P>
<P>
 County clinics will not provide flu shots for healthy adults under 60 years 
old. Information: (818) 350-6833.

ENVIRONMENT; EPA TELLS FIRMS TO PAY FOR CLEANUP STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has notified 17 San Gabriel Valley 
companies that they will have to contribute a total of about $1.1 million to 
investigate ground water contamination in the El Monte area. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the companies will also be called on to pay for cleaning up the 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which will begin in several months, is part of the EPA's overall 
effort to direct the cleanup of heavily polluted ground water beneath the San 
Gabriel Valley. The entire ground water basin, polluted with industrial 
solvents, is a federal Superfund site slated for priority cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has organized the cleanup into seven areas. In each area, the federal 
agency has taken action or plans to move to identify private parties 
responsible for the pollution. Those parties, in theory, are responsible for 
the cost of cleaning up the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17 firms that the EPA notified last week include both large and small 
businesses, which produce a variety of products -- from glass bottles to paint 
-- in El Monte, Temple City and Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA will soon begin negotiations to determine how much of the $1.1 million 
each company will pay, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of one company said he fears that he will be hit with a large 
tab that he cannot afford, and that he will be paying to clean up contamination 
left by others. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is industrial contamination that has been created over a 50-year period 
by people who are no longer here," said William Peters, president of Trail 
Chemical, an El Monte paint manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the investigation is completed in about a year, the EPA will ask the 
companies to pay for the actual cleanup, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation in the El Monte area involves sampling water from 11 wells, 
including six to be drilled, said the EPA's Nathan Lau, who oversees remedial 
action in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary testing has detected high levels of contamination, as much as 
3,000 times state and federal limits, in the top 20 feet of the ground water 
basin. The top of the basin is 70 to 100 feet below the surface. During the 
investigation, samples will be drawn from as deep as 400 feet below ground, 
officials said.

AEROJET TO INTERPRET SPACE DATA FOR ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aerojet, an Azusa aerospace corporation, received a U.S. Army award of $49.5 
million to develop a ground station that will process satellite data for 
military use. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joint Tactical Ground Station will provide fast, detailed reporting on 
ballistic missile launches using the sensors that detected missiles during the 
Persian Gulf War.The mobile station can be transported to the site of a 
military operation via aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is intended to convert raw satellite data into usable form in a 
shorter period than current technology without clogging high-priority 
communication lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on an existing prototype that the company developed in 1993, it will be 
compatible with any future surveillance system, said Nick Gionis, Aerojet's 
director of surveillance ground systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to streamlined military funding, the project will cut costs by 
using off-the-shelf commercial hardware "instead of reinventing the wheel," 
said Aerojet spokeswoman Michelle A. Simms. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to be completed in late 1996 and will be performed at 
Aerojet's Azusa site and at a subcontractor's Colorado facility.

FIELDS OF DREAMS; WHEN IT COMES TO COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS, HIGH SCHOOL PLAYERS 
LEARN THAT IT TAKES MORE THAN ATHLETIC PROWESS TO SUCCEED AT THIS GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Estrada is standing on the sidelines at the Peninsula-West Torrance 
football game, watching intently as the young players on the field run and pass 
and butt heads on the line. He's holding a clipboard, making notations on a 
form after every play, but he's actually holding much more than that in his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 What Estrada is holding are the dreams and futures of young men. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada is a professional high school football scout. Every year he will watch 
40 to 50 high school football games in the South Bay and throughout Los Angeles 
on behalf of an Orange County-based company called Para-Dies Scouting, 
assessing the players' abilities, attitudes and potential. 
</P>
<P>
 His reports and those from company scouts in other Southern California areas 
will be assembled and sold to colleges and universities for $1,500 to $2,000 a 
copy, giving them an overview of what's available in the Southern California 
high school football market. 
</P>
<P>
 For anxious high school football players who will be waiting for those college 
football coaches to call, a thumbs up or a thumbs down from Estrada could be a 
deciding factor. Each notation he makes on that clipboard can help advance -- 
or demolish -- a high school boy's dreams of getting a "ride" -- that is, a 
full college scholarship.  
</P>
<P>
 It's big business, this quest to get a scholarship, not just in football but 
in other sports, for girls as well as boys. Full or partial scholarships are 
available in about two dozen sports, and since implementation in the 1970s of 
Title IX, which seeks to balance expenditures on women's sports with men's, the 
growth of women's athletics scholarships has been explosive. In 1991, the last 
year for which figures are available, the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
reported that about 90,000 college athletes were receiving about $468 million 
in full and partial scholarships -- almost a third of them to women -- from 540 
NCAA Division I and II colleges and universities.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the numbers are large, the size of the athletic scholarship pie 
actually is small, given the huge demand for a slice of it. No one knows just 
how many high school athletes -- and their parents -- entertain dreams of 
getting an athletic ride. But insiders estimate that no more than 10% of high 
school athletes qualify for athletic scholarships, either full or partial.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the South Bay has a rich history of producing great athletes. George 
Brett went from the diamond at El Segundo High to an almost certain spot in 
baseball's Hall of Fame. Vince Ferragamo, a star at Banning High in Wilmington, 
went on to bigger stardom as the Rams' quarterback in their 1980 NFC 
championship season. Former NBA great Paul Westphal played at old Aviation High 
in Redondo Beach, while one of the NBA stars of the 1980s, Reggie Theus, came 
out of Inglewood High. And the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 If it can happen to them, some parents think, maybe it can happen to my kid. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many adults go to great lengths to help their children qualify 
for a college athletic scholarship, which not only would ease the burden of 
tuition but just might turn out to be a ticket to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 In the South Bay, some parents have moved into certain school districts from 
miles away -- and up to 15 years in advance -- to get their kid in the best, 
most high-profile athletic program for his or her sport. Others take their kids 
across the country to "showcase tournaments" where college coaches and 
recruiters can see them in action. Still others pay hundreds of dollars to 
companies that circulate athletic resumes among college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, including legendary El Segundo High School baseball coach John 
Stevenson, think it's gotten out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become a frenzy," said Stevenson. "There are kids playing solely 
because their parents are demanding that they earn a scholarship. Kids are 
trying to play for the wrong reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone connected with high school sports has a story about pushy 
parents screaming at their kids for supposedly blowing a scholarship by missing 
a layup or muffing a grounder. And yet, with the average cost of a private 
four-year college hovering around $14,000 (tuition, room and board) a year, who 
can blame a parent of a high school athlete for thinking that it certainly 
would be nice if Junior or Sissy could get all or even a portion of that 
tuition picked up by the school's athletic department?  
</P>
<P>
 So the question becomes, how do you help the kid do it? How do you increase 
the chances that your young athlete will get financial aid? 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews with coaches, student athletes, scouts, recruiters and 
parents, here are some suggestions: Make Sure the Kid Can Play 
</P>
<P>
 That may sound obvious, but the ability to play a sport well -- very well -- 
is a factor some parents overlook when they start dreaming of an athletic 
scholarship. Simply put, they think their young athlete is better than he or 
she really is. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of wishful thinking going on out there," said football scout 
Estrada. "But you have to be realistic. Sometimes parents will come up and ask 
me about their kids. I can't lie to them. If they ask me, I tell them the 
truth. Most of the time they're nice about it, but sometimes they don't want to 
believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson, the baseball coach at El Segundo High for 36 years, also cautions 
parents about the "big fish/small pond" syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some parents say, 'Why can't my kid get a scholarship, he's an All-League 
player?' " said Stevenson. "But what are there, six teams in his league? 
There's a big difference between being a great player at El Segundo High School 
and just being a player at USC." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some kids -- a very few -- are standouts, the so-called "blue 
chippers." For them, it's not a question of whether they're good enough to get 
an athletic scholarship, but which school they will grace with their presence.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for example, Inglewood High School basketball player Paul Pierce, 
one of America's most wanted young men. 
</P>
<P>
 Under NCAA rules, recruiters aren't permitted to contact high school players 
until after their junior year. Last July 1, his first day of eligibility, the 
6-foot, 7-inch Pierce got more than half a dozen calls from college coaches. 
Since then, he's received hundreds of calls and letters from recruiters, 
representing all the top college basketball programs. Pierce, who's rated the 
top college prospect in California, has narrowed the list to about six, 
including UCLA and USC. Across the country, college basketball coaches are 
anxiously awaiting his decision, hoping he will choose them. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Coaches) call back to back to back," said Pierce, a soft-spoken young man 
who just turned 17. "It gets a little hard sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Pierce's mother, Lorraine Hosey, it's been a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't afford to send my kids to college," said Hosey, whose two other 
sons also were athletic standouts, one getting a basketball scholarship at the 
University of Wyoming and the other becoming a professional baseball player. 
"For us, Paul's basketball has been a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 But while his basketball abilities are undeniable, Pierce still has one more 
hoop to get through before he can take those abilities to the college level. He 
has a 2.8 grade point average, but he still has to score a 700 or better on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test. Which brings us to an equally important requirement 
for getting an athletic scholarship. Make Sure the Kid Has Good Grades 
</P>
<P>
 Until the early 1980s, about the only academic requirement for playing college 
ball was maintaining a 1.6 grade point average in your college courses -- not a 
skull-busting requirement. In 1983, however, the NCAA started requiring high 
school graduates to meet minimum grade-point and SAT standards to be eligible 
for college scholarships. There is now a sliding scale: if you have a 2.0 GPA, 
you need a 900 SAT score; if your GPA is 2.5, you need a 700 SAT. And the GPA 
must be in 13 "core courses" -- math, English, the sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are strict. Poor grades mean no scholarship and no play. End of 
story, end of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have the grades," said Patrick Roy, coach of the Inglewood 
Sentinels basketball team, which had core-class requirements for its student 
athletes even before the NCAA instituted them. "Our priority is to put kids in 
school, not just to play basketball. If you don't want to . . . work for the 
grades to get you into college, you're in the wrong program." 
</P>
<P>
 Says football scout Estrada: "The city of L.A. probably has the best athletes 
overall in Southern California, but a lot of times nobody's pushing those kids 
to study and go to school. So you get a kid with maybe a high C average, but 
then you look at his SAT, and sorry, it's 600 -- and you get 200 just for 
writing your name. So those kids can't get scholarships. In the South Bay the 
schools are generally better, the grades are better, the SATs are higher. For a 
kid who's a good but not a great player, grades can be the most important 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Some kids, in fact, flip the equation, making athletics an adjunct to getting 
an academic scholarship instead of the other way around. Peninsula High School 
girls' basketball player Katharine Foster-Keddie is an example. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm using sports to get into better schools," said Foster-Keddie, a 
17-year-old six-footer who has a 3.9 GPA and recently became a semifinalist for 
a National Merit Scholarship. Although she's been approached by several 
colleges that provide athletic scholarships, she wants to attend an Ivy League 
school, preferably Harvard or Yale, which do not award athletic scholarships. 
But she knows that being a sports standout -- she also plays volleyball -- 
could tip the admissions scales in her favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster-Keddie and her parents also recognized another important step in 
increasing the chances for a scholarship. That is . . . : Make Sure the Kid 
Plays Where the Decision-Makers Will See Her 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay features a number of powerhouse schools in certain sports: 
baseball (El Segundo), basketball (Inglewood), girls basketball (Peninsula), 
and girls and boys volleyball (Mira Costa in Manhattan Beach). Faced with 
limited travel budgets, especially in the so-called "non-revenue sports" such 
as volleyball, coaches and recruiters naturally gravitate toward the best 
teams, the ones with the stars and blue chippers, bypassing lesser-known 
programs. "It's sort of a meat market in some respects," said Wendell Yoshida, 
who coached the Peninsula Lady Panthers' basketball team to a 1992 national 
championship and operates a nationally known program."(Coaches and recruiters) 
are out there all the time. We're going to Ohio this year to play in a major 
Christmas tournament, and there'll be college recruiters and coaches crawling 
all over the place."  
</P>
<P>
 But what if you don't happen to live in the El Segundo school district, or the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula district, or the Inglewood district, or whatever 
district is tops in your kid's sport? Well, you can do what a lot of parents -- 
including Foster-Keddie's -- have done: Move into the district so your kid can 
go to school there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wendell Yoshida is the best basketball coach in the area," said 
Foster-Keddie's father, Kevin Foster-Keddie. "When (Katharine) was in the fifth 
grade, and seemed to be showing talent in basketball, a friend said, 'Call 
Yoshida.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Foster-Keddie did, sent Katharine to several of Yoshida's summer basketball 
camps, and then when she was about ready to start high school, he and Katharine 
moved to a leased home in Rancho Palos Verdes -- leaving the rest of the 
Foster-Keddie family back home in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a lot of changes," Kevin Foster-Keddie said. "It was difficult. But I 
believe you have to be supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Peninsula basketball star, Allison Fortner, a 5-foot 9-inch shooting 
guard who recently returned from a trip to the East Coast for a showcase 
tournament to show her stuff to recruiters, also is a transplant: she moved 
into the district from San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every other top program has players with similar stories of moving from 
sometimes far-flung areas into the school district. Basketball coach Roy at 
Inglewood has had players move into the district from Artesia, the San Fernando 
Valley, all over. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel they need to come here to be seen by the coaches," Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
 And one El Segundo resident, who asked to remain anonymous, acknowledged that 
he decided to move to the city 15 years ago -- when his son was still in 
diapers -- in large part because of Stevenson's baseball program.  
</P>
<P>
 But what if you can't quite uproot your entire family just to make sure your 
kid is in the best sports program? What if you can't afford to fly all over the 
country showing off your kid at showcase tournaments? How can you get 
recruiters and coaches to notice you? The solution may be . . . : Advertise, 
Advertise, Advertise 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you're a true blue-chipper in football or basketball, you need to 
market yourself," said Tracy Jackson, president of College Prospects of 
America, an Ohio-based firm that contracts with student-athletes to distribute 
profiles of their athletic and academic statistics to colleges across the 
country. "It's a dating service concept; we introduce athletes to colleges and 
vice versa. If they want to get married, that's up to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest and largest company of its type, nine-year-old College Prospects 
operates through about 175 independently owned franchises in 47 states. For 
$650, a student can have a complete resume sent to every college athletics 
program in which they might legitimately be qualified to play. Jackson makes no 
guarantees that they'll get a scholarship, but he says there's a money-back 
guarantee that the athlete will get at least one response from a college coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone approves of the concept -- Stevenson of El Segundo calls such 
services "parasites," and even Jackson acknowledges that some fly-by-night 
operations have damaged the concept's image. But the company literature is 
thick with testimonials from college and high school coaches and parents. And 
some student athletes say it's the only way to get their names out there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Clark of Carson, whose daughter, Leslie King, 17, is a standout girls' 
softball player at Carson High School, said Leslie was hoping somebody would 
notice her, but nobody did. "Her coach told her about it (College Prospects), 
and since she signed up, she's gotten about 25 responses." 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches are sending me questionnaires," said Leslie, a senior who's on 
the honor roll and has a 3.95 GPA. "I haven't talked to any of them yet, but 
I'm hoping something will work out." 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't easy to come up with the money (for the service)," Clark said. "But 
when you consider how much college costs, we thought it was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most important piece of advice on college athletic 
scholarships, according to almost everyone, is not to attach too much 
importance to them. For most kids the odds are long, the payoff often is not 
that great -- especially from a partial scholarship -- and the athletic 
scholarship may not jibe with the kid's educational goals.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission (in high school athletics) is not to build college players or 
professional players," said Stevenson. "Our mission is to provide an education, 
and athletics is part of the educational process. If a kid gets a scholarship, 
that's nice, but I don't think kids should play just for that purpose. They 
should play because they love to play."

100 WOMEN MARCH TO PROTEST VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carrying signs that read "We Will Not Keep Silent About the Violence" and "No 
Means No," about 100 women marched the streets of Pasadena last weekend to draw 
attention to violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the YWCA of Pasadena-Foothill Valley Rape Crisis Center, the 
"Take Back the Night" march and rally Saturday evening also commemorated the 
20th anniversary of the center, which was formed after the rape of a 
13-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said that the march and rally were meant to draw attention to the 
issue of safe streets and homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just the streets that aren't safe," said Valerie Coachman-Moore, 
executive director of the YWCA of Pasadena-Foothill Valley. "People's homes 
aren't safe."

 A car-tracking device led sheriff's deputies not just to the stolen vehicle 
but to a suspect in a robbery and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest followed a noon carjacking Sunday in Pasadena in which four 
carjackers using a semiautomatic weapon forced a 60-year-old man out of his 
1994 GMC Suburban in front of the Ralph's supermarket at 160 N. Lake Ave.The 
Suburban was equipped with the LoJack car-tracking system. Six hours later, 
authorities tracked the system's signal to Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief pursuit, deputies arrested Jae Kong, 25, residence unknown; 
Young Lee, 26, and Melissa Gomez, 19, both of Los Angeles, and a 13-year-old 
girl, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Investigator Mark Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were being held at Los Angeles County Jail; Gomez is at Sybil Brand 
Institute for Women and the juvenile is at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kong, who authorities say may not be giving his real name, was wanted in 
connection with an Oct. 13 robbery in Bell Gardens that left two of the three 
robbery victims with gunshot wounds. Along with three accomplices, none of whom 
was involved in the carjacking, he is suspected of robbing three people inside 
a hotel room at the Fiesta Inn, authorities said.

TORRANCE SCHOOL BOARD UNANIMOUS IN OPPOSING PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Torrance school board passed a resolution Monday opposing Proposition 187, 
the initiative that would prohibit schools from educating children of illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not in the public interest to create an uneducated, unemployable and 
medically untreated underclass within our midst, an underclass that could 
eventually cost the taxpayers of the State of California far more in services 
required . . . than it would to inoculate and educate," the resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted unanimously to support the resolution, which called the ballot 
measure "counterproductive to rational public policy" and "potentially harmful 
to the children of the Torrance community." 
</P>
<P>
 Several educational organizations that also oppose the proposition, including 
the California School Boards Assn. and the Assn. of California School 
Administrators, have passed similar resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member John Eubanks said the Torrance Unified School District could end 
up paying legal fees and administrative costs caused by the proposition. In 
addition, Eubanks said, there would be no guarantee that surplus funds 
generated by cutting back on the number of students would go to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall reaction of the board was that something needs to be done but 
this isn't a solution," Eubanks said. MARY GUTHRIE

POWER POLITICS IN PASADENA; FEUDS, STAFF RESIGNATIONS AND MANAGEMENT ERRORS 
HAVE PUT CITY OFFICIALS ON THE DEFENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena has often worn its political controversies on its sleeve. But the 
most recent accusations and sometimes painful admissions of mismanagement are 
forcing the city's leadership into a new era of self-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney recently resigned under fire for allegedly discriminating 
against female staffers. And officials are now investigating whether black 
employees were denied promotions and subjected to racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 A string of respected department heads have left the city to take jobs 
elsewhere, and the city manager is under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the city still feels the sting of the dismal failure of 
its summer soccer festival, as well as the embarrassment of being cited by the 
state for not properly equipping firefighters to battle last year's Altadena 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Two council members recently suggested that the city look at a new form of 
government, perhaps going to a full-time mayor and changed roles for the 
council and city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some leadership problems that we're having to deal with," said 
Councilman Chris Holden, who, along with Councilman Rick Cole, would like to 
reshape Pasadena government. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints range from financial failures to allegations of institutional 
racism. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 * Small business owners were incensed last summer when the city's poorly 
planned soccer festival, Soccer Carnaval, flopped and vendors lost thousands of 
dollars. One reason for the failure was that World Cup officials exercised 
their contractual right to keep the festival from opening on game days. The 
city, which had assured the business owners that they would be able to open and 
sell to throngs of game-day fans, has paid settlements totaling $58,000 to 10 
merchants to defray their losses. Eleven claims are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 * In response to complaints from Pasadena firefighters, the state Division of 
Occupational Safety and Health cited the Fire Department in July for using torn 
protective clothing and for failing to supply protective shields during last 
year's firestorm in Altadena. The Fire Department is taking corrective action 
to satisfy Cal/OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
 * City Atty. Victor Kaleta resigned in August under fire from the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and women's groups. A consultant 
hired by the city to probe complaints against him found that Kaleta 
discriminated against female lawyers, including one African American, by 
failing to include them in a round of promotions in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation prompted its own storm of criticism, largely against Mayor 
Kathryn Nack for changing her mind and providing the fourth vote needed to 
force Kaleta out. 
</P>
<P>
 * City Manager Philip Hawkey admitted that the city should have been doing 
more to promote African American employees after the Pasadena Black Municipal 
Employees Assn. appeared before the council twice in the past two months 
complaining that too few blacks hold administrative positions. The group also 
said black employees have been subjected to racial slurs and more stringent 
discipline than have other employees. Hawkey is investigating the complaints; 
his report is to be completed by Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 * A number of department heads have left the city recently, including Library 
Director Edward M. Szynaka, who oversaw last year's campaign for a library tax, 
which voters approved. Ramon Curiel resigned as the city's affirmative action 
director last month, and Health Officer Dr. Jacqueline Stiff has announced her 
resignation effective Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * The City Council's infighting and critical nature have chipped away at 
employee morale, contributing to the departure of Szynaka and others. 
Councilman Isaac Richard often sparks council infighting by railing against 
what he sees as injustices against blacks at City Hall and in Pasadena. Cole is 
Richard's favorite target, but the councilman at times has taken on Nack and 
others. Richard also has gone into tirades against city employees, including 
City Clerk Maria Stewart, an incident that drew a censure from the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's factions agree that these developments are troubling, but there is 
little agreement on what should be done to prevent such problems in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard is the only prominent city leader to publicly call for Hawkey's 
ouster. But council members and community leaders have made it clear that they 
fret about Hawkey's ability to run the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all started on April 24, 1990, the day that 800 to 1,000 black people 
showed up in City Hall and protested the hiring of one Philip Hawkey," said 
Richard, an African American, referring to the day that Hawkey beat out two 
black candidates for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Holden and Bill Crowfoot said they have questions about whether 
Hawkey is the right man for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Their primary complaint is that Hawkey and his staff don't always keep them 
well-informed about key city issues and projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowfoot said he was caught unprepared when Soccer Carnaval vendors appeared 
before the council demanding reparations. The councilman said he voted to 
approve the festival with the understanding that a private firm hired to stage 
the event would be liable for any losses. City lawyers belatedly pointed out a 
contractual clause that made it clear that the city was obliged to offer cash 
settlements, the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council "is sitting completely unprepared to deal with the issues coming 
before us," Crowfoot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said he didn't know about the promotion problems in the city attorney's 
office until they hit the public arena with full fury. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these type of things don't come to the surface, and come to the surface in 
a dramatic way, we don't know about them," Holden said. "We're on a dinghy 
without a compass in the fog." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey met with the council members in a closed session Monday to talk about 
their concerns. The council, which can fire Hawkey at any time, reassured him 
that his position is safe for a year. The council also voted 6-0, with Richard 
abstaining, to extend Hawkey's potential severance pay from two months to the 
industry standard of about six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nack read the following statement after the session: "The council repudiates 
the confrontational attacks upon the character of the city manager and pledges 
to maintain an environment of fairness and respect within which the city 
manager's performance can be measured." 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager acknowledges that there have been some blunders, including 
Soccer Carnaval and the Cal/OSHA violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawkey said he has presided over successes as well, including the rebirth 
of Old Pasadena as the area's hot nightspot and the overall staging of the 
World Cup, which produced $2 million in revenue for the city and millions more 
for the local economy. (Richard has disputed the figures, which are scheduled 
for review by a council committee.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey acknowledged that he doesn't pass every detail of city business along 
to the council. In some cases, the bickering of council members would put an 
unnecessary damper on staff initiative, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we bring (an item) to the City Council, it's the target of 
criticism," Hawkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Black community leaders also are critical of Hawkey -- primarily because they 
believe that he has not moved quickly enough to promote African Americans into 
management positions. They are waiting to see how he resolves the complaints of 
inequities from black employees. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary complaint is that too few African Americans have moved into top 
spots in city government. Blacks account for 16% of Pasadena's officials and 
administrators, while filling 52% of the city's lower-paid service and 
maintenance positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a large number of people who don't believe that a large number of 
changes have occurred since he's been here," said Joe Hopkins, an activist 
lawyer who represents the Black Municipal Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey agrees that there should be more minorities in influential positions at 
City Hall, but he also said he already had made some improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities now account for 56% of the municipal work force, compared with 50% 
in 1989, before Hawkey was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the issue was highlighted by the black employees group, the city manager 
moved quickly to address its concerns. Hawkey formed a committee, which 
includes black and other minority employees, to investigate the allegations for 
the Oct. 24 report. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, one white supervisor who allegedly made racist remarks has been 
reassigned so he won't be in contact with rank-and-file employees, Hawkey said. 
A review indicated that the supervisor did not make racial slurs, but he is 
gruff and pushed his employees to perform, Hawkey said. Although the 
allegations were untrue, Hawkey said, he decided it was better for the 
department to transfer the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hawkey recently appointed African Americans to the positions of 
planning director, acting director of affirmative action and special assistant 
to the city manager, a rotating position that is seen as a steppingstone to top 
administrative assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't call Hawkey a racist, but I will say he's the top manager of an 
institution that really subordinates people of color," said Prentice Deadrick, 
Hawkey's new special assistant, a member and former president of the Black 
Municipal Employees Assn. "That's a classic definition of institutional 
racism." 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Hawkey seemed destined for the proverbial frying pan, and race 
has always been an issue providing much of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The council hired him on a 4-3 vote after thinking long and hard about 
allegations that he was unfair in dealing with black employees in Toledo, Ohio, 
where he was previously city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey, like Richard, also has the date that he was hired etched in his mind. 
It was the day that Richard, a community activist who would soon win a council 
seat, vowed to make the new city manager's life miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard has done just that. At times, the councilman walks over to Hawkey 
during a meeting to pledge he will "get" the city manager. Richard has attacked 
Hawkey and other city employees as incompetent or racist. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks on Hawkey have prompted a multiracial group of prominent residents 
to come forward in his defense. They said they fear that the allegations of 
discrimination will lead to the ouster of the city manager -- a replay of 
Kaleta's forced resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 With all its quarreling and contentiousness, the City Council has deprived 
Hawkey of the support he needs to do the job, said the group's spokesman, Bob 
Monk, a longtime community leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Monk blames Richard, saying he poisons the atmosphere at City Hall by sparking 
council infighting and overly criticizing some city employees. But he also 
blames the rest of the council, including Cole, for trading barbs with Richard 
and adding to the acrimony. Nack draws fire from Monk for failing to throw 
Richard out of the council chambers when he begins a tirade. 
</P>
<P>
 "No city manager is going to be able to function in that atmosphere of chaos 
down there," Monk said. "How do you expect to have a tranquil city government 
when the elected leaders of this town are in chaos?" 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicts have contributed to the departure of some key city 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Szynaka, the library director who resigned last summer, said he grew weary of 
a meddling council that wanted to micro-manage and was prone to flip-flop on 
issues, frustrating city administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 But Szynaka, now director of the Indianapolis/Marion County Library system, 
also faulted Hawkey for failing to stand up to the council for the good of the 
city. Hawkey, after all, is the trained city manager. Although he must carry 
out council policy, the City Charter grants him broad powers, including the 
hiring and firing of all but a few top officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil's in over his head. He's losing good people who have poured a great deal 
of themselves into making (Pasadena) a good city," Szynaka said. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of the council's willingness to get involved in personnel matters 
occurred two years ago after Hawkey hired a white woman to fill an 
administrative post in the city's Department of Water and Power. Richard, who 
wanted an African American employee promoted to the position, and other council 
members objected that the city had not properly followed hiring procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey investigated, found a problem with how the job was posted and rescinded 
the hire. The duties of the post were expanded, and the African American was 
picked for the new position. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't tell me what to do," Hawkey said of the City Council. "Of course, 
(Richard) did a lot of screaming and shouting." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiel, the city's recently departed affirmative action director, said he 
favored the initial hire because it would have brought another woman into a 
male-dominated area of City Hall. The woman ended up filing a lawsuit, which is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many staff, including managers, felt Hawkey did not stand up to the council 
members," Curiel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff morale also has suffered because of the council's combative and critical 
nature, Hawkey and other officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Richard, other council members harshly grill staffers who 
nervously search for answers. Part of the problem is that council members 
expect too much from a staff that has been reduced by budget cuts, Hawkey and 
others said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no secret that city employees don't like the idea of going before the 
council and always feeling like they've done something wrong," said Lance 
Charles, acting affirmative action director. "It's like, put on your 
(bulletproof) vest time, and that's not the way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
 But several council members said they have a responsibility to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 "People voted for me to be a decision-maker and represent their interests," 
said Richard, who added that his goal is to ensure that African Americans get a 
fair shake inside and outside City Hall. "I'm not here to let people get 
exploited under my nose." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent ouster of Kaleta from the city attorney's post added greatly to the 
tension at City Hall and to the consternation of community leaders. Almost 
everyone was critical of the way the matter was handled. 
</P>
<P>
 The NAACP and women's groups criticized the council for moving too slowly 
after a consultant found that Kaleta had discriminated against the female 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta's supporters felt that the council bent to political pressure instead 
of standing up for a strong city administrator. Keeping Score in Pasadena 
</P>
<P>
 A look at some of the players in Pasadena politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Prentice Deadrick was recently appointed special assistant to City Manager 
Philip Hawkey, a position that is seen as a stepladder to top administrative 
positions in municipal government. Deadrick, a member and former president of 
the Pasadena Black Municipal Employees Assn., has pushed for more top-level 
jobs for African Americans. He says Hawkey is not a racist, but that the city 
manager presides over institutional racism at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Philip Hawkey is investigating allegations that black employees 
have been ridiculed on the job by some managers, disciplined more severely than 
white workers and kept out of administrative posts. He has acknowledged that 
the city should have done more to promote black employees. His 1990 hiring was 
opposed by Councilman Isaac Richard; the two have been at odds since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Chris Holden has criticized Hawkey for not properly informing the 
City Council about key issues. Holden, along with Councilman Rick Cole, has 
proposed examining another method of city government, perhaps with a full-time 
mayor, to smooth out the city's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Joe Hopkins, an activist Pasadena attorney, is representing the 
Pasadena Black Municipal Employees Assn., which contends that African American 
employees are denied opportunities for promotion, disciplined more harshly and 
subjected to racial slurs. Hopkins won a $585,000 jury award earlier this year 
for a former Pasadena employee who said he was denied promotion because he is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leader Bob Monk, a longtime community leader and director of the 
Pasadena Boys and Girls Club, is part of a group of prominent residents who 
stepped forward recently in defense of Hawkey. Monk calls the City Council 
chaotic and blames it for the city's leadership problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Kathryn Nack was criticized for her actions after a consultant found 
that former City Atty. Victor Kaleta discriminated against female lawyers in 
his office. Nack, who initially voted to give Kaleta six months to bring 
harmony to his department, changed her vote and forced Kaleta's resignation. 
Some criticized Nack for political grandstanding, but the mayor said she never 
felt comfortable with her first vote and had to follow her conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Isaac Richard, the council's most volatile member, blames Hawkey 
for the city's problems and says he should be fired. Richard contends that 
Hawkey was unfairly hired over two black candidates. Some community leaders 
blame Richard for the city's leadership crisis, saying he has sparked 
infighting on the council and never given Hawkey a chance. Critics also say 
Richard's tirades against the city manager and other city employees have hurt 
morale at City Hall.

<P>
 Notre Dame has Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida has Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa High has Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Football's proverbial thorn in the side prevailed again Friday as visiting 
Culver City ended Mira Costa's 10-game winning streak with a 33-21 Ocean League 
victory. The Mustangs are 18-2 in two seasons under Coach Don Morrow, with both 
defeats coming at the hands of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mira Costa's 21-20 loss to the Centaurs in 1993 was viewed by some as 
a fluke or the result of bad luck, no such argument can be made about Friday's 
game. Culver City won because it had superior athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed was the difference. When Mike Fikes, Mira Costa's standout tailback, 
broke past the Culver City defense, he was easily caught. When a Culver City 
player got behind the Mustang defense, it was a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It was apparent early that Mira Costa had no answer for Centaur receiver 
Jasiri Rodell, who caught nine passes for 220 yards and four touchdowns. And 
the Mustangs failed to put enough pressure on quarterback Damon Williams, who 
passed for 268 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City's lightning-quick running backs -- Aki Wilson and Jahmal Wright -- 
fueled a successful ground game. Wright's 74-yard scoring run in the third 
quarter put the Centaurs ahead to stay, 26-21. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, things might have been different had Phil Fonua and Dino Rossi been 
able to play for Mira Costa. Fonua, an All-American nose tackle, would have 
provided a stronger pass rush and disrupted the running game. Rossi, a 
defensive back, is perhaps the only Mustang capable of slowing down Rodell. 
Morrow had praised Rossi's coverage of Rodell in last season's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Mira Costa, both seniors are out for the season -- Rossi is 
recovering from knee surgery and Fonua from a brain aneurysm. Without them, the 
Mustangs will fight an uphill battle to win their first league title since 1976 
and repeat as Southern Section Division VII champions. THE REAL THING? 
</P>
<P>
 After filling up on cupcakes, Redondo will begin a diet of more substantial 
Ocean League opponents this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Hawks (4-2) are tied for first with Culver City at 3-0, but their 
league victories have come against Centennial, El Segundo and Morningside, 
teams with a combined record of 5-12, 1-8 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 The more demanding part of Redondo's schedule begins Friday night when it 
visits South Torrance (3-3, 1-2), a team in desperate need of a victory in 
order to keep its playoff hopes alive. The outcome will provide a better 
indication if Redondo is a contender or a pretender. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Hawks looked like the real thing Friday, racking up nearly 300 yards 
in a 34-12 victory over Morningside. Sophomore Ed Sanchez relieved starting 
quarterback Doug Francis late in the third quarter and completed an eight-yard 
touchdown pass on his first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis, who left the game because of a shoulder injury, is expected to play 
Friday. GAME OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 Here we go again. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year Hawthorne plays Peninsula with first place in the Bay League on the 
line. And every year Hawthorne wins. The Cougars are 3-0 against Peninsula, 
coached by Hawthorne grad Gary Kimbrell. 
</P>
<P>
 So why should Friday night's game at Hawthorne be any different? 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Peninsula (5-1, 3-0) is playing great ball. After losing to 
Mira Costa, 9-6, the Panthers have won four consecutive games by a combined 
score of 159-28. Included in the streak was a stunning 35-7 victory over 
Leuzinger, considered a contender for the league title. Last week, Peninsula 
routed North Torrance, 51-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne's recent outings have not been nearly as impressive. The Cougars 
(5-1, 3-0) were forced to come from behind the past two weeks in victories over 
Inglewood, 29-19, and Torrance, 34-33. Mistakes and turnovers have hindered the 
team's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the Cougars clean up their act, this could be Peninsula's year. A FOOT 
AHEAD 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's the little things that count. El Camino College found this out 
Saturday in its Mission Conference showdown against Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors played what Coach John Featherstone called their "worst game of 
the year," yet were able to pull out a 38-35 victory over the host Falcons 
largely because of what happened on two field goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 35-35, defensive back Omarr Morgan blocked a 25-yard 
field goal attempt to give El Camino the ball at its 19-yard-line with 5 
minutes 11 seconds left. Quarterback Steve Sarkisian directed the Warriors 71 
yards in 10 plays to set up a 27-yard field goal by David Scanlon with 43 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time this season that Scanlon was called upon in a pressure 
situation, but it was no surprise that the former El Segundo High standout came 
through. Scanlon has made all 28 of his point-after attempts and is four of 
five on field goals, giving him 40 points, tops in conference kick scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino needed Scanlon's last-minute kick on a night it was plagued by 
penalties, turnovers and mistakes against a strong Cerritos team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (5-0), ranked third in the nation, draw an easier assignment this 
week, playing host to Saddleback (0-4-1) at 7 p.m. Saturday. Saddleback, under 
former El Camino coach Ken Swearingen, is off to the worst start in the 27-year 
history of the football program. TARNISHED RIVALRY 
</P>
<P>
 The Banning-Carson game was once the Hope Diamond of the South Bay prep 
football season. These days, though, the matchup of longtime rivals looks more 
like a gaudy piece of costume jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson (2-4) is coming off a 14-13 loss to Dorsey. Banning (3-2-1) tied 
Gardena, 20-20, last week. Yes, times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 43th meeting between the schools (Carson leads the series, 23-19) 
Friday night at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach carries some of the old 
significance. First place in the Pacific League is at stake, and the winner 
will celebrate as if it won the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things never change. NOTABLE

 What's the best spot for a romantic oceanside evening in Redondo Beach? 
</P>
<P>
 When can you attend the annual Japanese Koi Festival in Gardena? 
</P>
<P>
 And where can you enjoy the cheapest home-style cooking in San Pedro and have 
a view of the harbor? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Robert Badal or get his book, "Romancing the Southland," which rolled off 
the presses last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 700-page work is a historical account of life in Southern California and a 
guide to weird and wonderful places to see and things to do. Many of the 
highlights are in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 It will tell you that the Portofino Hotel and Yacht Club is the perfect 
private hotel for romance; the California Koi Festival (a competition judging 
rare fish) has been held in Gardena every March since 1974, and the friendly 
owners at Walker's Cafe ("bikers welcome"), established at 700 Paseo del Mar in 
1942, still know how to turn out a wonderful home-style lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Badal is a native Southern Californian, and his book is the result of about 
500 interviews, five years of writing and a lifetime of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old, who calls himself Mr. Romance, has lectured for 16 years 
throughout Southern California on the topic of love and romance.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I'm trying to do with this book and with the seminars I've 
developed is tie the region together," Badal said. "When I say 'Romancing the 
Southland,' I mean I'm looking for something interesting. I'm romancing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the places highlighted in the book are small restaurants, hotels and 
other businesses that focus on the unusual.

THEATER REVIEW; 'DRACULA' IS A SPOOF YOU CAN'T COUNT ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "Dracula the Comedy," at the Knightsbridge Theatre in Pasadena's Old Town, is 
frightening for the wrong reasons. It makes fun of a horror classic without 
eliciting one belly laugh itself. So it's a long evening, even though the show 
lasts only a little over an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Adaptor and Knightsbridge co-founder Joseph Stachura said that when he last 
staged a traditional "Dracula" nobody showed up. So this Halloween he decided 
to camp up the fangy count, and -- guess what? -- the theater was almost packed 
the night we attended. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with Stachura's comedy is that it's musty and talky, notably in 
the case of the visiting doctor, Prof. Van Helsinki (Frank Simons), who in the 
traditional version is the hero of the piece. Stachura has transformed him into 
a madman who insists he's Dutch, not German, and breaks into goose-steps and 
heils to the Fuhrer , his brow perspiring under the moody drawing room lights. 
</P>
<P>
 And what's "Dracula" without a bedroom and tombs or burial vaults? Director 
Edward Luhn's set is a drawing room, with gauzy curtains blowing through a 
French window. 
</P>
<P>
 In the show's one great moment, the traditionally costumed, oily Count Dracula 
(a suave and silken Victor Ian Lopez) sensually plunges his teeth into the 
luscious damsel, Lucy (Teressa McKillop). 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder that the straightforward, drop-dead-serious approach outwits most 
satiric transformations. The play's humorous motif is provided by Van 
Helsinki's dazed daughter, Mina (Cheryl Bricker), who sports a Dracula-induced 
gash on her pretty throat, with these pointy things protruding from her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 On a horror scale, zero. On a comedy scale, just a nibble. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dracula the Comedy," Knightsbridge Theatre, 35 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena, 
Friday, 9 p.m., Saturday, 8 p.m., Sunday, 5 p.m. Ends Oct. 31. $15; $10 for 
students and senior citizens. (818) 440-0821. Running time: 1 hour, 15 minutes.

MUSEUM IS SEEKING SURVIVORS OF BATAAN DEATH MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Asia Museum volunteers are trying to locate about 35 survivors of the 
World War II Bataan Death March, to present them copies of a South Pasadena 
native's book of poems describing his imprisonment in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Lee's book, "Nothing but Praise," is a collection of poems he wrote as a 
prisoner of war.Lee, who graduated from Pomona College, was stationed in the 
Philippines and captured after the Japanese took Bataan. After the Japanese 
victory, exhausted Filipino and American soldiers made an arduous trek to a 
prison camp on the central peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 After Lee wrote the poems, he buried them for safekeeping. The poems were 
unearthed after the war by a man who heard from freed prisoners that people had 
buried their writings in the Japanese prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The poems were eventually published, first in the Saturday Evening Post and 
then in book form. Lee died in 1945 en route to Japan when a ship on which he 
was being transported fell under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers for the Pasadena museum's Philippine Arts Council are working on 
the project, with the help of Henry Lee's sister, Frances Lee, a South Pasadena 
resident.

<P>
 As the morning sun lifts above the hills east of this town near the Hudson 
River, Harvey Houtkin, principal and chief executive officer of tiny Domestic 
Securities Inc., sits before a Nasdaq trading terminal, steeling himself to do 
the unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 Houtkin taps a few buttons on a keyboard linked to the central computer for 
over-the-counter stock trading. "What I'm doing now is the most unacceptable 
thing you can do in the market," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Houtkin -- a "market maker" whose business is buying and selling 
Nasdaq stocks at publicly quoted prices -- is about to send traders at vastly 
larger firms into fits of rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to attract a small portion of the more than 66 billion shares traded 
annually on Nasdaq, he is about to deliberately narrow the spreads -- 
essentially the market makers' profit margin -- on some of the most widely 
traded over-the-counter stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The move will save investors money. But it also will cut into the hefty 
profits of more established Nasdaq dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 He punches in the symbol for Intel Corp., the computer chip maker that is 
Nasdaq's second-largest company. Houtkin, with 1,000 shares to sell, changes 
his posted prices. He cuts the "spread" -- the gap between the best price at 
which any dealer will buy the stock and the price at which he will sell it -- 
from a quarter of a point, or 25 cents a share, to a mere eighth of a point, or 
12 1/2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, a message flashes on his trading terminal from a much larger 
market maker, Weeden & Co.: "Pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 A caller who says he is Peter from Morgan Stanley complains: "You guys break 
the spread for 1,000 shares?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chiron Corp.'s stock has been trading with a 1/2-point spread; Houtkin narrows 
it to three-eighths. The phones ring again. This time, Keith Balter, head of 
over-the-counter trading at Weeden, tells Houtkin: "You're embarrassing and 
pathetic. . . . You're breaking the spreads for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Small investors may never be aware that they benefited from Houtkin's 
initiatives. Yet an ordinary individual investor buying 200 shares of Chiron or 
Intel at the better price posted by Domestic Securities would have saved $25. 
With an average of 299 million shares changing hands daily on Nasdaq, narrower 
spreads on just the biggest Nasdaq stocks would add up to millions in dollars 
of savings for retail customers every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq this year surpassed the New York Stock Exchange to have the highest 
daily trading volume of the nation's stock markets. But amid the massive 
trading, such savings -- representing millions of dollars in foregone profits 
for market makers -- rarely materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, close examination of Nasdaq's day-to-day operations shows that the 
system is biased against the small investor, favoring big institutional traders 
and market makers over the ordinary investing public. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department confirmed this week that it is conducting an antitrust 
investigation of Nasdaq, looking into allegations of price-fixing and other 
illegal practices by dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which owns and operates Nasdaq, says 
it is unaware of any investigation but will cooperate fully. NASD officials 
insist that their fast-growing electronic market -- home to such familiar 
stocks as Microsoft Corp., MCI Communications Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. -- 
is fair to small and large investors alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq has made it possible for some of these companies to raise the money 
they needed to prosper, creating billions of dollars in wealth for the U.S. 
economy. And as the home to many of the most rapidly growing firms in 
technology and health care, it has increased tremendously in recent years in 
its importance to small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where the growth is," said Robert W. Erikson, 67. He is an original 
member of a Michigan investment club, founded in 1955, that now invests almost 
half its assets in Nasdaq stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But an inquiry by The Times -- including three months spent sitting on Nasdaq 
trading desks and interviews with more than 100 traders, professional 
investors, customers and Nasdaq officials -- found that individual investors 
are much more likely to get fair treatment for their trades on the venerable 
New York Stock Exchange than on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 On the NYSE, spreads for most stocks are a mere eighth of a point, while the 
vast majority of Nasdaq stocks -- even the biggest, most actively traded issues 
-- trade at spreads of a quarter-point or more. In part through an automated 
computer system, big and small orders get executed on a relatively equal 
footing on the New York exchange; indeed, investors often get prices better 
than the posted spread. Nasdaq investors, by contrast, get a worse price for 
their trades than big investors, such as pension and mutual funds or the market 
makers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 And if a customer has put in an order to sell a stock at, say, $20, that order 
will be filled on the NYSE before any buyer has to pay a higher price. On 
Nasdaq, there is no such rule. The federal Securities and Exchange Commission 
has moved in recent months to stop Nasdaq firms from "trading ahead" of their 
customers' orders. But the new rules still will allow thousands of more 
advantageous offers to sit unfilled each day in Nasdaq's fragmented trading 
system while market makers sell shares to small investors at higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the New York or American stock exchanges, Nasdaq (the name originally 
stood for National Assn. of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system) has 
no trading floor. It is a nationwide network of 510 market-making firms linked 
together by a central computer system and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 In a massive ad campaign, Nasdaq bills itself as "the stock market for the 
next 100 years." Yet traders say that except for a separate computer system 
owned by the British firm Reuters PLC, much of Nasdaq's daily volume is traded 
not through sophisticated electronic networks. Instead, it trades the 
old-fashioned way -- by one dealer talking to another over the phone, much as 
the over-the-counter market operated in the decades when it served mainly as a 
means for obscure companies to sell shares to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Nasdaq's most controversial practices: 
</P>
<P>
 * Competition among market makers to offer the best price and the narrowest 
spreads has all but disappeared on Nasdaq, according to veteran traders, mutual 
fund managers and others. Under a controversial system in which many market 
makers pay brokerage firms to send them a steady flow of orders from small 
investors -- regardless of the price the market maker is offering -- a 
financial incentive exists to keep spreads as wide as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD insists that price competition is the heart of its market system -- 
indeed, one of its key advantages over the NYSE's traditional "auction" system, 
in which a single "specialist" firm serves as the sole market maker for each 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nasdaq dealers flout the requirement to execute customer orders at the best 
available price. Despite new rules, market makers still will be able to ignore 
better offers for their customers' stock and thereby maximize their own 
profits. Dozens of times, a reporter watched as individual customers or traders 
entered orders at prices inside the prevailing spread, only to see the orders 
ignored while other trades were executed at less desirable prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD insists that it carefully balances the interests of its customers and 
market makers alike. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nasdaq seldom enforces a key securities regulation, the "firm quote" rule, 
which requires dealers to honor the prices they post on Nasdaq computer 
terminals. Instead, dealers routinely "back away" from their quotes -- that is, 
they refuse to trade at all at the prices they advertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 4,748 backing-away complaints have been filed with the NASD through 
Oct. 4 of this year, the group has taken no public disciplinary action on any 
of them. (On three, small fines of $500 to $1,500 were imposed but were not 
publicly disclosed.) Market makers charge that the NASD doesn't aggressively 
investigate most of the complaints. The NASD says many of the complaints are 
frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nasdaq also seldom enforces the requirement that dealers promptly report 
each trade for display on the public tape. Senior executives of mutual funds 
and other institutional investors complain that some Nasdaq market makers 
routinely delay reporting trades -- and thereby avoid influencing the market. 
In doing so, critics say, they prevent investors from accurately assessing the 
supply, demand and price for a stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD says it closely monitors the market, but that deliberate wrongdoing 
is difficult to prove. The group said it has taken no public action this year 
against any market maker for failing to accurately report trades. 
</P>
<P>
 While these problems are interlinked, veteran traders say the most fundamental 
problem with Nasdaq trading is the market's wide spreads. The Justice 
Department investigation is focusing on an alleged conspiracy by market makers 
to keep spreads wide. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD has vehemently denied that there is collusion in its marketplace. In 
an interview, NASD President Joseph Hardiman said that as far as he knew, 
market makers were completely free to narrow spreads. Hardiman said he had no 
knowledge of any verbal harassment of market makers who did so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be very distressed if that practice were to occur in our 
marketplace," Hardiman said. "To say that we would react strongly if any 
evidence of that were presented to us is an understatement." 
</P>
<P>
 Documents obtained by The Times show that formal complaints have been filed 
with the NASD, which so far has taken no disciplinary action on any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, NASD officials privately have been pressing market makers to cut 
spreads. Among the reasons: fear that big companies are becoming reluctant to 
list their stock on Nasdaq because of concern about excessive spreads -- and 
fear that Congress or the SEC might step in and require sweeping reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Justice Department antitrust probe -- still in its preliminary 
stages -- the big trading firms face more than a dozen major class-action 
lawsuits accusing them of conspiracy to keep spreads artificially wide. The 
suits, filed since May, seek millions of dollars in damages. They were prompted 
by news reports that business professors William G. Christie of Vanderbilt 
University and Paul H. Schultz of Ohio State University had found strong 
circumstantial evidence of tacit collusion among market makers to fix the 
spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 The market makers also deny that there is any collusion in Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Balter, the OTC trading chief at Greenwich, Conn.-based Weeden & Co., 
acknowledged that he verbally pressured Houtkin at Domestic Securities when 
Houtkin cut the spreads. Indeed, Balter expressed no remorse for berating 
Houtkin as a reporter listened in. 
</P>
<P>
 "A thousand shares is not worth breaking the spread in a stock," Balter said. 
"My comment is that for somebody who narrows a spread (without standing ready 
to buy large quantities of stock), pathetic is a good word." 
</P>
<P>
 (A Morgan Stanley Group Inc. spokeswoman said the firm would not comment on 
the call placed to Houtkin by its trader.) 
</P>
<P>
 Richard G. Ketchum, the NASD's chief operating officer, confirms that market 
makers are not allowed to speak "abusively" to each other or to try to threaten 
or intimidate fellow dealers. The NASD's rules of fair practice require member 
firms "to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable 
principles of trade." The NASD has the power to censure and fine violators, 
although it does so rarely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What are spreads? 
</P>
<P>
 If you were to look at a computer screen used by Nasdaq traders, you would see 
each market maker quoting two prices for each stock. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the "bid" price, at which the market maker is willing to buy the stock 
from the public. The other, known as the "asked," is the higher price at which 
the market maker is willing to sell. The difference between the two is called 
the spread. It exists to cover a dealer's costs of making a market in a stock 
(including the risk of holding shares that might go down in price) and the 
dealer's profit margin. 
</P>
<P>
 In promoting itself as superior to the NYSE, the American Stock Exchange and 
other exchanges, Nasdaq boasts that for each of its stock, multiple dealers vie 
with each other to make markets. 
</P>
<P>
 For such big Nasdaq stocks as Apple Computer, MCI, and Microsoft, there are 50 
or more market makers. The NASD contends that Nasdaq's multiplicity of market 
makers creates intense competition and results in customers getting better 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vaunted competition among market makers is more illusory than real. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 30, for example, nearly 450,000 shares of Cambridge, Mass.-based 
Biogen Inc. had traded as of 11:57 a.m. EDT Although there were 38 market 
makers supposedly competing with each other to trade the stock, 13 were posting 
the identical bid price, 50 3/4. All of the rest posted less favorable prices 
-- indicating, basically, that they were not willing to trade. And none had 
stepped forward to beat the 51 1/4 asked price by breaking the 1/2-point 
spread. 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time, shares in Intel, a Santa Clara-based semiconductor 
maker, were trading with a 1/4-point spread -- and continued to do so 
throughout the day, though 63 market makers were posting prices for the stock. 
Intel ended the day with a higher trading volume than all but three stocks on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the day's trading pattern was typical. On Nasdaq, the vast 
majority of stocks have spreads of at least 1/4 of a point; less actively 
traded stocks can have spreads ranging beyond 2 points -- that is, more than $2 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, for example, Oneita Industries Inc., one of the smallest stocks 
listed on NYSE, had a spread most of the trading day of 1/8, even though only a 
total of 55,500 of its shares changed hands. In contrast, the spread on Lotus 
Development -- a far larger company that is one of the biggest listed on Nasdaq 
-- varied between 1/4 and 1/2, even though more than 3.2 million shares traded. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no real competition" among market makers on spreads, said Robert M. 
Gintel, chairman and chief executive of the Gintel Group, a mutual fund manager 
in Greenwich, Conn. Nasdaq's claims about the benefits of market maker 
competition are "fictional," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq officials contend that the spreads are determined purely by competitive 
market forces. Indeed, the NASD and market theorists say that in a truly 
competitive market, spreads should be determined by how actively traded a stock 
is, how many shares are held by outside investors, the volatility of a stock's 
price and the number of market makers competing against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spreads in highly liquid, highly active stocks (on Nasdaq) are very 
good," insisted Hardiman, the NASD president. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet records of market makers' daily quotes and the new study by Christie and 
Schultz suggest the existence of a gap between official explanations and 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The professors discovered something odd about Nasdaq trading: Seventy-one out 
of 100 of the largest Nasdaq stocks almost never were quoted in "odd eighths," 
they wrote. That is, the quoted bid or asked prices might be 20 or 20 1/4 or 20 
1/2, but almost never 20 1/8 or 20 3/8 or 20 5/8. And as a direct result, the 
spreads on these stocks almost never were less than a quarter of a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie and Schultz, whose findings will be published in December in the 
Journal of Finance and have been cited in many of the class-action lawsuits, 
searched for market-related reasons why these stocks would not trade in odd 
eighths when, at the same time, much more thinly traded stocks routinely had 
odd-eighths quotes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, they concluded that there must be an unwritten agreement among 
market makers to keep the spreads in these stocks wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "While this paper does not provide conclusive evidence of tacit collusion 
among market makers, we are unable to offer any other plausible explanation for 
the lack of odd-eighth quotes," they stated. 
</P>
<P>
 None of big market-making firms contacted by The Times would give an 
explanation for not quoting major Nasdaq stocks in odd eighths. All declined 
comment, some citing the pending class-action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, NASD officials tried hard to discredit the study. Ketchum told The 
Times in May that the report "is irresponsible -- and in fact we believe it is 
slanderous." 
</P>
<P>
 NASD chief economist Gene L. Finn acknowledged that the NASD has no studies of 
its own on the subject. But he and Ketchum maintain that market forces explain 
why quotes for certain stocks "gravitate naturally" toward increments of 1/4 of 
a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Ketchum said spreads on big Nasdaq stocks stay wide because Nasdaq market 
makers are expected to stand by the prices they quote for large amounts of 
stock -- 10,000 shares or more per trade. The dealers, he said, need wide 
spreads to cover the risks they undertake in filling such big orders. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nasdaq rules only require market makers to honor their prices for 1,000 
shares. Despite repeated requests, NASD officials did not offer statistical 
evidence that dealers routinely honor their prices for bigger amounts of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times, meanwhile, has learned that at the same time they were deriding the 
professors' report, top NASD officials quietly had begun moving to address a 
problem whose existence they publicly denied. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 24 -- just a day before he publicly blasted the professors' report as 
"slanderous" -- Ketchum addressed a closed-door meeting of major Nasdaq market 
makers, sponsored by the Securities Traders Assn., at the headquarters of Bear, 
Stearns & Co. Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Ketchum has since confirmed that he told the market makers that the spreads on 
some stocks were too wide -- and asked for voluntary action to narrow them. 
Otherwise, he said, the NASD might be forced to crack down. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later -- on Friday, May 27, and Monday, May 30 -- the spreads on 
three of the biggest Nasdaq stocks -- Apple Computer, Microsoft and Amgen Inc. 
-- suddenly narrowed to an eighth, and stayed there. In the previous months, 
they almost always had traded with spreads of at least a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 Ketchum and other NASD officials confirm that, in response to his speech, 
three leading market makers each picked a leading Nasdaq stock and unilaterally 
cut the spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was William R. Rothe, a member of the NASD's board of governors who 
is also a managing director in charge of OTC trading at Baltimore-based Alex. 
Brown & Sons. Rothe cut the spread on Apple Computer that Monday, The Times has 
learned. All day, whichever way the stock moved, Rothe moved his firm's bid or 
asked prices to ensure that the spread stayed an eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman Sachs & co. did the same with Microsoft. And a third market maker did 
so with Amgen, an NASD source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spreads have stayed at an eighth ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothe declined to comment about the narrowing. Goldman Sachs spokesman Edward 
G. Novotny, in a written statement, denied that the firm's decision to cut the 
spread on Microsoft that day had anything to do with Ketchum's speech. Ketchum, 
however, said in an interview that he believes the decision stemmed at least 
partly from his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, at an eighth, these stocks now trade with spreads the same as 
those for comparable stocks on the NYSE. Critics say the ease with which market 
makers were able to permanently lower them raises questions about whether 
competitive market forces really determine Nasdaq spreads -- and about why the 
spreads on more big Nasdaq stocks haven't followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz, the Ohio State professor, said the fact that three market makers 
easily were able to narrow the spreads on three of Nasdaq's biggest stocks 
supports the theory that there is collusion among market makers to set spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 On Microsoft, for example, he noted that 41 market makers on a single day 
began quoting in odd-eighths, changing a pricing practice that had been in 
effect for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That, we think, is probably the strongest evidence that the dealers are not 
acting independently," Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 From the vantage point of small investors, spreads can be the difference 
between winning and losing on an investment. 
</P>
<P>
 For a stock quoted 8 bid-8 3/4 asked, investors buying on the asked price 
would have to wait for the stock's bid price to go up nearly 10% (not counting 
commissions) before they could break even on their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the quoted spreads don't tell the whole story. Professionals often 
trade "inside the spread," paying far less to buy and sell Nasdaq shares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Institutions love to trade Nasdaq because they get treated very nicely and 
can trade inside the spread," said Andrew Schwarz, an options trader and 
specialist on the American Stock Exchange. "But if your Aunt Betty wants to buy 
500 shares of a Nasdaq stock, good luck getting a price inside the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Many individual investors say they have no idea they routinely pay more for 
Nasdaq stocks than the professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the recent experience of Beverly Wayte of Pasadena, an avid investor 
who teaches adult English classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her broker Charles Schwab & Co., Wayte on Aug. 17 bought 200 shares of 
Eltron International, a Chatsworth company that makes bar code printers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her order was executed at 11:24 a.m. EDT, and she got the stock at its quoted 
ask price, 12 3/8. But records obtained from the NASD show that within minutes 
of her trade -- while the stock's quoted price remained unchanged -- other 
investors were able to buy it for less. A case in point: In another trade that 
took place within just seconds of Wayte's, a bigger investor bought 1,000 
shares of Eltron and paid only 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwab, the nation's leading discount brokerage firm, would seem to have 
little incentive to get customers like Wayte a price inside the spread. Schwab 
owns one of the biggest Nasdaq market makers, Mayer & Schweitzer Inc., which 
executes most of the Nasdaq trades for Schwab's customers. So Schwab profits 
from the wide spreads, as do large Wall Street brokerage firms like Merrill 
Lynch & Co. Inc. and PaineWebber Inc., which are Nasdaq market makers 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwab spokesman Hugo Quackenbush said most retail customers are not concerned 
about getting a price inside the spread, but rather about getting their orders 
filled quickly at the price quoted to them over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush defended the firm's handling of Wayte's and similar trades. "We're 
not embarrassed about it," he said. "We go to great efforts to guarantee that 
customers get the best nationwide inside bid or offer, as appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 And he acknowledged that Schwab has a profit incentive to charge the full 
spread. "Sure we make more money," he said, adding: "We play by the rules of 
the Nasdaq market." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardiman, the NASD president, said he is not troubled by small investors 
getting worse prices on Nasdaq. "The retail investor clearly doesn't have the 
negotiating clout that an institutional investor has," he said. "That's true in 
any business." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, the spreads should not be significant to small investors. 
"Individuals should not trade a lot of stocks in the Nasdaq market," he said. 
"These are growth stocks. They should be investors, not speculators." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Wayte, who buys a few hundred shares of Nasdaq stocks from time to time, 
said she was surprised to learn from a reporter that others trading at the same 
time get better prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed and frustrated," she said. "And I'd like to know what the 
SEC thinks about this." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of companies whose stocks traded on Nasdaq have taken investors' 
concerns so seriously that they have pulled their shares off Nasdaq and listed 
them elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Until August, the NAIC Growth Fund, a closed-end mutual fund, was listed on 
Nasdaq. But swamped with complaints from fund investors about the wide spreads 
market makers were quoting on the shares, it moved to the Chicago Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund is run by the National Assn. of Investors Corp., a Royal Oak, Mich., 
not-for-profit group that promotes responsible investing by individuals and 
helps set up investment clubs, including many for senior citizens. The 
closed-end fund (a mutual fund whose shares trade like a stock) was set up as 
an investment vehicle for NAIC members. 
</P>
<P>
 While the stock was listed on Nasdaq, the spread was 1 1/2 -- or sometimes 
more, according to NAIC Chairman Thomas E. O'Hara. Market makers "were making 
as much as $2 on a $10 stock," he said. "We thought that was a little 
ridiculous. Our members blamed us for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Since switching on the Chicago exchange, the spread on NAIC Growth Fund shares 
has narrowed to 1/4, according to Lawrence Augustyn, the specialist who handles 
the shares. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 2, O'Hara wrote to Hardiman seeking an explanation for the wide 
spreads. NASD spokesman James Spellman said the NASD had no record of receiving 
the letter. He declined comment on the NAIC fund's move to the Chicago 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies have cited spreads as a reason for bolting from Nasdaq. David 
C. Carney, chief financial officer of CoreStates Financial Corp., said the 
Philadelphia-based bank holding company switched to the NYSE last year, in part 
for its narrower spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 Though insisting that spreads on most Nasdaq stocks are acceptable, Hardiman 
conceded: "It's one reason we lose companies to the exchanges." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nasdaq says competition among market makers is its greatest advantage 
over the NYSE, longtime traders say they no longer need to compete to get 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, they say, is a practice known in the industry as "payment for 
order flow." Mushrooming since 1987, it means market makers no longer need to 
compete on price to be guaranteed a steady flow of customer trades: They get it 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Market-making firms pay brokerage firms to send them their customer orders for 
execution. Instead of shopping around a customer's order to find a market maker 
willing to offer the best price, the brokerage gives all or most of its orders 
to one willing to pay for them. The market makers typically pay several cents 
per share for each buy or sell order. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest brokerage firms have become major market makers themselves. Firms 
such as Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage, execute a great 
proportion of their customers' trades -- assuring them a flow of internal 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Payment for order flow exists for stocks listed on the NYSE and other 
exchanges as well. And controversy about the practice is not new; it has 
prompted class-action lawsuits (which are pending) and condemnation from many 
investor groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has drawn scant public scrutiny is its profound impact on Nasdaq 
trading, where it serves as a strong incentive for market makers to keep 
spreads wide. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Their contracts require market makers to give the best quoted bid 
or asked price for a stock at the time an order comes in, regardless of that 
market maker's own price. So if a small market maker, such as Domestic 
Securities' Houtkin, breaks rank and cuts the spread, other, bigger market 
makers suddenly have to meet his price. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, a market maker who cuts the spread does not just narrow his 
own profit margin, but that of fellow market makers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics such as Houtkin call the system "bribery for order flow." A Harvard 
Law Review article published in May said brokerage firms that accept payment 
for order flow "are engaging in a practice . . . that may induce them to place 
their own interests ahead of their customers' interests." 
</P>
<P>
 On Nasdaq, payment for order flow "has eliminated competition based on price," 
said Benjamin L. Lubin, a former member of the NASD's board of governors, its 
top policy-making body. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have captive order flow coming in, I do not have an incentive to tighten 
my (spreads)," added another member of the NASD board of governors who declined 
to be named. "I don't have to attract business by having a superior bid or 
offer, (because) it's coming to me no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 Many market makers and brokerage firms contend that payment for order flow is 
necessary if very large numbers of small orders are to be handled efficiently. 
The volume of small orders on Nasdaq has grown so explosively during the last 
decade, they say, that they could not shop each one around to multiple market 
makers seeking the best price. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC, after spending several years agonizing over the issue, has decided 
not to ban payment for order flow. Instead, the agency is adopting a rule that 
would require brokerages to make detailed disclosure of such payments to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other reasons why market makers get upset when Houtkin and others 
cut the spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does it cost them money under payment-for-order-flow arrangements, 
but it also riles up their big institutional customers, such as pension and 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment officers at these institutions have computer terminals on which 
they can see the current best bid and asked prices for Nasdaq stocks. If 
Houtkin cuts the spread on a stock, his new, better price will flash on their 
screens. And that leads institutions to demand better deals too. 
</P>
<P>
 In a notarized affidavit, Domestic Securities trader James Mercer stated that 
on July 15, a trader at San Francisco-based market maker Hambrecht & Quist Inc. 
called Domestic to complain that Houtkin had cut the spread on the stock of 
Xilinx Corp., a San Jose software company. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is bull----," the caller allegedly raged. "I have institutional 
customers who come to me and I have to match your price. It's bull----, you 
guys going down an eighth for a thousand shares." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the allegation, Hambrecht & Quist general counsel Steven 
Machtinger said: "In our opinion, the Nasdaq stock market is very competitive. 
Beyond that we have no comment." 
</P>
<P>
 NASD officials have tried to cast doubt on Houtkin's motivation, pointing out 
that he has a record of minor disciplinary violations. Houtkin has been 
censured and fined twice, paying an undisclosed amount under $3,000 in total -- 
once in 1991 for failing to keep accurate records and once in 1985 for 
allegedly abusing a Nasdaq computer system for handling small orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Lerner, general counsel of Domestic Securities, says Houtkin has been 
singled out for disciplinary action because he is a maverick, an assertion the 
NASD denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Other market makers have a new strategy for dealing with Houtkin, Lerner 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
 When Domestic Securities cuts the spread on a stock, a big market maker will 
hit the firm with a huge order to buy or sell 50,000 or 100,000 shares. 
Domestic Securities must fill only 1,000 shares at its posted price, but then 
either must immediately change its price or accept the full order -- which 
Domestic Securities, a small firm, says it cannot afford to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just blow us out of the way so that the spread can go right back to 
where it was before," Lerner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual investors are frustrated too. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pay on the way in and on the way out," said John D. Miskie, 59, a 
Redding, Pa., chemist forced into retirement by a stroke. Miskie says he 
invests some of his limited savings in Nasdaq and NYSE stocks to have 
"something to hand over to my grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Miskie: I understand that market makers have to make money to stay in 
business. But that's their problem. These (spreads) seem tough to justify."

 The electronic Nasdaq market has grown into the nation's busiest marketplace 
for buying and selling stocks, with higher trading volume than the better-known 
New York Stock Exchange. Nasdaq is where investors trade shares of Intel, 
Microsoft, Apple Computer and other leading firms, along with the stocks of 
hundreds of smaller companies.

 Critics are questioning the fundamental fairness of Nasdaq's trading system, 
and the Justice Department has launched an antitrust investigation of possible

</P>
<P>
 A glossary of common terms used on Nasdaq: 
</P>
<P>
 * Market makers: Firms that put up their own capital to "make a market" in 
particular Nasdaq stocks, acting as dealers by continuously posting prices for 
the stocks on Nasdaq's computer and standing ready to buy or sell. Unlike the 
New York Stock Exchange, where a single "specialist" is the sole market maker 
for each stock, each Nasdaq stock has multiple market makers. There may be 60 
or more market makers for very big Nasdaq stocks, such as MCI, Apple Computer, 
or Microsoft, or fewer than five for small, very thinly traded stocks. Market 
makers include many big, well-known Wall Street investment houses, such as 
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, as well as lesser-known firms that do little 
else besides making markets in Nasdaq stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bid: The posted price at which a market maker is willing to buy a stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Asked: The posted price at which a market maker is willing to sell a stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spread: The gap between the bid and asked prices. This is essentially the 
market maker's profit margin for acting as a dealer in the stock. Market makers 
buy from investors at the bid, and sell at the highter, asked price. 
</P>
<P>
 * Backing Away: The illegal refusal by a market maker to honor the prices it 
posts in the Nasdaq computer system for buying or selling a stock. This is 
analagous to a store that refuses to honor its advertised prices. The SEC 
requires market makers to buy or sell, from anyone who wants to trade, usually 
at least 1,000 shares of stock at the bid or asked prices it posts. When a 
stock's price is moving up or down, market makers may be afraid that they will 
suffer losses if they honor their quoted prices. So they refuse or ignore an 
offered trade. They might falsely claim that someone else was "ahead" -- i.e., 
that the market maker just sold the required amount of stock to another 
customer or market maker at that price. For individual investors, backing away 
means they end up having to pay more to buy a stock, or get less for selling 
it. It also delays execution of customer orders, which can cost customers money 
if the stock price is quickly changing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trading through: Market makers continue to trade with the investing public 
at their quoted bid or asked prices, ignoring offers that are better for 
customers. The customer who put in the better priced order often doesn't get it 
filled. Other investors never know about these pending orders, and miss out on 
an opportunity to buy stock at less than the quoted ask price or sell at more 
than the quoted bid price. Trading through benefits the market makers because 
they get to charge the full spread. Critics say this is a fundamental flaw of 
the Nasdaq market, since it prevents some investors from knowing what other 
investors are willing to pay for a stock at a given time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trading ahead: Also known as front-running, this refers to a market maker 
buying or selling for the firm's profit ahead of an order from the firm's own 
customer. When a customer places an order that is likely to move the market -- 
on Nasdaq even relatively small orders can have a big affect on a stock's price 
-- the firm might buy or sell ahead of that order, profiting later from the 
price move from the customer's order. This can also result in the customer 
getting a worse price, if his brokerage firm trades ahead of his order and 
snaps up all the stock at the best available prices. This has long been illegal 
on NYSE, and many other exchanges. Since June, a limited ban on this has been 
in effect on Nasdaq. Impact of Nasdaq "Spreads" 
</P>
<P>
 Stock transaction on the Nasdaq routinely cost small investors more than big, 
institutional investors. Consider these parallel transactions in the shares of 
a hypothetical firm, XYZ Co.: 
</P>
<P>
 SMALL INVESTOR 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Smith buys 300 shares of XYZ stock. Almost certainly, her order will be 
executed at the asked price, $10.50 per share. So she pays $3,150. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, XYZ stock's price hasn't changed, so a disappointed Smith 
decides to sell. As a small investor, she almost certainly will get the bid 
price, $10.00 per share. So she gets back $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Her net loss on a stock that hasn't budged -- $150, or 4.8% -- is the direct 
result of the 1/2-point spread, the 50 cents-per-share difference between the 
bid and asked prices. 
</P>
<P>
 If you add in the commissions she'll pay her discount brokerage -- $76.79 on 
the purchase plus $75.80 on the sale -- Smith's total loss climbs to $302.59, 
or 9.6% of her investment. The stock price would have to rise 10% just to break 
even. 
</P>
<P>
 BIG INVESTOR 
</P>
<P>
 Major Pension Fund buys 4,000 shares of XYZ stock. As a big, institutional 
investor, Major can get a price "inside" the spread, buying at less than the 
asked price -- in this case, $10.25 per share. It pays $41,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Major again goes inside the spread, selling at $10.125 per 
share. The pension fund gets back $40,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund's net loss of $500 amounts to just 1.2% of its investment. The 
effective spread on its transaction was just 1/8 point. 
</P>
<P>
 As a big investor, Major is able to negotiate much smaller commissions as a 
percentage of its investment. So between the narrower spread and the lower 
commissions, XYZ shares would have to rise far less for the pension fund to 
break even.

DELAY OF TRIAL AND BAIL DENIED FOR SIMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stunning change of tactics, lawyers for O.J. Simpson on Wednesday 
requested a yearlong delay in the superstar athlete's murder trial but made it 
contingent on his release on bail -- a move they sought to allow publicity to 
subside before a jury hears evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an impassioned defense argument, however, Superior Court Judge Lance 
A. Ito denied the request -- although he will allow Simpson's attorneys to 
renew it later. As a result, the flurry of activity accomplished little beyond 
temporarily rocking the murder trial, where jury selection has been under way 
since late last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unprecedented case that requires an unprecedented remedy," said 
Simpson lawyer Robert L. Shapiro, forcefully asking Ito to "take charge" of the 
case and grant bail. Simpson's other lead attorney, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., 
appealed to Ito's sense of grandeur, asking him to grant bail despite a dearth 
of case law supporting such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 "This affords Your Honor a place in history," Cochran said. "This is your 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark responded by proposing a three-month delay but 
vigorously arguing that no bail was warranted. Under California law, defendants 
in capital cases are not entitled to bail, a fact that Clark cited to the judge 
in warning against defying judicial precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense invites this court into the chasm of disaster," she said of 
Simpson's effort to win bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon bombshell in the Simpson proceedings came amid a day of 
fast-moving developments, some of which unfolded in open court, others behind 
closed doors. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * In a closed courtroom Wednesday morning, Simpson addressed the judge. 
Although transcripts of that hearing have not yet been released, Cochran said 
later that Simpson told Ito that he was not fleeing on the day of his arrest, 
when the nation watched as he and close friend Al Cowlings led police on a 
low-speed pursuit through Orange County and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ito appealed to television programs to hold off on broadcasting interviews 
with Faye D. Resnick, author of a controversial new book that purports to 
detail the last months of Nicole Brown Simpson's life. Two of three programs 
said they would go ahead despite Ito's request, but CNN's "Larry King Live" 
agreed to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ito put in place a new system for questioning prospective jurors, one that 
had been proposed by Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman last week. Under the 
new system, jurors will be questioned singly and will be asked about their 
exposure to the book as well as other issues that might make it difficult for 
them to be impartial. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening days of the Simpson case, publicity has dogged the 
proceedings, creating a series of flare-ups as Ito has attempted to insulate 
prospective jurors from being tainted by prejudicial publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue exploded anew this week with the release of "Nicole Brown 
Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted." The book was co-authored by 
a National Enquirer columnist and Resnick, who describes herself as the dead 
woman's best friend while painting a seedy and controversial portrait of her. 
</P>
<P>
 After the book's release, Shapiro said he no longer believed that Simpson 
could receive a fair trial. Prosecutors disagreed, and both sides met with Ito 
in a series of conferences Wednesday in an effort to find a way to guarantee a 
fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Measures can be taken to ensure a fair and impartial jury," Clark said during 
one break in the proceedings. "We're exploring them now." 
</P>
<P>
 When the two sides returned to court Wednesday afternoon, however, the defense 
argued that the drastic remedy of a long delay was the only way to protect the 
jury from contamination. That represented a dramatic turn in the defense 
position, which from the start has been to argue for the speediest possible 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even while asking for the delay, the defense made it clear that it 
only wanted a postponement if Simpson would be allowed to go free on bail. That 
posed a difficult argument for Simpson's lawyers, however, because California 
law generally does not allow for bail in cases such as this. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, a defendant is presumed ineligible for bail in a capital 
murder case unless the defense can show that the proof of guilt is not evident 
or the presumption of guilt is not great. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, two California appellate courts have ruled that the statutory 
presumption against granting bail to a defendant in a capital murder case also 
applies in a special circumstances murder case, even if the district attorney 
is not seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to persuade Ito to ignore the precedents, the Simpson lawyers called 
on him to rise above case law and "become a jurist." At one point, they 
compared him to Earl Warren, a former chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Simpson's lawyers maintained that their client is entitled 
to bail because, contrary to prosecution arguments, he had not shown any 
intention to flee. Cochran referred to a session in which Simpson apparently 
addressed the judge directly on that subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Although transcripts were not immediately available from that session, the 
remarks attributed to Simpson would be his most extensive in the case, since 
his comments to date have been limited to perfunctory responses and his brief 
statement upon entering his plea -- when he famously proclaimed that he was 
"absolutely 100% not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran's comments indicated that Simpson had told Ito that he had not 
intended to flee June 17, the day that he first failed to surrender as 
scheduled and then ultimately was arrested at his Brentwood home after leading 
police on a long, low-speed highway pursuit. As evidence, Cochran said Simpson 
cited the fact that when he was spotted on Interstate 5, he was headed back 
toward Los Angeles, not away. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark countered, however, that Simpson was in fact attempting to escape that 
day and only changed plans when he realized that he could not succeed. She also 
confirmed for the first time news reports by The Times and KNBC-TV that Simpson 
had a large amount of cash and a passport when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man in possession of a gun, passport, and $7,000 or $8,000 . . . and a 
disguise reasonably leads a logical person to conclude that a flight was 
attempted but unsuccessful," Clark said. Later, she added: "The People are 
asking that this defendant not be given the opportunity to succeed where 
previously he had failed." 
</P>
<P>
 As Clark spoke, Simpson shrugged and shook his head, visibly indicating his 
disagreement with her portrayal of his actions that day. 
</P>
<P>
 After briefly recessing to review the law and recent cases, Ito turned down 
the defense motion. He did so without prejudice, however, meaning that 
Simpson's lawyers can renew their request later if circumstances change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with you that this is a highly unusual situation," Ito said. "And I 
appreciate the call to judicial greatness. . . . But a trial court has to be 
guided by statutes and the case law." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said Ito was on solid ground in that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of granting a continuance for a year to deal with pretrial publicity 
was seriously misguided because the publicity would simply have heated up all 
over again as we approached the new trial date," said UCLA law professor Peter 
Arenella. "Moreover, there is always the possibility that during the delay more 
damaging prejudicial information will come out, which would irretrievably taint 
all prospective jurors." 
</P>
<P>
 Myrna Raeder, a Southwestern University law professor, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand (the defense) position," she said. "But it's a difficult one 
under the law, particularly where the prosecution can point to Mr. Simpson's 
low-speed chase -- from the prosecution's point of view a risk of flight." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito's decision Wednesday at least temporarily heads off the chance of 
a trial delay, it does not resolve the judge's continuing concerns about 
publicity in the case, particularly in light of this week's release of the 
Resnick book. Referring to the book Wednesday, Shapiro said it was widely 
available, adding: "They're selling the books on the courtroom doorsteps." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some analysts believe that Ito is overreacting to the book -- noting 
that it is just the latest in a long series of unsubstantiated accounts about 
the relationship between O.J. Simpson and his ex-wife -- the judge has made it 
clear that he considers its publication potentially devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Ito launched an extraordinary campaign to mute its effect, 
sending letters to the president of CBS News, as well as to talk show hosts 
Larry King and Maury Povich, asking them to not air scheduled interviews with 
Resnick. That request raised delicate questions of media restraint, and it 
produced a mixed response: CNN agreed to hold off, while Povich and CBS said 
they would go ahead with their scheduled broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interview of Ms. Resnick, no matter what its content, will serve only to 
fan the already raging fires of adverse publicity and further jeopardize the 
parties' right to a fair trial," Ito wrote. "I hope you will find it in your 
conscience, corporate and otherwise, to cooperate with this request and delay 
this program's broadcast until after the jury in this case has been selected 
and sequestered." 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, Resnick writes that Nicole Simpson's ex-husband threatened to 
kill her on numerous occasions, some in the months immediately before her 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did not threaten action against organizations proceeding with interviews, 
but his request did pose a challenge to exercise restraint. It raised issues 
about whether programs should give credence to Resnick's account despite a 
judge's request that they hold off and about whether responsible news 
organizations would be undermining important constitutional principles in 
pursuit of a racy story. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point news organizations have to stop citing the 1st Amendment as 
giving them an imprimatur to do whatever they want," said Jeff Greenfield, a 
media and political analyst for ABC. "I do believe there are times when 
journalists use the 1st Amendment the way a diplomat uses his passport when he 
is stopped for drunk driving. We have to go beyond asking 'Do we have the legal 
right to do this?' and ask 'Are there other things at stake?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Greenfield declined to comment on the merits of Ito's request, but some 
lawyers and media experts said they considered it a reasonable one. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we in the press stand behind the 1st Amendment and say 'protect us' 
because we wish to air a story on Ms. Resnick, who has co-authored a book with 
a National Enquirer writer for money . . . we undermine our argument that we 
are advancing democracy," said Ken Auletta, media critic for the New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Levenson, a Loyola law school professor and frequent commentator, said 
she too thought Ito's request was understandable, given the intense publicity 
that surrounds the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a reasonable request," she said. "He's asking them to show some 
responsibility. What a novel concept." 
</P>
<P>
 But Everette Dennis, executive director of the Freedom Forum for Media Studies 
at Columbia University, said he fears that by drawing more attention to the 
book, "Judge Ito has given it greater credibility. It's become the forbidden 
fruit now." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, two of the affected programs showed little interest in abiding by the 
judge's request. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Resnick's book has been the focus of a great deal of media attention, and 
the contents of the book have been widely publicized," CBS News President Eric 
W. Ober said in a letter sent to Ito on Wednesday. "Accordingly, while CBS News 
appreciates and respects your commitment to safeguarding Mr. Simpson's 6th 
Amendment right to a fair trial, we believe that broadcasting Ms. Chung's 
interview with Ms. Resnick is fully consistent with responsible journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Povich said he too had considered the judge's request but ultimately decided 
that broadcasting the interview carried little risk of influencing the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Resnick book is available in bookstores," Povich said. "There has been 
all kinds of media coverage already on the book. There are other interviews 
scheduled. And besides all that, the judge has already instructed his potential 
jurors not to watch television, listen to the radio or buy newspapers, 
magazines or books. So I think he's solved his own problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Povich's show is the only scheduled appearance for Resnick before 
a live audience. The audience, Povich said, was "very skeptical" of Resnick's 
claims and peppered her with questions about her drug history and her motives 
for writing the book. 
</P>
<P>
 But only CNN's "Larry King Live" agreed to postpone its broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of the court's fair trial concerns, in this case CNN has decided to 
exercise its 1st Amendment right and will delay telecast of the interviews," 
the network's public relations office in Atlanta said. 
</P>
<P>
 When jury selection resumes today, Ito intends to question jury panel members 
about any exposure to the book or to coverage of it.

STUDY CITES 'INAPPROPRIATE' PROCEDURE IN SUBWAY WORK; CONSTRUCTION: OUTSIDE 
FIRM HIRED BY MTA CRITICIZES THE USE AND INSTALLATION OF WOOD WEDGES IN 
TUNNELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN and RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The substitution of wood wedges for metal bracing in 12 miles of Los Angeles 
subway tunnels under construction was "inappropriate," according to an outside 
engineering study performed for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, obtained Wednesday night, also concluded that the wedges in tunnels 
along Hollywood Boulevard failed two months ago mainly because the contractor 
did not install them properly and did not surround them with concrete or grout 
material as required. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings present the MTA with a critical portrait of the design and 
construction of the twin tunnels being built in Hollywood and under Vermont 
Avenue. Excavation in Hollywood has been halted since Aug. 18, when surface 
sinkages of nine inches were confirmed. Two days later, workers were evacuated 
from one tunnel because of fears that the structure could collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit authority Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White hired the 
Chicago-area forensic engineering firm of Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates this 
month to provide an independent analysis of the construction overseen by MTA 
engineers and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 White, reached Wednesday night, said he will weigh the report in deciding 
what, if any action, to take against the MTA's design engineering consultants, 
led by the firm of Parsons Brinckerhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a matter we will be pursuing . . . with the design team," White said. 
"Were we to conclude that professional standards were not met, we would at that 
point take whatever action is appropriate. . . . It's going to be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Parsons Brinckerhoff were not available for comment 
Wednesday night. Earlier, the project's chief tunnel designer, who approved the 
substitution of the wood wedges, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Hall, a Caltech engineering professor who has reviewed the 
substitution of the wedges at the request of The Times, said the assumption of 
wood strength was clearly faulty. "It's really a simple undergraduate 
calculation," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 White last month said he stood behind his construction staff's decision not to 
seek a credit from the tunnel contractor in exchange for the use of the 
less-expensive wood, instead of metal struts. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new report's findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * The design of the tunnel bracing overestimated the stresses that the wood 
wedges could be expected to withstand. "Substitution of the wood wedges for the 
specified metal struts was inappropriate," the report said. Transit engineers 
approved the substitution in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * The tunnel contractor, the joint venture of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, failed to 
place dry-pack grout, as required, around the 32-inch-long wood wedges. The 
study cites inspection reports -- drafted weeks after tunneling was halted in 
August -- verifying "areas in both the Hollywood and Vermont tunnels where the 
expansion gaps were incompletely or improperly filled." 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite the inappropriate substitution of the wood, the wedges probably 
would not have failed if they had been inserted properly and if the grouting 
material was placed around them in the expansion gaps, between 4-foot-wide, 
8-inch-thick segments of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tests performed for the tunnel contractor show that the wood wedges "do not 
meet the submitted criteria" for strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny have declined to answer questions from 
the news media, citing a provision of their contract. However, the president of 
the company that controls the joint venture has for the first time publicly 
blamed transit officials for not requiring more extensive grouting of the soil 
to prevent ground sinkages. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President John F. Shea, in a letter this week to MTA board members, 
said that project officials "consciously" decided not to require grouting that 
might have stabilized the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea also contended that the failure of the wood wedges did not cause, but 
resulted from, the ground sinkages of up to nine inches in Hollywood. Earlier 
engineering analyses concluded that the failure of the wedges contributed to 
the sinkages. The Wiss Janney report said that although "the crushing is 
believed to be responsible for much of the observed settlement," more 
investigation is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea's letter comes as White is considering terminating the contracts of both 
the tunneling contractor and the transit authority's inspection management 
firm, Parsons-Dillingham. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Parsons-Dillingham have alleged that Shea-Kiewit-Kenny 
deliberately concealed from inspectors deficient work -- the placement of 
improper filler material instead of required high-strength grout -- around the 
wood wedges. Shea's letter did not address that allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 White, asked Wednesday about Shea's letter, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the tunneling in Hollywood and earlier problems, the Clinton 
Administration on Oct. 5 announced a suspension of $1.6 billion in future 
federal funding for subway expansion. The funding will be unfrozen, federal 
officials said, when the MTA demonstrates that it can competently manage subway 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the growing disagreements over responsibility for the sinkage is 
who -- contractors, taxpayers or both -- will pay for tunnel repairs and damage 
claims from property owners. The total costs are not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea, in his letter, cited two types of grouting that he said were not 
required by transit officials: 
</P>
<P>
 One is compaction grouting, whereby a cement-based material is injected from 
street level. The material has been used to stabilize soil under which a 
tunnel-boring machine has passed or is about to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The second procedure referred to by Shea is chemical grouting, the injection 
of grout through pipes from within the tunnel into soil ahead of the boring 
machine. It is designed to coagulate fine soils that otherwise might pour into 
a tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Not mentioned in Shea's letter was contact grouting, another procedure 
intended to prevent ground settlement. This calls for pumping of cement-based 
grout from within the tunnel to eliminate air voids between the structure's 
concrete segments and the surrounding earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Sept. 11 that MTA officials did not enforce a contract 
specification requiring Shea-Kiewit-Kenny to perform contact grouting along 
Vermont Avenue and part of Hollywood Boulevard. Inspection reports show that 
even after the MTA began enforcing the specification, the contractor did not 
contact grout more than 340 linear feet of tunnel in the area where the ground 
sinkages are now apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea said in his letter: "The decision to exclude compaction and/or chemical 
grouting in this critical area on Hollywood Boulevard was consciously made by 
the" MTA and its consultants. "These procedures are normally specified in urban 
tunneling to mitigate damage to property," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials have said that they, in consultation with the contractors, 
considered and rejected performing compaction or chemical grouting as of late 
July, when they found that Hollywood Boulevard had sunk by four inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to questions posed by The Times, the chairman of the design firm of 
Parsons Brinckerhoff, Martin Rubin, gave this explanation last month: 
</P>
<P>
 "Compaction, chemical . . . and other forms of grouting were considered by the 
MTA, its consultants and contractors. . . . It was determined that grouting 
would not significantly reduce settlements." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin did not specify whether the contractors he referred to included 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny and he could not be reached for elaboration. John Adams, the 
MTA's interim director of rail construction, said he could not comment.

EXPLOSION IN TORRANCE INJURES 20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A gas explosion ripped through a Torrance oil refinery Wednesday afternoon, 
sending flames 40 feet into the air and injuring at least 20 people, at least 
half a dozen of them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Mobil Oil refinery said the blast occurred at 3:15 p.m. when 
an elevated pipe carrying liquid petroleum gas apparently sprang a leak, 
releasing flammable vapor into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 William Buckalew, Mobil environmental health and safety manager, said the 
hydrocarbons exploded within moments, creating a fire that burned for about 
half an hour before it was extinguished by Torrance firefighters and Mobil's 
own crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the refinery were shut down after the blast, but most of the plant 
was operating normally by 6 p.m. Buckalew said it was unclear what had ignited 
the hydrocarbon vapors, adding that the explosion is under investigation. 
Hydrocarbons themselves will not explode upon contact with the air, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the only sign that something was amiss was a drift of white 
smoke that snaked from an overhead pipe and set off a stampede of alarmed, 
orange-suited crews below. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe God gave us a warning," said Roy Hicks, a 36-year-old Lawndale 
carpenter who was working at the plant for a Mobil subcontractor when the 
10-foot cloud of what smelled like car exhaust floated down around around his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said he was sprinting toward a fence outside the plant when the force of 
the blast smacked him to the ground. He was not seriously injured, but others 
were, including a man who was knocked off a 20-foot ladder by the shock waves, 
two men burned over 7% and 17% of their bodies, a fourth man who suffered 
third-degree burns on his face and two others who were taken directly to the 
burn unit at Torrance Memorial Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall, hospitals in the area of the plant, near 190th Street and 
Crenshaw Boulevard, had reported treating at least 17 people for minor to 
moderate burns and smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mobil officials, who were keeping their own tally, said a total of 20 
workers were treated at the four hospitals -- Little Company of Mary, Torrance 
Memorial, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Memorial Hospital of Gardena. Only one 
of the injured was identified as a Mobil employee, company officials said; the 
rest are believed to have been contract workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast was not severe enough to cause the evacuation of any nearby 
neighborhoods, officials said. Spokesmen at Mobil reported that there was "no 
off-site impact" from the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District, however, reported that it is 
investigating whether any hydrogen sulfide -- a noxious gas that can cause 
nausea and shortness of breath -- was released from the refinery as a result of 
the explosion, spokesman Bill Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is also studying whether fallout from the explosion might include 
asbestos from pipe insulation. Kelly advised refinery neighbors not to touch 
unknown debris that they might find in their yards and to contact the district 
with questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's explosion was not the first refinery accident to rock the South 
Bay. In October, 1992, an explosion at the Texaco refinery in Wilmington 
injured 16 workers, and 500 nearby residents were evacuated. That blast -- felt 
throughout the Los Angeles Basin -- was blamed on a worn pipe near a hydrogen 
processing unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that same year, in January, an accidental blast of steam at Chevron's 
El Segundo refinery injured 10 contract maintenance workers. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mobil itself has had various accidents at the same plant over the years, 
including two that have long served as grist for a bitter battle between the 
city of Torrance and the oil company over the safety of the Mobil facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, a woman was incinerated when her car stalled at the Mobil plant on 
her way to a concert. When she tried to start her car, a spark ignited fumes 
that had leaked from a tank farm. 
</P>
<P>
 And in November, 1987, an overflow of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid 
precipitated a major explosion and a 15-hour fire that caused $17 million in 
property damage, but no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Torrance sued Mobil after the accident, but the parties reached a 
settlement calling for a safety adviser to monitor the facility. Mobil also 
agreed to phase out the use of hydrofluoric acid by 1997 or come up with a 
substitute by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial accounts of Wednesday's accident left it unclear whether it was caused 
by any of the factors that led to earlier accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrofluoric acid was not involved or released during the blast, Buckalew 
said. Rather, he said, the substance involved was the less dangerous liquid 
hydrocarbon, which was in a line leading into the refinery's alkylation unit, 
where the octane of the gasoline is increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the alkylation unit itself was not involved in the blast, it was shut 
down Wednesday in the wake of the accident because of damage to the feed line, 
officials said.

 Buckalew said it was unclear how the hydrocarbon had escaped the suspect pipe, 
which was one of dozens in a "pipe rack" about 20 feet above the ground in the 
north-central sector of the refinery.

'EVERY TIME, IT HURTS AGAIN'; ISRAEL: NATION REELING AS VICTORIES IN PEACE 
PROCESS ALTERNATE WITH DEADLY ATTACKS FROM OPPONENTS.

 Confronted with the wreckage of Wednesday's horrific bombing attack on a Tel 
Aviv bus, an anguished teen-age girl there screamed at no one in particular, 
"How much can we take?" 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis of every political stripe and from all walks of life were asking much 
the same question Wednesday, wondering how many more emotional shocks they can 
absorb on the increasingly savage road to peace. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 10 days, the nation has been whipsawed between emotional highs and 
lows so drastic as to produce a national feeling of vertigo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an emotional roller coaster," acknowledged Education Minister Amnon 
Rubenstein. He put the bus attack in a unique category of outrage, something so 
devastating, he said, that it "endangers the government's ability to carry on" 
with its process of transferring limited control of the West Bank to the 
Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke after the militant Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an easy battle," Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in a 
late-night news conference Wednesday. ". . . We have to stand in battle, facing 
a terrible enemy: Hamas, Islamic Jihad and parts of the Islamic movement which 
is spread all over the Arab and the Muslim world." 
</P>
<P>
 And President Ezer Weizman, who traveled to the scene shortly after the 
attack, called on his countrymen to stay calm. "I appeal to the citizens of 
Israel to take a deep breath, (to have) a lot of patience and forbearance," 
Weizman said. "These are enemies of peace who try to torpedo things." 
</P>
<P>
 But for many Israelis, forbearance was difficult to contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a moment when people's emotions get control of them," said Yoav Peck, 
an activist with the left-leaning Peace Now movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck, who immigrated here 21 years ago from New York, said he was braced for a 
right-wing backlash not only against Palestinians, but also against Israelis 
who support dealing with the PLO and withdrawing from occupied territory. "My 
car has Peace Now . . . stickers all over it," said Peck, a Jerusalem resident. 
"When I parked in front of my house today, I wondered whether my headlights 
will be smashed, as they have in the past when such incidents occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Magnifying the impact of Wednesday's attack for Israelis was the fact that two 
vicious attacks directly preceded it, plus the knowledge that the organization 
that carried out all three has pledged to stop at nothing in its efforts to 
sink the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas has proved itself both willing and capable of carrying out bold, even 
suicidal, attacks in the past and unflinching in its readiness to hit civilian 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 9, a pair of Islamic militants carried out a rare attack in downtown 
Jerusalem, killing two people and wounding 13 when they opened fire on a street 
crowded with cafes. The attackers, themselves shot dead, were later identified 
as members of the Gaza-based Hamas movement. 
</P>
<P>
 That same night, another group of Hamas militants kidnaped a 19-year-old 
soldier, Nachshon Waxman, as he hitchhiked home to Jerusalem from his army 
base. The nation agonized with Waxman's parents during the week, as they prayed 
and pleaded publicly for their son's safe release. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the Waxman kidnaping ended in tragedy. Waxman was shot dead by his 
captors as an Israeli army unit stormed their West Bank hide-out. An Israeli 
officer leading the raid, Nir Poraz, also was shot dead, and nine other 
soldiers were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The failed rescue attempt was made just hours after Rabin, Foreign Minister 
Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat were awarded this year's Nobel 
Peace Prize. Some Israelis now say that Rabin and Peres should refuse to accept 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Waxman debacle, Rabin and Peres seemed determined to demonstrate to 
the nation that terrorism would not derail their peacemaking efforts. The two 
flew to Jordan on Sunday night and, after all-night negotiations, initialed a 
peace treaty with King Hussein on Monday afternoon. Israelis heard the welcome 
news that an Israeli Embassy may open in Amman just six weeks from now. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news from Amman was augmented Tuesday when Avraham Hamra, the rabbi 
of the Syrian Jewish community, arrived in Israel with his extended family. 
Just days before, the government had revealed that Syria had allowed virtually 
its entire Jewish community to emigrate in the past three years, and had 
tolerated the immigration to Israel of more than 1,000. The release of Syrian 
Jews was interpreted here as a sign that Syria may yet sign a peace treaty with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 So plans were well under way for a gala celebration of the treaty signing, 
scheduled for Oct. 26, when Wednesday's bombing occurred, killing 22 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House said Wednesday that President Clinton still plans to attend 
the signing, to which Israel and Jordan had planned to invite 5,000 guests. But 
the impulse here to celebrate vanished in the flames that leaped from the 
shattered bus on Dizengoff Street on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly has been an emotional yo-yo," said Gerald Steinberg, a military 
analyst at Bar Ilan University's Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies. 
Israelis had no time to recover from the depression the nation felt when Waxman 
was killed, Steinberg said, before the horror of the bus bombing was plastered 
across their television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Rabin is smart, he will make next week's signing ceremony a low-key 
event," Steinberg said. "It is a time for black hats and black coats, not 
celebrations." 
</P>
<P>
 Specialists hasten to underscore that these ups and downs are nothing new to a 
people who rose from the ashes of the Holocaust to build a modern, thriving 
nation despite living in a state of war with most of their neighbors for 46 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been the reality since the founding of the state -- this oscillation 
between stress and lulls," said Prof. Zahava Solomon, head of the Bob Shapell 
School of Social Work at Tel Aviv University. "During the (1991) Gulf War, the 
periods of stress and lull were even closer together than they are right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis cope with it, Solomon said, "because, unfortunately, there is a 
process of habituation in people who live in the shadow of war." Damage done to 
the immediate victims of a terrorist attack, and to those who witness the act 
or who know people involved, may be great and lasting, Solomon said. But the 
rest of the nation is able to pick up the pieces and go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even today, you saw this," Solomon said. "It took a couple of minutes, and 
then people in the surrounding buildings came out to help the survivors. It was 
not a situation of panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Both professional researchers like herself and average Israelis are aware, 
Solomon said, "that in time of terrorist attack, in times of war, Israeli 
society gets very cohesive. I hate to say it, but some good things come out of 
these bad things." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time, it hurts again," said Shmulik Sadan, a 28-year-old personnel 
director at a survey institute who was wounded in Wednesday's bombing. "But if 
we don't make peace, it'll just get worse and worse."

 THUMBS DOWN: Students at Cal State Northridge voted down a proposal this week 
that would have generated $2.25 million to supplement the school's athletic 
program (C1). . . . The decision may have left several teams, including 
football, subject to the budgetary knife and has jeopardized the school's NCAA 
Division I standing. It marked athletics' second such defeat of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 SECURITY: The killings of two elderly Van Nuys women in their homes have 
prompted responses from both government and business. Councilman Joel Wachs on 
Wednesday proposed that the city develop a safety program, and an Arizona 
company is giving 50 alarm systems to people who use the Bernardi Multipurpose 
Senior Center. . . . "Many people will be able to sleep better," says the 
center's Sabella Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 IN COURT: Bail for CSUN football player Jonathan George Beauregard, above, was 
increased Wednesday from $15,000 to $100,000. He's charged with the attempted 
murder of his former girlfriend and her male acquaintance (C6). . . . 
Beauregard was taken away in handcuffs, but CSUN reiterated that he is still a 
member of the football team. 
</P>
<P>
 TAKE A NUMBER: It was another big opening in a town of big openings. But it 
was not a new Hollywood premiere that caused the excitement in Studio City 
Wednesday. It was a local institution -- Art's Deli -- that had been out of 
business since the Jan. 17 quake (B1). . . . In an average week, Art's goes 
through 1,000 pounds of pastrami, 400 pounds of lox and 200 dozen bagels. 
</P>
<P>
 NO CHEERS: There's no joy in Valley sports bars. With no World Series, which 
was to have begun this week, and no pro hockey, many fans stay home. Bryan 
Culbertson, manager at Weber's Place in Reseda, reports a 20% drop in 
attendance. He has 11 TVs, and almost nothing to show. . . . "Thank God for 
college football and Thursday-night games," he said.

BOMB RIPS APART ISRAELI BUS, KILLS 22 IN BOLD TERRORIST ATTACK; MIDEAST:

AND THREATENS TO STRIKE AGAIN. OFFICIALS VOW CRACKDOWN ON PALESTINIAN

 A powerful bomb, apparently placed by Islamic militants opposed to the 
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, blew up a crowded bus during the morning rush 
hour in the heart of Tel Aviv on Wednesday, killing 22 people and wounding 48. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion lifted the bus off the pavement and scattered charred bodies of 
passengers -- many of them dismembered -- up and down Dizengoff Street, turning 
cosmopolitan Tel Aviv's central thoroughfare into a slaughterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "People went flying into the air, arms and legs thrown in different 
directions," said Moshe Reiner, who was walking to work when the blast occurred 
at 8:55 a.m. "It was a very terrible thing. There are no words, really, to 
describe the horror we saw." 
</P>
<P>
 The death toll was the highest in any terrorist attack in Israel in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, said in Amman, Jordan, and in 
telephone calls to local radio stations that it was responsible for the 
bombing, its third and most devastating attack in Israel in two weeks. Hamas 
opposes the year-old peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and has vowed to carry its fight into Israeli cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier statement read at noontime prayers in mosques in the Gaza Strip, 
where Hamas has strong support, the group's military wing known as the Izzidin 
al-Qassam Brigades declared there would be more attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "God will torment them with your hands and the hands of the faithful," the 
Al-Qassam statement said, calling the Tel Aviv bombing revenge for the killing 
of three Hamas members after they kidnaped and subsequently shot dead an 
Israeli soldier last week. Hamas gunmen had earlier killed two people in 
Jerusalem's cafe district. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who cut short a visit to London and convened an 
emergency meeting of his security advisers on his return, vowed to hit back 
hard at Hamas, saying he would seek legislation broadening the powers of 
Israel's security police to hunt down its leaders, detain them without charge 
and use harsher methods in interrogating them. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments by Rabin and other top Israeli officials indicated that a major 
roundup of Hamas supporters was planned for the West Bank, in Arab East 
Jerusalem and, with or without the cooperation of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, 
in the Gaza Strip, where Palestinians have self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ways need to be found so that suiciders, the murderers of Hamas, will know 
that they are not the only ones who can be killed in their operations, but also 
their houses, the houses of their families, could be harmed," Rabin said. 
"Certainly, I cannot find the words to express the pain and anger at the 
murderous attack against innocent civilians in the heart of Tel Aviv by the 
Hamas organization." 
</P>
<P>
 President Ezer Weizman, visiting the injured in Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, 
said the Tel Aviv bombing would "require an unusually harsh reaction -- 
different from what has been done so far." 
</P>
<P>
 "This cannot be allowed to continue," Weizman said. "We will have to catch 
(Hamas members), to tear them apart, to chop them to pieces. This is what I'm 
certain the Israel Defense Forces and the security service will do." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel quickly closed its frontiers with the Gaza Strip and the West Bank on 
Wednesday, barring Palestinians from crossing into Israel to work. And Rabin 
said that, in the long term, "We need a separation between us and the 
Palestinians, not just for days but as a way of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin declared, however, that Israel will continue to pursue peace with the 
Palestinians and its other Arab neighbors -- but demand that they take tougher 
actions against Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the Islamic movements are fighting is not the peace process," an angry 
and exhausted Rabin said, "but the very existence of the state of Israel for 
they see the peace process securing Israel's existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Even victims of the bombing agreed. "The peace process has claimed a heavy 
price, but I think we have to continue with it and not stop," said Shmulik 
Sadan, 28, who was on his way to work and reading his newspaper at the back of 
the bus when the explosion occurred. "Every time, it hurts again. But if we 
don't make peace, it will just get worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat called Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to convey his condolences and 
offer assistance in finding those responsible for the bombing. Other 
Palestinian ministers condemned the bombing as brutal terrorism intended to 
halt the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pushing forward the peace process is a major part of responding to the 
actions of extremists who receive instructions, training and funding from known 
external parties," Arafat said in a statement denouncing the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel contends the PLO has done too little to prevent violence by the Islamic 
groups, and Rabin and Peres said they will make "new demands" of Arafat in his 
ongoing negotiations with Israel to ensure its security. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton denounced the bombing as "an outrage against 
the conscience of the world" and said he will still travel to the Middle East 
next week to witness the signing of a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said in a written statement that the bombing was "aimed at 
destroying the hopes of the Palestinian people as surely as it is directed at 
the people of Israel." He urged other world leaders to condemn the attack and 
"ensure that there is no haven or support for those responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack along a street that for many Israelis symbolizes the good life 
reminded the country of its continued vulnerability to terrorism even as it 
expands its peace agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization and 
prepares to sign a full peace treaty with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a blow that went straight to our heart," Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo 
said. "This terrible catastrophe, and its location, tears us to shreds." 
</P>
<P>
 The bombing was the deadliest attack in Israel since March 11, 1978, when 37 
Israelis died in a series of bus and car hijackings by Arab gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, the Israeli armed forces' chief of staff, 
said a suicide bomber apparently boarded one of the Dan Bus Co.'s No. 5 buses 
with up to 45 pounds of explosives, waited for the bus to fill with passengers 
and then set off the bomb as a second bus drew close in the heart of Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the sudden I heard such a big boom that I thought a plane had 
crashed," said taxi driver Shlomo Ben-Nun, 39, who was about 50 yards ahead of 
the bus when it exploded -- and "escaped with my soul within me." 
</P>
<P>
 The first explosion seemed to be followed by others and by a fireball that 
engulfed the bus, witnesses said. Briefly, there was silence, and then there 
were screams, sobbing and sirens of rescue vehicles. Many people fled in panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers sent to deal with the blast wept at the carnage they saw 
strewn over the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "People flew from the sidewalk, and the head of the driver was completely cut 
off," Eitan Yamini, another witness, said. "I saw immediately that there were 
15, even 20 dead from the bus and the sidewalk. Even a war zone would not look 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Many bodies were in pieces so small that black-coated men from the Hevra 
Kadisha, Israel's burial society, had to pick gently through the wreckage to 
find them. Arms and legs were found on the rooftops of four-story buildings. 
Eight hours were needed to identify just the first six victims, whose bodies 
were largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe a West Bank Islamic militant, Yeyeh Ayyash, known as "The 
Engineer," who has been wanted for two years in connection with other bombings, 
was involved in Wednesday's attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the injured passengers recall a man with dark hair, perhaps in his 
30s, and carrying a big bag who was seated in the fifth row -- the area where 
police experts believe the bomb was -- but nobody regarded him as suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not ruled out the possibility that the bomb may have been planted 
on the bus earlier and set to detonate during rush hour to maximize the number 
of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the Tel Aviv bomb was similar in strength to a Hamas bomb that 
killed five Israelis at Hadera in April; a Hamas suicide bomber killed eight 
Israelis at Afula the same month. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry Israelis called for retaliation against Palestinians and demonstrated 
here and in Jerusalem on Wednesday evening. "Death to the Arabs, death to 
Rabin," they chanted at Zion Square in Jerusalem, where they scuffled with 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Tel Aviv Mayor Milo pleaded for calm in his city. "I understand the cries of 
fury, but we have to say calm," Milo said. "This won't bring anyone back to 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Netanyahu, chairman of the opposition Likud Party, warned that if 
Rabin did not get tougher with the Palestinians he would be "personally 
responsible for a wave of disasters that will follow." 
</P>

Aviv.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CLOSE-UP; TRAVELING WITH THE ENEMY: WILSON AIDE 
TAPE-RECORDS BROWN EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Damian Jones, 24, works for Gov. Pete Wilson. But he spends far less time with 
the Republican governor than he does with Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Stop by most Brown campaign events in the Los Angeles area and you'll find 
Jones standing near the back of the crowd. He aims his tape recorder at the 
state treasurer. And sometimes, Brown aims her words at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a special guest here today," she told the crowd at a recent campaign 
stop in Orange County. "He's at as many of my events as (deputy campaign 
manager) Michael Reese, who travels with me. His name is Damian Jones, and he 
works for Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones waved. The crowd booed. But Brown added warmly, "He's very respectful. I 
have faith that we can turn him." 
</P>
<P>
 If he wore a disguise, Jones might be called a spy. Wilson's campaign prefers 
to call him deputy director for Southern California broadcast media. He is paid 
$2,625 a month to keep the region's radio reporters apprised of Wilson's 
campaign news. Then, in his spare time, Jones gets Brown on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Most voters never see Jones, but he leaves a definite mark on the race for 
governor. Because of him -- and other Wilson campaign workers like him in San 
Diego and the Bay Area -- no Brown comment goes unmatched, no charge 
unanswered. At least not for very long. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sooner after she says something (that) we know about it, the sooner we 
can respond," said Dan Schnur, Wilson's chief campaign spokesman, explaining 
the importance of the information Jones provides to Wilson headquarters in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All politicians keep tabs on their opponents -- reading their direct mail, 
watching their television ads, even researching their backgrounds. But in the 
midst of a campaign, nothing beats following the enemy around. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign has a few high-level employees -- press secretary John 
Whitehurst, for example, and senior adviser for research Michael Rice -- who 
sometimes attend Wilson events throughout the state. After Wilson speaks, these 
people often hold their own news conferences to poke holes in his claims. Other 
times, they attempt to persuade reporters one-on-one, passing out Brown 
campaign materials and offering instant analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, they want reporters to hear Brown's side. At the most, they hope 
to refocus the day's news through a Brown lens, not just rebutting Wilson but 
promoting Brown's alternative. Such is the art of on-the-spot "spinning," and 
when Wilson's campaign wants to do it, they usually unleash the sharp-tongued 
Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
 But a high-level employee can't always be spared to attend every photo 
opportunity. In these instances, the Brown campaign sends no one at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson is a career politician," said Julie Buckner, a Brown spokeswoman. 
"He also gives programmed, controlled responses to reporters' questions. We can 
almost script his answers for him. So there doesn't seem to be a need to listen 
to his every word." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign takes the opposite approach -- shadowing Brown so 
relentlessly that one Brown aide compared it to "stalking." Jones, a 1992 
graduate of Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, never speaks for the Wilson 
campaign. He goes to Brown events to listen. And what he hears is put to 
strategic use. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brown was quoted in the National Journal as saying Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
had changed her position on the death penalty to run for higher office, Jones 
tagged along at one of the state treasurer's campaign events in Hollywood. When 
reporters asked Brown why she had taken such an undeserved poke at her 
Democratic running mate (who in fact had decided to support the death penalty 
many years before she ran for higher office), Jones got her answer on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones immediately called Wilson's Sacramento office and played the tape into 
the phone. From there, Brown's words were transcribed and faxed to reporters 
across the state who had not been at the Hollywood event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping an eye on the enemy can, at times, cause disruptions. Earlier this 
year, Wilson's campaign sent someone to two Brown events armed with a video 
camera. The Brown campaign tried to block him from shooting. And on the 
governor's birthday, a California Democratic Party staffer interrupted a bill 
signing to present Wilson with a crumb cake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of these events, the campaigns agreed upon what one aide called a 
"Geneva accord" under which each is allowed to attend and tape the other's 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is so personable and polite that even as he works against Brown, his 
rapport with her seems to grow. "Damian's playing it safe," joked one person 
who has watched him work. "No matter who's elected governor, he'll have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 After witnessing more than 20 Brown events, Jones -- who hopes to work either 
in government or public relations after the campaign -- does a pretty good 
Brown impression, complete with her favorite jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was up in Eureka the other day and this local newscaster introduced me as 
Kathleen Brown, sister of Jerry Brown and daughter of Willie Brown!" Jones 
said, mimicking the now familiar Brown delivery. (Brown's father is Edmund G. 
(Pat) Brown, the former two-term governor.)

 "She's very nice," Jones added. "She's definitely a very nice lady." 
</P>
<P>
 So has he ever thought about switching allegiances? Jones offers the response 
he gave at the Orange County event: "I held up two fingers, as in the peace 
sign, and said, 'Pete.' "

FRESNO ON BRINK OF A 'LAND WAR' OVER GROWTH; CITIES: DRAFT OF GENERAL PLAN 
ENVISIONS 1 MILLION RESIDENTS, REFLECTING POWER OF BUILDING INDUSTRY. CRITICS 
CONDEMN PROPOSAL THAT WOULD GOBBLE UP WATER AND FARMS, EVEN THE RAISIN CROP.

<P>
 The future of California's heartland was unveiled the other night -- a bold 
blueprint for growth torn right from the pages of postwar Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It envisions a Fresno with 1 million people and paving over 16,000 acres of 
farmland in the next 25 years, raising the possibility of no more raisins in 
Raisin City. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one small hitch: Fresno sits on an aquifer tainted with 
pesticides, a legacy of its farming past. Supplying clean water to new 
suburbanites won't be easy or cheap, especially in a city that is already 
losing tens of millions of dollars each year because of poorly planned growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city is in bad shape," said Joani Johnson, a member of the citizens 
committee offering advice on the general plan. "The costs of water and sewer 
and other services for these million people are going to be astronomical. It 
has the potential to bankrupt us." 
</P>
<P>
 That Fresno would put forward a general plan hostile to its economic health 
speaks to the power of the building industry, critics say. And they came out in 
force Tuesday to lodge their protest at City Hall, dragging along their horses, 
cows and goats to remind politicians of their rural roots. 
</P>
<P>
 They won a victory of sorts when Mayor Jim Patterson conceded that the draft 
plan did not adequately address their concerns and would need to be overhauled 
before moving forward. But in rejecting the draft, Patterson emphasized that 
the basic tenet of growth will not change. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno will continue to gobble up farmland and water as it pursues an 
expansionist path. "This city will continue to move outward," he said in an 
interview. "It has to." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson argues that Fresno, one of the nation's fastest-growing cities with 
400,000 residents, has benefited economically from 15 years of housing and 
commercial boom on its fringe. Even as it faces rising infrastructure costs, 
the city needs to become more builder-friendly, not less, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's own budget figures belie his optimism. Since 1980, according to 
official reports, yearly revenues attributable to new development have risen 
$56 million, while the yearly cost of servicing the growth has gone up $123 
million. In other words, for every dollar that growth brings to Fresno, more 
than $2 are spent to accommodate the growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Building Industry Assn. of the San Joaquin Valley argues that these 
figures do not tell the whole story. In a region where the unemployment rate 
hovers at 14% and 15%, construction jobs are vital. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing is not "another industry to be evaluated strictly on the basis of 
being revenue positive or negative to government," said Jeff Harris of the 
building association. "The building industry . . . employs thousands of 
professionals who are consumers in the local economy." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, more than 200 citizens packed the council chambers carrying 
signs that read "Horses, Not Houses" and "For Once Say No!" One man scanned the 
map of the general plan on display and located his back yard. It was a huge 
high school. Not even the head of the citizens committee who unveiled the draft 
plan downplayed the economic, social and environmental costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be major, major, major impact on the area," said William Patnaude, 
an architect. 
</P>
<P>
 One flaw of the plan, according to Patnaude, was a directive from the City 
Council last year that growth be confined to the northeast and southeast 
sections of the city. The ostensible reason was that the Fresno County Board of 
Supervisors, which has an annexation and tax-sharing agreement with the city, 
mandated such a constraint. 
</P>
<P>
 But others say the real reason growth was pushed into the northeast and 
southeast is that major developers, who happen to be big contributors to the 
mayor and City Council, own or have options to buy vast tracts in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing was stacked in the favor of big developers from the beginning," 
said Ivan Evans, a member of the general plan committee. Evans said more than 
half of the committee came from the building and real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 During two hours of public debate, the specter of a crime- and smog-ridden 
Southern California that only 40 years ago boasted the world's richest farm 
economy was never far away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived in the San Fernando Valley for 28 years before I was forced to leave 
because of uncontrolled, massive growth," said Dennis Clement, a retired Los 
Angeles police officer and firefighter who moved to rural Fresno four years 
ago. "Now it seems that nightmare is about to descend on this valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, northeast Fresno would be annexed and transformed from the 
least urbanized to one of the most urbanized sectors. Planners agree that this 
region between the San Joaquin River and the foothills is one of the most 
environmentally sensitive in the valley. And it has nowhere near the ground 
water or sewage capacity to support the envisioned growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In sending the plan back to the committee, Mayor Patterson said he shared a 
great deal of their concerns. "We are on the verge, on the brink, of what 
amounts to a land war." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson believes that the plan can be modified to the satisfaction of rural 
residents and developers and that the infrastructure costs will not bankrupt 
the city. The head of the plan committee isn't so sure. "There is going to be a 
huge battle on this thing," Patnaude said. "And someone is going to have to 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest loser could be the farm economy. No one is talking about modifying 
plans for paving over thousands of acres of vineyards and orchards in southeast 
Fresno -- land that accounts for $42.2 million in gross revenues. Almost 5,000 
acres of raisin grapes, the last of the crop within city limits, would vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 'The fiscal impact of this plan will be devastating," said Liz Scott-Graham of 
the American Farmland Trust, a nonprofit group that advocates the preservation 
of farmland. "It will destroy the most productive part of the economy -- 
farmland -- and replace it with houses that just take money out."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON CAMPAIGNS IN CRUCIAL SOUTHLAND; 
TRAILING FEINSTEIN IN RECENT POLLS, THE GOP CANDIDATE FOCUSES ON MODERATES AND 
CONSERVATIVES. HE VISITS PASADENA, EL MONTE, COVINA AND CLAREMONT.

 After so many months of campaigning and so many millions spent on television 
ads, U.S. Senate candidate Mike Huffington faced the one impromptu question 
Wednesday that strikes terror in any political underdog: 
</P>
<P>
 "What's your name?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the GOP congressman took this one in stride. After all, it came from a 
3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 The question, posed at the Bundy Scott Child Care Center in Pasadena, opened 
the second day of Huffington's five-day campaign swing through voter-rich 
Southern California -- an area that with the rural Central Valley looms as 
crucial in his Nov. 8 race against Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Focusing on the moderate and conservative voters who must turn out if he is to 
win, Huffington's bus tour pulled out from the Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena before 
stops at a Chamber of Commerce Expo in El Monte, Covina High School and GOP 
headquarters in Claremont. By the time his tour ends Saturday, he will have 
visited GOP strongholds in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to round up votes in Southern California," Huffington said as his 
burgundy-colored bus rolled through El Monte and other areas that since the 
1980s have been known as Reagan Democrat Country. 
</P>
<P>
 With recent polls showing Feinstein with an edge -- KCBS-TV reported Wednesday 
that Feinstein leads Huffington 44% to 35% with the large group of remaining 
voters undecided -- Huffington knows that his only hope of beating Feinstein 
rests on getting the legions of moderates and Republicans to the polls. Toward 
that end he has made three extended trips through the Central Valley and plans 
one more. The current bus tour is his first locally and the longest of his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 His day was carefully constructed around the central themes of his campaign -- 
less government, lower taxes, getting government out of people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 After his visit to the child care center, Huffington was asked whether he 
would join the stand against Proposition 187 taken by former GOP Cabinet 
members Jack F. Kemp and William J. Bennett, the latter a sort of political 
guru for Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released Wednesday, Bennett and Kemp attacked Proposition 187, 
the California initiative that seeks to bar illegal immigrants from receiving 
public services, as an extreme and racially divisive reaction to illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he would take a position on Proposition 187 and other ballot 
measures before Election Day. Asked about his reaction to Bennett's 
denunciation of Proposition 187, Huffington said, "I think everyone should make 
up their own mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about Proposition 187 popped up several times during the day. Before 
addressing civic and business leaders in El Monte, Huffington was pressed again 
and his response, like Feinstein's refusal to take a stand on Proposition 187, 
clearly frustrated South El Monte's Mayor Vera Valdiviez. 
</P>
<P>
 "On this particular issue, (a position) needs to be stated," she told 
reporters. "They are not taking a position that's important to the nation. 
Absolutely, they are ducking it.' 
</P>
<P>
 Later, addressing more than 100 government students at Covina High School, 
Huffington again declined to take a position on the measure when asked about it 
by Genise Eckles, a 17-year-old senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our country was built by immigrants," he told the students. "But I know this, 
our country cannot afford to let everybody come in who wants to come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his day, Huffington seemed relaxed and smoothly shifted gears -- 
and his message -- for each audience. Before the civic and business leaders, he 
spoke about tax cuts and lifting government regulations; to the government 
students, about the importance of education and registering to vote; and when 
he addressed the Covina Colts football team, the rail-thin swimmer and runner 
extolled the virtues of athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 The only glitch in his schedule came during his visit to the day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the event, Huffington's campaign announced that he would read stories 
to the preschoolers from William Bennett's best-selling "Book of Virtues." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he picked "Who Lost a Shoe?" and "The Tiny Seed." 
</P>
<P>
 "It (Bennett's book) was there," Huffington said later, "but they told us the 
kids were too young."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN RAPS WILSON FOR HIS SUPPORT OF PROP. 
187; DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE SAYS THE INITIATIVE ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION WOULD TURN 
SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES 'INTO BIG BROTHER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Before a classroom filled with a multiethnic array of high school students, 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown on Wednesday lashed into Gov. Pete Wilson for 
his support of the anti-illegal immigration Proposition 187, saying that it 
would cost the state money -- not save it -- and turn school administrators and 
other public employees "into Big Brother." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need less government, not more Big Brother government," she said, 
adopting a favorite Republican line. 
</P>
<P>
 As sharply as she has in her campaign to unseat Wilson, the Democratic 
gubernatorial nominee characterized Wilson as a man who has used the issue of 
illegal immigration to his own political advantage. She upbraided Wilson for 
actions he took as a U.S. senator that increased the number of immigrants 
allowed into the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Illegal immigration didn't start overnight," she told students at Pasadena 
High School. "It's been here. And the incumbent governor has got fingerprints 
all over the issue of illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Her remarks came as two noted conservatives broke ranks with Wilson and came 
out against Proposition 187. Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development under President Bush, and William J. Bennett, education secretary 
under President Ronald Reagan, denounced the initiative as "fundamentally 
flawed" and said it could provoke a backlash against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in a campaign appearance in Long Beach, dismissed the objections of 
his Republican peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are two guys who are in Washington and it is very clear that they have 
been there too long," the governor said. "When you spend too much time in an 
ivory tower think tank, you begin to lose touch with reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she believed that the Kemp-Bennett statement would help the 
campaign being waged against the initiative. "It shows that this is an issue 
that cuts across party lines," she said. "These are very conservative 
thinkers." 
</P>
<P>
 As Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur noted, however, it currently is 
support for the proposition that cuts across party lines. A Los Angeles Times 
poll published Saturday noted that while support among Republicans is running 
high -- 75% to 19% -- the measure also leads among Democrats, 52%-40%. 
Independents favor it by a margin of 57% to 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would deny government services to illegal immigrants, and 
would require medical professionals, school administrators and others to report 
those they suspect are in the country without proper papers. It has inspired 
strong emotions on both sides, from supporters who argue that the state is 
going broke trying to pay the bills of illegal immigrants to opponents who say 
it will increase crime, health concerns and incidents of bias against 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's contention that the initiative would cost California money was based 
on the Clinton Administration's threat to withhold $15 billion in funding for 
state schools if Proposition 187 is passed. The initiative apparently would 
violate a Supreme Court decision requiring states to educate illegal immigrant 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford to lose that $15 billion," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spokesman Schnur scoffed at the threat, however. "We don't believe Bill 
Clinton is going to shut down California's public school system the year before 
he is up for reelection because the voters have passed an initiative he doesn't 
agree with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's reference to Wilson's Senate actions was aimed at his support for an 
amendment to a comprehensive immigration reform act. The amendment, as drawn by 
Wilson, would have allowed employers to hire immigrant workers temporarily to 
pick perishable crops. Democrats in the House of Representatives changed it to 
make it easier for the workers to remain in the United States. Wilson said he 
voted for the Democratic version because it was part of the overall immigration 
reform act. 
</P>
<P>
 In her criticism of Wilson, Brown said he acted at the behest of his friends 
and campaign donors in the agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did that when it was politically convenient for him," she said. "He 
received over $600,000 in campaign contributions from his special interest 
friends who wanted cheap labor. So he fought for it then and now in a tough 
reelection campaign he wants to ride this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Wilson, who believes that illegal immigrants are lured to California by 
the promise of government-paid benefits, Brown argues that they are after jobs. 
Thus, she said, she would press for tamper-proof identification cards for all 
Californians seeking employment, and would strengthen sanctions against 
employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In other remarks to the high school students, Brown renewed her criticism of 
Wilson for what she characterized as his failure to apply for a federal grant 
to fund programs that help guide students from school to jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our governor . . . was asleep at the switch, missed the application deadline 
and so California has lost out on getting $43 million this year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spokesman Schnur said Brown was factually wrong. The Wilson 
Administration applied last spring for a Department of Education planning grant 
to help it put together a proposal for the larger grant, he said. Twenty-eight 
other states proceeded the same way, according to Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
 "California hasn't missed anything," he said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; KEMP DEFENDS CRITICISM BEFORE HOSTILE 
AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Former Republican Cabinet Secretary Jack F. Kemp faced an unenthusiastic and 
sometimes angry audience at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace on 
Wednesday as he defended his condemnation of Proposition 187, the illegal 
immigration reform measure on the Nov. 8 state ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first public discussion of his opposition to the initiative, Kemp told 
the audience that he could not, in good conscience, support a measure that 
would "turn teachers and nurses into agents of the INS." 
</P>
<P>
 Plunging into a controversial debate that puts him at odds with the state 
Republican Party -- and, according to recent public opinion polls, a majority 
of the state's voters -- Kemp said the measure feeds an anti-immigrant movement 
that the GOP should oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so bothered in my conscience (about the initiative) that I could not, 
in good conscience, support it, even though I know it will probably pass," said 
Kemp, who is considered a possible presidential candidate in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vote for (Proposition 187). Go ahead and vote for it," Kemp told an Anaheim 
apartment owner who blamed the crime rate on illegal immigrants. "I don't blame 
you at all. . . . Send a signal (to Washington). But don't ask me to defend 
something that's fundamentally flawed. . . . I am speaking from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The former Housing and Urban Development secretary also told the audience not 
to "scapegoat the problems of California on immigrants because they are not the 
source of the problem. The source of the problem is the overtaxation, the 
overregulation, the stupid defense cuts from Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, who was invited to the Nixon library to discuss 1996 presidential 
campaign issues, was grilled by the audience after it was reported that Kemp 
and William J. Bennett, another former Republican Cabinet secretary, had 
prepared a statement strongly opposing the anti-immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In the policy statement, which was released Wednesday, Kemp and Bennett said 
that although they oppose illegal immigration and welfare benefits for illegal 
immigrants, they believe Proposition 187 is unconstitutional and may 
"contribute to a nativist, anti-immigrant climate." Instead, they called for 
more effective border control, reform of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and a crackdown on fraudulent immigration documents while opposing 
national identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the policy statement coincided with Kemp's planned speech in 
Orange County -- the birthplace of Proposition 187 -- and on the same day that 
former President George Bush attended a political fund-raiser for Rep. Robert 
K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Bush did not comment on the measure. Dornan -- despite his support for it -- 
expressed his own reservations and said of Kemp and Bennett: "I absolutely 
respect their opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan conceded that the initiative is flawed and may have an adverse effect 
on schoolchildren. The initiative would require school administrators to report 
children or the parents of children who are suspected of being illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the restaurant where Bush and Dornan appeared, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach) issued a stinging rebuke of Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
 "His act of stupidity has knocked him right out of the presidential race," 
Rohrabacher told reporters. "If he disagreed with it, he should have kept his 
mouth shut. . . . Jack Kemp wants to be loved. The man is using his heart, but 
that's not the organ of the body meant for thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp has campaigned for Gov. Pete Wilson and other GOP candidates on the 
statewide ballot, a point not lost on a man who stood up after Kemp's speech to 
challenge Kemp's immigration statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't you just be quiet?" the audience member asked, prompting laughter 
from the audience. "All you did was boost (Democratic gubernatorial candidate) 
Kathleen Brown and possibly wound your good friend, Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson is not going to lose the election because of Jack Kemp," the 
former Cabinet secretary said, emphasizing his belief that Wilson will win the 
election.

RWANDA SAYS ITS FOREIGN MINISTER STOLE $187,000; AFRICA: GOVERNMENT CLAIMS 
OFFICIAL FLED TO PARIS WITH CASH MEANT FOR ITS U.N. MISSION AND WASHINGTON 
EMBASSY. HE DENIES CHARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Rwandan government denounced Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ndagijimana on 
Wednesday, accusing him of fleeing to Paris with $187,000 needed to pay the 
bills of its embassy in Washington and its U.N. mission in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Although New York police initially had treated the disappearance of 
Ndagijimana earlier this month as a missing-person case, Claude Dusaidi, 
director general of the Rwandan Foreign Ministry, told a news conference at the 
United Nations that the foreign minister had surfaced in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he should be trapped and arrested as a common thief," Dusaidi said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ndagijimana, according to a fax sent in his name to the office of the 
Reuters news agency in Paris, denied that he had stolen anything. He said he 
was in Paris on a private visit approved by Rwandan President Pasteur Bzimungo. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations, he insisted, revealed "the atmosphere of prejudice, suspicion 
and mistrust which currently rules at the heart of the Rwandan government." 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, however," he went on, "that some Rwandan leaders are trying to 
push me toward the exit, given the positions I have adopted on a number of 
fundamental political issues." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dusaidi said that the government in Kigali had asked French and other 
international authorities "to find him and assist (in getting) him back to 
Rwanda . . . so he can deliver back to the government the money with which he 
has been entrusted." 
</P>
<P>
 The case bristles with ethnic overtones. Ndagijimana, a Hutu in a 
Tutsi-dominated government, was the previous regime's ambassador to France. 
That Hutu-dominated regime has been accused of slaughtering more than half a 
million Tutsis earlier this year in an act of genocide that stopped only when 
the Tutsi-led rebel army overran the tiny Central African country. 
</P>
<P>
 Dusaidi, in fact, indirectly blamed the international community for pressuring 
the government to include suspect Hutus as a demonstration of its intent to 
encourage a tolerant, multiethnic society. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are aware of the pressures that the international community has been 
putting on our government to become broader," he told reporters, ". . . and 
bring in elements who come from groups responsible for the genocide of our 
people. . . . We entrusted him (Ndagijimana) with responsibility, despite the 
fact that he was a high member of the former regime that was responsible for 
genocide." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fax sent to Reuters, Ndagijimana said the government was upset because 
he had called for the release of thousands of people jailed for genocide 
without proof as well as for a lifting of a ban on political party activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ndagijimana arrived in New York on Oct. 5 with Bzimungo. According to Dusaidi, 
the foreign minister was carrying the $187,000 in U.S. currency and was 
supposed to turn it over to the diplomats at the U.N. mission on Oct. 8. But, 
said Dusaidi, he never showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Dusaidi told reporters that the money was needed to pay telephone, electricity 
and other bills for the Washington embassy and the U.N. mission. He said no 
money had come from Kigali since July. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign minister carried cash, Dusaidi said, because "our banking system 
is not working." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no bank that is open in Rwanda that is operating," he said. "If that 
was the case, we would have wired the money directly to our account in the 
U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Dusaidi also said that the previous ambassador to Washington had wired $2 
million to bank accounts in Cairo and Nairobi, Kenya, in July before the 
Clinton Administration froze the bank account and expelled him from the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Dusaidi also rejected a report by Amnesty International in London that accused 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front -- the rebel army that ousted the previous 
government -- of killing hundreds and possibly thousands of prisoners and 
unarmed civilians in its onslaught.

<P>
 A drowning giant panda was rescued by villagers from a river in China's 
southwest Sichuan province and has been named after its rescuers, the New China 
News Agency said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodcutters jumped into the Dadu River on Oct. 3 and pulled the struggling 
panda to the bank using ropes and poles after sighting a floating "stump-like 
thing," the agency said.They then warmed up the animal with their own clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The female panda has been named Lulu to honor its rescuers, who are residents 
of Luding County, the agency said, and is on the way to a new home, the 
provincial Chengdu Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Logging, poaching and other incursions into wilderness areas have left only 
1,000 giant pandas alive in the wild.

AMERICAN ALBUM: NEW ENGLAND SKATING COMPLEX BREAKS THE ICE; IN A REGION WHERE 
DEVELOPMENT GETS A COLD SHOULDER, SIMSBURY, CONN., WARMS UP TO THE PROJECT 
AFTER OLYMPIC STARS SIGN ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a region where the word "development" is usually uttered with contempt, 
builder Stephen Fish has found an unlikely ally in Olympic skating superstar 
Oksana Baiul. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the Ukranian-born Baiul and her reputation, Fish has 
persuaded this town's approximately 25,000 citizens to allow him to do what 
under ordinary circumstances would be unthinkable -- build a giant ice-skating 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish is completing construction of the 70,000-square-foot building this week 
with the enthusiastic support of the town fathers, who have offered him a 
two-year tax abatement and more than $300,000 in town-funded improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 A Simsbury resident, Fish was surprised by the ease with which he succeeded in 
defeating the town's vocal, well-organized opponents of development. In recent 
years, he says, their "stiff-shirted New England attitudes" had forced him to 
delay or alter at least three residential projects here. 
</P>
<P>
 In New England, virtually every major development proposal precipitates a 
battle pitting builder against citizens, Fish says. "The developer is 
mistrusted; the homeowner can lie in a heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in the 1670s, Simsbury, like most long-established New England towns, 
recoils whenever it is presented with a proposal for large-scale real estate 
development. As a result, the nearest movie theater and shopping mall are no 
less than 40 minutes away by car. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic hard times have come to this town, brought on by the collapse of 
defense-related manufacturing business and setbacks in the insurance industry, 
headquartered in nearby Hartford. But commercial developers -- even those with 
national clout, such as Walmart -- still have met with nothing but hostility 
from an unswerving population whose primary goal is to preserve the quaint 
character of New England. 
</P>
<P>
 What Fish has learned recently could help other New England developers: Even 
the staunchest of preservationists love celebrities, and particularly an 
Olympic skating champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Simsbury residents are excited that the new facility will be used by Olympic 
skaters such as Baiul and Viktor Petrenko, as well as other skating stars who 
are committed to using the rink for their regular practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic coach Bob Young observes that the feud between skaters Tanya Harding 
and Nancy Kerrigan -- which played out in the newspaper headlines as Fish was 
trying to win support for his new facility -- focused attention on the sport of 
ice skating and helped promote Fish's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good thing for us," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 When development opponents threatened to kill Fish's request to build the 
skating facility at the north end of Simsbury, a record number of residents 
came out for a special town meeting, many of them determined to express their 
support for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the meeting drew such a crowd that fire marshals had to turn people 
away. The ensuing flap caused the board of selectmen to appoint a task force to 
recommend ways to make Simsbury's town-meeting system of government more 
democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 In a subsequent referendum demanded by opponents of the ice-skating facility, 
the town voted, 4 to 1, in favor of the proposal -- an outcome that surprised 
everyone, especially Fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite this outpouring of support, Fish was nervous. He initially decided 
to start small by postponing construction of the skyboxes overlooking the 
Olympic practice rink and the adjacent hockey rink. 
</P>
<P>
 But when more than 2,000 people showed up for the groundbreaking ceremony in 
April -- at which Baiul presided -- he changed his mind and set about building 
the entire facility in 14 weeks, with construction crews working seven days a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 As the building was being completed this week, Simsbury residents were 
swarming about in hopes of getting an opportunity to peek inside the facility 
-- and perhaps catch a glimpse of Baiul, who has taken up residency in Simsbury 
along with Petrenko, their coach, Galina Zmievskaya, and Petrenko's wife, Nina, 
a choreographer for skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Zmievskaya will be director of the singles skating program. Young, a native of 
the area who persuaded Fish to locate the facility in Simsbury because he 
wanted to spend more time with his 80-year-old parents, will serve as 
president, executive director and head of the pairs program. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Olympians scheduled to use the facility for practice on a regular basis 
are Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov. 
</P>
<P>
 Such big names have drawn other potential patrons to the skating facility, 
including several well-regarded Olympic aspirants. And mothers and fathers from 
miles around are bringing their children to sign up for the Learn-to-Skate 
program, hoping to groom their own stars. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, says Young, ice time for the coming season is already completely 
booked. 
</P>
<P>
 Even non-skaters are seeking to come to the facility, just to watch the 
Olympians practice. To satisfy them, Fish is promising that the 1,700 seats 
around the rehearsal rink will be open to the public under certain, as yet 
unspecified, conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish recently agreed to spend $1,390 each for six flag poles that were not in 
the original plan. The poles will be used to fly the flags of Ukraine and the 
native countries of the other stars skating here.

 DEMOCRATIC VISIONS: As Republicans fantasize over just how great their gains 
will be in the November elections, Democrats face a rising tide of nightmare 
scenarios. They can toss and turn thinking about life under Senate Majority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who has been dubbed by some as the Darth Vader of 
American politics, or House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the mastermind of 
slash-and-burn GOP tactics. Imagine loyalists trying to sleep through visions 
of Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman or Alfonse M. 
D'Amato (R-N.Y.) as Banking Committee chairman -- with subpoena power to make 
President Clinton's life even more miserable over the Whitewater matter. As if 
all this isn't enough to give Democrats a fit, they can ponder this: Under the 
Constitution, who would be the second person in line of presidential succession 
behind Clinton and Vice President Al Gore? Try "President Gingrich."

 DRAWING A LINE: The Justice Department this week quietly suggested that there 
are limits to the special interest that Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has shown toward 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. A former Portland, Ore., police 
chief withdrew as a top contender to head the department's community police 
program after a Justice official expressed concern about his support of gays 
and lesbians. Tom Potter, who had marched in uniform in several gay pride 
parades in his city, said a Justice official worried that his involvement could 
hurt Clinton with conservative groups. A department official acknowledged that 
Potter's stance could prove "distracting," and that selection of the head of 
the Cops program, which hopes to help fund 100,000 new community police 
officers in U.S. cities and towns, is still a month away.

 DESPERATION SHOT: As if there were a shortage of national campaign issues, the 
Senate race in Wisconsin has taken a bizarre swerve into the politics of 
professional basketball. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Herbert Kohl is also the 
millionaire owner of the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Assn. His 
opponent, Republican state Rep. Bob Welch, far behind in both money and polls, 
began running a television spot earlier this month making an issue of Kohl's 
negotiations with Glenn (Big Dog) Robinson, who has been holding out while 
seeking a contract reportedly worth $100 million. The point of Welch's ad 
seemed to be that if Kohl were willing to spend that much on a basketball 
player, he would also play fast and loose with taxpayer funds. If that were the 
idea, it backfired. Kohl has refused to agree to such a large contract and has 
been winning applause on the campaign trail when he talks about it.

 BACK TO THE FUTURE: Stung by Clinton's campaign trail warnings that a vote for 
GOP candidates this November will bring back the allegedly dire days of 
Reaganomics, conservatives are striking back. A panel of erstwhile Reaganite 
economists assembled by National Review economics editor Lawrence Kudlow is 
arguing that Clinton's mix of high taxes and belatedly tightened interest rates 
will produce a return to the stagflation that marked the presidency of the last 
Democratic chief executive, Jimmy Carter. Kudlow, economics director for the 
Office and Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, warns that 
inflation will reach 4% to 5% in the next two years and the growth rate will be 
only 1% to 2%, with a possible 20% slump in the stock market.

ENDING IRAQ SANCTIONS NO PANACEA; MIDEAST: CITIZENS BLAME EMBARGO FOR WOES. BUT 
OBSERVERS SAY LIFTING BAN WOULD NOT MEAN SPEEDY IMPROVEMENT IN MOST PEOPLE'S 
LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For four years now, President Saddam Hussein has so successfully fanned the 
flames of hatred against America that Iraqis instinctively blame the U.S.-led 
embargo for virtually everything that goes wrong in their lives -- from a bad 
clutch to the quality of public education to an inability to put enough food on 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
 But even a lifting of sanctions will not improve life appreciably for most 
Iraqis -- at least not for months and perhaps even years, analysts here say. 
After the inevitable euphoria accompanying an eventual end of the embargo 
fades, how will the Iraqis express their frustrations? 
</P>
<P>
 Will their anger rivet on some new, more convenient scapegoat, perhaps closer 
to home? Might that target be Hussein himself? 
</P>
<P>
 Some diplomats have been pondering these questions since the issue of 
sanctions against Iraq was thrust onto center stage by Hussein's recent, 
ominous deployment of his army near the Kuwaiti border, followed by a 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly no one expects an immediate popular uprising when and if the embargo 
ends. But such questions underscore a growing recognition that it will be a 
long haul before most Iraqis can reclaim a lifestyle to which they had once 
grown accustomed, now only a distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hussein's promotion of a lifting of sanctions as a panacea for Iraq's 
worries could come back to haunt him, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not be a very fast recovery," a top Turkish official said here 
Wednesday. "Things will get better only gradually -- perhaps months, maybe a 
year or more." 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Iraq has about $100 billion in debts and far more to pay in war 
reparations. "What will be left (after the debts are paid) will not be very 
much," noted the official. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq intends to pay its debts with proceeds from renewed oil sales, but its 
daily production is down to about 650,000 barrels. Given the deterioration in 
Iraq's oil-industry infrastructure, it is questionable that production levels 
can quickly regain the pre-Gulf War level of 3 million to 8 million barrels a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 It may take months to begin producing even 1 million barrels a day, one 
analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, with new oil entering the market, prices could drop, thus cutting 
into Iraq's oil revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way they can quickly fulfill those promises (of debt payment)," 
the analyst noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers fear things could deteriorate further before they get better -- 
even with an end to sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything here -- the telephone system, electricity, sewage -- has been 
rebuilt, but it's all temporary, mostly done with old and faulty spare parts 
that could collapse any day," said a European diplomat, a Baghdad veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spare parts -- there's very little in any sector now," added a Russian 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 And there have been scattered reports of looting of government food storage 
centers in several parts of Iraq, according to diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is not explosive, but (such incidents) are small signs of how 
awful conditions are," one Western official said. And there are now reports 
that the recent harvests are far less bountiful than official government 
reports say, according to Iraq watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as if preparing Iraq's 18 million citizens for even harsher days 
ahead, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Saleh conceded recently that the next six 
months "definitely will be more difficult for the people. . . . They will sell 
more of their belongings." 
</P>
<P>
 One Arab businessman confided: "Many Iraqi women I know already have sold all 
their jewelry, and I know of families that have even sold their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 There could be a quick post-embargo improvement in supplies of food and 
medicine if Iraqi officials assign both a high priority, observers say. "But 
not if they allocate the funds for other purposes," said a senior diplomat from 
a neighboring country, referring to the current boom in government construction 
of mosques as well as a suspected rearming of the Iraqi military. 
</P>
<P>
 Saleh vehemently denied that Iraq is rearming, but Iraqi officials do not 
dispute the urgent need to improve such basic amenities as water quality and 
sewage treatment. For instance, Baghdad Mayor Qaid Hussein Awadi announced 
Wednesday that Hussein has allocated money to upgrade water purification in 
this teeming metropolis of 7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything will depend on the priorities of the government . . . ," one 
analyst concluded Wednesday. "For perhaps another year, there's no danger of 
mass starvation. The Iraqis are surviving."

BOMBING OF GOVERNMENT OFFICE IN BAGHDAD KILLS 1, WOUNDS 5

 A bomb exploded in a prayer room at Iraq's Ministry of Religious Affairs on 
Wednesday, killing a senior civil servant and seriously injuring five people. 
</P>
<P>
 No one claimed responsibility, and official media reports did not identify any 
specific group. But the official Iraqi news agency INA said the bomb was 
locally made. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraqi television blamed "agents hired by the enemies of Iraq," usually 
considered to be a reference to Kurdish separatists or Iranian-linked Shiite 
Muslim rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Baghdad residents said the explosion, in the northern district of Bab al 
Moaddam, sent plumes of smoke over the city. Streets near the building were 
littered with glass and stained with blood. 
</P>
<P>
 TV images showed the frame of the aluminum ceiling collapsed into the wreckage 
of broken glass and desks. The force of the blast bent ceiling fans and cracked 
concrete walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning explosion was first reported by Shebab (Youth) television, run by 
President Saddam Hussein's son, Uday. INA carried the news hours later and 
named the dead man as Attallah Mohammed Saleh, a director general in the 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil defense sources told the agency that six pounds of dynamite smuggled 
into the building wrecked a prayer section and damaged ministry annexes. 
Earlier reports on Shebab channel said nearby houses were also damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a string of bombings over the last two years as U.N. sanctions 
imposed after Iraq's August, 1990, invasion of Kuwait throttled the country's 
economy. One person was killed and three people were wounded in similar blasts 
in Baghdad in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The last such attack was Aug. 22, when a booby-trapped car exploded outside 
the state-run Al Jumhuriyah newspaper office, causing no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all these attacks have been reported by the official media as the 
government has sought to play down public discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq has accused Iranian government agents of staging previous bombings. 
Wednesday's blast coincided with reports that Iranian troops had attacked an 
anti-Tehran guerrilla base inside Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moujahedeen Khalq, an Iranian opposition group, said Wednesday that 
Iranian troops had attacked the main base of its guerrilla army inside Iraq 
just after midnight. The soldiers fled when the guerrillas returned fire, the 
Moujahedeen said, adding that there were no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack, if confirmed, would be the first Iranian cross-border raid since 
May, 1993.

CHURCH LEADERS HELP HERALD POPE'S NEW BOOK

 The Holy Father won't be doing talk shows or signings, thanks, but nearly 
anybody else here would be pleased to come: The Vatican is wheeling out 
red-robed battalions to ballyhoo publication today of a book of personal 
reflections by Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fascinating, satisfying, moving book," New York Cardinal John J. O'Connor 
told reporters at a special pre-publication briefing here. "It ought to be a 
bestseller," said Archbishop William H. Keeler, president of the National 
Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In content, the book, titled "Crossing the Threshold of Hope," reiterates 
oft-aired papal positions on well-known themes from salvation to abortion. But 
the tone is chatty, one-on-one, intimate -- a learned friend tossing chewy 
ideas across the hearth on a winter's night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps what is new here is a revelation of his own unique approach, touches 
of his mysticism. It is a new approach that offers new insights into the man," 
said O'Connor. Said Keeler: "Reading it is like opening several doors to the 
Holy Father's heart. . . . Every word seems to count." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, keeper of Vatican orthodoxy, journeyed to Milan, 
Italy, on Wednesday to add his praise at a formal presentation of the work, 
being published simultaneously in 35 countries and 21 languages. Curia Cardinal 
Paul Poupard stayed home, where he told Vatican Radio that the book impressed 
him for "its great vivacity." 
</P>
<P>
 Publisher Alfred A. Knopf, which reportedly paid from $6 million to $9 million 
for U.S. rights, says it has shipped more than 1 million copies for sale 
beginning this morning. The jacket price is $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's publication had been timed to coincide with a scheduled papal trip 
to the United Nations and the northeastern United States this week. The trip 
was canceled because of the Pope's slowness in recovering fully from surgery in 
the spring to repair a broken leg.

 "The publisher anticipated enormous immediate sales if he had gone to the 
U.S., but I think it will sell steadily over a long period of time," said 
O'Connor, who, with Keeler and other U.S. bishops, is attending a monthlong 
synod here on religious life. 
</P>
<P>
 A collection of 35 reflections, some first-person, the 50,000-word work was 
prompted by 20 written questions submitted to John Paul last year by Italian 
reporter Vittorio Messori for a television interview. 
</P>
<P>
 That interview never took place, but the Pope was intrigued by the questions 
and began answering them in his spare time, writing longhand in Polish, 
according to papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro, who helped arrange publication 
through Arnoldo Mondadori Editore in Milan. The Pope's proceeds will all go to 
charities of his choosing, Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time a Pope has written something this way for publication 
outside ecclesiastical forms. It's like a private conversation between the Pope 
and the reader," said Navarro, who bounced from the Vatican briefing to the 
Milan presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Issued as the Pope completes the 16th year of his reign, the reflections 
ricochet from the abstract to the concrete: from condemnation of abortion and 
"human tragedies" in which "the woman is the victim of male selfishness" to 
recollections of his boyhood friendship with Jews in Poland. "Anti-Semitism is 
a great sin against humanity," the Pope writes, recalling horrors of the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope quotes the Bible, contemporary philosophers and himself. He has 
publicly visited all of the issues many times before, but the reflections are 
leavened by his reader-friendly style and his personal experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulling the fall of communism, in which he was a major actor, John Paul says 
it is simplistic to imagine that Divine Providence played a role in the 
collapse. "It fell as a consequence of its own mistakes and abuses. It proved 
to be a medicine more dangerous than the disease itself," the Pope says. 
</P>
<P>
 In other reflections, the Pope examines questions such as "Does God exist?" 
"If so, why is He hiding?" and "Is Jesus really the son of God?" He also 
examines Buddhism, Islam and Judaism, finding that they share a "fundamental 
element and a common root."

ARISTIDE BLAMES STREET VIOLENCE ON RIGHT WING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Jean-Bertrand Aristide blamed his right-wing foes Wednesday for 
street violence that has spread fear among Haiti's elite, and he promised a new 
government of the "rich and poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite expectations that he would announce some key government appointments, 
Aristide spoke only in general terms of his plans for an administration 
embracing all Haitian classes and dedicated to reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters at the Presidential Palace for the first time since a 
U.S. Air Force jet brought him back Saturday from three years in exile, he 
accused his opponents of already working to undermine him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a campaign of manipulation aiming to tarnish the image of the 
government," Aristide said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his foes hired armed agents and contracted buses for them to go on 
looting sprees, which have been blamed on Aristide sympathizers. Mobs have 
attacked businesses and homes of people linked to Haiti's repressive army. 
</P>
<P>
 "We oppose all acts of violence and all acts of vengeance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence has increased pressure on Aristide to construct a government 
quickly and put Haitians back in control of Haiti, which has been under virtual 
stewardship of the U.S. military since Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Aristide attempted to lay blame for the violence at the feet of his 
right-wing foes, his supporters appear responsible for at least some of the 
many attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to hundreds of reporters Wednesday inside the palace he has been 
largely holed up in since his arrival, Aristide also talked of plans to 
overhaul existing government services -- from education to criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 And, extending an apparent olive branch to the wealthy, he described a Cabinet 
that will include members of all classes.

U.S. OFFERS NEW GUIDELINES FOR MAMMOGRAM SCREENING; HEALTH: THE FEDERAL 
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP WOMEN FEEL AT EASE WITH BREAST CANCER 
EXAM. RESULTS WITHIN 10 DAYS IS ANOTHER GOAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal health officials Wednesday released new guidelines governing 
mammography screening for breast cancer in an effort to enhance its 
effectiveness and to reduce the anxiety often experienced by women who undergo 
the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 One recommendation, for example, is that mammography facilities ensure that 
women receive the results of their screening within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women never get results or receive them late because of "communications 
breakdowns or confusion as to who will deliver" them, Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala said at a news conference. "Such errors are 
unacceptable" and can cause treatment delays when cancer is present or undue 
worry over what turns out to be a normal reading, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had never been clear whether mammography facilities or referring health 
care providers were responsible for telling women their results. Now it is," 
said Dr. Lawrence W. Bassett, Iris Cantor professor of breast imaging at the 
UCLA School of Medicine, who chaired the panel of experts that compiled the 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines recommend "that facilities notify women of their results, and 
also make sure that they are referred to a primary care provider for follow-up 
if they have come into the facility without one," he said. "Closing the 
communication loop between referring health care providers, women and 
facilities only makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations also strongly urge women to refuse screening by any 
facility that has not been certified by the Food and Drug Administration. Each 
facility should display prominently -- or have available -- an FDA certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Quality standards for mammography were required by a law passed by Congress in 
1992 and the deadline for certification was Oct. 1. Facilities lacking such 
certification are operating illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations do not address how often and at what age women should 
undergo the procedure. In recent years, a debate has erupted over the 
effectiveness of mammograms in reducing the death rate from breast cancer in 
women between the ages of 40 and 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, most medical experts continue to believe that women 40 to 49 
should have the procedure every one to two years and -- since risk increases 
with age -- annually after the age of 50. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines also offer advice to medical workers on ways to be sensitive to 
women who often are nervous about the process. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be an estimated 182,000 new cases of breast cancer in American 
women this year and 46,000 deaths. Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of 
cancer deaths in women. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts have estimated that regular mammograms -- an X-ray that can detect 
tumors years before they can be felt -- could reduce breast cancer deaths by 
one-third. Nevertheless, a majority of American women fail to undergo regular 
screening, according to the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost of a mammogram is $89 but prices can range from $50 for a 
routine "screening" mammogram to $250 for a "diagnostic" mammogram for women 
with symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines, which were released by the Agency for Health Care Policy and 
Research, part of the U.S. Public Health Service, are expected to be widely 
disseminated to health care providers. They are not mandatory but are regarded 
by medical providers as the "standard of care." 
</P>
<P>
 They were praised by a range of medical organizations Wednesday, including the 
American Cancer Society, the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists and the American College of Radiology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have known for some time that the benefits of mammography are compromised 
if women are not screened routinely, if the results of their examinations are 
miscommunicated and if there is poor communication between her health care 
providers," said a cancer society statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inattention to these important details may result in a missed opportunity to 
diagnose and treat her breast cancer early." 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines stress that mammograms are not perfect and that monthly 
self-examination and a physical examination of the breasts by a health 
professional also should be considered part of effective breast cancer 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said that mammograms should only be performed with modern, 
high-quality equipment and with film processors set up specifically for the 
mammography film being used. 
</P>
<P>
 It also said that all personnel performing services -- from the technician who 
takes the picture to the radiologist who reads it -- should be qualified 
through training, experience, certification and licensing.

TEXANS ASSESS FLOOD DAMAGE AS RECORD RAINS EASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIANNE HART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheila Bradley returned home Wednesday to find nearly all of her belongings 
ruined by floodwaters that had surged over the banks of the normally placid 
Simms Bayou. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked hard for so long to make this house something to be proud of, and it 
was all gone in a short time," she said, gesturing toward a heap of wet 
furniture and soggy carpeting on her front lawn in the South Acres section of 
Houston. "But I can't think about that now. Nothing to do but clean up and move 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 As the sun came out in southeastern Texas on Wednesday, the enormity of the 
situation began to set in: At least 10 people had died as three days of 
continuous storms dumped up to 30 inches of rain in some areas, overwhelming 
rivers and waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Bradley and her neighbors -- who were among the more than 12,000 people 
forced to flee -- made tentative steps toward normalcy, officials began to 
assess the damage and provide relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God the rain has abated," Gov. Ann Richards said at news conference 
after flying over flooded areas with Housing and Urban Development Secretary 
Henry G. Cisneros. President Clinton on Tuesday declared 26 Texas counties 
federal disaster areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A Red Cross spokesman said more than 4,000 people have spent time in 53 
shelters in 15 Texas counties, one of the local agency' largest efforts in 
recent years. And hundreds of National Guardsmen were called on to help prevent 
looting and deliver clean water to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said it was too early to tally damage from the flooding, but 
it was believed to be in the tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 A stunned Anthony Runis, 62, was operating on autopilot as he swept the mud 
from his living room in the South Acres subdivision Wednesday. "It's a 
disaster, it's all gone, it's all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 For blocks, lawns were littered with piles of rain-soaked mattresses and 
clothes covered with dreck from the bayou. Much of what people owned sat on 
street corners waiting to be picked up as trash by the city dump trucks that 
cruised the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried when I saw what had happened to the house, but I'm glad it's over and 
we can try to put our lives back together," said Barbara Pick, a 43-year-old 
florist. As she led the way down the waterlogged hallway carpet, the stench of 
bayou water was in the air, and in every room, beds and chairs were piled high 
with clothes, cushions, lamps and radios. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Price, a 40-year-old college administrator, spoke over the whine of a 
machine advertised to vacuum water and disinfect the floor. "These companies 
just come to your door like vultures and charge $600, but at this point, you 
just pay it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of South Acres were luckier than Houstonians to the north, where 
record rainfall and flooding from the San Jacinto and Trinity rivers meant 
recovery would take longer as the waters searched for a place to recede. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorboats were in high demand in north Harris County as residents took trips 
through their subdivisions to see what they could salvage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Forest Cove area near the San Jacinto River, the only evidence of homes 
was the occasional chimney protruding from the high water. Strong currents from 
the river were tearing some of these houses apart, with roofs breaking away or 
entire houses pulled off their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're used to dealing with floods, but this wasn't a flood, it was something 
I've never seen," resident Greg Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Talbot of the Harris County Flood Control District said that most lake 
levels are dropping, but that any more rain on the already-saturated ground 
will only add to residents' troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue operations were ongoing in Liberty County, east of Houston, where 
officials are trying to persuade people to leave the area around the Trinity 
River so as not to be caught by rising water.

U.S. CITED FOR LAXITY AT UC NUCLEAR LABS; CONTRACTS: TWO REPORTS FIND THAT THE 
ENERGY DEPARTMENT IS NOT KEEPING A CLOSE REIN ON SPENDING AT THREE FACILITIES 
MANAGED BY THE UNIVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Energy Department is failing to staunch wasteful spending at nuclear 
weapons laboratories operated by the University of California and is in danger 
of losing control of lab activities, government audits said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the General Accounting Office also said that the Energy Department 
is giving the university $14 million to cover costs that the government would 
not pay under normal circumstances, including potential criminal penalties for 
health and safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), who requested the audit, charged that the 
money amounts to a "slush fund" for penalties and fines. The university is free 
to keep whatever it does not spend. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report, the GAO said the department is losing control of pension 
fund costs at the labs, making unnecessary payments for employee pensions and 
offering employee buyouts with far more generous provisions than federal 
employees receive. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges come as the Energy Department is weighing whether to open 
competition for the prized contract to manage the labs, a job that the 
university has performed without rivalry for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of California is one of the largest Energy Department 
contractors, receiving about $2.5 billion annually to operate the Lawrence 
Livermore, Los Alamos and Lawrence Berkeley national labs. 
</P>
<P>
 UC officials took strong exception to many of the GAO charges, asserting that 
the stewardship of the labs by the school is one of the principal reasons they 
are regarded as world-class scientific organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The labs have greatly improved their management," said Robert Kuckuck, the 
university's special assistant for laboratory administration. "There has been 
an awful lot turned around." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuckuck said that in the last two years, the university has tapped just $6,000 
of the $14 million pool established for costs that the government ordinarily 
does not pay. Under its contract, the university is reimbursed for all of its 
legitimate costs. Rather than a slush fund, Kuckuck characterized the money as 
"a risk management fee." 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Department spokesman Philip Keith said the agency had not seen the GAO 
reports and could not comment on specific charges. But he added that the 
university contract was negotiated during the George Bush Administration before 
reform efforts by the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some things that could be improved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UC stewardship of the labs has come under increasing criticism in recent years 
amid charges that the university lost millions of dollars of government 
property and substantially overcharged the government for its fleet of 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has attempted to clamp down on the department's 
business practices, acknowledging that improving efficiency and contract 
administration is one of the top issues confronting the troubled agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to O'Leary, Dingell praised her reforms but also charged that the 
GAO reports show that the efforts have not yet cleaned up problems with the 
labs' administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department signed a five-year contract in 1992 with the university 
to manage the labs. Since then the department has decided to open to 
competition its multibillion-dollar management contracts at other nuclear 
weapons sites and is considering whether the UC contract should also be subject 
to competition. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision may be reached as early as next year. In his letter, Dingell said 
the decision should be based in large part on the university's willingness to 
correct the problems cited by the GAO. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO issued two reports, one charging that university's fees are 
substantially higher than they should be. The other charges that unnecessary 
pension payments were made for 18,300 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO audit said that many exceptions to the Energy Department's standard 
practices have been made that have weakened the department's "ability to 
effectively oversee the contracts and protect the taxpayer's investment in 
these laboratories." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the exceptions is an agreement that prior notice be given for any 
so-called surprise inspections at the laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 Livermore, located east of San Francisco, and Los Alamos in New Mexico are the 
nation's design centers for nuclear work. Lawrence Berkeley lab in Berkeley 
does research unrelated to nuclear weapons.

IN NASDAQ PRICING, WHAT YOU SEE MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU GET

 Readers of newspaper stock tables have reason to be confused about the cost of 
trading in Nasdaq stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 4, Nasdaq stock tables began listing daily closing prices in 
increments as small as 32nds and 64ths of a point.Investors may have gotten the 
impression that spreads suddenly had narrowed to such small fractions. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, on Nasdaq stocks that sell for $10 or more per share, the smallest 
possible spread remains an eighth. Nasdaq's trading computers are programmed so 
that they won't even allow market makers to enter bid and asked prices in 
smaller increments, although there are plans to change this, NASD President 
Joseph Hardiman says 
</P>
<P>
 The fractions in the stock tables instead reflect actual trades at the end of 
the day -- not the prices market makers quote and most small investors pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Big customers, such as mutual funds and other institutions, long have been 
able to negotiate better prices inside the quoted spreads. But until April, if 
an institution bought a stock at, say, 20 1/32, Nasdaq computers rounded the 
price to the nearest eighth for reporting in newspaper stock tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Nasdaq no longer rounds off those numbers. So while the reporting of 
actual trades on Nasdaq is more accurate, the change has had no effect on the 
spreads or on the prices most small investors pay to buy Nasdaq stocks. SCOT J.

WALL STREET IS SOLD ON OVER-THE-COUNTER PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One reason for Nasdaq's explosive growth is that over-the-counter trading is 
extremely profitable for Wall Street firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The big spreads on stock trades bring in millions of dollars in trading 
profits; indeed, most big securities houses make more from Nasdaq trading than 
from New York Stock Exchange stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 And brokers benefit. At big, mainstream brokerage houses they typically get to 
keep about 40% of the commission on sales of Nasdaq stocks, versus about 30% on 
NYSE trades. (The rest goes to the brokerage firm.) In addition, on Nasdaq 
stocks, brokers also often get large, hidden commissions that don't show up on 
the confirmation slips sent to customers after each trade. These undisclosed 
payouts are called "sales credits." 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, the firm's trading desk shares profits with the brokers -- either 
as an inducement for them to sell stock if the firm is holding a large, 
unwanted position in its inventory, or simply to promote activity in a stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who represent small investors charge that this creates a major 
conflict of interest: Brokers whose firms offer them big, hidden sales credits 
to sell a particular stock have a strong motivation to tout these stocks to 
customers. The customers have no way of knowing that the broker's enthusiasm 
for the stock has nothing to do with a belief that its price will go up. (This 
can't happen with stocks listed on the NYSE and other exchanges because trading 
and reporting rules prevent it.) 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which owns and operates Nasdaq, 
defends the practice of not disclosing these sales credits to customers. It 
says they are not commissions, but a brokerage firm's decision on how to divide 
up trading profits internally. SCOT J. PALTROW

CLINTON IN N.Y. TO BOOST CUOMO'S SAGGING FORTUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton traded political compliments with New York Gov. Mario M. 
Cuomo Wednesday, basking in praise from one prominent Democrat who isn't shying 
from an election-year presidential embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is this a race? Why is it even close?" Clinton asked at a dinner that 
raised $2.5 million for Cuomo's difficult reelection effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton called Cuomo "a national treasure" and said that he would win in "a 
rout" if New Yorkers based their votes on Cuomo's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo, lagging in New York polls as Clinton is nationally, suggested that 
neither he nor Clinton gets proper credit for their accomplishments from 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to figure out why, after 12 years, all they remember is my baggy 
eyes," the three-term governor joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton brought with him two well-received announcements for New York state. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, he pledged to work to alter federal law to increase the federal 
Medicaid contribution to New York, saying the current formula "is unfair to 
you, and I think we should change it." The formula rewards poor states and 
penalizes richer ones. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he was granting New York a federal waiver that will give the 
state more flexibility in its welfare program. People who work could still 
qualify for welfare payments under certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why all the things this President has done have not been noted 
by the American public," Cuomo told an afternoon conference nominally held to 
discuss the state's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be that he has not spent enough time dwelling on each of them as they 
occurred. I really don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo is facing a tough reelection challenge from Republican George E. Pataki. 
While some Democratic incumbents have tried to put distance between themselves 
and Clinton, Cuomo has not. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent poll by the New York Times and WCBS-TV showed that 55% of surveyed 
New Yorkers approved of Clinton's performance, while only 45% approved of the 
job Cuomo was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a negativism, a divisiveness in the air," Cuomo told the evening 
fund-raiser in a mid-town Manhattan hotel. "There is a kind of fear, a concern, 
an anxiety among Americans. And there are people who will pander to it and use 
it politically." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is "showing us that the way is up," Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President returned the praise in kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've still got it, Mario," Clinton said to rousing applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire your governor so much, I like him so much, I feel that he is my real 
partner. I think that he has given you strong and disciplined and responsible 
leadership. And he is still filled with new ideas and energy," Clinton said.

SEAFOOD IS JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED; NUTRITION: STUDY SAYS FOR THE MOST 
PART RESTAURANTS SERVING FISH AND OTHER OCEAN FARE GET HIGH MARKS. 
</P>

 At long last, praise! 
</P>
<P>
 The nutrition activists who scared many people away from Mexican, Chinese and 
Italian restaurants and denounced the high saturated-fat content of movie 
theater popcorn are back again. But this time the message is strikingly upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 A nutritional analysis performed by the Washington-based Center for Science in 
the Public Interest and released Wednesday shows that the nation's seafood 
restaurants, for the most part, are serving up healthy fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found more healthy, low-fat and delicious choices available at seafood 
restaurants than at any other restaurants we've seen," said Jayne Hurley, the 
group's senior nutritionist. "Bake it, broil it, blacken it, grill it -- as 
long as you don't fry it, seafood is a great catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the nutritional value of the other restaurants the center studied, 
menus in seafood establishments offer an array of low-fat choices, more options 
for healthier side dishes and sodium levels which -- although high -- were far 
below the "stratospheric levels" found in Chinese, Italian and Mexican 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The nutrition center is a consumer advocacy and education organization founded 
in 1971 that specializes in food and nutrition issues. It promotes healthful 
eating through diets that are low in saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar, salt 
and processed foods. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has drawn the wrath of some nutritionists and food industry 
officials who complain that, in a quest for media attention, it has exaggerated 
the dangers of certain foods that are virtually harmless if eaten in 
moderation. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the study, the National Fisheries Institute, a seafood trade 
organization that represents 1,000 companies, including restaurants, emphasized 
that seafood restaurants offer numerous preparation options for individuals 
concerned about their diets. But the institute added: "Fried items, including 
fried seafood, can be enjoyed in moderation along with a balanced and sensible 
diet over the course of several meals or several days." 
</P>
<P>
 Diets high in saturated fats have proved to be -- or are suspected of being -- 
associated with numerous serious or life-threatening medical conditions, 
including heart disease, obesity and certain kinds of cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 The center began studying restaurants a year ago because "more than 40% of the 
American food dollar is spent outside the home, yet consumers have little idea 
what they are eating when dining out in a restaurant," the center said. 
</P>
<P>
 It offered kudos to those restaurants and movie theaters that have made 
positive changes in the year since its reports began coming out. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jacobson, the center's executive director, singled out Chi-Chi's, the 
Mexican restaurant chain, for introducing a new menu nationwide that 
prominently features several lower-fat meals and appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the chain now offers to prepare any entree on its menu with reduced-fat 
cheeses, he said. "Chi-Chi's is to be congratulated," Jacobson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, after the center's April report condemning the coconut oil used in movie 
theater popcorn, only one of the 10 largest theater chains still uses it, and 
that chain -- United Artists -- offers air-popped popcorn as an alternative, 
Jacobson said. 
</P>
<P>
 For its seafood study, the organization purchased 14 of the most popular 
seafood dishes at 32 mid-priced restaurants in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, 
Seattle and Washington, including the nation's largest seafood chain, Red 
Lobster, as well as smaller regional chains and independents. 
</P>
<P>
 Each sample was individually dissected and its components weighed. Then 
composite samples of each dish were sent to an independent testing laboratory 
for nutritional analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said that baked, broiled, blackened, grilled or steamed seafood -- 
including flounder, cod, haddock, sole, shrimp, scallops, crabs and clams -- 
were the best nutritional picks. A seafood meal with a baked potato topped with 
a tablespoon of sour cream, a salad with a tablespoon of low calorie dressing 
and two dinner rolls with half a pat of butter on each, averaged 723 calories 
with 18 grams of fat, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all seafood meals are created equal: A fried seafood combination 
platter, served with tartar sauce, french fries, cole slaw and buttered 
biscuits, contained 2,178 calories and a whopping 130 grams of fat, about as 
much fat as a person should consume in two full days, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fried seafood combo (is) almost as bad as fettuccine alfredo, the infamous 
heart attack on a plate, and the most unhealthful entree CSPI has ever 
analyzed," the group said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group criticized the Red Lobster chain for frying fish in a highly 
hydrogenated solid shortening rather than in true oil. The shortening, which 
comes in solid block form, contains high levels of trans fats that act like 
saturated fat in increasing cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturated fats are turned into cholesterol by the body. Hurley said that this 
type of shortening "is worse than lard for consumers' hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Monroe, a spokesman for the restaurant chain, said that "whether the 
vegetable oil used at Red Lobster is more healthful in a solid versus liquid 
form has been the subject of discussion among nutritionists, dietitians and 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that "we strive to satisfy the needs of both the health-conscious 
diner and the one who enjoys an occasional indulgence. At Red Lobster, our 
guests choose what they want and how they want it prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson said that individuals who carefully monitor their cholesterol intake 
should avoid shrimp -- and choose scallops instead. An average order of shrimp 
has between 100 and 150 milligrams of cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 But "if you're not watching your cholesterol, that isn't a terrible amount," 
he said.

STINGINESS PROVES TOO MUCH FOR CANDIDATE MCCLINTOCK'S 'SKINFLINT' ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom McClintock, the underfinanced Republican candidate for state controller, 
takes the prize for the most offbeat political ads so far in the fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Tightest skinflint around, his radio ads declare, to the accordion strains of 
"Scotland the Brave" and a narrator speaking in a thick Scottish burr."He's 
tighter than a bullfrog's behind," boasts "Angus McClintock" of his "cousin" 
Tom. "And that, my friends, is watertight." 
</P>
<P>
 In another ad: "Tighter than a rusty lid on a pickle jar." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republican candidate has a problem, in part brought on by his very 
thriftiness. Most big-city radio stations are rejecting McClintock's radio ads 
-- not because of the unorthodox content, but because the stations can charge 
higher rates for nonpolitical advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Snow, the campaign's advertising purchaser, said that only four 
broadcasters in the vast Los Angeles radio market agreed to sell time to 
McClintock, including news station KNX. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock and Kathleen Connell, his Democratic opponent, were almost dead 
even among likely voters in the latest Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Ramirez, spokesman for the Connell campaign, dismissed the effect of 
McClintock's ads. "The voters are going to vote on who has the best 
qualifications, not who has the best gimmick," he said.

L.A. COUNCIL OKS FUNDING PLAN TO RENOVATE 2 DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council signed off Wednesday on a state agency's funding 
plan for renovations of drug treatment facilities in Venice and Lake View 
Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal tax law required the council to approve issuance of $10 million in 
tax-exempt certificates of participation by the California Statewide 
Communities Development Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators of Phoenix House, a national drug treatment program for 
teen-agers, will spend the money on refinancing debt and repairs to centers in 
Venice and Lake View Terrace, as well as one in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents in Lake View Terrace had opposed the opening of the Phoenix 
House boarding school in their neighborhood. But two leaders of the homeowners 
association spoke in favor of the financing package Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an agreement with homeowners, Phoenix House administrators promised not to 
use the funding proceeds to acquire more land or to expand the school beyond 
its previously licensed enrollment of 150 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix House, based in New York, operates 15 residential treatment centers in 
California and on the East Coast.

NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS KILLED BY GUNS INCREASES 32% SINCE '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of people killed by guns in California increased by more than 30% 
between 1989 and 1993, a rate slightly higher than the national average over 
the same period, according to a new state study. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the human toll is great and well-documented, the study says gun 
violence is costing state taxpayers more than $18 billion a year, directly and 
indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, released Tuesday, estimates that California employees and 
businesses directly lost close to $4 billion last year in worker productivity, 
defined as the skills and efforts of slain and injured workers, because of gun 
violence. There were 47,888 gunshot victims in California last year and 5,000 
of them died. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was done by the California Research Bureau, a nonpartisan policy 
research group of the California State Library. The report, Firearm Related 
Violence in California: Incidence and Economic Costs, was commissioned by the 
Assembly Committee on Gun Violence and its chairman, Louis Caldera (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 "Gun violence incidents in California are reaching epidemic proportions. 
Firearm homicide will soon overtake auto fatalities as the leading cause of 
death by injury in California," Caldera said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will not propose a handgun ban that would face daunting political 
opposition but instead wants to work toward goals such as curtailing sales of 
cheap handguns and forcing more gun owners to keep guns locked up. An Assembly 
panel he chairs has scheduled hearings, the first of which will convene at 9:30 
a.m. today at the Los Angeles Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Firearm-related murders increased 32% in California between 1989 and 1993. The 
pace surpassed the increasing national average over the same period by 4 
percentage points. All other types of murders in California decreased slightly 
between 1989 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs cited by the report included $1 billion to provide medical care to 
gunshot victims in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80% of the direct medical expenses to treat gunshot victims, nearly 
$900 million, was passed on to California taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to lost worker productivity, there was a $225-million loss to 
California's economy because of the decrease in Japanese tourism after the 
recent killings of Japanese nationals in California, according to the study.

PILOT SAYS HE WASN'T WARNED OF U.S. COPTERS

 An Air Force pilot who shot down a U.S. helicopter over Iraq testified 
Wednesday that a radar plane gave no warning that two American copters were in 
the no-fly zone established after the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Eric Wickson testified under immunity at a hearing for three AWACS radar 
plane crew members charged with dereliction of duty.He said they had the craft 
on radar but did not identify them. 
</P>
<P>
 Wickson also said the helicopter he downed was not broadcasting a code 
identifying it as friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six people were killed April 14 when the two helicopters were shot 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Wickson said he thought the copters were Iraqi Hinds. Maj. Lawrence Tracey, 
Capt. Jim Wang and 2nd Lt. Ricky Wilson were monitoring the zone when the 
copters were downed.

D.A. UNVEILS PLAN TO STREAMLINE MANAGEMENT STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury unveiled a plan Wednesday that 
would streamline his management staff but give several top officials hefty pay 
raises. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said the consolidation plan, to be considered next week by the Board 
of Supervisors, shaves $330,000 from his budget and allows him to better manage 
his 600 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only will this make us more efficient . . . but it will save the county 
money," the district attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current management structure is a relic from the days when the 
prosecutor's office employed two dozen people, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been operating with a kind of horse-and-buggy operational structure," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, Bradbury would be assisted by a single top aide -- instead 
of the two he has now -- and by five other senior-level executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these people would get raises. Chief deputy Kevin J. McGee, for 
instance, would receive a raise of about $7,000, pushing his salary as high as 
$96,000. At least four others would get substantial, but undisclosed, increases 
as they are promoted. Bradbury refused to name those who would get raises, or 
to reveal their salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said the office would still save money because five other positions 
would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 He compared the consolidations to similar reorganizations of the Sheriff's 
Department and the courts administrative staff within the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 As when such changes were implemented by the courts, other local officials 
applauded. But the president of one lawyer group criticized the raises it would 
bring to the handful of administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing could not be worse as far as office morale among the troops is 
concerned," said Douglas W. Daily, president of the county's public defender's 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we see the upper echelon sort of distance themselves and getting pay 
raises, it makes us feel that once again the county is rewarding managers and 
at the same time the people who actually run the cases in the courtroom are 
being pushed down," Daily added. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury's announcement follows a recent controversy over how public lawyers 
are paid in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, county officials revoked merit raises to 25 junior-level public 
defenders and deputy prosecutors, essentially saying the county is in bad 
financial shape and cannot afford to give them raises for last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys in both the prosecutor's and the public defender's offices have 
commissioned a study comparing their salaries with those of colleagues 
statewide. The lawyers contend they are being paid about 20% less than other 
public attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president of the local district attorney's association, however, said 
he is happy to see Bradbury proposing raises for his top managers. Kevin G. 
DeNoce said he just wishes the county would reward line prosecutors with a 
similar pay hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Most prosecutors now earn between $32,000 and $69,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is demoralizing the prosecutors in this office," DeNoce said. "The 
way the Board of Supervisors has allowed the personnel office to handle 
salaries is totally incompetent." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vickie Howard said she will support Bradbury's reorganization 
because it saves money, even with the five pay raises. "I'm very much in favor 
of cutting government whenever we can do so," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 She declined to comment on complaints by line prosecutors and public defenders 
until she sees the results of the parity study, expected to be completed by the 
end of next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman also said he supports the raises Bradbury 
is handing out, though he said he would like the Board of Supervisors to allow 
him to give raises to his two top assistants as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five positions Bradbury would cut, one is now held by Assistant Dist. 
Atty. Colleen Toy White, who has been elected to the Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Bradbury said his office is adding two powerful computers that will make 
crime-fighting easier, because they will allow his office to better link up 
with other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are two systems that will take us into the 21st Century in good shape," 
Bradbury said.

CONTRACTOR BLAMES TRANSIT OFFICIALS FOR SOIL SINKAGE; SUBWAY: HEAD OF TUNNELING 
FIRM SAYS MTA FAILED TO REQUIRE GROUTING THAT MIGHT HAVE STABILIZED THE GROUND 
IN HOLLYWOOD. AGENCY CHIEF WHITE DECLINES COMMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN and RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under attack for problems in the construction of subway tunnels along 
Hollywood Boulevard, the president of the firm responsible for the work is 
blaming transit officials for their failure to require more extensive grouting. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President John F. Shea, in a letter this week to board members of the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said that project officials 
"consciously" decided not to require grouting that might have stabilized the 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea also contended that the failure of wooden wedges used for bracing of the 
initial tunnel shell did not cause but resulted from the ground sinkages of up 
to nine inches in Hollywood. Earlier engineering analyses concluded that the 
failure of the wedges contributed to the sinkages. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea's letter marks the first time that the contractor has publicly defended 
the tunneling work, performed by a joint venture of his and two other 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 His letter also comes as MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White says 
that he is considering terminating the contracts of both the tunneling 
contractor and the transit authority's inspection-management firm, 
Parsons-Dillingham. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Parsons-Dillingham have alleged that the tunneling 
contractor deliberately concealed deficient work from inspectors. They said the 
work involved the placement of improper filler material -- instead of required 
high-strength concrete -- around the wood bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the tunneling in Hollywood and earlier problems, the Clinton 
Administration on Oct. 5 announced a suspension of $1.6 billion in future 
federal funding for subway expansion. The funding will be unfrozen, federal 
officials said, when the MTA demonstrates that it can competently manage subway 
construction. The tunneling has been shut down since Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea, citing provisions of the firm's tunneling contract, has declined to 
discuss any of the work with the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 White, asked Wednesday about Shea's letter, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the growing disagreements over responsibility for the sinkage is 
who -- contractors, taxpayers or both -- will pay for tunnel repairs and damage 
claims from property owners. The total costs are not yet known, but are 
expected to climb to at least the tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea, in his letter, cited two types of grouting that he said were not 
required by transit officials: 
</P>
<P>
 One kind is called compaction grouting, whereby a cement-based material is 
injected from street level. The material, of peanut-butter consistency, has 
been used to stabilize soil under which a tunnel-boring machine has passed or 
is about to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The second procedure referred to by Shea in his letter is hemical grouting, 
the injection of watery grout through pipes from within the tunnel into soil 
ahead of the boring machine. It is designed to coagulate fine soils that 
otherwise might pour into a tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Both types of grouting add to the tunneling cost because of the labor and 
materials involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Not mentioned in Shea's letter was another procedure intended to prevent 
ground settlement, called contact grouting. This calls for pumping cement-based 
grout from within the tunnel to eliminate air voids between the structure's 
concrete segments and the surrounding earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported on Sept. 11 that MTA officials did not enforce a contract 
specification requiring the joint venture of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny to perform 
contact grouting along Vermont Avenue and part of Hollywood Boulevard. 
Inspection reports show that even after the MTA began enforcing the 
specification, the contractor did not contact grout more than 340 linear feet 
of tunnel in the area where the ground sinkages are now apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shea, in his letter: 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision to exclude compaction and/or chemical grouting in this critical 
area on Hollywood Boulevard was consciously made by the" MTA and its 
design-engineering and inspection-management consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 "These procedures are normally specified in urban tunneling to mitigate damage 
to property," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To buttress his position, Shea attached to his letter a page from a soils 
report circulated by the transit agency in 1991 to prospective bidders. The 
document advised contractors: 
</P>
<P>
 "While chemical grout could be used to control settlement, it would be very 
expensive and probably not worth the expense relative to the cost of any 
repairs" to damage inflicted on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials have said that they, in consultation with the contractors, 
considered and rejected performing compaction or chemical grouting as of late 
July, when they found that Hollywood Boulevard already had sunk by four inches. 
The officials allowed more tunneling in the area, and the boulevard sank an 
additional five inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to questions posed by The Times, the head of the MTA's design 
engineering group, Parsons Brinckerhoff Chairman Martin Rubin, gave this 
explanation last month: 
</P>
<P>
 "In late July and early August, sections of Hollywood Boulevard had settled 
beyond that which was anticipated. Compaction, chemical . . . and other forms 
of grouting were considered by the MTA, its consultants and contractors. . . . 
It was determined that grouting would not significantly reduce settlements." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin did not specify whether the "contractors" he referred to included 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny and he could not be reached for elaboration. John Adams, the 
MTA's interim director of rail construction, said he could not comment.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; FORMER POLICE CHIEF AMONG 
AWARD FINALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may seem odd that on the list of nominees for this year's Fernando Award -- 
given annually to a volunteer in recognition of a lifetime of community service 
-- is a man who was paid to serve as Los Angeles police chief and then state 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he did so much above and beyond the job he was hired to do," said Lee 
Alpert, an Encino lawyer and Fernando Award board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpert said that although he doesn't favor any of this year's five finalists 
for the award, he says Ed Davis is worthy of being on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed was sometimes a very controversial guy. You either hated him or you loved 
him," said Alpert. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpert said he first met the formidable former police chief as a young lawyer 
when he accidentally stumbled into the wrong room at Parker Center and found 
himself facing a room full of police brass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Son, may I help you? I think you have the wrong room," Davis said to Alpert. 
In that moment, Alpert said he saw the kind firmness of the man who was chief 
from 1970 to 1979 and he later grew to admire and respect him. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, branded as ultra-conservative by his critics, showed himself to be a 
moderate Republican during his years in the Legislature representing the Santa 
Clarita and western San Fernando valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 As police chief, Davis based his programs on the British Bobbie system, which 
dates to 1829, and started community policing through his "basic car plan" (in 
which car units regularly patrol given areas), team policing and Neighborhood 
Watch programs. Alpert remembers that Davis, who then lived in Chatsworth, did 
not just set the policy but would go out to the neighborhoods of the Devonshire 
Division to help set up watch programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was natural for me to pay particular attention to the people in the San 
Fernando Valley who didn't feel they had been given full attention from 
Downtown city government," said Davis, 77. Despite his move to Morro Bay after 
his retirement from the Legislature, Davis said he keeps in close touch with 
the Valley, which was his home for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 While growing up in a working-class neighborhood in Downtown Los Angeles, 
Davis said he learned community responsibility from his mother. Davis was named 
police commander of the Valley in 1960 and moved to Chatsworth in 1964. He 
later was named honorary mayor of Chatsworth and became involved in a variety 
of community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has attended many ceremonies for the Fernando Award -- now in its 36th 
year -- and said he was impressed with the recognition for a lifetime of 
service. "I didn't ask for it and didn't dream it could be attained," Davis 
said of his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year's winner of the Fernando Award is given a statuette of a Native 
American, chosen because of the strong sense of community it represents, said 
Fred Thomas, the 1988 winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The award is presented each year to those people who have done the most for 
the entire San Fernando Valley, not just a particular community," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The award was created as a way to inspire others to dedicate their lives to 
community service, Alpert said.  
</P>
<P>
 The winners often find their lives are not quite the same, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a week that goes by that there is not a former winner of the 
Fernando Award speaking somewhere," said Thomas, who appears before high school 
and other youth groups in an attempt to instill in them the same values he 
holds dear. "You have even more responsibility than you had prior to receiving 
the award." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley chambers of commerce and past Fernando Award recipients nominate and 
vote for the winner, who will be named at a dinner Nov. 4. Other finalists are 
attorney Benjamin Reznik, car dealer Terry York and businessmen Clyde Porter 
and Kenneth L. Banks Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Last in a series on the five nominees for the 1994 Fernando Award, appearing 
in Personal Best, a weekly profile of an ordinary person who does extraordinary 
things. Please address prospective candidates to Personal Best, Los Angeles 
Times, 20000 Prairie St., Chatsworth, 91311. Or fax them to (818) 772-3338 .

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; WISE POLITICAL RETREAT BY CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, one of the largest churches in the country, has 
done the right thing in retreating from plans to sponsor a controversial 
"voter's guide" for campaigns for school board, city council and other local 
races in Orange County. In the process, it has defused a proposed challenge to 
its tax-exempt status, which would have forced the issue on church involvement 
in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, wisely, the church hierarchy has decided to stay out of sponsorship of 
the survey, leaving it to parents and volunteers to disseminate any candidates' 
responses to a questionnaire. At least for now objections have abated. 
</P>
<P>
 While it lasted, the controversy was instructive. The original stated 
intention of publishing candidates' responses to a series of pointed questions 
on moral issues was said to be informational only, but some candidates 
understandably were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of closed-ended questions on such volatile and complicated questions 
as abortion left no room for explanation or nuance, and essentially backed 
candidates into a corner or put them in the position of refusing to cooperate.  
</P>
<P>
 The implication surely was going to be that if candidates had answered the 
"wrong way," or refused to take part, they might be considered objectionable 
for voters who were looking to the church for guidance on how to vote. That 
could make a difference when a big church makes a big mailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Church members are entitled to their own political views, of course, and like 
any group in American life they have a legitimate interest in finding out 
whether political candidates share their values and opinions. Church activism 
is an essential part of American history and the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 However, while churches have a clear interest in justice and social welfare, 
they violate Internal Revenue Service rules if they engage in political action 
and they risk loss of tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience is a reminder too that voters, while bombarded with various 
messages suggesting how to vote, have a responsibility as individuals in a 
democracy to make informed judgments on their own.

FLIP-FLOP FOR UNLV, GRGURICH; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: DEAL IS STRUCK WITH FORMER 
RUNNIN' REBEL ASSISTANT BUT LATER DISINTEGRATES. ATHLETIC DIRECTOR WEAVER 
RESIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ongoing soap opera that is Nevada Las Vegas basketball took another 
bizarre turn Wednesday as the school started the day with someone who thought 
he was the new coach but ended with neither a coach nor an athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, Tim Grgurich, a former assistant to coach Jerry 
Tarkanian, had agreed to take the job in the morning, but by day's end the only 
thing clear was that Jim Weaver, the school's athletic director, had resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver and UNLV interim President Kenny Guinn met Wednesday night in Guinn's 
office to continue discussions about the hiring of Grgurich. But when Weaver 
emerged from Guinn's office, he called a quick news conference to announce that 
he was leaving UNLV but would stay in his job until Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The move underscores the chaotic state the campus has been in since school 
officials began the procedure to force out unpopular Coach Rollie Massimino 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said that Weaver, the athletic director since 1991-92, resigned 
because he did not want to recommend Grgurich for the job, and because of 
pressure he has felt from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver was said to be worried that Grgurich's link with the former regime 
would plunge UNLV back into the turmoil it experienced with the NCAA under 
Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA recently declined to prosecute Grgurich for alleged violations during 
his tenure as an assistant at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to Grgurich said the coach and Weaver did not get along. There 
was said to be distrust between the two because of Grgurich's longtime 
association with Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, though, Weaver said he is resigning to help mend the rift in Las 
Vegas still lingering from the feud between Tarkanian and former UNLV president 
Robert Maxson, who holds the same position at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe I have been tagged as a person who is part of the old," said 
Weaver, formerly the associate athletic director at Florida. "I want to be the 
last person to go. I want this community to start to heal. I want this 
university to start to heal." 
</P>
<P>
 But Weaver has been on the hot seat for his role in negotiating a lucrative 
and controversial supplemental contract with Massimino. Several regents have 
expressed anger over Weaver's handling of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinn said UNLV will try to hire an interim coach for the upcoming season as 
soon as possible, leaving the hiring of a permanent coach until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich was believed to be Guinn's top choice, but sources said he, too, was 
not willing to recommend Grgurich to the Board of Regents because of 
reservations he still has about Grgurich's ties to Tarkanian. Grgurich, whose 
wife and children still reside in Las Vegas, left the negotiations this morning 
believing he had a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the negotiations said Grgurich told Guinn he would accept the 
school's offer during a meeting Wednesday morning. That meeting occurred only 
moments before Guinn attended an ad hoc Nevada Board of Regents meeting to 
approve the almost $1.9- million buyout of Massimino's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinn was expected to also announce an agreement had been reached with 
Grgurich. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Guinn said the sides had reached an impasse in negotiations and that 
UNLV mighthave to seek additional candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich flew to San Diego, where the SuperSonics were playing the Lakers in 
an exhibition game, to discuss the situation with team officials. He met with 
UNLV players twice before leaving town to inform them he was their new coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich flew back to Las Vegas late Wednesday night to inform the players the 
deal had fallen apart and to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 A school source said players plan to meet with Guinn today to demand Grgurich 
be namedcoach.

DUCK DEFENSEMAN SEEKS SOME RELIEF; HOCKEY: MCSWEEN FILES UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM 
THAT WOULD PAY MAXIMUM BENEFIT OF $230 A WEEK FOR 26 WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mighty Duck defenseman Don McSween has filed an unemployment claim, becoming 
the first NHL player known to take advantage of California law that makes 
locked-out employees eligible for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 McSween, whose claim is pending, was a career minor leaguer who earned 
$30,000-$50,000 a year before making about $100,000 with the Ducks last season. 
The team rewarded him with a contract that was to pay him $300,000 this season. 
If his claim is approved, McSween would be eligible for the maximum benefit of 
$230 a week for up to 26 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that much, but more or less it makes a statement. For a guy like me, 
any little bit helps," said McSween, 30, a married father of two who doesn't 
own a home and drives an Oldsmobile. "I've played mostly in the minors, almost 
entirely until last year. I really don't have a million dollars in the bank by 
any means." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck officials received notice of McSween's claim and verified the last day of 
his employment, stating the reason he is not working as an "owner's lockout," 
said Andy Roundtree, vice president for finance and administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me," Duck President Tony Tavares said. "I think he's well 
within his legal rights to do it. I guess some people might be annoyed with it. 
But we pay in based on our payroll. He's within his rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Union chief Bob Goodenow was unaware of McSween's filing, but said, "He's a 
career minor leaguer who has a family and trained all summer. Now, in the face 
of an owners' lockout, far be it for me to suggest what a player should do." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow also said there is an emergency fund available to players. 
</P>
<P>
 McSween won an NHL job while on a stint filling in for injured players in 
Anaheim last season. He played in 32 games and earned easily the most of his 
seven-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say it goes all year, the worst-case scenario; it would hurt, and cancel most 
of whatever I saved last year," he said. "I'd obviously have to find work. But 
I've got an engineering degree and my wife has a teaching degree. It might be 
hard to get hired if you tell them if the season's ready to start, I've got to 
quit. But we live a simple life. We don't spend a lot. We have no reason to go 
out and buy new cars. Our cars are in good shape. We're not used to making a 
lot of money. It wouldn't hurt us that much. We'd do OK." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings and Ducks announced ticket-refund and exchange policies for games 
that are postponed or canceled by the lockout, joining the San Jose Sharks as 
the first teams to issue policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Though no games have been officially canceled, the league is expected to 
announce some cancellations this week. A league spokesman also said the 
reconfigured schedule will not extend the playoffs beyond the end of June 
because of potential problems with maintaining adequate ice surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several options for fans who purchased individual game tickets for 
the Kings or Ducks -- holding the tickets to see if games are rescheduled, 
exchanging the tickets for future home games this season at the point of 
purchase or receiving a refund for actual games missed. Returns and refunds are 
available only after the date of the scheduled game. 
</P>
<P>
 For King season ticket-holders or purchasers of mini-plans, there are three 
choices. For those who wish to maintain their priority position, the team will 
provide a 6% interest payment as incentive, including a guarantee that prices 
for their seats will be not be raised next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, instead of a refund, subscribers have the option of receiving "Kings 
Dollars" equal to 10% of the total value of their package, as games are 
canceled or missed. "Kings Dollars" can be redeemed for future King games, 
other Forum events or Forum concessions, or be used at any of the Slap Shop 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The final choice is a refund for all canceled games in their season package. 
However, no refunds will be made until all of the games in the first segment -- 
home games 1-10 -- are missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck season ticket-holders or mini-plan purchasers can receive a credit toward 
tickets for potential playoff games or season tickets or mini-plans for next 
season, and can also receive a discount of 5% of the amount credited toward the 
purchase of playoff tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with ticket packages who want refunds may request reimbursement on a 
monthly basis as games are postponed or canceled.

JIM MURRAY: CONNORS SCOFFS AT BURNOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Scott Connors, master mechanic, peered across the net to check the 
problem at hand. It was like a plumber probing a leak. 
</P>
<P>
 Across from him was Johan Kriek. Now, as leaks go, Kriek is not major. The 
carpeting is safe. Connors has always been able to dam up the Johan Krieks, 
usually in the quarterfinals or earlier in the bigger tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem here is, our master mechanic Connors is 42. In some sports, that's 
past prime time. In tennis, it's slippers and hot water bottle time. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you're Jimmy Connors. Jimmy's contract with life had no provision for 
getting old. Jimmy doesn't intend to get old. He might get winded earlier in 
the match, but there are ways of getting around that. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriek is eight years younger than Connors. A minor hurdle. Kriek is also 10 
pounds overweight. Jimmy has never been overweight in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy sizes up the situation. An adjustment here, a poke there, a wrench at 
the right time and Kriek will be all plugged up. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy wound up, contorted his body like a guy aiming a slingshot at the moon 
-- and hit maybe his 2 millionth serve. Or, maybe his 20 millionth. Who's 
counting? Jimmy has been serving tennis balls since he was old enough to stand. 
Other babies got rattles. Jimmy got rackets. Jimmy won his first tennis set 
before he was able to count that high. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a strange career. Jimmy was born in East St. Louis, and for those 
who have never been there, it is to modern society what Dodge City or Tombstone 
was to the Old West. Jimmy had a better chance of being a gangster than a 
tennis player. "That's why my mother got a racket in my hands," he says now. 
She was afraid that if she didn't, a machine gun would be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy's career was probably 50% talent and 50% determination. So he made a 
habit of beating guys whose ratio was 90-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy didn't have a 130-m.p.h. serve. He wasn't especially fast. But he always 
hit the ball hard and usually someplace you just left. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, you couldn't get the ball past him. Sometimes, when you thought you 
had, and the ball appeared safely behind him, Connors would somehow get a 
racket on it behind his back. It was almost as if he had two rackets. And it 
didn't matter whether the ball came on a big serve or a changeup lob, Jimmy hit 
it back to your feet. It was very discouraging. Jimmy was like Joe DiMaggio. 
When the ball came down, he was there. You couldn't smuggle a volley past him. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, Connors was mean. Tennis is a courtly game -- but not the way 
Jimmy plays it. Jimmy challenged the whole environment. Linesmen, referees in 
the chair, even the crowd, were targeted by Jimmy. He was the original brat on 
the tennis circuit. Jimmy never added the grace note. He just beat you. You got 
a problem with that? Go see the chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the guys Jimmy didn't pamper was Jimmy. Tennis players are getting as 
fragile as violets. If they don't have a physical infirmity, they invent a 
mental one. The trouble is, you can't perform arthroscopic surgery on the 
brain. Ennui is incurable. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors never got "burnout." He was always afraid someone would take him off 
the court, never mind his saving them the trouble. Jimmy plans to take a bagful 
of rackets to the pearly gates and start looking for a linesman to criticize. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy won two Wimbledon titles and was runner-up four times -- to Bjorn Borg 
twice, to Arthur Ashe and John McEnroe. He won five U.S. Open titles and was 
runner-up twice. He won 116 singles titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors never let the game get away from him. No long withdrawals, no trips to 
places where they never heard of a let, no weeks in contemplation. Jimmy was 
usually on a court or on a plane on the way to one.  
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy played from such an early age that he had to grip the racket with two 
hands on every shot. The racket was almost as heavy as he was. So, when he got 
to UCLA, he still used both hands on the backhand. The purists were 
consternated. Two-handed backhands were for girls, or juniors, not Wimbledon 
finalists, they said. Jimmy did what he usually did: He proved them wrong. No 
one tells Jimmy Connors how to grip a tennis racket. It's like telling 
Rockefeller how to count. 
</P>
<P>
 He had the peripheral vision of a goldfish. "I can see behind me," he says, 
smiling. His eyes, like Ted Williams', are better than 20/20. They dart 
sideways, upward, downward -- like a fox zeroing in on a chicken. They have 
almost no whites showing. They are the eyes of a man not to be messed with. 
</P>
<P>
 So he played last week at Sherwood Country Club in the Digital PC Champions 
tournament, a 10-stop senior tour invented by Connors himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He sized up Kriek. He checked the lines crew to see whom he could profitably 
intimidate. He checked the flags for wind, the court for bounce, then he turned 
his attention to Kriek. He won in straight sets, not overwhelmingly, merely 
convincingly, 7-5, 7-5. He let Kriek beat himself, then he moved in to mop up. 
The next day, he won the tournament, defeating Jose-Luis Clerc, 7-5, 5-7, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 It was vintage Connors. Connors on court is Casey at the bat, Horowitz at the 
piano, Olivier at the Old Vic. Arnold Palmer was born to play golf; Connors was 
born to play tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 What's his secret? "Tenacity," Connors says. "The edge I had was minute, but 
minute is enough if you use it right. I was never greedy and I never had fear. 
I just got the shot back if it was a great shot, I didn't try to fashion a 
winner out of it -- and I had no fear. I played the same when I was behind, 
4-6, 4-6, as I did when I was ahead, 6-4, 6-4. I never figured a game was over 
'til I heard those terrible words, 'Game, set and match!' Right up 'til then, I 
figured it was up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks burnout is for fire departments to worry about, not athletes. As far 
as aging is concerned, Jimmy treats it like any other opponent with a faulty 
backhand or weak second serve. He might not even have to argue the line calls.

BRUSCHI SWARMS TO THE OCCASION; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: DEFENSIVE END COMES UP BIG AS 
LEADER OF VAUNTED ARIZONA DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can have your technology. Bob Jellison will take common sense and give you 
a few Tedy Bruschi stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "In his senior season, in the first round of the playoffs, we were playing 
Cordova and were down, 18-14, in the last few minutes," said Jellison, who 
coached Bruschi at Roseville High, just outside Sacramento. "We go down and 
score, and we put Tedy at the point of attack on every play." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruschi, who has picked up a few stories of his own as the leader of Arizona's 
Desert Swarm defense, remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the quarterback called '47 power' or whatever, and it called for the left 
tackle to pull, I'd tell him, 'let's switch,' and I would play tackle," Bruschi 
said. "Then I would play guard, or wherever the play was run." 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 plays and 80 yards, he played up and down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, the other coach said, 'I knew what you were doing, but what the 
hell could I do about it?' " Jellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the story is not complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, when we scored, there were about 30 seconds left, so they had time to 
come back," Jellison said. "One of our cornerbacks fell asleep on a play, and 
they completed a long pass and lined up for a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tedy blocked it." 
</P>
<P>
 The stories linger. They were often told in 1990 to recruiters who dismissed 
them as high school lore when they looked at a 6-foot-1 lineman who didn't fit 
their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Wildcat assistant) Mark Lunsford said, 'I can't believe that everybody's not 
here. You just don't see a guy that plays like this,' " Jellison said. "There 
were a lot of people to look and they were interested, but they said, 'Well, 
he's only 6-1, and he's only 240 and. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sarcasm is mixed with disgust when Jellison remembers Bruschi's senior season. 
Jellison thought America's colleges would beat a path to his door. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the old computer game," Jellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was 6 feet 1. Computers tell most of those colleges to look for 6-4, 6-5, 
6-6 defensive linemen. That way, if they can get a 6-6, 275-pound guy who runs 
4.7 or 4.6 (in the 40-yard dash) and the guy doesn't pan out, they can tell the 
alumni, 'Well, look, he had all the tools.' If you take a chance on a 6-1 guy 
and he doesn't pan out, it's harder to explain." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody has to explain Bruschi, Arizona's defensive end and spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
 He is happy to explain himself. Bruschi likes to talk almost as much as he 
likes to hit quarterbacks -- and he likes to hit quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruschi led the Pac-10 in sacks last season with 19 1/2. He played alongside 
Outland Trophy winner Rob Waldrop, who faced blockers from every direction in 
his senior season, freeing up Bruschi to roam. Now Bruschi has the reputation 
and gets the attention, and Chuck Osborne, who replaced Waldrop, leads Arizona 
with seven sacks. Bruschi has six. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing you do when you come up to the line is to find out where he 
is," said UCLA center Mike Flanagan, who has been looking at Bruschi since 
their high school days. They will meet again Saturday in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he moves from side to side on the defensive line, Bruschi isn't hard to 
find. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has that look in his eyes that says, 'I'm crazy,' " Flanagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also says that he's a player on a mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark Lunsford, the guy who recruited me here, and Larry Lewis, the guy from 
Washington State who recruited me, those guys looked beyond the height and 
weight and saw what I was doing on the field," Bruschi said. "You've got to 
have people like that in your program. If you just recruit for numbers, a 
defense like ours is going to come along and we're going to put your numbers in 
the dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 That, Arizona has done. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats are eighth in the nation in total defense, fourth in rushing and 
scoring defense and regard all of those numbers as a sign of a down season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are offended when people score against us," Bruschi said. 
</P>
<P>
 They are second in the Pac-10 in all three categories, behind Washington 
State, which they defeated, 10-7, last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruschi made six tackles, one of them a sack of Chad Davis, while facing 
double-team blocking all day long. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand (Waldrop's) situation," Bruschi said. "Guys were focusing on 
Rob last year, and he took the pressure on like a champ. He realized what he 
had to do and played his role and let the other guys have their time in the 
sun. I'm not saying I'm getting less numbers because they're putting more guys 
on me. I'm not making excuses. I'm saying I want to win, and if it takes my 
getting fewer numbers for us to win, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are not that far down. Bruschi has eight tackles for losses 
totaling 55 yards, has recovered two fumbles and blocked a Georgia Tech 
field-goal attempt in the Wildcats' opener. He has 29 1/2 sacks in 31 college 
games and has tackled opposing players for losses totaling 296 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruschi had a sack in 15 consecutive games, the streak being blown by 
wishbone-running Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those sacks came against UCLA last season, and one caused a Wayne Cook 
fumble that Arizona recovered. The Wildcats scored on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 Another came in the Fiesta Bowl, when Arizona built the momentum that it took 
into this season by beating Miami, 29-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruschi, a communications major, naturally, was the defensive MVP in the 
Fiesta and waxed loquacious at game's end. His comments have lingered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I've been known to throw some one-liners at the press that they 
really caught on to," he said, laughing. "After the Fiesta Bowl, they were 
telling me good job, and I said the Desert Swarm will be back for more in '94." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's sports publicists recognized a good thing. "Desert Swarm will be 
back for more in '94" is on a poster, near the telephone in a Tucson apartment 
Bruschi shares with two teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rings a lot. Bruschi is a reporter's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I just have fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That, and the crazy look he affects in games, have given him a reputation as 
something of a wild child. Long hair and a 255-pound body dwarfing his 
motorcycle add to the effect, particularly when his girlfriend, Arizona 
volleyball player Heidi Bomberger, is riding, too.  
</P>
<P>
 He dismisses it all as perception. The motorcycle is a way to beat the 
university's parking system. "I get the best spots in town," he said. "Drive it 
right up to the classroom door." Besides, he has a car now. "My brother got it 
for me," he said. "It's a '67 Buick, a sporty one." 
</P>
<P>
 And the talk? It's mainly inspiration, aimed at teammates, Bruschi said. "I 
don't taunt the opposition. Well, there is talking, but that's just part of the 
game. I don't talk to the point where people say that guy needs to shut up. If 
something needs to be said, I'll say it. I'd rather lead by example." 
</P>
<P>
 He has done that at Arizona, where he's getting the last word about the things 
that kept him from being a hot commodity in the recruiting class of 1990.

NO PASSING FAD; LAKER FLOOR LEADER VAN EXEL IS ROUNDING OUT HIS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The light summer reading soon developed into a heavy burden, so Nick Van Exel 
decided to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Change. 
</P>
<P>
 He would change the way he played point guard for the Lakers. His choice, but 
with other people prodding. 
</P>
<P>
 The prodders included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- New Coach Del Harris, who prides himself on a history of very good 
relationships with previous point guards, including Mike Dunleavy and John 
Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Assistant coach Larry Drew, who has become a mentor to Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, apparently, most of all, the writers who took note of his propensity 
for shooting, of the fact that he had 154 more attempts than any other Laker 
despite a success rate of only 39.4% and more three-point tries than any four 
teammates combined. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the summer, I read a lot about how I would be a good player if I was more 
like a true point guard and passed more," he said. "I took that and used it in 
thesummer. Pass first, shoot second." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Van Exel's improved play has been one of the most obvious and 
discussed aspects of Laker training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed a big difference," said Drew, a former NBA point guard. "As a 
matter of fact, I see him turning down some good shots. I see a more mature 
Nick Van Exel. Knowing that his scoring opportunities will come, he likes to 
get the other guys involved in the offense first. He knows now that is his 
responsibility. He's grown up, big time. For one thing, I don't see him getting 
as frustrated when things don't go well. Or I see him becoming more vocal. I 
see him becoming more of a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Executive Vice President Jerry West: "Looking at him, you'd think it was 
someone who had played four or five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, this is Van Exel's second season since West and the Lakers took him 
as the 37th pick in what became the steal of the 1993 draft.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati guard, whose goal while playing junior college ball in Texas 
was simply to play at a big-time school so he could get on TV once or twice, 
was named second-team all-rookie and ranked second among all first-year players 
in assists behind Anfernee Hardaway of Orlando and sixth in scoring (13.6). 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the off-season.  
</P>
<P>
 He read the stories that emphasized erratic, streaky shooting -- he twice had 
six three-pointers in a game, a team regular-season record, but went three of 
16 from behind the line on the last day of the season in a failed attempt to 
break Dennis Scott's all-time NBA rookie mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories mentioned the assist-to-turnover ratio of 3.2-1, commendable for a 
first-year player on a team trying to run, as an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed a new five-year contract, which should bring a greater sense of 
security. He watched the playoffs and took particular note of John Stockton and 
how the Utah Jazz superstar, despite leading all guards in shooting during the 
regular season, looked to pass first. Haywoode Workman of the Indiana Pacers 
left the same impression. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel dedicated himself to becoming the prototype point guard. He wanted to 
play like Stockton, not merely against him. Instead of attempting to break a 
shooting record, he will try to average between eight and 10 assists, after 
finishing at 5.8 as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I played good in spurts," Van Exel said. "I learned a lot from 
that. From the first preseason game this year, I came in with 100% more 
confidence. It's all about confidence for me. When you have that, it's all 
about ability when you're out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Harris hears about Van Exel's strides since the end of last season and 
nods in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done a nice job running the team," said Harris, who spent hours watching 
his new point guard on tape after being named Laker coach in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell by his body language and all, he is much more comfortable with 
the ball. I think he knows now he can score any time, but it's good to see him 
look to pass more."

NEWSWIRE: STEWART COULD BE FREE AGENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pitcher Dave Stewart will not be offered salary arbitration by the Toronto 
Blue Jays, making him eligible for free agency, the team announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 37, had hinted at retirement. But the right-hander has recanted and 
suggested he is interested in staying with the Blue Jays or playing in Japan. 
Former Angel Dick Schofield also became eligible for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels decided not to risk losing designated hitter Chili Davis to free 
agency, offering him arbitration and guaranteeing he will remain an Angel for 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry was offered salary arbitration by the San Francisco Giants. 
. . . The rebuilding Boston Red Sox allowed four high-priced veterans -- Andre 
Dawson, Frank Viola, Joe Hesketh and Tom Brunansky -- to become eligible for 
free agency by declining to offer them salary arbitration. . . . The Houston 
Astros chose not to offer arbitration to outfielders Kevin Bass and Milt 
Thompson. . . . The Pittsburgh Pirates said they will not attempt to sign 
center fielder Andy Van Slyke for next season. . . . Bob Hamelin of the Kansas 
City Royals, formerly of UCLA, easily won the American League rookie of the 
year award, becoming the first designated hitter to do so. Hamelin batted .282 
with 24 home runs and 65 runs batted in. . . . Joe Paparella, an American 
League umpire for 22 years who retired in 1968, died in Sebastian, Fla. He was 
85. Jurisprudence 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan George Beauregard, 22, the Cal State Northridge offensive lineman 
charged with two counts of attempted murder, received a dramatic bail increase. 
San Bernardino Municipal Court Judge Ronald M. Christianson raised it from 
$15,000 to $100,000. Beauregard was led from the courtroom in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, C. David Rossen, former racing director of King President Bruce 
McNall's thoroughbred racing operations, pleaded guilty to one count of wire 
fraud, entering his plea before U.S. District Judge Richard Paez. Rossen, 39, 
could face a maximum prison term of five years, up to $250,000 in fines, three 
years of supervised release and the possibility of making restitution. 
Sentencing is Feb. 22.

 Unregistered sports agent Steve Endicott was arrested and sentenced to one 
year's probation and fined $3,000 for trying to sign several Florida State 
football players as clients, said university officials in Tallahassee, Fla.

NO BASEBALL TALKS PLANNED AFTER PLAYERS, MANAGEMENT MEET 
</P>

 Striking major league baseball players met with club owners Wednesday for the 
first negotiations involving newly appointed federal mediator William Usery but 
recessed without scheduling further talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have very strong feelings and very strong views," Usery said after the 
session, which lasted less than two hours."I still believe there is a way to 
resolve this through collective bargaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Usery, a former secretary of labor, said that he will talk with each side in 
the next few days before arranging another negotiating session. He said that it 
is not certain where the next meeting will take place.  
</P>
<P>
 By appointing Usery last week, the Clinton Administration made its most 
aggressive move to try to end the strike, which now might threaten the start of 
the 1995 season. President Clinton made a personal statement about the dispute 
Wednesday, wearing a shirt that read "Play Ball" on his morning jog. "I would 
call it a preliminary meeting," Donald Fehr, head of the players' union, said 
after the session. "There was not a discussion of substance, by design." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, the owners' negotiator, said he is optimistic that a 
settlement can be reached. "We are committed to the collective bargaining 
process," he said. "This is the right process and the right mediator." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's talks took place behind closed doors at a private Washington club. 
The session was the fifth between player and owner representatives since the 
strike began Aug. 12. It was the first meeting since Sept. 9.

FORMER ORIOLE MANAGER OATES HIRED BY RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Baltimore Oriole manager Johnny Oates was hired Wednesday to manage the 
Texas Rangers, the first step of a transformation that has the Rangers looking 
more like the Orioles of old. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates was given a two-year contract; its terms were not disclosed.He replaces 
Kevin Kennedy, who was fired by General Manager Doug Melvin last week and then 
beat out Oates for the Boston job. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this ballclub needed was a manager that had experience and also had a 
winning percentage of managing in the big leagues. The man to my right here, 
Johnny Oates, brings both of those qualities to the ballclub," Melvin said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Oates: "It's a wonderful opportunity for my family and myself. I can't 
wait to get started." 
</P>
<P>
 Oates, 48, becomes the fourth Ranger manager in 29 months and the 14th 
full-time manager in club history. He is the first with previous major league 
experience since Darrell Johnson served as interim manager for Don Zimmer at 
the end of the 1982 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates was fired as Oriole manager in September after Baltimore finished second 
in the American League East with a 63-49 record. The Orioles' record during 
their last three seasons under Oates was 237-199.

and friends this week, sat out practice because of a sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Young, who grew up in Carthage, Miss., said he hopes to play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going home to play and I don't want to miss this one," said Young, who 
picked up the $1,600 tab for the tickets. "The least my family and friends can 
do now that I've bought the tickets is put up a sign for me." T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; WILLIAMS WILL START AT TAILBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders will make lineup changes at tailback and offensive tackle Sunday 
against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Harvey Williams will start over Tyrone Montgomery after gaining 72 
yards in 16 carries against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised because I came here to be a starter anyway," said Williams, 
who leads the team with 227 yards rushing. "Tyrone is a very talented back 
who's done well. But the bottom line is that we have to start winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell said of Williams: "The more he plays and sees the ball, the 
better he becomes. We've decided to just go ahead and start the game with him." 
</P>
<P>
 With left tackle Gerald Perry sidelined for at least five games because of a 
broken bone in his ankle, nine-year veteran Robert Jenkins will take his place. 
Jenkins, formerly of the Rams, signed as a free agent before the season and has 
played in six games this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a while since I started at left tackle," said Jenkins, who started 
at right tackle for the Rams last season. "Of course, I would have liked to 
have played more and been more seasoned for this task, but I have a whole week 
of practice to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 The final move for the Raiders was the insertion of Greg Skrepenak, a former 
No. 1 pick from Michigan, at right tackle in place of Bruce Wilkerson, who did 
not play well against the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to give Skrepenak his chance to play," Shell said. "It's not as if 
he can't play left tackle, but I just think that he's a pure right tackle." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Skrepenak's first start in his three-year career after being 
inactive throughout last season and playing only a backup role as a rookie in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after the blowup between quarterback Jeff Hostetler and the Raider 
coaching staff over the team's play-calling, Shell refused to discuss the 
matter with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff will have the same leeway that he's had before," Shell said. "But that 
thing is over with. You can keep probing all you want, but it's over with as 
far as I'm concerned." LONNIE WHITE

 Shawn Walters' 234-yard game at Stanford boosted him to third in Pac-10 
rushing statistics. Washington's Napoleon Kaufman leads with 167 yards per 
game, followed by Arizona's Ontiwaun Carter (124) and Walters (119).Wide

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; OVERHAUSER PUT TO TEST ON SATURDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 College is a Monday-through-Friday experience for most students, but Chad 
Overhauser has been spending his Saturdays in class. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWayne Patterson taught one session.This week's will come from Professor Tedy 
Bruschi. 
</P>
<P>
 Overhauser, a redshirt freshman, has started at right tackle since Paul 
Kennedy suffered a season-ending knee injury in the second game against 
Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
 Grades have varied. "What I have learned is that most of the people I'm 
blocking are 22 or 23, and I'm 19," said Overhauser, who has the size, at 6 
feet 6, 290 pounds, but not the maturity to handle many of the Pacific 10 
Conference's best pass rushers. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, of Washington State, showed him that when he had four sacks. "I got 
a lesson real quick in that one," Overhauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bruschi, Arizona's pass-rushing defensive end and sack specialist, 
Overhauser will face another of the Pac-10's best, but at least it will be a 
familiar face. The two played against each other in high school in the 
Sacramento area. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 UCLA medical personnel have decided that All-American wide receiver J.J. 
Stokes does not need another MRI test, though there has been fluid buildup in 
his injured left leg. He has been practicing pass patterns with the offense for 
the first time in four weeks. Stokes suffered a thigh bruise in the season's 
first game, against Tennessee, and since then has played only a few plays, 
against Washington State. Coach Terry Donahue said Stokes is not expected to 
play Saturday. JIM HODGES

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON: FORTUNE SMILES ON LONG BEACH'S 
STREEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Her name, Stephanie Streeks, could not be more fitting. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Streeks, as in winning streaks. Since she came to California from 
Gering, Neb., two years ago to play volleyball at Long Beach State, she has 
been on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, while seated in a Hollywood television studio, Streeks heard the 
words: 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on down! You're the next contestant on 'The Price Is Right!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Streeks ran squealing down the aisle, hugged host Doug Davidson and proceeded 
to successfully guess the correct prices of such items as a remote control and 
a jewelry cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she knew it, Streeks had struck gold. 
</P>
<P>
 She rolled up more than $37,000 in prizes on the game show, including home gym 
equipment, tennis equipment, a trip to Lake Tahoe, water skis, a ski boat and a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like (winning the lottery)," Streeks said. "I was so surprised and I 
was so excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Streeks said she probably will sell the boat to help pay the nearly $8,000 in 
taxes that the Internal Revenue Service demands on her winnings. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the car, a 1995 station wagon, Streeks plans to trade it in for a 
sportier model. Something more befitting a volleyball player. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning those prizes capped a weekend in which Streeks, a redshirt freshman 
outside hitter, made her first appearance with the 49er volleyball team. She 
had two kills in four attempts without an error to help Long Beach defeat New 
Mexico State on Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents, who had dropped in from Nebraska for a surprise visit, were 
watching from the stands. Streeks was showing her parents around town the next 
day, when they were offered tickets to the game show. 
</P>
<P>
 California has been the land of opportunity for Streeks. As a redshirt last 
year, Streeks watched as the 49ers won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 For someone who grew up in a small Midwestern town, where she was Gering 
High's valedictorian, such a winning streak has been a little overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone would have told me when I came to school in California two years 
ago that we would win the national championship in volleyball and I was going 
to win on 'The Price Is Right,' I would have said, 'Forget you!' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Frankie Hejduk grew up crisscrossing the border between Southern California 
and northern Mexico with a surfboard under his arm, camping out on beaches in 
search of the perfect wave. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hejduk, who was the national junior high school surfing champion in 1988, 
doesn't have much time for surfing anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 He's too busy as a starting defender for the UCLA soccer team. Hejduk earned 
the starting position last year. This season, he has four goals and two 
assists, among them the game-winning goal on a penalty kick in a 2-1 victory 
over San Francisco last month. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Dieguito High, Hejduk split time between the two sports. In the 
morning, he surfed in a special physical education class for surfers. In the 
afternoon, he played for the La Jolla Nomads soccer club, which won state 
championships from 1989-91. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sports converged on a spring day in 1990, when Hejduk surfed all 
morning to lead San Dieguito to the national championship in Huntington Beach. 
Then, Hejduk raced to Diamond Bar, where he led the Nomads to a victory in the 
State Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 Hejduk would not say which sport he enjoys more. 
</P>
<P>
 "No comment," he said with a laugh. "I couldn't decide between them. I 
wouldn't even want to deal with it. Surfing is definitely a more relaxing 
sport. It's just so mellow out in the water, you have the sunset or the 
sunrise." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Hejduk's surfboard sits in his apartment while he watches most 
sunsets from UCLA's North Soccer Field. But if he hears about good swells and 
he has a chance, Hejduk grabs his board and hits the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Hejduk wouldn't say if the waves ever lure him away from his classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think my coaches will want to hear that one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Marv Dunphy, Pepperdine men's volleyball coach, will be inducted into the 
Volleyball Hall of Fame on Friday in Holyoke, Mass. Dunphy is 212-89 in his 
11-year career and led the Waves to national championships in 1978, '85 and 
'92. Dunphy also served as coach of the U.S. national team from 1984-88. In 
1988, he led the United States to the Olympic gold medal in Seoul. . . . Others 
to be inducted are: Patty Dowdell, a member of the U.S. national women's team 
from 1973-80; John Koch, an administrator with the U.S. Volleyball Assn. who 
died after a bout with cancer earlier this year, and Larry Rundle, a member of 
the 1968 U.S. Olympic team that defeated the Soviet Union for the first time. . 
. . The 10th-ranked Long Beach State women's volleyball team, 13-3 overall and 
8-1 in the Big West Conference, will play conference matches at Nevada tonight 
and at New Mexico State on Saturday before playing host to seventh-ranked UC 
Santa Barbara (17-1, 8-1) in an important Big West match on Oct. 28 at 7:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh-ranked UCLA men's soccer team, 12-1 overall and 4-1 in the 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, will play MPSF matches at home against Cal 
State Fullerton (8-5-1, 3-2) on Spaulding Field at 7:30 p.m. Friday and against 
San Diego State (8-6, 2-3) on the North Soccer Field at 2 p.m. Sunday. Then in 
the UCLA tournament, the Bruins will play Notre Dame (6-7) on Spaulding Field 
at 8 p.m. on Oct. 28 and top-ranked Indiana (14-1) on the North Field at 1 p.m.

HORSE RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; BREEDERS' CUP WILL GET A BOOST FROM SOVIET 
PROBLEM IN SPRINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soviet Problem, a 4-year-old filly who has run poorly only once in a 17-race 
career, will be shipped from Maryland to Kentucky on Sunday, and her owners, 
John Harris and Don Valpredo, are expected to make a preliminary payment Monday 
that will keep her eligible for the $1-million Breeders' Cup Sprint at 
Churchill Downs on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Soviet Problem wasn't nominated for a fee of $500 three years ago, 
Harris and Valpredo must supplement her into the race for $120,000. The first 
payment of $40,000 is due Monday, with the balance to be paid Nov. 2, when 
entries are drawn for the seven races worth $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 First place in the Sprint is worth $520,000. "It won't be a good financial 
decision to run," Valpredo said. "We'll be putting up more than 20% of what 
we're running for. But John and I have always been strong about making 
contributions to racing, and since the Breeders' Cup is designed to bring the 
best horses together, we feel that our filly ought to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Soviet Problem comes at the best possible time for the 
beleaguered Breeders' Cup program. This year's races will be run without 
several prominent horses, including Holy Bull, the favorite for 
horse-of-the-year honors. 
</P>
<P>
 It would cost Jimmy Croll, Holy Bull's owner-trainer, $360,000 to run for the 
$1.56-million winner's purse in the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem, extending her record to four consecutive victories against 
male competition, raced outside California for the first time last Saturday and 
won the $200,000 Laurel Dash, a six-furlong grass race, in Maryland. Soviet 
Problem has 14 victories and two seconds in 17 tries. At six furlongs on dirt, 
which are the conditions for the Breeders' Cup Sprint, Soviet Problem has eight 
victories and one second in nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think she can compete effectively in the Sprint," Valpredo said. "She's 
now won seven in a row, and there's not a North American sprinter who's done 
that. And she's beat the boys on grass and dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron, who is four for four aboard Soviet Problem, rode the filly at 
Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
 "She must have lost a length and a half at the start," McCarron said. "She 
gets tense in the gate, like a lot of the real fast sprinters do, and she 
kicked six or seven times while she was waiting. When the door opened, her 
right hind leg was off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 For the third time in her career, Soviet Problem came from off the pace to 
win. She beat another California filly, Cool Air, by 1 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 In May at Golden Gate Fields, trainer Bob Baffert tried to beat Soviet Problem 
with three of his top sprinters in the $150,000 Oakland Handicap. Soviet 
Problem fought them off to win by one length. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the real thing," said Baffert, who won the Breeders' Cup Sprint with 
Thirty Slews in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron pointed out that fillies have done well in the Sprint. Very Subtle 
won the race in 1987; Safely Kept won the race in 1990, the year after she lost 
the stake by a neck; and a pair of necks prevented Meafara from winning it in 
1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 3-year-old in 1993, Soviet Problem won her first five starts by a 
combined 34 lengths before her only off-the-board finish, a seventh in the 
Railbird Stakes at Hollywood Park in May. 
</P>
<P>
 She suffered a tendon injury in that race, and trainer Greg Gilchrist wasn't 
able to bring her back to the races until last February. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem was bred by Valpredo and Harris, who stands her sire, Moscow 
Ballet, at the family's 18,000-acre cattle and horse ranch in Coalinga. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem's dam, Nopro Blama is by Dimaggio, whom Don Valpredo's father, 
John, named after his favorite ballplayer. Dimaggio, winner of the Hollywood 
Juvenile in 1974, was 22 when he died in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem could become the first California-bred to win a Breeders' Cup 
race. Since the series began in 1984, 31 Cal-bred starters have been 
unsuccessful while horses from such unfashionable breeding states as Oklahoma 
and Pennsylvania have won Breeders' Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest a California horse has come to winning was when Fran's Valentine 
finished first in the first Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, only to be 
disqualified to 10th by the stewards for interference in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of McCarron's five Breeders' Cup victories came in the 1985 Sprint 
with Precisionist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think supplementing Soviet Problem is worth their while," McCarron said. 
"She's so quick that she feels like a rubber band that's been pulled back as 
far as you can pull it." 
</P>

 Jerry McKeon, president of the New York Racing Assn. tracks since 1982, 
resigned unexpectedly Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who has been with the NYRA since 1971, appeared in announcing his 
resignation said: "New York racing is lost and is trying to find its way in the 
presence of many gambling alternatives that have developed in recent years." 
The NYRA operates Aqueduct, Belmont Park and Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of the five-week summer hiatus at Saratoga, the association 
has been struggling in recent years with its winter racing operation at 
Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
 In late August, Jerry Lawrence, executive vice president of the NYRA, 
resigned, citing philosophical differences with the association's board of 
directors. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Mike Smith, who has tied his 1991 record by winning 62 stakes races this year, 
will be back aboard Devil His Due, the likely favorite for the Breeders' Cup 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Smith's commitment to Holy Bull, Jerry Bailey rode Devil His Due in 
his last two races, second-place finishes in the Woodward and the Jockey Club 
Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who leads the country in purses with more than $12 million, has been 
the rider for Devil His Due's three victories this year.

<P>
 An unidentified bettor at Santa Anita on Wednesday hit what is believed to be 
the largest Pick Six in U.S. history -- $1,010,221.40. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by a two-day carryover of $328,219, there was $1,424,041 bet Wednesday, 
and only one favorite -- Damad in the sixth race -- won during the sequence. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying Rey, a 14-1 shot, opened the Pick Six with a wire-to-wire victory, at 
$31.40; then came victories by Shiny Slew ($8.40), Damad ($4.80), Alta Blue 
($13), Romarin ($10.40) and Cup O Moonshine ($22.40). 
</P>
<P>
 The previous record for a Pick Six payoff in Southern California was 
$976,229.60, when there was one perfect ticket on Feb. 28, 1986. BOB MIESZERSKI

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: COMBING FOR THE TRUTH AMONG FOLLICLE FABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest weapon of choice in the battle of the sexes seems to be the 
whimper, with both sets of combatantes -- reeling from slights genuine and 
imagined -- lobbying volleys of self-pitying laments: 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is harder than your job." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I have to do more errands than you do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your insensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're self-centered." 
</P>
<P>
 "You are uncommunicative." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a nag." 
</P>
<P>
 It's as though both sides are competing for the title of Most Beleaguered at 
the annual Gender Games. 
</P>
<P>
 And nowhere do people get more touchy and self-involved than when the 
Treacherous Trio -- time, gravity and the aging process -- conspire to rob them 
of their youth and good looks. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when her smooth, solid thighs start to partition, his flat, hard 
stomach begins looking helium filled and everyone seems to grow extra skin. And 
all hell breaks loose. 
</P>
<P>
 She heads for the makeup counter for thigh-sculpting and face-smoothing 
creams. He orders the super-deluxe, multi-exercise, home-fitness unit. Both 
make appointments with the plastic surgeon for sucking, tucking and stapling. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in general, only he will be faced with one humiliating task: to shore up, 
beef up, augment, or just try to hang on to those last remaining hairs on his 
once pileous dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff writer Jeff Meyers, who insists he's merely thinning, not balding (the 
guy's in serious denial), is too kind to wish baldness on any woman, 
particularly his editor, and he personally hopes for "a miracle cure" before 
he's "too old to care." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers has been looking for a miracle cure ever since 11th grade, when he 
first noticed that his hairdo "lacked bounce not even a good shampoo could 
bring back." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Meyers rubbed on ointments and elixirs and the prescription 
drug Rogaine. He went to charlatans who promised to regrow his hair by passing 
a spark-inducing electric wand over his head. But nothing stopped the 
relentless northern march of his scalp, making him the perfect candidate -- 
actually, he was the only candidate on our otherwise hirsute Life staff -- to 
write this week's centerpiece celebrating last week's Be Bald and Be Free Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the great men in history were bald," Meyers said. "And there were 
some sexy bald men, too -- thank God for Yul Brynner." 
</P>
<P>
 After doing the story, Meyers wasn't tempted to get a hairpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it ain't broke, don't affix anything to it, that's my motto," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 And plugs were out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you if it doesn't come out so good? Go for the baseball cap look?"

SOUNDS: SYMPHONY'S OPENING IS HARMONIOUS; CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS CAUSED 
PRE-SEASON DISCORD. BUT ORCHESTRA'S FIRST CONCERT WAS SMOOTH AND PUT A LOCAL 
COMPOSER IN THE LIMELIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 All the pieces were in place and everything seemed right with the world, 
momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 8, the curtain went up at Oxnard Civic Auditorium and the big, lush, 
propulsive orchestral sound of the Ventura County Symphony gushed off the 
stage. Maestro Boris Brott, now settling in as cultural fixture in the county 
rather than the new kid in town, returned to launch his third season at the 
helm. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget Rachmaninov and Mussorgsky, the "Russian Masters" of the concert's 
title. Oxnard's own Wunderkind composer/pianist Miguel del Aguila stole the 
show with the premiere of his animated, engaging piece "Conga." In it, Aguila 
taps into both Latin American and European classical elements, interweaving and 
knocking traditions together with affection and sly irreverence. 
</P>
<P>
 Further enhancing regional pride, this work of art was graciously funded by 
the City of Ventura Cultural Affairs. In general, the Ventura County Symphony 
was up to its ever-increasing standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, as with many things boasting a polished veneer, all was not as 
right as it seemed. The operative word was tentative. The symphony, in a 
continuing effort to advance itself, ran up against troubled contract 
negotiations with its players before the season began. A strike was threatened, 
but they managed to hammer out a temporary agreement, ensuring that the show 
would go on. 
</P>
<P>
 One hopes that all will be well. The upcoming eight-concert season holds great 
promise. Unfortunately, last year's provocative Musics Alive! series of chamber 
music concerts, focusing on contemporary and world music, is not continuing, 
but there are other signs of progress. Most notably, the symphony will pass 
another milestone this week when it takes the stage at the new, much-adoed 
Civic Arts Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night's concert in Thousand Oaks will be an impressionistic feast 
under the heading of "A Ravel Spectacular." Included on the program are 
"Rhapsodie Espagnole," "Daphnis et Chloe, Suite 2," "Alborada del gracioso," 
"Pavane pour une infante defunte" and that ever-popular, classic turned 
soundtrack for amour, "Bolero." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Conejo Valley Symphony has been officially crowned the resident 
orchestra of the new arts citadel, the Ventura County Symphony will grace the 
stage three times this season. Aside from the "Ravel" concert this week, they 
will return to Thousand Oaks next spring, to perform "La Boheme" and "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, the Ventura County Symphony will make the cross-county trek for 
seasons to come. The ensemble's presence would fulfill the Civic Arts Plaza's 
built-in mandate as a countywide entity. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far in his tender tenure at the podium, Brott has achieved his goal of 
shaping up the orchestra and filling seats, if not always paying as much heed 
to the music of our time as some would hope. Still, this season features three 
premieres of pieces by composers in the area: Aguila's "Conga," Enrique 
Gonzalez's "El Amanecer en el Desierto de Altar" and Dwight Stone's "Fanfare 
2010." 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Brott will be less of a presence in the county this year, gone from 
October until the Feb. 4 concert. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 6 and 7, Brott conducts Mendelssohn's "A Midsummer Night's Dream," 
along with the Ventura County Master Chorale Women's Chorus and narrator Claire 
Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 The gods of mediation and music-making permitting, it should be a fine season. 
JAZZ ON PARADE 
</P>
<P>
 Aficianados of jazz that veers left will want to mark their calendars for this 
Saturday night at White Winds Studio in Montecito. Venerable pianist Horace 
Tapscott will come to town to perform a duet with the fine reed player Charles 
Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 30 years, Tapscott has played a key role in developing an 
avant-garde-leaning jazz sensibility in inner-city Los Angeles, founding the 
Pan-African People's Arkestra. And Tapscott is no stranger to Santa Barbara, 
having recorded a series of captivating solo piano recordings at the Lobero 
Theater several years ago on the Nimbus label. 
</P>
<P>
 Be there. SPEAKING OF THE 66 
</P>
<P>
 From another West Coast school entirely, all-too-modest tenor sax giant Pete 
Christlieb ventured up the road last Saturday night to play with the Johnny 
Vieth trio. As expected, Christlieb delivered choruses full of invention and 
witty brevity, and solos begging to be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 He counted off an effectively peculiar, medium swinging version of "Body and 
Soul" and took a refreshingly diagonal approach into "Stella by Starlight." 
</P>
<P>
 A fine evening of music was capped off with a loopy Latin-ized variation on 
"All the Things You Are." 
</P>
<P>
 Christlieb holds forth on some private middle ground between slick sauvity and 
an incurable sense of adventure. Here's hoping he comes back this way soon. 
Details

NIGHT LIFE: IT'S A 'SPECIALS' NIGHT FOR SKA; THE BRITISH BAND, INCLUDING FOUR 
ORIGINAL MEMBERS, BRINGS ITS GREATEST HITS PACKAGE TO SUNDAY'S DANCE-A-THON AT 
THE VENTURA THEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orson Welles did "Citizen Kane" and "The Magnificent Ambersons," and it was 
pretty much all downhill (and dinner) after that. The Specials, a two-tone ska 
band out of Coventry, England, have thus far had a similar career. The first 
two Specials albums are still selling despite the fact they came out in 1979 
and 1980, or back before Jimmy Carter was popular, but President. 
</P>
<P>
 And now -- isn't this special? -- the real Specials have reformed to play some 
dance music especially for all the skankers. The dance-a-thon begins at 8 
Sunday night with Fresno's Let's Go Bowling and a local group, the Ska Daddyz, 
opening at the Ventura Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 What's pretty special about this tour is that four of the original seven 
members will be there to orchestrate the whole sweaty mess. Neville Staples 
(vocals), Horace Panter (bass), Roddy "Radiation" Byers (lead guitar, vocals) 
and Lynval Golding (vocals, guitar) are the original guys. Mark Adams 
(keyboards), "Aitch" Bembridge (drums) and Adam Birch (horns) are the new guys. 
According to Panter, it's as though they had never left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like the last 13 years didn't happen at all. Eighteen months ago, 
members of the band got together to work on an album for a reggae singer named 
Desmond Dekker," Panter said. "It was so much fun, we decided to take it on the 
road and see who wanted to hear some Specials songs. We did very well in 
Europe; then we went to Japan, where we were treated like deities. It was 
incredible; we were very bemused by it all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Specials may not yet be deities in the United States, where there is, 
nonetheless, plenty of rock 'n' roll royalty, yet their music has helped to 
inspire a dance craze that has been around for 15 years. The current tour is 
primarily college towns, but an inordinate number of gigs are on the West 
Coast, where ska is as healthy as the California Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "In America, ska is getting an awful lot bigger," Panter said. "I think people 
look at it as a fashion statement because we get a lot of young kids who are 
very snappily dressed, also college kids, a lot of skateboard kids and people 
that heard our album 13 years ago. Ska's not so big anymore in England, but 
that's OK because we can remain anonymous and keep our day jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 To the untrained eye, the impending dance marathon will look like a gang fight 
no matter who plays. But, it's not. For one, at a ska show, you skank -- at 
punk metal shows, you mosh. The mosh pit is almost always all male with 
testosterone levels off the Richter scale, elbows flying everywhere, and the 
girls squished like bugs against the stage or running for their lives. Also at 
the end of the night, the mosh pit is the one with the blood on the floor. 
Skankers, on the other hand, are both males and females, polite ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't encourage moshing at our shows. People dance, certainly, but it's 
not so monogamous as at metal shows," Panter said. "People don't mosh 
themselves into the hospital. And since our music is so positive, people leave 
our gigs smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 There were always so many people in the Specials, more than a basketball team 
but less than a football team, that after the onset of the inevitable creative 
differences, there were enough members to man a bunch of bands. The 
self-destruct mechanism must be in a musician's genes. When the Specialization 
of labor led to diversification, there were plenty of popular ska bands -- the 
English Beat, Selector and Madness -- on hand to make people in skinny ties 
dance. But according to the bass player, there was one big difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the first -- our first gig was in 1977. We split in 1981 -- some 
members joined Fun Boy 3, and I ended up joining General Public. But all these 
different projects had faded out by 1987 or 1988," said Panter. "Next, some of 
us did the Special Beat thing for a few years. We've always had sort of a punk 
rock element to our music, and we have reggae roots as well, plus quite noisy 
guitars." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect a whole bunch of new Specials tunes this time around. This is a 
basic "If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It Tour." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really just the first two Specials albums," said Panter. "It's a 
greatest hits package, really, but people seem to really want to hear it. Well, 
they're good songs, and you can dance to them, and they're good for parties. 
Also, we have relevant lyrics that deal with racial harmony, which is still 
relevant in the 1990s. We're not sure about a new album -- this is our first 
time out in 13 years." Details

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: GUILD HELPS WRITERS FINE-TUNE COMPOSITIONS; THE COUNTY GROUP 
MEETS MONTHLY SO POTENTIAL HIT-MAKERS CAN FIND CRITIQUES AND COLLABORATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Chances are you've heard the joke about everybody in Southern California 
working on a screenplay. But there are probably just as many tunesmiths hoping 
to score No. 1 with a bullet on the Billboard charts. And lots of them are, no 
doubt, writing country music. 
</P>
<P>
 But face it. The days of the Nashville Handshake -- handing someone your demo 
tape during an introduction -- are over. Lawsuits over copyright infringement 
have closed the option of submitting songs over the transom; now they go 
through legitimate music publishers, artists' managers and attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 So how do you get your song across if you don't play an instrument or can't 
sing? 
</P>
<P>
 You might learn a thing or two about the biz at the Ventura County Producers 
and Songwriters Guild. About 100 members strong, this organization gets 
together the last Tuesday of each month, alternating its meetings between World 
Music in Simi Valley and Instrumental Music in Thousand Oaks. And you don't 
have to be a resident of Ventura County to join. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical meeting will feature a guest speaker's presentation followed by a 
question-answer session and critiques of some tapes of members' work. But this 
Tuesday, guild members may sign up to perform their compositions in the annual 
"Writers in the Round Showcase" at World Music in Simi Valley. And it's open to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives songwriters a chance to test their material," said Jim Best, guild 
president. "Some of them are not performers. But they have a chance to get up 
there and gut it out to get a response to their work." 
</P>
<P>
 Best, 46, is a Moorpark resident and has been a professional musician since 
the mid-1980s. A lead singer in Shiloh from 1990-91, he is lead vocalist for 
Buckshot, a local band that he and keyboard/bass player Gerry Collard formed 
almost one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the guild members are country-oriented, according to Best. 
"And we're always encouraged by success stories like fellow member Dick Torst. 
He recently received a royalty check for a song he wrote for Jimmie Rodgers 
that was recorded in the '50s. And it was just put on a European 'greatest 
hits' release," said Best. 
</P>
<P>
 Members agree the guild is also a good place to meet a collaborator. In 1988, 
Best made a demo of his song "I'm Comin' Home" in Denny Martin's studio. "Since 
1988, Denny has produced about 50 of my demos," Best said. "We've co-written 
approximately 10 songs. Two of those were published by Buckhorn Music and 
Robinsparrow Music in Nashville. And one of our tunes, 'Jenny's Love,' was 
presented to Shenandoah a few weeks ago. So we're just holding our breath." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who is not pictured because he left for Nashville after our phone 
interview, now lives in Canoga Park. But local residents might recall his solo 
club performances in the county during the '70s and '80s. Since the mid-'80s, 
Martin has concentrated his efforts on his demo studio business, Martin Music 
Productions. The producer-songwriter will be showcasing tunes in clubs 
including the famous Bluebird Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 He averages four visits a year to Nashville to market songs, and has had 10 
published in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of his songs will be on a compilation CD slated for release on Canyon 
Records, an independent label located in Chatsworth. The album will be 
distributed internationally for radio airplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Which delights Westlake Village resident Terry Sue Crawford, a 
singer-songwriter who performs two songs on the project. Crawford wrote her 
first lyrics in 1992 after meeting Martin, who encouraged her efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "As writers, we work in a solitary environment," Martin said. "So we need to 
have our work heard by other writers because they can help to critique and 
prepare our songs for the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Vail of Newbury Park agrees. He just returned to work after dedicating a 
year to writing songs full time. And it paid off with a three-song deal with 
Cedar Creek Music in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 Vail said he writes everything from '30s country swing to the new 
country-rock. And he must have taken lessons from the George Jones hit "High 
Tech Red-Neck," because Vail likes to compose while seated at the computer with 
a guitar in his lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guild is a good place to meet a co-writer, especially if you are a 
lyricist or a composer," said Vail, who has collaborated with Best. "It's also 
a good place to network among guest speakers -- I've met sound engineers, radio 
station program managers and record company executives." 
</P>
<P>
 "But the best thing about belonging to the guild is it motivates me to 
consistently write so that I have songs to play at the meetings." Details

CENTERPIECE: BALD TALES; SO, YOU'RE SEARCHING TO REGAIN A THICK, FULL MANE? 
IT'S NOT EASY, BUT HERE'S HOW.

<P>
 You want hair. 
</P>
<P>
 You want it bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Your hair has been disappearing down the shower drain for decades, forcing you 
to endure sadistic jabs from associates. "Is that your scalp or a cantaloupe on 
your neck?" Heh heh . 
</P>
<P>
 Your quest for eternal hair begins in the Ventura County Yellow Pages, which 
devotes an entire page to "Hair Replacement." (For those who want the opposite 
effect, "Hair Removing" is the preceding category.) You notice numerous 
before-and-after photos of men who have beaten baldness. But it's the headlines 
that really grab you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Restore your crowning glory." 
</P>
<P>
 "Grow your own hair." 
</P>
<P>
 "Permanent hair, with a natural hairline (emphasis theirs)." 
</P>
<P>
 And best of all: "Guaranteed." 
</P>
<P>
 Your 10th-grade hairdo -- thick and bouncy -- immediately flashes to mind. You 
call the 800-numbers for free information. Within days, the first brochure 
arrives in the mail, a shocking 36-page guide on "the art and science of hair 
restoration." You had always accepted male pattern baldness as a minor flaw but 
nothing like, say, disfigurement from a car wreck. But according to a Beverly 
Hills medical group, hair loss ranks right up there with the worst catastrophes 
befalling humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Samson (sic) to Shakespeare, (baldness is) a tragedy of life," the guide 
informs you. "For thousands of years, men of all countries and races have 
shared the tragedy of premature hair loss, and the hope of discovering a cure." 
You learn baldness was "shameful" in ancient times and represented "the loss of 
a man's virility." Shakespeare was so resentful of his own baldness, the guide 
points out, that he made his bald characters either fools, villains or aging 
kings. 
</P>
<P>
 What a revelation. Far from being the swashbuckling figure you think you are, 
you are a tragic fool with a virility problem. Feeling as if you should go live 
in a colony of baldies so normal people won't have to look at you, you now see 
yourself as the victim of an unspoken tragedy -- and you're not even entitled 
to disability. What a bum hand life has dealt you. If you had hair you would be 
normal, not the object of shame, pity and ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
 You would do anything to reverse this cruel twist of genetic programming. 
Anything . 
</P>
<P>
 Your enthusiasm lasts only as long as it takes to read more of the guide and 
find words like scalp reduction, minigraft, micrograft, megagraft, flap 
rotation, strip graft and bilateral lift . You come to realize that the medical 
profession's answer to hair loss isn't a simple potion or pill. To regain your 
mane, you have to be willing to spend several thousand dollars for minor 
surgery and then hide out for weeks until the scabs fall off. 
</P>
<P>
 You begin to wonder if you want hair that desperately. 
</P>
<P>
 Included on the "Hair Replacement" page are ads for hairpieces, an alternative 
to surgery. Billed as instant, painless hair, the wigs come in natural or 
synthetic, attaching to your scalp by means of fusion, weaving and "track 
bonding." You can get "24-hour wearability" and a "unique comb-back hairline." 
One company offers "private consultation rooms" and a "private unmarked 
entrance" so customers don't have to risk being exposed by normal people. 
</P>
<P>
 Before visiting the medical and prosthetic hair establishments in Ventura 
County, you talk to an associate who has worn hairpieces and is currently 
undergoing $13,000 worth of surgical restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Since May, Mick (not his real name) has had five procedures: two scalp 
reductions and three transplant sessions of 200 grafts each. The 46-year-old 
salesman has one transplant session left, plus a "touch up." Even though he is 
nearly done with his ordeal, the transplanted follicles have yet to sprout 
(regeneration takes several weeks after the shock of transplantation) and the 
top of his head still looks raw and dappled, forcing him to wear a hat or 
bandanna in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "My (scalp) is not much of a turn-on until the hair grows in," says Mick, a 
bachelor whose side hair flows to his shoulders. "I don't go out looking for 
women. I sort of have to lay low." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Mick underwent two scalp reductions. "The doctor cut out some of 
the balding area and pulled (the surrounding scalp) together and stitched it 
up," Mick says. Because of his tight scalp, a temporary "extender" was inserted 
sub-dermally during the first reduction to "give elasticity to the area," he 
says. A month later, the extender and a large swatch of scalp were removed. 
Each reduction required Demerol and an IV. Excess bleeding gave him black eyes 
and a swollen forehead after both operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The transplants were less traumatic. Sitting up in a barbershop-like chair, he 
watched videos for two or three hours as a surgical team hovered around him. 
Using a scalpel, the doctor extracted healthy hair follicles from the fringe 
around Mick's head and inserted them into Mick's barren dome, making sure they 
were placed in natural-looking positions. Working at the hairline, the doctor 
had to be an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want it to come out looking phony," Mick says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair transplantation has improved aesthetically since its development in the 
1960s. Less than a decade ago, surgeons were still experimenting with radical 
flap rotation -- in which large sections of hair-bearing skin were moved to 
balding areas -- and were transplanting plugs of five or six hairs, causing an 
unsightly "Barbie Doll" or "toothbrush" appearance. Today, micrografts of one 
or two hairs are much less detectable, especially along the hairline. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Mick's scalp is still numb from the anesthetics, he is pleased 
with his progress and relieved that the worst is behind him. "You go through 
this once in your life," he says, "and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Why did he care so much about being hair-challenged? "I've always been vain," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mick advises you to pick a local transplant doctor "in case something goes 
wrong and you have to see him quick." 
</P>
<P>
 You go for a free consultation from a Thousand Oaks dermatologist who has been 
transplanting hair for several years. An assistant escorts you to a small 
examination room. The doctor follows. He wears a starched white lab coat and a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you want to talk about hair?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
 While he examines your hair, you glance at his: dark, flecked with white, 
fairly full in front. Nature? No, micrografts, he confirms. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor sifts your strands with a comb. "Right off the bat," he says 
ominously, "I have to tell you, I can't give you a full head of hair." He sees 
your disappointment. "But I can give you a 'look' of hair up front so as people 
face you, it looks like you have hair." You envision a social life spent with 
your back to a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor informs you that a scalp reduction isn't practical in your case. 
"You don't have enough (donor) hair to fill in," he says. "What's the point of 
giving you a scar in the middle of your head if you won't be able to cover it?" 
</P>
<P>
 You need about 800 minigrafts over three or four sessions, he says. His 
standard price is $16 a graft, but he gives you a discount and will do the 
surgery for "roughly" $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 You want a second opinion, so you visit the county office of an L.A.-based 
doctor with branches as far away as Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at an expensive private home, you are greeted by the L.A. doctor's 
representative, a friendly Englishman who identifies himself as a doctor and 
consultant. Escorting you into a paneled office, he tells you his doctorate is 
in "atmospheric physics" and he is qualified to analyze your scalp and "remove 
sutures." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he is living proof that hair transplants work. Just a few years ago, the 
L.A. doctor performed two scalp reductions and 800 transplants on the 
consultant, giving him a satisfactory top of wavy tan hair and making him a 
true believer. "Your own (transplanted) hair is so much nicer than a wig," he 
says. "I wore wigs for 22 years. Hated them. The happiest day of my life was 
when I threw them away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Englishman walks behind you and kneads your scalp. He winces: "Not much 
mobility there." He says you will probably need three scalp reductions, more if 
you don't embark on a program of "vigorous scalp massage to give you average 
flexibility." You tell him the dermatologist warned against scalp reductions 
for you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmmm, he may be right," the consultant says. "Or he may not be right. I'll 
let (the L.A. doctor) make the determination." 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant writes out two estimates: one for $15,200 that includes three 
scalp reductions and 700 micro-and minigrafts, the other with no reductions but 
1,800 transplants for $14,400. But if you take advantage of a soon-to-expire 
promotion and give him a $1,000 refundable deposit, you can save about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 You decide against transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 But you still want hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Wigs, you learn, have been around for a few centuries, but only in the last 
two decades have manufacturers solved the fundamental problem of keeping them 
from moving around, falling down or blowing off and humiliating the wearer. 
Some solutions were drastic, borderline barbaric: The wig was secured to wire 
loops surgically stitched into the scalp, or to loops of living skin 
transplanted from the groin area. Not only do you never have to remove your 
wig, you never want to. 
</P>
<P>
 You visit a one-man hairpiece operation in the back of a Ventura barbershop. 
The owner, a folksy man with a thatch of graying chestnut hair, leads you into 
a private room and seats you in a revolving chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a lot of nerve," he says. You look at him blankly. He winks. "It 
seems to take a lot of nerve for a guy to come in here." 
</P>
<P>
 You tell him you want hair bad and you're looking into wigs. "Looking into it 
won't do a thing," he says. "You won't gain a thing until you actually buy one. 
And nothing you can do will change your looks like a hairpiece. You are a 
different person. You won't be recognized. It sounds scary, but it's a lot of 
fun. Kind of like the 'Twilight Zone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He grasps his hair and suddenly peels it off his head, exposing a shiny bald 
scalp. "See, it does make a difference," he says. "Thirty-one years ago, when I 
was 26, I got contacts and a hairpiece. Greatest thing I ever did for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 He reattaches his wig with two-sided tape, first degreasing his scalp with an 
alcohol-based solution. "Can you shower in this?" he asks without prompting. 
"Yes. Should you shower in it? No." He revels in his candor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little different from the average hairpiece man of today," he says. 
"Most people are out for your money. Well, I am to a degree, but I wear a 
hairpiece and really want you to be as happy as I am." 
</P>
<P>
 He recommends a custom piece made from synthetic hair and costing from $550 to 
$1,250. What kind of guarantee does he provide? "What kind of guarantee do you 
want?" he says. "It's not a piece of metal. You take it home and I don't know 
how you treat it. I guarantee you hair -- I'm not guaranteeing it will last 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning you away from a mirror, he fits a wig on your head and styles it. 
"This is not your size or color," he cautions. "Our brains are like a computer. 
If I put something on you, even if it looks fantastic, chances are you won't 
like it 'cause you're not used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 He spins the chair toward the mirror and you gape at what seems to be a 
coonskin cap perched atop your head. "Notice how it shaves 10 years off your 
age," he says. "You kind of look like your younger brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Before you can tell him you don't have a younger brother, he's whispering: 
"You know the biggest problem you'll have with a hairpiece? You'll be 
uncomfortable with women running their fingers through your hair. You kind of 
tense up." 
</P>
<P>
 You say you'll have to think about buying a wig. 
</P>
<P>
 "By all means," he says, "get one or you'll think about it till the day you 
die. It's like thinking about food when you're hungry. It don't really solve 
the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Another wig outfit offers other choices. At the Oxnard branch office of an 
established statewide company, a consultant with glossy real hair tells you his 
product is made from hair of European teen-agers and costs as much as $3,000. 
The hairpiece would be glued to your scalp along a shaven "track" around your 
horseshoe-shaped bald spot. The process effectively prevents the wig from ever 
coming off, but you have to sleep and shower in it. And when the shaven hair 
grows out in a few weeks, the wig loosens and requires servicing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's $55," the attendant says, "but we give you a haircut and clean your 
unit." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the hairpiece is exposed to sun and chlorine, it should last for 
years, the attendant says. "A person who grooms himself well should not have a 
problem. The life expectancy of a unit should be between three and four years. 
We have some clients who work out in the fields or in machine shops and tend 
not to take a shower every day. That will wear the unit out, and the life 
expectancy will be 1 1/2 to 2 years." 
</P>
<P>
 When you get home, you ponder your options -- scalp reductions, micrografts, 
fake and genuine hairpieces, regular showering -- and decide to save your money 
and your scalp. You adopt a mantra, "bald is beautiful," and accept your 
destiny, reluctantly perhaps, but with the courage to go forward despite your 
tragic condition. Off the Top 
</P>
<P>
 Ever wonder what would happen if you woke up bald one morning? You would still 
be that same lovable, sensitive human being, of course, but would you have the 
same charisma? Would anybody still trust you, take you seriously or ever 
describe you as dashing ? For an actor suddenly gone bald, romantic roles are 
history. In politics, nobody ever won with the slogan, "Vote for Me -- I'm 
Bald." You think we're exaggerating? Test your reaction to these 
computer-altered photos of famous Ventura County residents. We think you'll 
agree, Sue Ellen never would have given J.R. a second glance.

HINTS ON CHOOSING A NEW HEAD OF HAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To avoid bad hair days with your transplants or hairpiece, care should be 
taken in choosing your doctor or wig maker. 
</P>
<P>
 For transplants, experts recommend board-certified doctors of dermatology, 
general surgery or plastic surgery who specialize in hair restoration.Ask for 
before-and-after photos and phone numbers of patients. Make sure the doctor -- 
and not an assistant -- actually does the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The state medical board "used to receive a lot of complaints about hair 
transplants," says David Thornton, supervising investigator. "People had 
unrealistic expectations, and sometimes the doctors were incompetent -- there 
was a lot of scarring." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last few years, techniques have improved. "We don't get a heck of a 
lot of complaints," Thornton says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wigs seem like a simple solution to baldness, but they have drawbacks, experts 
say. Weaving -- bonding the wig to natural hair -- can cause those hairs to 
fall out. A wig needs to be cleaned and styled often, which may necessitate the 
purchase of a spare. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping science invents a miracle cure for baldness? You may go completely bald 
before that happens -- no breakthroughs are on the horizon, experts say. And 
don't be tempted to buy products that claim to regrow hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no safe and effective and approved over-the-counter product to treat 
hair loss," a spokesman for the federal Food and Drug Administration says. 
</P>
<P>
 The only FDA-approved prescription drug for hair loss is Rogaine, but it has 
"limited effect," the FDA spokesman says. JEFF MEYERS

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; OJAI GROUP SEEKS TO BROADEN PUBLIC ACCESS TV; A 
MEDIA NETWORK WOULD BE CREATED TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS AND TEACH COMMUNITIES THE 
SKILLS THEY NEED TO PRODUCE THEIR OWN PROGRAMMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not often you hear people say, "Doggone it! There's just not enough 
public access TV on." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet an Ojai group is gearing up a campaign to create a media network for 
public access channels across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main purpose is to create a telecommunications center in Ojai," said 
Carol McCartney, a documentary filmmaker on the board of the newly minted 
Ventura County Media Network. "We've been talking with the schools about ways 
we could bring multimedia into the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member George Stuart said educators were "aflame" with the idea, and he 
defended Channel 8, the channel most cable providers in Ventura County use for 
public access. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 10 cities in Ventura are guaranteed access, but lots of them don't make 
use of it because people in the community don't have the skills," he said. 
"Carol (McCartney) wants to teach the community those skills so they can 
develop programming for local access." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart said the Media Network would also help distribute public access 
programs from other communities in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot to look at here," he said. "Local people don't know what's 
going on in their community." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course programming isn't all informative. The New Age spiritualists, 
political wackos and "Wayne's World" wanna-bes that typically populate the band 
width are several wavelengths removed from the pluralistic forum public access 
was originally intended to create. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Cole, director of the UCLA Center for Communication Policy, recalls one 
Southern California television host who expressed disappointment that few 
people read books anymore, so he used to sit in front of the camera and read a 
book. But not out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, that's most of public access," Cole said. "Cheap, easy, sort of odd." 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public-access channels are governed by franchise agreements between the cable 
company and the city or town in which it operates. The agreements were an 
inducement cable operators offered to reluctant cities: Give us the franchise 
and we'll provide public, educational or government (PEG) access, with no cost 
to the user. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to air a show must learn how to use the studio's equipment. All 
they pay for is the tape; the cable operator provides cameras, editing 
equipment, lighting and instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, the Media Network will be putting together proposals for 
federal grants and private donations. Funds will be used for studio space, 
production equipment and a technician.

FASHION; MAKING SCENTS OF OUR SURROUNDINGS; THE PURSUIT OF AROMAS FOR HOMES AND 
AUTOS HAS LED TO A STAGGERING RANGE OF FRAGRANCES. 
</P>

<P>
 Escapism is one of our culture's all-time biggest hits. Americans have long 
sought means to get away from it all, from dime novels to the current 
definitive illusion, virtual reality. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for the disenchanted who balk at sealing themselves off in strange 
robotic costumes, there is a middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Light a candle: A bouquet in the air can call up the mood of a forest grotto, 
a South Seas island, a country meadow. Impressions of your workaday urban condo 
with its wretched electronic accents will fade. You will experience aromatic 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 More than at any time in history, perhaps, the country is following its 
collective nose. Environmental fragrancing products last year generated an 
estimated $500 million, and so far '94 looks bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's because people can't afford to travel to forest grottos, but our 
theory is it's just tidier to bring the forest ambience home -- it saves so 
much laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if your personal space lacks ambience, check the options. Fragrancing has 
come a long way since knockout pine scent -- in a bottle that looked like 
insect bait -- enhanced the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there are better ways to impart atmosphere to the home, from aerosol 
spray to incense. But romantics will lean toward scented wax. 
</P>
<P>
 Candles no longer just burn; they impart aroma -- and the choices available 
are staggering. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wicks 'N' Sticks in Thousand Oaks, manager Alecia Echolm couldn't count the 
number of scents available in the store, but said it was over a hundred, and 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there are a lot more sophisticated fragrances," she said, "Before there 
was, like, cinnamon. Now there's Home Sweet Home, which has cinnamon and spice 
and clove, you know, combinations." 
</P>
<P>
 Some scents sound exotic, others nostalgic -- from Rainforest to Bridal 
Bouquet. Many have the word country in their titles, and one expresses a 
particularly poignant escape: Clean Air. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming as popular as candles are fragrant waxed chips, which are simmered 
over a flame in ceramic pots, melting a large pool of wax that produces scent 
beyond the capacity of several candles. 
</P>
<P>
 The chips make it easy to further combine scents, and at Gifted Candle in 
Ventura, co-owner Deborah Ramsey said she custom bags mixtures of chips and 
renames the combinations. Here are High Lonesome (cedar and pine), Hill Country 
(peach and cedar) and an indoor fantasy called Victoria's Secret (lavender, 
lilac and musk). 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of all of these options, the top seller at both stores is French 
Vanilla, which evokes a modest escape destination: an old-fashioned kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 All the scents are imparted through a blend of oil and paraffin, so those who 
want to avoid petroleum products may want to use straight aromatic oils 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Many candle retailers also carry the oils. And, at The Oaks mall, we found 
Chestnut Ridge, a specialty shop in a cart, offering oils exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Joe Fries explained the oil may be dropped on a clay circle called a 
light ring and placed over a light bulb to diffuse the scent. Or clay pots of 
oil give off a gentle aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 Fries, whose wife, Margaret, owns the business. On the East Coast where the 
couple lived until last year, nearly every home has added fragrance, he said. 
"Maybe it's because you spend so much more time in your home there," he said, 
"Here, people are more interested in their cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Fries' theory stems from the fact that more of his customers buy the fragrance 
vials for cars than for the home. The favorite automotive fragrances, he said, 
are Rose or Magnolia for women; Apple or Lemon for men. 
</P>
<P>
 Just for good measure, we checked to see what less romantic types are doing 
with their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 At Camarillo Car Wash, we learned that one out of three customers wants a 
scented spray added to the interior. To keep lines moving, there are just five 
scents to choose from, including Pina Colada and Country Spice. But the big 
favorites are the more mundane options: good old home-grown Lemon, and running 
neck and neck with it: a materialist's fantasy known as New Car.

EARTHWATCH: TV PROGRAMS FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTALISM; AN AWARDS CEREMONY ON CABLE 
AND A NEW DOCUMENTARY SERIES ON PUBLIC BROADCASTING GIVE ATTENTION TO THE 
PLIGHT OF THE PLANET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmentalism has become so trendy it has made it to prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday, the cable superstation TBS will carry an awards ceremony 
conducted by the Environmental Media Assn. Heavy hitters from show business, 
the arts scene and politics -- including Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the convert from 
red to green, and poet Maya Angelou -- will gather to point out recent evidence 
that ecological themes have not gone out of fashion in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, by coincidence, the Public Broadcasting System this month has launched 
the documentary series "Future Quest," running Mondays, which will repeatedly 
get into environmental questions. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the awards event Sunday, Ventura County folks who tune in should pay 
particular attention to the "Best Movie of the Week/Miniseries" competition. 
Brian Trenchard-Smith of Westlake Village is the director of the made-for-TV 
movie "Official Denial" in this category. Ostensibly a science fiction thriller 
about an ordinary guy captured by aliens, the movie, made in 1993, also has a 
solid pro-environment slant. 
</P>
<P>
 More a thriller than a message film, it gets across the idea that "our science 
allowed us to control the world until there was no more world to control," as 
expressed by one of the movie's characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the film was good for my children," Trenchard-Smith said, referring to 
his boys, ages 10 and 13, who are in local schools. But he did admit that 
though the boys enjoyed "Official Denial" and even came on the set to give him 
some advice on how to direct an "alien," at home they repeatedly play videos of 
his other films, which include "Night of the Demons II," "Dead End Drive-In," 
and "Escape 2000." Nonetheless, he defends his recent eco-film as "a worthwhile 
social and moral message amidst the entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, "Official Denial," with its message intact and critics approving, was 
able to double the ratings of the cable service "The Sci-Fi Channel," on which 
it premiered. A win-win situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncharacteristically for Hollywood, the screenwriter in this case is also 
happy. Bryce Zabel, a seasoned TV veteran -- and committed environmentalist -- 
who wrote a measured and thoughtful script for the production, lives nearby in 
Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian," Zabel said, "did a good job." The end result, he said, is a film that 
realized his goals: to show an audience that "the future can be rewritten. We 
can avert tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 This mix of show-biz and ecology seems to be a flavor-of-the-season at PBS on 
Mondays. In "Future Quest," pop culture meets pure science. It's as if the MTV 
staff took over the reins of PBS mainstays "Nature" and "Nova." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the initial episode of this series on the future out-rated all 
other PBS shows, including "Masterpiece Theatre." 
</P>
<P>
 In the episodes previewed by Earthwatch there were lots of interesting gizmos 
flashing around on the screen, some in scenes culled from vintage sci-fi 
flicks. Perhaps physics is too much emphasized and biology not enough, but the 
most interesting elements of the series are the faces of the people 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a forthcoming episode, titled "Planet Patrol," a veteran environmentalist 
named Scott Mathes is seen leading school-age members of the California 
Environmental Project into the Santa Susana Mountains above Simi Valley to pull 
trash out of the canyons. He is as appealing and positive a character as any in 
nighttime TV series. 
</P>
<P>
 The science adviser on the series, Berkeley astronomer Timothy Ferris, appears 
frequently on camera, using his movie-star charm to deliver some rather barbed 
remarks -- for PBS or any TV network. At one point he assails viewers' wasteful 
consumer habits: "We are gobbling up everything in sight, leaving our kids to 
take care of themselves. They will curse us as fools and have every right to do 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 That's environmentalism this season, as seen on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 News at 11. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: The TV broadcast of the Environmental Media Awards event is Sunday, at 
8 p.m. on the cable channel TBS Superstation. Videocassettes of the movie 
"Official Denial" are currently available at major local video stores. PBS' 
"Future Quest" documentary series runs Mondays at 8 p.m.

ON THE ROAD: RELYING ON INSTINCT TO KEEP BARBARIANS AT BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Theresa McConville is discussing that special moment when parents, in the 
throes of divorce, abuse the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Not hit them, mind you. Not even yell at them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's when the parents go barbarian on one another, and the kids get to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," McConville says, "it's when Dad swings by McDonald's to pick up 
his son on visitation rights -- the restaurant having been determined to be a 
'safe' place for the battling parents to briefly meet -- and he manages to slam 
Mom's hand in the car door and start to drive away." 
</P>
<P>
 She pauses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not exactly what we want for our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 McConville is not a therapist, although on this occasion she is speaking to 
nearly 70 of them over lunch at Spanish Hills Country Club. Neither is she a 
divorce mediator, strictly speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 McConville's a lawyer. A lawyer with attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lawyers?" she asks. "Did you ever call a lawyer? 'Oh, sorry, I can't talk 
about that -- that's confidential. Oh, sorry, I don't have time right now. Oh, 
sorry sorry.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But lawyers have time to talk to the Canon photocopier man when he comes to 
the office. Did you know that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Most lawyers are busy thinking they're God." 
</P>
<P>
 The product of God's hourly labor, of course, can be a determination that 
McDonald's is an appropriate meeting venue for people known to behave like 
junkyard dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to change that," McConville says. "The issues in divorce and custody 
cases are often lost in the process, in the battling. And the kids are the ones 
caught in the middle. That's what we're talking about here, the kids. You can 
help us do better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McConville approaches her audience with savvy. She knows that many members of 
the California Assn. of Marriage and Family Therapists are in their second 
careers. Therapy is like that: People often come to it and practice it after 
they have some real life experience under their belts. 
</P>
<P>
 McConville, who has a flourishing Ventura County law practice in contested 
custody cases, is on her third career -- if you don't count the minute she 
spent trying to become a realtor. She's fourth-generation in this county, the 
daughter of a cop. Her first job after college was as a deputy for the Ventura 
County sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 That lasted until an entrepreneurial itch got her and she went into the 
ambulance business. But that's a trade immersed in liability and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 So she picked up a law degree, has been in practice for 15 years. She's thea 
mother of four, she will tell you, although two of her children are 
stepchildren -- the natural children of her second husband. She will also tell 
you that "kids can benefit from diverse environments as long as those 
environments are not hammering away at each other." 
</P>
<P>
 In lawyering, McConville found that she had "an instinct" for contested 
custody cases that made her an A-list choice "on the father underground" and 
obviated the need for a Yellow Pages ad. Most important, though, is her belief 
that "instinct is important" in all proceedings, legal or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McConville focuses her argument. She is plain about what happens when a 
divorcing mom and dad show up at court in Ventura County, a venue in which 
mediators conduct their work in the presence of opposing lawyers -- some of 
whom are so volatile as to "litigate whether this is (Thursday)." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how many times I've wasted away in Mediationville," she 
quips. "But the good news on that is while I sit around court doing nothing, I 
get to know the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always call me and ask: 'Will you fight for me? How often do you win?' 
And I tell them: 'This is about losing. It's a degree of losing.' And all the 
while, in the losing, the kids are on a chess board getting pushed around." 
</P>
<P>
 She tells the therapists, many of whom conduct assessments as part of 
mediation, that they can do two things to help. The first is to publish a 
brochure with their photos, biographies and special strengths for distribution 
to members of the Ventura County Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lawyers need people who have something to give to them," she says. "In the 
case of kids and family dynamics, that's you. But lawyers don't know that. If 
it's right in front of them, with your pictures, they will. You might include 
information on how clients will pay -- do you take Visa? Simply state what the 
client's options are. We need this information if we're going to make things 
better for everyone, especially the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The second suggestion is that a supervised drop-off center be established so 
that Dad can deliver the kid and leave before Mom arrives and risks getting 
assaulted -- a place to which any reasonable court might happily make 
assignment. (By the end of lunch, a knot of therapists is busy on this front.) 
</P>
<P>
 These are mere arrangements, however. What McConville is really selling 
operates at a level deeper than the law and is buried in the substrata of 
personality itself: instinct. The inherent nature to know what's needed and to 
do what's right. In crisis, when people sometimes go barbarian, the right 
instinct may be the first thing to go. While some bystanders can help in this 
circumstance, others get hurt. Dogs do bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, kids don't instinctively screw themselves up," McConville says. "It 
takes us adults to do that to them."

JAUNTS; PATCHING TOGETHER A GREAT EXPERIENCE; LOCAL PUMPKIN PURVEYORS OFFER A 
WIDE VARIETY OF ENTERTAINMENT -- FROM HAUNTED HOUSES TO HAYRIDES AND MUSIC.

 If you're in search of the great pumpkin, you'll find a lot more than just 
pumpkins at the pumpkin patches around the county these days. Hauling away one 
of the gorgeous gourds is almost a gala event. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest pumpkin extravaganza is being served up this weekend and 
next at the McGrath Street Pumpkin Patch in Ventura. There you'll find 
everything from a haunted house to spooky storytellers and nonstop live 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The open classroom program at Ventura's Blanche Reynolds Elementary School is 
taking over part of the McGrath patch this year for its "Pumpkin Moon Faire." 
The festivities run this Saturday and Sunday, and Oct. 29 and 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The haunted house, for kids 10 and younger, will be set up in a moving van 
loaned to the school by Allied Van Lines, according to one of the parent 
organizers, Sydney Harris. Students in the open classrooms are designing the 
interior with ghoulish touches, like gigantic spider webs and spiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Craft booths will be set up where children can make trick-or-treat bags or 
masks, paint pumpkins, get their faces painted and their hair sprayed in 
Halloween colors. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is hauling in a mobile stage for the musical entertainment that 
includes folk, country, blues and rock 'n' roll bands, along with a 
magician/juggler, and six storytellers from Ventura Storytellers. The food 
lineup includes chili made by a Blanche Reynolds parent, candy apples and 
pumpkin bread. On Oct. 30, there will be a drawing for trips and other prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no charge for admission to the fair, but the school is charging for 
the booth crafts, the haunted house and some other activities. Proceeds from 
the fair will benefit the school's open classroom program. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if you simply want a pumpkin or winter squash or maybe Indian corn, 
the McGrath Street Pumpkin Patch, open daily, has its usual harvest, along with 
free hayrides and petting zoo with goats, horses and rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what's going on at other major pumpkin patches around the county: 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner Farm -- Here you'll find seven acres of pumpkins to choose from, some 
over 200 pounds, along with winter squash, Indian corn, mini pumpkins and 
gourds. Hayrides are $2, Model T rides $1. Kids can see farm animals. The Old 
Country Trio Plus One entertains on weekends, noon to 4 p.m. Pumpkin bread and 
cookies are on sale. Adults can eat pie on the porch of the restored Victorian 
Faulkner home on Saturdays and Sundays from 1 to 3:30 p.m. Located at Briggs 
and Telegraph roads, near Santa Paula. Open 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily. 
Information: 525-9293. 
</P>
<P>
 Tierra Rejada Ranch -- Pumpkins are scattered over seven acres here too, but 
the large ones are not gigantic. Wagon rides at half-hour intervals are free. 
Farm animals are out for viewing, and for $2, kids can take a pony ride. Tierra 
Rejada is also a pick-your-own produce farm, and some vegetables -- tomatoes, 
green beans, cucumbers and peppers -- are ripe for picking now. The farm's 
produce stand also is open. Located at 3370 Moorpark Road, Moorpark. Open 9 
a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Information: 529-3690. 
</P>
<P>
 Boccali Ranch -- If you want a more pastoral pumpkin experience, this spot 
tucked between Ojai and Santa Paula is the one. Its two acres of pumpkins 
include miniatures that cost 50 cents, up to 100-pounders in the $25 range, as 
well as gourds and Indian corn. Free hayrides run on the weekends. Located on 
Highway 150, midway between the two cities. Open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

FOR THE KIDS; A WALK ON THE CHILD SIDE; DECORATIVE TILE WORK, MADE BY ABOUT 
1,500 YOUNGSTERS LAST SPRING, WILL BE DEDICATED AT 11 A.M. SUNDAY, FOLLOWED BY 
A FREE 1 P.M. ART FESTIVAL.

<P>
 While people ooh and ah over the new Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks this 
weekend, kids will have some artwork of their own to admire outside the theater 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,500 children from all over the Conejo Valley had a hand in making the 
meandering sidewalk outside the complex. They each decorated tiles last spring 
that were finally laid into the sidewalk last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive tile project, sponsored by the city, will be dedicated Sunday amid 
all the hoopla over the Arts Plaza's grand opening. But the dedication, which 
begins at 11 a.m., is a real children's event. After the formalities, they can 
join in a treasure hunt and see some entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The affair will be followed at 1 p.m. by more kid stuff: The Children's 
Festival of the Arts. Put on by the Conejo Recreation and Park District, this 
free outdoor event is crammed with arts and crafts activities for kids who like 
to be creatively messy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's geared for children 3 to 12 years old. They can do everything from 
decorating Pogs to painting rocks and creating sculptures out of wood scraps. 
They'll learn how to weave on canvas with yarn and how to make tile trivets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Chapter of the National Charity League is helping put on the 
festival, which organizers anticipate will draw about 3,000 children. The 
league will have 100 teen-age girls on hand to help the children with the 
crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 During the afternoon, the children can take a break from the activities and 
enjoy a slate of entertainers that includes: the California Dance Theatre and 
the Ritter Dance Company, both of Agoura Hills, along with Bobbie's School of 
Performing Arts, Conejo Valley Cloggers, Conejo Clarinet Consort and Fanfare 
Dance Team, all of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival runs until 4 p.m. -- plenty of time to peruse the sidewalk tile 
art too. The city held workshops last May and June, giving children a chance to 
draw on and paint a 6-inch-square piece of tile. Special provisions were made 
to include the artwork of disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
 The children paid $5 for the privilege so the project was carried off without 
any city funds, according to Carol Williams, a senior management analyst and 
co-chairwoman of the effort. GTE chipped in some money for children unable to 
pay the $5. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are amazingly creative," Williams said. The older children were asked to 
design around the concept of giving the world a gift. The younger ones were 
given another theme -- Jungleland, which was previously located on the site of 
the theater complex -- so many design motifs are animals.

 Speaking of the jungle, Cal Lutheran University's Children's Theatre will 
stage Edward Mast's "Jungalbook" at the new Civic Arts Plaza this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted from Rudyard Kipling's tales, this is the story of the boy Mowgli, who 
was raised in India's jungle by wolves. It has the other familiar characters -- 
Baloo the bear, Bagheera the panther, and Sherakhan the tiger. 
</P>
<P>
 In this production, though, the actors wear contemporary clothes while their 
masks and movements make it clear which characters they are portraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Barbara Wegher-Thompson, the cast will be performing in the 
smaller Forum Theatre. The 13-member cast includes some local students, Elisa 
Johns and Bret-Jordan Kreiensieck, both of Thousand Oaks, in the roles of 
Sherakhan and Bagheera. 
</P>
<P>
 Show times are 3:30 p.m. Friday, 1 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 
p.m. Tickets are $6. For more information, call 449-ARTS.

THEATER REVIEWS; TWO PRODUCTIONS LACK STUDENTS, BUT NOT CLASS; SANTA BARBARA 
COLLEGES HOST 'KING LEAR' AND 'SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION' FEATURING FACULTY, 
LOCAL AND VISITING ARTISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two productions opened last weekend at collegiate venues -- but don't be 
misled. Neither "King Lear" at UC Santa Barbara nor "Six Degrees of Separation" 
at Santa Barbara City College are student productions, but professional-caliber 
stagings worthy of serious attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lear" is the latest project from UCSB's Theatre Artists Group, an 
interdepartmental program spotlighting the talents of faculty and visiting 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six Degrees" features an impressive array of performers and technical 
specialists drawn from Santa Barbara's theatrical community. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanning centuries and sensibilities, the shows represent different takes on 
the nature of identity -- Shakespeare's timeless descent into the painful birth 
of a self and John Guare's abstract meditation on our uniquely 20th Century 
brand of alienation. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, you can't go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 You couldn't ask for a more lucid, insightful and impeccably realized staging 
of Shakespeare's greatest tragedy than director Robert G. Egan's inspired 
production at UCSB. 
</P>
<P>
 Without recourse to exotic resettings or other ephemeral gimmickry, Egan sets 
his sights on a clear and faithful rendering of the text, and his confidence 
that the work speaks forcefully to our own time proves well-founded. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of Lear is the supreme test of a mature actor's craft, and guest 
artist Al Ruscio, a familiar face from film and television, rises magnificently 
to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 But however successful, Ruscio's Lear doesn't overpower the production. He's 
well-balanced by George Backman's Earl of Gloucester (similarly undone by 
deceit and his own folly in the play's parallel tragedy); Joshua Haber's 
scheming Edmund, the first existential character in literature; Frank W.D. 
Ries's all-seeing Fool, and Michael Morgan's exiled Edgar. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who claim that "King Lear" is the greatest play in the English language 
will find plenty here to bolster their argument. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Barbara City College is playwright John Guare's quirky puzzle-box 
drama, "Six Degrees of Separation." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathematicians tell us that separating any two people on the planet is a chain 
of only six acquaintances. Guare maintains that the psychological gulfs between 
us are far greater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six Degrees" sketches the forms alienation takes in the midst of the 
enlightened egalitarian society on which we Americans pride ourselves 
</P>
<P>
 It's a false comfort, Guare maintains. He holds up to scrutiny a contemporary 
upscale Manhattan couple -- the Kittredges, an art dealer (Tony Miratti) and 
his partner/wife (Laurel Lyle) -- who find their professed liberal humanism 
tested by Paul (Edd Stockton), a young black man who gains entree into their 
home by claiming to be the son of Sidney Poitier. 
</P>
<P>
 In framing Paul's quest to remake himself as a member of the Kittredges' class 
-- white, cultured and wealthy -- the play brushes up against a plethora of 
social issues without addressing any of them in depth. Like the Kittredges, 
we're confronted with an ambiguity without a pat interpretation -- the dramatic 
equivalent of the massive double-sided Kandinsky painting (vibrantly reproduced 
by scene designer Patricia L. Frank) that dominates the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of director Rick Mokler's staging is likewise steeped in the play's 
intentional abstraction, and it falls to the performers to supply the human 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Most successful in this regard are Miratti's increasingly testy Kittredge and 
Stockton's breezy, elegant Paul, who ultimately drops the mask of 
self-assurance to reveal a frightening portrait of a self without a center, an 
identity shaped not by experience (as we saw in King Lear), but rather by the 
frustrated desires nurtured by hollow social values. Details

 Come December everyone will be talking about the "sounds of the holidays." You 
know, sleigh bells a-jing-jing-a-ling, Bing Crosby crooning, that gentle sound 
of champagne glasses clinking in holiday toasts. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's still October, folks. And we've decided that it's about time people 
pay more attention to the under-appreciated sounds of the present holiday 
season. We're talking about the lovely, sweet sounds (OK, make it shrill, 
grotesque noises) of Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween revelers pay plenty of attention to costumes . . . and fake lips . . 
. and oozing blood-like concoctions. But what would the occasion be without a 
fair share of clunks, thumps, shrieks, howls, and blood-curdling screams? Ahh, 
music to a ghoul's ears. So, last week we went shopping for those sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 We knocked on the doors of Michaels crafts store in Ventura, K mart in Santa 
Paula, Thrifty in Fillmore, and It's A Party (formerly It's My Party) in Ojai. 
The sounds we found came in many forms -- from cassette tapes to high-tech 
sound-activated gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's start with the gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two that particularly caught our ears. The first, which we found at 
K mart, was a thing called "Lite-Up Spooky Tunes." It's a gizmo that looks like 
a Walkman (without a headset), but push the buttons on top and you get a trio 
of screams and growls (not to mention flashing lights). Price: $4.99, and 
that's with two AA batteries included. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a good time to note that the biggest trick-or-treat for shoppers of 
sounds, is the batteries. Some gadgets include them, some don't. It varied 
considerably, so keep an eye on the small print. 
</P>
<P>
 The second item at the top of our list was the "It's Alive! Candy Dish" 
selling at Michaels for $19.99. The ceramic ghost-shaped dish lets out a scream 
when candy is taken from it. And it's not a bad-looking dish even without the 
electronics. Two AA batteries are not included in this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels had some other pretty remarkable noisemakers too. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the "Pumpkin Impostor," a sound-activated Jack-O-Lantern look-alike 
that lights up and says "Happy Halloween" when someone walks near ($12.99, 
batteries not included); and the sound-activated "Electronic Door Plaque" that 
looks like Frankenstein's Monster and lets out a ghost laugh when approached. 
It's priced at $12.99 without the batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrifty also had a version of an electronic door plaque. This one, a "Witch 
Head Door Plaque" or "Illuminated Screaming Door Plaque." The sound-activated 
device lets out "eerie screams." K mart also had "Boo Door Knockers" that look 
like demons of some sort, intended to be mounted to the front door. When a 
trick-or-treater knocks on it, it says, "Beware . . . Welcome," backed by an 
eerie bell toll. The words are barely audible, but the item is only $9.99 and 
that includes the batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Assorted other items we found included little sound-activated boxes, covered 
with a ghost, witch, pumpkin, or spider cloth. K mart had them for $4.99 and 
$5.99 (for the spider), batteries included. Slightly higher-quality versions 
were going for $9.99 without the batteries at It's A Party. 
</P>
<P>
 It's A Party was also selling "Spooky Hammers." The cute, fluorescent toys, in 
the shape of a long arm and creepy hand, clenching either a scarecrow, ghost, 
or witch, make whistles and squeaky sounds. On a far less cute note, Thrifty 
had "The Electronic Devil's Sickle," which makes a screaming sound, for $5.99 
with batteries not included. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels had the largest selection, four tapes from K-tel, all priced at 
$3.99. There was "Screeches, Clanks, & Howls," featuring those old favorites 
"Demented Dentist," "Lunatic Laughter" and "Hits, Stabs, & Splats"; 
"Halloween's Greatest Stories" by Edgar Allan Poe; "Scary Sounds of Halloween"; 
and "Sounds to Haunt Your House." 
</P>
<P>
 K mart was selling a one-hour CD ($4.99) or tape ($2.99) called "Spooky Tales 
and Scary Sounds," featuring 35 sound effects including fighting cats, a 
heartbeat, and a creaky door. The store also had a 45-minute "Chamber of 
Horrors" tape for $1.69. Thrifty had a "Spooky Sounds" tape of "chilling sound 
effects for haunted houses, ghouls, and gremlins of all ages" for $1.49. And 
for $3, It's A Party was selling a 45-minute tape of "Peter and the Werewolf -- 
A Ghost Story with a Happy Ending." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, despite all the weird noises Halloween, too, is intended to have a happy 
ending -- even without the jing-jing-a-ling.

LECTURE; AUTHOR'S NEW BOOK GETS TO THE KERNEL OF AMERICAN VEGETABLE; LEND 
WRITER AN EAR AND YOU MAY LEARN EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT CORN, AND 
ALSO HAVE A CHANCE TO EAT IT LOTS OF WAYS. 
</P>

 Depending upon the dreamer, an ideal single-course meal might include one of 
any number of things. But corn? Probably not even in the Top 100. Corn sounds 
about as exciting as the yawning contest no one had the strength to enter at 
the Valium convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Fussell, who wrote "The Story of Corn," and makes the grain as exciting 
as it gets, disagrees. She will give a slide and lecture presentation at the 
Monday meeting of the Santa Barbara chapter of the American Institute of Wine & 
Food. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting in the spirit of the occasion will be the San Ysidro Ranch's executive 
chef, Gerard Thompson, who will concoct a four-course, all-corn menu, which is 
definitely not for the corn dog and Diet Pepsi people. The meal will include 
items such as polenta ravioli in a sweet corn broth, barbecued duck tostadas 
with corn cream and smoked salmon, and corn fritters. No corn liquor this time, 
but plenty of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fussell's book, heavier than a bushel of corn, came out in 1992 and is in its 
sixth printing. It tells us that civilization on the Western Hemisphere was 
built not on greed or even concrete, but on corn. And Fussell is no Nebraska 
Cornhusker with delusions of grandeur, she's a native Californian relocated to 
New York. She also has a doctorate in English Literature and a growing 
reputation as a culinary historian. 
</P>
<P>
 And while her book may be without dinosaurs, serial killers, or Nazis, "The 
Story of Corn" does have plenty of the other stuff contemporary Americans seem 
to crave -- sex, violence, whiskey, human sacrifice, cannibalism, football, and 
yes, smut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to find a distinctive American cuisine, and the unifying thread 
was corn," said the writer during a recent phone interview. "It opened a 
virtual Pandora's Box. It's been the basis of our agribusiness since the 
1850s." 
</P>
<P>
 Fussell's book is a cornucopia of corn facts, and then some. It seems to be in 
everything but one's thoughts, though it is in Garrison Keillor's: "People have 
tried and tried, but sex is not better than sweet corn," he is quoted in the 
book. Woebegone, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only 1% of the corn grown is used for human consumption; 99% goes for 
something else," said Fussell. "If the corn silos were destroyed, the whole 
industrial machine would break down. Most corn is used for fodder or industrial 
starch." 
</P>
<P>
 Want corn numbers besides the score of the Nebraska game? The 1% translates 
into three pounds of corn per person per day. And further, one bushel of corn 
translates into 15 pounds of retail beef, 26 pounds of pork, and 37 pounds of 
poultry. Corn oil or corn syrup is in everything from paint to processed foods 
to rubber tires to embalming fluid. Cornstarch can be found in aspirin, 
aluminum, sponges and all dehydrated, powdered or granulated foods. There's 
even corn in the 212-area code that Fussell calls home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corn is everywhere. It's grown on Long Island and New Jersey," she said. 
"Many people don't know that China is the second-largest producer of corn in 
the world. Conditions in Manchuria are similar to those in our own Corn Belt. 
Corn is the most hybridized of any major plant in the world, and it can grow in 
more places than any other plant in the world. It can grow in the polar regions 
to the hottest rain forest. Wheat or rice won't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The chapter on the sex life of corn probably won't make it to the Playboy 
Channel, but corn did begin as a fun plant. Mumuchitl, parched corn, fluffed 
maize or popcorn was the first corn -- yes, even older than Orville 
Redenbacher. Today, the average American consumes 56 quarts of popcorn each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corn originated in the Yucatan Peninsula and the surrounding rain forests. 
It's older than rice and almost as old as wheat. Corn was being planted almost 
8,000 years ago. It tells us who we are and where we came from," Fussell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the plant grows everywhere, such diverse locations as Turkey, China, 
India and Africa claim corn as a native. Corn has virtually thousands of 
different names depending upon the society and which of the more than 8,000 
varieties is being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fussell's book and slide show (once presented at the Smithsonian Institute) 
also touch upon the fun side of corn, relating in detail the history of Cracker 
Jack, commercial popcorn companies, the birth of Kellogg's Corn Flakes and also 
Fritos. 
</P>
<P>
 She discusses hominy, tortillas, tamales, corncob pipes, Peruvian corn beer, 
whiskey, farm machinery, the rise of corn in the Corn Belt, and corn smut, 
which probably needs a new name. It will be on the menu as huitlacoche , which 
is a black-blue fungus akin to a mushroom. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the author, there's no rival out there trying to steal her 
thunder by writing a history of peas or beans, and there can't be much more to 
say about corn. Fussell's next book will deal with the contentious struggle 
among vegetarians and carnivores. 
</P>

RESTAURANT REVIEW; RED LOBSTER PUTS A PINCH ON QUALITY; THOUGH SOME DISHES ARE 
GOOD AND FRESH, OTHER OFFERINGS ARE POOR AND FLAVORLESS. SIMPLE BROILED HALIBUT 
WAS A HIT.

 The Red Lobster chain of restaurants dots the United States with astonishing 
success. Whether it's the Red Lobster on Route 17 in northern New Jersey or the 
Red Lobster off the Ventura Freeway in Oxnard, the dining room is always 
running full-tilt with happy customers facing tan mounds of fried shrimp or 
combo plates sprouting large pink and white branches known as crab legs. 
</P>
<P>
 The decor is nautically contrived, with giant wood-carved fish hanging from 
one wall and ships' nameplates mounted on all others. It is hard to know what 
Bluenose, the Maine-to-Nova Scotia ferry, would mean to folks here, but then 
there is much about Red Lobster that eludes. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for a table, for example, note the lobby rack bearing pamphlets 
on healthful, low-fat, low-cholesterol eating -- all designed, it would seem, 
to militate against deep frying and fatty, cheesy sauces. Once seated, note the 
fat-happy menu boasting broccoli cheese soup, shrimp in cream and cheese sauce, 
mushrooms stuffed with deviled crab beneath a mantle of melted cheese, and all 
manner of breaded and deep-fried and sauced fish. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, the menu also contains lean, broiled and boiled choices. But the 
house gesture toward health consciousness does seem to carry with it an 
ambiguously blubbery wink of the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion persists when an ebullient server, to whom an order of blackened 
salmon has been placed, offers that she's never liked fish at all and instead 
prefers chicken. Well, thank you. (More on the salmon later.) 
</P>
<P>
 The food here is generally fair and undistinguished, dipping as low as poor 
and flavorless and as high as good and fresh. Variable quality alone never 
scares me off -- it's hard to turn out large amounts of good food anywhere, 
chain or not, and I am always grateful for the properly grilled piece of fresh 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 But we are not talking about a seaside shack here. Red Lobster can be pricey 
if you don't watch it, with dinner for two with a beer for each of you easily 
hitting the $50 mark. That, combined with mixed results from the kitchen, makes 
the place awfully costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Among appetizers, the deep-fried calamari ($3.99) are tough and, but for herbs 
in the breading, flavorless. Bayou-style seafood gumbo ($2.65 a cup) is a 
thickened, roux-brown brew, which requires endless fishing to find the 1 1/2 
microshrimp that qualify as seafood content. New England clam chowder ($2.25) 
is nominally better -- it bears plenty of clam bits and flavor -- but suffers 
from too much thickening. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, go for the shrimp cocktail ($5.35), in which the crustaceans are 
plump, flavorsome, and just-slightly undercooked, and the better for it. 
Lobster-stuffed mushrooms ($5.99) are fresh and satisfying, if a bit shy in 
lobster flavor and content. Parmesan zucchini ($2.99) is a decadent hit, 
arriving fresh and crisp, encased in buttery batter and plentiful enough for a 
table of two or three. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrimp quesadillas ($4.99) are a lush sight but disappoint: Even a lusty 
Cheddar filling leavened by green onions can't overcome a scattering of tiny, 
flavorless shrimp. Salads, included with dinner, cut both ways. Caesar is goopy 
in the dressing, while cole slaw is crisp and refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 The single best entree sampled was the simplest: broiled halibut ($14.99). The 
fish was fresh, sweet, succulent, generously cut, expertly handled under the 
flame. Its accompaniment of sauteed fresh yellow and green squash, spiked with 
onion and mixed herbs, was just right. But the blackened salmon ($13.99) was a 
confusion: The fish lacked flavor from within, and its alleged incendiary Cajun 
coating, while visibly present, lacked any fire whatsoever. The sensation was 
one of eating virtual blackened salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Swordfish grilled with lemon pepper ($16.59) straddled the fair-to-good mark: 
fresh and flavorful in the fillet but wan and lost in a treatment that sounded 
bold and promising. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking the heart to order large fried shrimp -- a dish so popular it is 
offered in three sizes, with prices ranging from $10.35 to $14.35 -- I did 
engage a Neptune's Feast ($12.65). This combo plate included the large 
butterflied and fried shrimp (OK, a bit chewy, too much breading), broiled fish 
fillet (delightfully tender), bay scallops (no flavor), and deviled crab cake 
(busy, blurry, mushy, indistinct). 
</P>
<P>
 The place takes its name from the lobster, so a live 1 1/4-pounder from Maine 
was ordered at lunch for the hefty sum of $26.95 (recently market priced at 
$23.35). Plucked from the tank in the lobby and steamed to retain as much 
flavor as possible, this crawler showed apparent mileage: The meat was lacking 
in the inherent sweetness of Maine lobsters, and its texture was too tough for 
the money. This, indeed, made for the saddest confusion of all. 
</P>
<P>
 When in doubt, always reach for the one thing that does come out right here -- 
a decadence called hot cheese garlic bread. It accompanies every entree. It is 
salty, lush, a once-in-a-while indulgence that lights up the good and cushions 
the bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are OK, best among them a key lime pie ($2.65) that is tart and 
assertive in the filling and crumbly in a thick crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Lobster's wine selection is modest but very fairly priced, with some 
varieties offered by the glass. Details

COLOMBIAN THIEVES GET AWAY WITH $30 MILLION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thieves stole nearly $30 million in peso currency from a branch of Colombia's 
Central Bank in one of the biggest heists in the country's history, the bank 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than half of the loot -- about 18.5 billion pesos -- was in crisp new 
bills of various denominations that were never issued and are considered 
worthless, the bank said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a group of gunmen entered the Valledupar branch in northern 
Colombia last weekend, tied up the guards, knocked out the security system of 
alarms and closed-circuit television cameras and broke into the safe using an 
acetylene torch.

WORKING OUT THE LAST-MINUTE BUGS; RADIO: WITH ARRIVAL TODAY OF KCLU-FM, THE 
COUNTY GETS ITS OWN NPR OUTLET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran University's new public radio station was due for its debut in 
less than 24 hours and programming director Mike West was a little distracted. 
</P>
<P>
 West had a few odds and ends to take care of Wednesday before the darkened ON 
AIR sign above the production room door at KCLU-FM's Thousand Oaks studio would 
be turned on at the crack of dawn today. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of West sat a stack of 80 compact-disc recordings of contemporary and 
classic jazz. By the time Ventura County's first National Public 
Radio-affiliated station was on the air, West was hoping to have listened to 
each one. 
</P>
<P>
 But reviewing the discs, making notes on style, tempo and appropriateness of 
each for the contemporary jazz format of KCLU-FM 88.3, was rapidly becoming a 
mathematical impossibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earlier I would listen to the whole CD," West said, hitting the fast-forward 
button on the compact-disc player. "But now we're out of time." 
</P>
<P>
 This week has been a mad scramble of last-minute preparations for West, 
general manager Dan Kuntz and the rest of the station's staff. There are four 
paid positions and nearly 30 volunteers, including students and faculty 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment in the booth KCLU will use for talk shows was still being 
installed Wednesday, the schedules for the volunteer broadcasters have yet to 
be determined and West was resigning himself to a lot of early mornings and 
late nights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that, he says, is quite all right. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you make the commitment, you're just going to have to forget about your 
free time," West said. "You just have to put the time in if you want to have 
quality programming." 
</P>
<P>
 The station will be on the air from 5 a.m. to midnight every day, starting 
with NPR's "Morning Edition" news program. "Fresh Air," a talk-show about 
contemporary issues, and "All Things Considered," a news show, will air from 3 
p.m. to 5:30 p.m. In between the NPR programming, KCLU will air jazz, some 
local news and a talk show dealing with issues specific to Ventura County three 
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting off with a real simple philosophy," West said. "But the 
schedule is designed to grow. We are really going to try to be the hometown 
station for Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 National Public Radio is already available in the county, but KCLU said some 
residents complain that it is hard to find on the radio dial. Ventura and 
Oxnard pick up Santa Monica's public radio station KCRW-FM 89.9 signal from a 
200-watt transmitter on top of Laguna Peak at Point Mugu State Park, said KCRW 
engineer Will Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 But south of the transmitter, the signal goes fuzzy again until the listener 
travels closer to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai, KCRW's signal converts to another frequency, 102.1 FM. In Moorpark 
and Santa Paula, it picks up again at 102.3. Both signals come from weaker 
transmitters of eight to 12 watts. By next year, Lewis said, the station hopes 
to boost the power on its Laguna Peak transmitter. KCRW has 5,000 subscribers 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Kuntz and West are hoping to attract listeners who are tired of 
adjusting their dials as they drive around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard from so many people, 'I can't wait to get public radio clearly,' " 
West said. "This area is really crying out for a nice strong signal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 KCLU's signal is transmitted from a 1,200-watt tower on top of Calleguas Peak, 
four miles from the Cal Lutheran campus. It will be capable of reaching 500,000 
listeners, according to Kuntz. But because of nearby mountain ranges, residents 
in Ojai, Santa Paula and Fillmore mostly likely will not get the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, the station began sending out a test signal every six minutes, 
starting with the sound of a crashing wave, followed by the sound of 
approaching horses' hoofs and a voice saying, "Listen. We're getting turned on 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want it to sound like a storm is coming," Kuntz said. "But we want 
it to be an exciting change." 
</P>
<P>
 For Matt Smith, a junior communications major from Oceanside, working as a 
disc jockey at an NPR affiliate is a far cry from the old student radio 
station, which went on the air through cable television, and then only on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically nobody listened," Smith said. "We just had fun amusing ourselves. 
We had to touch the antennae with the TV cable to get a signal. We were 
supposed to be on all the time, but no one really knew how to get on the air." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is way more professional," he added. "It's amazing to me that I can get 
this kind of experience on campus." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate the debut of KCLU-FM, Cal Lutheran is holding an open house and 
"Sign-On" party from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. today. The public is invited for 
refreshments, a presentation by radio personality Norman Corwin, and a chance 
to record messages to be aired on the station. Call 493-3151 for information.

SCHOOL UNIFORM PROPOSAL DRAWS LACKLUSTER BACKING; EDUCATION: ONLY THREE OF THE 
17 ELEMENTARY CAMPUSES IN THE VENTURA DISTRICT SHOW ENOUGH INTEREST AMONG 
PARENTS TO PURSUE THE IDEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, PECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six months after the Ventura Unified School District proposed that elementary 
schools require students to wear uniforms, the overwhelming majority of schools 
have given their answer. 
</P>
<P>
 No thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Informal school surveys and reports from principals show only lackluster 
support for uniforms among parents at 14 of the district's 17 elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interest was not there," Oak View School Principal Shelley Pratt said. 
"We're satisfied with what we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Only three of the district's elementary schools -- Poinsettia, Mound and Arnaz 
-- found enough parent interest to explore the issue further, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the lack of enthusiasm at most elementary schools, officials have now 
begun an effort to enlist parental support for uniforms at middle schools. 
Cabrillo Middle School plans to send out written surveys next month, and 
Anacapa Middle School has already begun calling its 1,000 parents. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far the people conducting the surveys are avoiding using the word 
uniform in their dealings with parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word uniform just makes people gasp," Anacapa Principal Charlotte McElroy 
said. So callers from the Anacapa Parent-Teachers' Organization are asking 
parents if they would like to choose from a designated color scheme, McElroy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she thinks surveying parents on school uniforms without specifically 
mentioning uniforms might be misleading, McElroy said no. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, principals from all four middle schools, including DeAnza 
and Balboa, will meet to consider mandating that all students in grades six 
through eight trade in their shorts and leggings for dark slacks and plaid 
skirts. School officials said they would establish such a rule only with 
parents' support. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Joseph Spirito likewise said elementary schools should only require 
uniforms if parents want it. "Although I personally would like to see it . . . 
I'm not going to push it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Spirito first proposed school uniforms last spring, he said he wanted to 
begin at elementary schools. Parents of middle school students would more 
readily accept uniforms, he said at the time, if their children had worn them 
in lower grades. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, the superintendent said he is open to middle schools 
adopting uniforms ahead of elementary schools if there is enough parental 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what individual schools decide, Spirito said he still hopes 
there will be at least one Ventura school whose students wear uniforms next 
year: a planned "back-to-basics" school to be established somewhere within the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived as a magnet school that would draw students from around the 
district, the back-to-basics school would combine uniforms for students with 
required volunteer work from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, students and teachers would sign contracts agreeing to the school's 
strict standards for dress and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 A district committee is now trying to find a school to convert to the 
back-to-basics format, but has so far been unable to find any school where 
parents clearly want the proposed change. Some committee members have said they 
are leaning toward Will Rogers School, although Spirito did not include that 
school among the three where there is any significant parental support for 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of converting the entire school to a back-to-basics concept, the 
committee has been discussing the possibility of launching a scaled-down 
version of the proposed school in a bank of empty classrooms at an old campus 
next to Will Rogers currently being used by the Ventura Adult School. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Will Rogers has been singled out by some as a possible site, Spirito 
said Wednesday that the district still plans to approach a handful of schools 
in Ventura with the idea of converting to the back-to-basics format. He 
expressed hope that parents who have rejected the idea of uniforms might change 
their minds after considering the dress issue as just one part of a package. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although they would not support uniforms for the traditional school, they 
might if it converted to a new outlook," Spirito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the district's main approach to the uniform issue is centering on 
the middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Anacapa's Principal McElroy said Wednesday she maintains her long-held belief 
that uniforms would work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel that that would give us a community feeling, that kids would 
know parents care, that we care," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anacapa Parent-Teachers' Organization is surveying the school's 1,054 
parents by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 186 parents contacted so far by the school group, 72% have said they 
support a required color scheme, 22% were against the idea and 6% were 
undecided, McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy said she would not want all students dressing the same. Rather, the 
school is proposing only that children wear clothes of certain colors, such as 
blue and white. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying the girls can look at walking shorts, pants and a skirt, and the 
boys can look at the walking shorts and the pants," McElroy said. Blue jeans 
may also be acceptable if they were clean and hemmed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo Middle School Principal Kris Bergstrom, another advocate of uniforms, 
said some parents have asked for uniforms as a way to save money. "Parents have 
come to us and said, 'Boy it would be a lot easier if you had a uniform. Then I 
wouldn't have to spend $80 on skater shorts.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At back-to-school night this fall, Bergstrom asked 400 parents to stand if 
they supported high standards of behavior and dress. Everyone rose to their 
feet. But the school has not yet begun to ask parents specifically about 
uniforms.

ELECTIONS / SANTA PAULA COUNCIL; CANDIDATES RUNNING LOW-COST CAMPAIGNS, CALL 
BUSINESS TOP ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a handful of campaign signs dot the storefronts and roadsides around 
Santa Paula, and even fewer brochures have found their way into voters' 
mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few of the candidates for three seats open on the Santa Paula City 
Council will spend much money seeking election, each agrees that the top issues 
facing the city this year are attracting jobs and creating a more favorable 
climate for companies already in business. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest filing statements, the eight candidates will spend 
less than $15,000 combined on their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, voters and candidates are talking primarily about restoring the 
once-thriving downtown and creating jobs for residents of Santa Paula, the 
poorest city in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Other concerns, such as cleaning up graffiti and solving a continuing gang 
problem, have for the most part taken a back seat to business among those who 
would rule the mostly agricultural city of about 25,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime was a big issue in the past," Police Chief Walt Adair said. "But crime 
rates are down substantially in Santa Paula, as much as 25% over last year. So 
it's not surprising it's no longer foremost on people's minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the candidates list attracting business and industry as their top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate, 33-year-old production supervisor Sergio Hernandez, who is 
waging a write-in campaign for a seat on the council, needs 20 valid signatures 
of support by Tuesday to become an official write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County city with the lowest median income -- roughly two-thirds of 
the county average of $45,612 a year -- Santa Paula seemingly has been passed 
by as an investment prospect by builders and developers, candidates and city 
leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowded ballot features a variety of candidates: incumbents seeking return 
trips to the dais; former council members trying to pick up where they left 
off; and political newcomers intent on change. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their varied backgrounds, the candidates use a similar theme in their 
campaigns. It is a message not lost on Santa Paula voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born and raised here," said Daniel Robles, director of the Blanchard 
Community Library in Santa Paula, "and we've really stagnated over the last 15 
to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to look very seriously at economic growth. Now, the way the economy 
is, there isn't enough money to go around to get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides economic development, Mayor Wayne D. Johnson, a first-term council 
member up for reelection, adds increased police and fire services to his list 
of goals. He also wants to better support youth programs such as the Boys & 
Girls Club and improve recent progress made to streamline permits and other 
services at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson reported that he has just under $2,000 to spend getting elected. 
</P>
<P>
 He is on personal leave from his job as an insurance agent that began last 
year as a stress disability leave. Some voters wonder how he can seek 
reelection when he could not work professionally. But Johnson stands on his 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they can start finding fault with the job I've done on the council, then 
they'll have something to talk about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Councilman John A.F. Melton points to his two decades of council 
service and reminds voters that he is well-known by state and federal 
officials, adding that contacts like those pay off at home. 
</P>
<P>
 He also says he wants to expand industry, but opponents point out that he 
voted against the K mart, its jobs and sales tax dollars when it came up for 
review at the City Council several years ago. Melton now says he was merely 
trying to preserve the greenbelt around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging the two incumbents are the town's newspaper publisher, a legal 
clerk, a lumber yard manager, two business owners and a former councilman. 
Councilwoman Margaret A. Ely announced earlier this year that she would not 
seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the eight official candidates, including four-time mayor Melton, filed 
papers saying they would spend less than $1,000 on their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Espinosa, who has a law degree and works as a clerk in the district 
attorney's office while she prepares for the State Bar exam, reported total 
contributions of more than $4,000. She said she would work at enhancing youth 
programs and building stronger relationships between private industry and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Another leading money-gatherer is Santa Paula Times Publisher Don Johnson, no 
relation to the mayor, who has raised more than $3,400 in cash and other 
contributions for his campaign. He touts an economic revitalization plan that 
includes building more middle- and upper-income homes to increase the city's 
tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 Some rival candidates and business owners do not like the idea of the city's 
lone newspaper publisher seeking election to the council. But that doesn't 
bother Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts me in a better position to make sure the truth is getting out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie H. Maland served on the Santa Paula City Council for 24 years before 
being unseated by Robin Sullivan two years ago. He said he is proud of the 
strides the council has taken with its redevelopment funds and other 
improvement plans but that more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula teen-agers need a recreation center much like the Boys & Girls 
Club, he said. Youth programs are "less expensive than adding a few more head 
busters in the police department," Maland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flo Zakrajshek has owned an air-conditioning business in town for three 
decades. The 1993 Santa Paula citizen of the year, Zakrajshek lost a council 
bid two years ago. She said she supports downtown revitalization but objects to 
the Downtown Improvement Plan approved by the council because it is 
misdirected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flower pots, benches and signage is not going to bring shoppers downtown," 
Zakrajshek said. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvement plan targets 1,100 acres as a revitalization center and 
proposes sweeping changes in land use and other regulations over the next 15 
years to lure investment to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Zakrajshek, lumber yard manager John Wisda said the city is not using its 
redevelopment and other funds to its best advantage. He complained that the 
current council would rather buy fixed assets such as swing sets and dump 
trucks rather than offer investment incentives to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisda said he would work to create a low-income home buyers program to beef up 
property tax rolls. "That gives you a return on your investment," he said. 
"Playground equipment does not pay property taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Victor Salas is a lifetime Santa Paula resident who in recent years 
has become more and more politically active. He runs his family's manufacturing 
plant and helped launch the city's Mexican-American Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Salas said he wants a younger and more diverse council to stir up what he 
calls a bureaucratic City Hall that hinders economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of industries come into the city and we seem to put too many 
restrictions on them," Salas said. "So they leave." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The local business community has not endorsed any particular candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the first time, the Santa Paula Area Chamber of Commerce is grilling 
candidates via a questionnaire drawn up by President Dan Diaz, a 
third-generation Santa Paulan whose family has run a local restaurant for 
nearly 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz said he is most concerned with attracting new businesses and employers to 
his hometown. He said he supports the small steps that have been taken in 
recent years, such as the Downtown Improvement Plan, but urges the council to 
begin other programs to help local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in business for 58 years," said Diaz, who said the questionnaire 
results will be distributed to chamber members. "Our survival depends on the 
survival of other businesses in town." 
</P>
<P>
 Other merchants are lobbying against incumbents. Some say the current council 
is responsible for driving businesses away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a real problem with them being anti-business," said Jim McCoy, a 
former council member who runs an automobile repair shop in town. "They've not 
been working with the community as much as they should." 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy filed a complaint with the district attorney questioning how Johnson 
could be on stress disability while serving as mayor. That claim is still under 
investigation, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Rhonda Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Helton, who owns an air-conditioning shop in Santa Paula, said the 
current council needs fresh faces to do away with business-stifling 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're totally out of touch with the people in town, the business people 
that generate the dollars and make things happen," Helton said. "Some of them 
have been on the council for too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Judge Edwin F. Beach rues the recent council decision not to endorse 
Proposition 187, the so-called Save Our State initiative that would deny most 
public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 He also complained that the city administrator and department heads seem to 
have too much control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council lets too many of the decisions be made by staff, rather than 
taking the bull by the horns and telling the staff to carry out the policies 
they set," Beach said. Santa Paula City Council Eight candidates, two of them 
incumbents, are seeking election to three council seats. Each candidate sees a 
need to attract industry and jobs to the city, which has the lowest median 
income in Ventura County. But the candidates have offered little in the way of 
specifics.

<P>
 Laura Espinosa  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 40 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: legal clerk at the Ventura County district attorney's office 
</P>
<P>
 Education: law degree from the Ventura College of Law, associate of arts 
degree in political science from Ventura College 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Espinosa was born and raised in Oxnard but has lived in Santa 
Paula for more than 20 years. Espinosa said she has worked extensively to 
promote the city's youth, including a stint as youth employment director at the 
Santa Paula Boys & Girls Club and 11 years as a volunteer at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Espinosa said she will focus on economic development in the community 
while looking for alternative ways to create funding sources. She wants to 
implement more coalitions among private industry, the city and the schools to 
better educate the residents and to beef up the police force if more revenue 
can be found. She also wants to stimulate home ownership by providing 
incentives to developers to build more affordable housing. 
</P>

<P>
 Don Johnson  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 47 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: newspaper publisher 
</P>
<P>
 Education: graduated from Adolfo Camarillo High School in 1965, attended 
Ventura College for three years 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Johnson arrived in Ventura County in 1962 and served two years in 
Vietnam after high school. After working as business manager of the Simi Valley 
Enterprise, he moved to Santa Paula in 1979 to accept a job as general manager 
of the Santa Paula Chronicle. He launched the Santa Paula Times in January, 
1993, after the Chronicle closed. He recently helped found a citizens watch 
patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Johnson said that increasing the tax base and strengthening the local 
economy are his top issues. He wants to see homes for middle- and higher-income 
buyers built in Santa Paula to balance the city's housing stock and increase 
property tax revenues, and he supports annexing a portion of Adams Canyon to 
the west of Santa Paula to build those homes. He said that the Redevelopment 
Agency efforts begun in the past two years should have been started years ago 
and that more work needs to be done to lure consumers downtown. He said there 
is no conflict of interest between serving on the council and publishing a 
local newspaper.

 Wayne D. Johnson  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 54 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: council incumbent, former insurance agent now on personal leave 
</P>
<P>
 Education: attended El Camino College in Torrance for two years 
</P>
<P>
 Background: A first-term councilman and current mayor, Johnson was born in 
Culver City and moved to Santa Paula in 1972. Before winning a council seat in 
1990, Johnson served on a variety of city-related commissions, including the 
Planning Commission, the Housing Authority and the Mobile Home Rent Review 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Johnson wants to follow through on efforts the council has begun in 
recent years to turn the economy around in Santa Paula. He points to a new Taco 
Bell and movie theater as evidence of an economic turnaround. He also wants to 
hire more police officers and firefighters. He said the city is working hard to 
attract businesses and trying to streamline the permitting and inspection 
processes required by city staff.

 Leslie H. Maland  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 73 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: retired civil engineer 
</P>
<P>
 Education: bachelor of arts degree in engineering from UC Berkeley, master's 
degree in engineering from UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 Background: A native of North Dakota, Maland moved to Ventura County as a 
teen-ager. A 58-year resident of Santa Paula, he spent four years in the Army 
Air Corps during World War II before operating a construction business in Santa 
Paula for more than 10 years. He spent the next 28 years as a deputy civil 
engineer for the U. S. Navy at Point Mugu. Maland was a 24-year council member, 
including four stints as Santa Paula mayor, when he was defeated in the 1992 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Maland says he wants to attract jobs and industry to Santa Paula and 
is concerned by the city budget. He chastised current council members for 
appointing a finance review committee to make recommendations on the 1994-95 
budget, saying they lost the opportunity to figure out the workings of a city 
budget for themselves. He also advocates a teen center for young residents who 
may not be interested in the Boys & Girls Club. He said the council should pay 
more attention to its teen-age residents and less attention to the Union Oil 
Museum.

<P>
 John A. F. Melton  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 64 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: council incumbent, retired manager for Southern California Edison 
</P>
<P>
 Education: associate of arts from Ventura College; attended several 
universities, including the University of Kansas and Baker University in 
Baldwin City, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Melton, a Kansas native, moved to California after visiting when 
he was serving in the Marine Corps in 1951. He took a job with Edison in 1953 
and spent 37 years at the company before retiring in 1990. A council member 
since 1974, Melton has served on a number of regional panels that set policy 
for local governments, including the Southern California Assn. of Governments 
and the California Council of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Melton wants to protect the quality of life in Santa Paula by 
continuing to attract development. He wants to ensure, however, that the city 
does not lose its agricultural base by allowing too much development and said 
that preserving the existing greenbelt around the city will help. He said his 
years of service on the council and his contacts at regional, state and federal 
levels benefit the city. He said the city is being run efficiently and points 
to the fact that it employs about the same number of people it did 16 years 
ago, despite a 45% increase in population.

 Victor Salas  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 62 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Newly retired from Santa Paula Water Works, Salas will concentrate 
full-time on a family business that manufactures pest-control devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Education: earned an associate of arts degree in hydrology from Ventura 
College, attended classes at San Diego State University 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Salas was born and raised in Santa Paula. He spent four years in 
the U. S. Air Force before opening the first Spanish-language radio station in 
Ventura County. He spent seven years on the Planning Commission and four years 
on the Santa Paula Union High School District governing board. An active member 
of the Santa Paula Area Chamber of Commerce, he later helped found the 
Mexican-American Chamber of Commerce and served as its first president. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Salas said the Santa Paula City Council needs to better reflect the 
city's ethnic majority. He said the panel also needs younger people with new 
ideas because the city is losing sales tax dollars to nearby markets such as 
Ventura and Oxnard. Like the other candidates, Salas wants to see more jobs and 
industry in the city. He said he could use his business experience to help new 
companies get through the permitting and inspection processes more easily.

 John Wisda  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 46 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: lumber-yard manager 
</P>
<P>
 Education: high school graduate 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Wisda was born in Chicago, but moved in the early 1950s to Santa 
Monica, where he remained until moving to Santa Paula five years ago. Since his 
arrival, Wisda has coached youth soccer teams and been a member of the Santa 
Paula Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: The candidate with the shortest residency in Santa Paula, Wisda said 
he has made the most of his five years in Ventura County. He says he wants to 
strengthen the local economy and lower taxes. He said two of the city's funding 
sources -- Redevelopment Agency funds and Community Development Block Grant 
money -- are being misused. He said both funds should be tapped to help 
first-time home buyers, who would contribute to property tax rolls. Wisda, a 
member of the citizens panel appointed last year to tackle the looming budget 
deficit, was miffed when the council ignored most of the committee's 
recommendations. He chastises the council for not taking advantage of growth 
opportunities in the 1980s and said that only now are council members coming 
around to welcoming development.

 Flo Zakrajshek  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 64 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: owns and operates heating and air-conditioning company 
</P>
<P>
 Education: attended a university in Ohio for two years 
</P>
<P>
 Background: A 35-year resident, Zakrajshek has been active in Santa Paula for 
years, participating in several citizens panels and running for City Council in 
1990 and 1992. She was named Santa Paula's citizen of the year in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Zakrajshek said Santa Paula needs to concentrate on bringing more 
shoppers downtown to stimulate an area that used to be a major draw. The city 
should focus on its uniqueness and enhance the once-popular Main Street and 
Harvard Boulevard areas, she said. The high dropout rate among high school 
students worries Zakrajshek, and she supports better communication between the 
city and its school districts. She is also worried about budget problems that 
have plagued the city in recent years and said the council should show more 
prudence in its expenditures. She supports the goal of the downtown improvement 
plan but worries that not enough tangible improvements will be made to attract 
new businesses.

LURE OF FREE MONEY HOOKS 70 SUSPECTS IN STING; ARRESTS: CASES INVOLVE CHILD 
SUPPORT, BAD CHECKS AND WELFARE FRAUD. DEADBEATS FROM AS FAR AWAY AS NORTH 
CAROLINA ARE DUPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Velasquez had challenging marching orders: persuade deadbeat parents, 
welfare cheats and other suspected criminals to turn themselves in. 
</P>
<P>
 With no other good ideas in mind, the Ventura County district attorney's 
investigator decided to mail his targets a letter informing them they had 
unclaimed money waiting for them. 
</P>
<P>
 To his surprise, the plan worked. On Wednesday, Ventura County officials 
announced that 70 of their most sought-after deadbeats had been taken into 
custody within the last week -- all in search of free money. 
</P>
<P>
 Offenders drove from as far as North Carolina and Ohio to pick up checks from 
the fictitious state Department of Unclaimed Property Earnings Depository -- or 
DUPED. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, nothing like this has occurred in California in quite some 
time," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff G. Bennett, chief of the investigators for 
the prosecutors office. "The message that ought to be sent very clearly is if 
you owe a child support payment, we are going to find you one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best operation that has ever been conducted in the child-support 
area," agreed Deputy Dist. Atty. Stanley C. Trom, head of the child support 
division. "Every one of these people knew there was an arrest warrant out for 
them. These are our most difficult cases. When people know they are wanted, 
they hide." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those arrested in the sting had been hiding out from authorities for a 
number of years. Velasquez was given the task several months ago of trying to 
flush out some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 He started by concocting the letter from the fictitious state agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter began: "This is to inform you that, according to our records, you 
may be entitled to the unclaimed earnings listed below." It went on to tell the 
unsuspecting targets that the state owed them anywhere from $600 to $1,900 in 
earnings their current or previous employer had improperly withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 Of about 1,000 who received the letter, more than 100 called an "800" line set 
up by the district attorney's office to inquire about their sudden windfall. 
Those people also scheduled appointments to pick up their money from a state 
office in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez said officials did not set up the office in Ventura County, lest 
that raise any suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 When the targets began showing up Oct. 12 to collect their checks, 
investigators met them with handcuffs. Most of the duped took their arrests in 
stride, although investigators said several relatives who accompanied suspects 
to the office site became unruly, and one woman had to be taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those arrested came from within the state. But others flew, drove or 
caught a train from such distant states as North Carolina, Texas, Ohio, Utah, 
Alabama and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, 41 men and women were arrested for overdue child support payments, 
16 for writing bad checks and 13 for welfare fraud, Velasquez said. Most were 
able to make bail after posting $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate how far some people had come in search of free money, 
investigators point to the cases of Bruce Calvin Steele of North Carolina and 
Phillip Terrier of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Both drove thousands of miles to Santa Barbara to collect the money they 
thought they had coming. Authorities said they were particularly happy to 
arrest them.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steele, a 51-year-old former Fillmore man, owes the county $6,723 in back 
support to his three children who are now grown and no longer receiving county 
aid, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrier, 33, formerly of Thousand Oaks, has a 14-year-old child and is behind 
$3,489.64 in his $75-a-month support payments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone fell for the trick. When contacted in Arizona and told of his 
unclaimed earnings, one man said, "Why should I come for $1,600 when I'm making 
$1,000 a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said now that they know how to reach that man, they plan to have 
him arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we go back to the issue of greed and wanting something for nothing," 
Velasquez said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : VENTURA; 2 WITNESSES TO NAZI ATROCITIES EDUCATE 
CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A class of eighth-graders sat absorbed in silence Wednesday, listening to a 
history lesson from two 74-year-old teachers who were witnesses to Nazi 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd Simon of Ventura told of his youth as a Jewish student in Nazi Germany, 
his time in the Dachau concentration camp, and his return to Germany as a 
military intelligence officer hunting Nazi war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hasen of Camarillo told of being the first member of the western allied 
forces to liberate a concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Balboa Middle School students listened intently to the speakers, part of a 
new holocaust education program that includes visits by all Ventura 
eighth-graders to the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasen and Simon were talking about events that happened in Europe half a 
century ago. But the students had no trouble relating the lessons of tolerance 
to present day Ventura County school yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of name-calling and picking fights," said John Dennison, 14, 
who said the tales of Nazi discrimination reminded him of kids at his school 
who taunt each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Another student, Chris Pettit, said he found the Nazis reminiscent of present 
day gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasen made the eighth-graders cringe by including the gory details of the 
liberation of the Ohrduf camp in southern Germany on April 4, 1945 -- including 
his discovery of two naked dead men in one room of the camp hanging from meat 
hooks. 
</P>
<P>
 That particular incident was the focus of the majority of the students' 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon brought a stack of documentary evidence, including the last letter he 
received from his mother, who was killed in the holocaust. Students carefully 
handled Simon's battered olive green German passport, marked with a swastika on 
the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon said that after receiving a visa to immigrate from Germany to Cuba, he 
entered the German Embassy in Cuba, gave the desk attendant a "Heil Hitler" 
salute, and asked for a one-year renewal of the passport. As Simon prepared to 
dash out the door of the embassy, afraid that he would be sent back to a German 
concentration camp along with his passport, the clerk returned with his 
extended passport. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba had told Simon that he had to renew his 
expired German passport before they could give him a visa to enter the United 
States, where he joined the army "to fight back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasen urged the group of about 60 students to remember his words, and beware 
of neo-Nazi revisionist groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 74 years old, and when I'm gone, who is left?" he asked. "Who is left to 
stave off and fight off these idiots who are claiming that this thing never 
happened?" IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : VENTURA; O'CONNELL SAYS STAFF DID NOTHING WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Appearing in Ventura on Wednesday to receive an award from a group of 
educators, Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) denied that two staff 
members did anything wrong when they were found looking through a dumpster 
outside the office of a political rival last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, who is locked in a tough battle with Republican candidate Steve 
MacElvaine for the state Senate seat in the 18th District, denied that aides 
Jerry Wooledge and Geoffrey A. Weg were looking for information when they were 
caught by an assistant to Republican congressional candidate Andrea Seastrand. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were looking for (Wooledge's) checkbook because he had lost it earlier 
in the day," O'Connell said. "It's as simple as that. They weren't doing 
anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell refused to comment on the propriety of two of his aides going 
through a dumpster late at night near the offices of his political opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine and Seastrand both occupy office space in a San Luis Obispo 
building along with a branch of the Bank of America. Ralph Wunder, an aide to 
Seastrand, said he observed two men with flashlights rummaging through the 
dumpster outside of the office shortly after 10:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wunder said that after he startled the two men, they fled in a car and he gave 
chase in what turned out to be a short but high-speed pursuit. The chase ended 
when San Luis Obispo police intervened. Authorities have declined to file 
formal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief presentation Wednesday morning at Ventura College, O'Connell 
was named state legislator of the year by the Faculty Assn. of California 
Community Colleges, a group that represents 45,000 teachers based at community 
colleges across the state. J. E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 5 DONORS NOMINATED FOR ART CENTER 
BOARD 
</P>

<P>
 Tapping well-connected fund-raisers and arts boosters, the Alliance for the 
Arts has nominated five donors to serve on the Board of Governors of Thousand 
Oaks' new performing arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is a powerful group," said William Bang, who chaired the 
nomination committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-known nominee, Charles Young, serves as chancellor and chief 
executive of UCLA. A resident of Lake Sherwood since 1990, Young is in charge 
of the college's fund raising and endowment, and has helped develop theater 
programs at UCLA. Young and his wife, Susan, contributed $50,000 to the 
alliance's endowment campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other nominees have also donated $50,000 to the endowment: Albert Adam and 
Bert Greynald. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam, a Thousand Oaks resident for 17 years, chairs annual fund raising for 
the Conejo YMCA. He is a vice president and assistant manager at Prudential 
Securities in Thousand Oaks. Greynald joins the Civic Arts Plaza board after 
several years as a governor of the Los Angeles Music Center. A developer and 
longtime resident, Greynald is president of Morrison Homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth nominee, Elaine Wooster, works as facilities and plant operations 
manager for the space shuttle main engine room at Rocketdyne, a division of 
Rockwell International. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the big-business ties of her fellow nominees, Jeanne Stapp got 
the nod for her decades of work with the arts community. A member of the city's 
Arts Commission for 12 years, Stapp has been pushing for an auditorium for 
nearly three decades. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SEX EDUCATION CURRICULUM REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley school board has sent a proposed sex education curriculum back 
to the drawing board because parts of it were deemed inappropriate, Supt. Mary 
Beth Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolford, who declined to give specifics on what the panel found inappropriate, 
made the announcement late Tuesday after a group of conservative parents told 
the board that the new curriculum should not include references to 
homosexuality or any sexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents criticized the board, saying it allowed a committee of nurses and 
teachers to stray from guidelines developed earlier this year. The committee 
was formed to select materials for use in seventh- and 10th-grade courses on 
sex education. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Kathy Burke singled out sections in the recommended literature that 
mention homosexuality, masturbation and oral sex, which she said were not 
supposed to be included in the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleen Ary, chairwoman of the conservative Citizens for Truth in Education, 
also criticized the materials for not being abstinence-based. "Children will be 
left to their own designs to determine right and wrong for themselves," she 
said. TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GOP EXTENDS VOTER REGISTRATION LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Republicans have extended their voter registration lead over 
Democrats, reversing a three-year trend that saw large Democratic gains in the 
county, according to the latest numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 351,921 people have registered to vote in the Nov. 8 election, said 
Assistant Registrar Bruce Bradley.This is the second-highest number of 
potential voters in the county's history after the 1992 presidential election, 
when 359,236 people registered, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans accounted for 155,468 registered voters in the latest registration 
rolls, and Democrats 144,791, with the remaining voters signing up with 
alternative political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Larkin, chairman of the Ventura County Republican Central Committee, 
attributed the GOP lead to an aggressive registration drive that involved 
hiring independent contractors to sign up voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Larkin said dissatisfaction with the Clinton Administration also helped. "We 
signed up a lot of crossover voters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hank Starr, chairman of the county's Democratic Central Committee, 
said negative campaigning by Republican candidates has been effective in 
steering voters away from the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has certainly been a wake-up call to Democrats," Starr said. CARLOS V.

<P>
 Joining cities and counties throughout California, the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors has passed a resolution opposing a statewide ballot initiative that 
would wipe out local restrictions on smoking in public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188, which is backed by tobacco giant Philip Morris Inc., would 
replace local smoking ordinances with a more lax statewide anti-smoking law. 
Only the state Legislature could amend the law, which would require a 
two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved its resolution opposing the measure during its meeting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County passed a strict anti-smoking ordinance in November. Other 
cities in the county, including Camarillo, Ojai and Ventura, also have passed 
similar ordinances during the past year. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COMPOST FIRM SAYS PERMITS STILL NEEDED 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An east county composting company that said it will move to a new site by 
early January admitted Wednesday it has not begun applying for county permits 
to operate elsewhere, a process that will take at least five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Tom Berg, director of the county's resource management agency, said the 
Worm Concern's current permit expires Jan. 15 and the company has "not shown 
particular diligence in achieving the permits" needed to continue operating. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it began operating two years ago, problems have plagued the Worm 
Concern, which operates on a 20-acre plot off Tierra Rejada Road between Simi 
Valley and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has never filed the proper operating permits with the county, Berg 
said at a meeting of the East County Waste Task Force, and neighbors have 
complained about noxious odors from the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 At an Oct. 7 press conference, Worm Concern operators announced they would 
move their operation to a site several miles north of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Worm Concern attorney Peter Racicot admitted that the company has 
not signed a lease for a new site but said it is working hard to meet both its 
neighbors' needs and the county's permit requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is not to cause upset in the community," Racicot said. "The goal is 
to provide a service that meets the intent of state law." SARA CATANIA

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS COUNCIL; ATTACKS IN HEATED CAMPAIGN FOR 3 SEATS SPILL 
INTO CITY'S PUBLIC MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, AND STEPHANIE SIMONSPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 The growing nastiness of the Thousand Oaks City Council campaign has spilled 
over into council sessions, as opponents of Councilwoman Elois Zeanah use 
public time to hurl personal insults at the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mayor Alex Fiore and Councilman Frank Schillo shunned Zeanah on 
Wednesday by endorsing four of her opponents in the heated race for three open 
council seats. Sitting council members have rarely endorsed candidates before 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, the public comment portion of the City Council meeting was 
dominated by the scathing attacks that have become commonplace this election 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 At a forum last week, for instance, one of the 16 council candidates used all 
of his time to attack Zeanah. And over the weekend, campaigners distributed 
buttons depicting a "Z" with a slash through it, along with flyers calling 
Zeanah "elitist" and "divisive." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah sat through a barrage of insults again Tuesday, attacks she later 
called "part of a well-orchestrated effort to undermine my campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 "You've mastered the art of hate," said Jim Henson, a Thousand Oaks man who 
claimed credit for the negative flyer. "You've brought out the worst in this 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah tried to respond to the remarks, but Fiore said the council chamber was 
no place for a political debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been gagged and silenced," an angry Zeanah said. "It should be my 
personal privilege to respond to these attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 During a break in the meeting, Fiore said the harsh remarks took him by 
surprise. "This is unusually bad," he said. "I don't remember things ever 
getting this out of hand in any previous election." 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks on Zeanah, who is finishing her first term, have come in large 
part from residents who say she has tried to stymie development in the city. 
Zeanah argues she is responding to her constituents who want to ensure that the 
rural qualities of Thousand Oaks are preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 The nasty remarks at the council meeting came for the second consecutive week, 
and some council members said they were concerned that public comment time was 
being misused. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said they believed the campaign 
rhetoric was taking time away from other important city business. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore said he agreed, but could find no way to curtail the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've all been through this, maybe not to this degree, but you still 
have to sit and take it," Fiore said. "I don't know what more can be done."  
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Fiore and Schillo announced they would be supporting four 
candidates in the election: incumbent Judy Lazar, retired businessman Marshall 
Dixon, firefighter Andy Fox and detective Mike Markey. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah has endorsed her own slate of candidates, backing retired filmmaker M. 
Ali Issari and city operations manager David Hare. And Councilwoman Zukowski 
said she has endorsed Zeanah, Issari and Hare. Lazar and Zeanah are the only 
incumbents up for reelection this fall.

 Prior to this year, Schillo said, it was unusual for council members to 
endorse any candidates. Several council members attributed their endorsements 
to the large campaign field. They said residents had been inundating them with 
calls asking for advice on how to vote in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 While many of the challengers have hoped to turn anti-incumbent anger into 
votes, others have latched onto the incumbents' endorsements with gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heartily welcome Alex's endorsement -- I don't think I could have wished 
for anything better," Dixon said. "We basically share the same philosophy and 
the same ways of getting things done." 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex's votes are floating around out there, and maybe this will help me get 
some of them," said Markey, who ran unsuccessfully for the council four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Fiore is retiring after 30 years on the council, both Markey and Dixon 
said they believe his endorsement will carry extra weight. Fiore has been the 
top vote-getter in all but two of his races, and he still has substantial 
support among the community.

PROPOSALS FOR 5 GOLF COURSES MOVE AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council on Wednesday approved detailed studies of three 
public golf courses that would be built within three miles of each other during 
the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, the county Parks and Harbor Commission forwarded to the 
Board of Supervisors a proposal to build two 18-hole golf courses on county 
land at Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park, just north of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission made no recommendation on whether the county should take the 
next step in an approval process -- authorization of an environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 county study showed a pent-up demand for at least seven more public 
golf courses countywide, according to county parks official Robert Amore. The 
two courses at Happy Camp could net up to $250,000 a year to be used partly for 
park improvements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amore said he was not sure if the Moorpark area can absorb all five of the 
proposed golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It remains to be seen whether all five will be built," he said. "If the 
timing is right, maybe they could all be built. Certainly if all five come on 
line on the same day that could pose some problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark officials are also concerned that five new golf courses could be too 
many. But the City Council told two developers Wednesday evening that they 
could go forward with studies of projects including three golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 One study will analyze the environmental effects of two 18-hole golf courses 
planned by the Bollinger Development Corp. on 400 acres between Grimes Canyon 
Road and Walnut Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf courses are part of a plan to build 216 luxury homes ranging in price 
from $800,000 to $1 million on the west side of town, company President Paul 
Bollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an inducement, Bollinger is offering the city one of the golf courses, 
which he estimates could net Moorpark as much as $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Moorpark) could do exactly what the county is trying to do in Happy Camp -- 
earn a lot of money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of another project review, the Moorpark council also approved the 
study of the city costs and benefits from a 3,221-house development by the 
Irvine-based Messenger Investment Corp.  
</P>
<P>
 Messenger plans to build the other 18-hole golf course as another centerpiece 
of a luxury home subdivision northeast of town. Upon council approval of the 
Messenger project, Moorpark would annex the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried about the number of proposed courses, city officials tried to force 
Messenger to prove that its golf course would be profitable, company Vice 
President Gary Austin said. But the city backed down after the company 
objected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has already done a study showing a demand for golf courses," 
Austin said. "It's a business decision anyway, and we're willing to take the 
risk that it will be profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, there are seven golf courses in eastern Ventura County, three 
public. There are no golf courses in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always crowded (on the public courses)," said Jim Honer, manager of a 
golf supply store in Simi Valley. "I don't think it matters how many you build. 
There's always demand for more. You'll get people driving in from the San 
Fernando Valley, (elsewhere in) Los Angeles County and even Ojai, just to get a 
chance to tee up on uncrowded links." Proposed golf courses 1. Bollinger: two 
18-hole courses (400 acres) 2. Happy Camper: two 18-hole courses (700 acres) 3. 
Messenger: one 18-hole course (200 acres)

 Intel Begins Plant Expansion: The world's largest chip maker broke ground on a 
$500-million expansion of its Santa Clara Pentium chip facility, which it said 
could create as many as 1,200 jobs.The project will double the size of Intel 
Corp.'s "clean room" to 70,000 square feet and add 160,000 square feet 
elsewhere in the plant. A clean room is an area where the air is thoroughly 
cleansed so that silicon chips -- the brains of personal computers -- won't be 
contaminated. The factory produces versions of Intel's most advanced 
microprocessor, the Pentium.

 Strong corporate profit reports bolstered stock prices Wednesday, despite the 
drag of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing to within 42 points of a record high, the Dow Jones industrial average 
rose 18.50 points to 3,936.04, reversing Tuesday's 6-point loss and resuming a 
climb that added 3% last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market initially weakened along with the bond market, where fear of 
inflation sent prices lower and interest rates higher. But bond yields 
retreated somewhat later, and Wall Street turned its attention to 
stronger-than-expected quarterly results from U.S. corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Institutional Brokers Estimate System said that as of Wednesday, 57% of the 
companies it tracks reported third-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street 
average estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just an accumulation of good corporate third-quarter earnings reports," 
said Jack Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest. "That's proving to be 
right now the overriding consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also tied Wednesday's gains to computerized buying programs ahead of 
Friday's options expirations. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Rice, chief market strategist at Josephthal Lyon & Ross, cautioned that 
the surge in major indexes masked some underlying weaknesses. "Volume is up, 
but the fact of the matter is that the breadth is still poor, and it has been 
for a number of sessions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, rising issues edged out decliners by 1,131 to 1,029 on 
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 319.34 million shares, up 
from 259.74 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks headed lower at the open, along with bonds, after the government 
reported that while the nation's trade deficit narrowed by $1.45 billion in 
August, Japanese imports to the United States surged to a record high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both imports and exports were stronger," said James Schroeder, MMS 
International market analyst. "That's more an indication of continued economic 
strength and obviously would include both here and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices often fall on data that show a robust economy, because they can 
foreshadow inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields continued to rise as the dollar fell while investors 
worried that a weaker U.S. currency would deter foreign investors from buying 
dollar-denominated securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Also hurting bond prices were inflation fears, fanned by a rise in daily 
commodity prices and remarks from a Federal Reserve official. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield increased to 7.89% from Tuesday's 
7.86%, pushing its price down 1/4 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 in face value. 
Yields and prices move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, the dollar fell to within a yen of its all-time low 
against the Japanese yen after the U.S. government reported an unexpected 
widening of America's trade deficit with Japan in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The British pound also rose sharply, advancing for a seventh-consecutive 
trading session. No specific set of data or news spurred the jump, but analysts 
said solid economic growth, low inflation and political stability in Britain 
has made sterling an attractive alternative for dollar sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling in Asian dealings, the dollar slid further to close at 97.28 yen 
-- a record-low close in U.S. trading -- down from 97.75 yen Tuesday. The 
dollar also was changing hands in New York at 1.502 German marks, down from 
1.5025. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling, meanwhile, continued to advance against the dollar after breaking 
through a two-year high Monday. The pound has risen about 2.55% against the 
dollar this month and is up more than 9% from early this year. It closed at 
$1.623, up from $1.613, a third day of gains exceeding 1 cent. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Computer-related stocks surged after Compaq and Digital Equipment reported 
improved quarterly results. 
</P>
<P>
 * Compaq rose 1 1/8 to 36 5/8 after the company said its third-quarter net 
income rose to 75 cents per share from 42 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Digital rose 1 7/8 to 31 1/4. The company narrowed its first-quarter net 
loss to 98 cents per share from $1.14 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM added 1 to 75 3/8 as analysts anticipated a good third-quarter earnings 
report due Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * The strength in computer stocks spread to the over-the-counter market, where 
Intel rose 1 5/8 to 60, Lotus Development added 1 3/4 to 36 7/16, and Microsoft 
climbed 1 to 57 5/8. Computer stocks boosted the Nasdaq composite index, which 
is heavily weighted with technology stocks, by 5.81 points to 770.62. 
</P>
<P>
 Other major indexes gained as well. The NYSE composite rose 1.07 points to 
258.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.62 points to 470.28. The 
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 1.54 points to 458.26. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airline stocks rose as AMR gained 1 3/4 to 53 3/4. The parent company of 
American Airlines said its third-quarter net profit rose to $2.47 per share 
from $1.33. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adaptec gained 2-7/16 to 20-11/16 on strong earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Johnson & Johnson gained 1 3/8 to 54 1/2. Its third-quarter profit of 82 
cents a share beat analysts' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amgen jumped 4-1/16 to 58 after the biotech company reported very strong 
earnings Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mostly lower abroad, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225-share average falling 
123.53 points lower at 19,868.87, while Frankfurt's DAX average dropped 33.6 
points to 2,051.16. In London, the Financial Times 100-share average closed 
24.5 points lower at 3,060.8. In Mexico, however, the Bolsa index rose 25.08 
points to 2,750.13.

FASHION; COOLING TRENDS; CLASSIC COATS DO SWEATERS ONE BETTER. AND IT WILL BE 
COLD SOON -- REALLY. 
</P>

<BYLINE>

 Forget your coat? That's not likely to happen this winter. Classic coat shapes 
-- short or long, full or fitted, belted or loose -- in unusual materials will 
make the season a memorable one for outerwear. 
</P>
<P>
 There are sweeping A-line swing coats that move with the body, 1940s-inspired 
coats that fit at the waist and flare to the ankles, little car coats that tie, 
and long, three-button coats of cushy wool and cashmere blends. Shearling, fake 
fur, leather and other animal skins bring out the beast in men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers from Calvin Klein to Dolce & Gabbana use shearling on collars, cuffs 
or the entire garment. Calvin Klein indulged heavily, covering a long coat 
entirely in dark brown woolly stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shearling has been selling well, even in Southern California, because it's 
lightweight," says Don Witkowski, a vice president for Barneys New York. "It's 
uncanny the way it's taken off." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who feel sheepish in shearling, Barneys also has coats in leather, 
suede and soft weaves reminiscent of wool blankets. "They're fun with jeans and 
sweaters or over a sport coat," Witkowski says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolce & Gabbana's short, loose coat in a heavy charcoal ribbed knit feels as 
comfortable as an old sweater but has a lot more style. Other relaxed styles 
are Barneys' loose-fitting jacket of wool plaid in earthy shades of ecru and 
gray and a soft, three-button coat in buttery black suede. All are available at 
Barneys New York in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Emporio Armani's fashion-forward coats are wool-cashmere swing coats, 
faux-fur car coats, and long princess coats with banded collars and fitted 
bodices that flare at the hemline. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes them unique is we take classic styles and make them in 
non-traditional fabrics," says Courtney Chamine, spokeswoman for Emporio Armani 
in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Shearling, for example, appears on everything from bomber jackets to long 
overcoats at the Emporio Armani boutique in Beverly Hills. A collarless men's 
overcoat is covered in tan shearling. 
</P>
<P>
 Other classic styles get a wilder look from fake fur. A women's car coat can 
be had in plush fake chinchilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Chamine: "It can be worn with a great wool sweater and velvet skirt. It's 
meant to be playful."

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: DESIGNER'S DAYTIME LOOK HAS THAT FREUDIAN TOUCH

<P>
 British designer Bella Freud, whose father is artist Lucien Freud and whose 
grandfather was Sigmund Freud, popped up here after her London show to interest 
buyers in her spring collection. 
</P>
<P>
 We wouldn't have even seen Freud had we not been prowling the corridors of our 
idiosyncratic-but-well-located hotel in search of junk food. A sign led us to a 
tiny room where four rolling racks of polished, youthful suits and dressy tops 
caught our eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Freud, who for years worked as Vivienne Westwood's assistant, said she designs 
dressy daytime looks for a fantasy girl "who's a little wild." Fantasy has 
replaced Freud's original fashion heroine, Claudine, from the Colette books. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about her line's label, which bears a drawing of a silly dog whose 
tongue hangs out, she said matter-of-factly: "My dad did it. He's kind of handy 
that way." 
</P>

 Fun Couple: Model Janice Dickinson and Vogue publisher Ronald A. Galotti were 
gushing over each other here as she taped a fashion segment for TV's "American 
Journal." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is college for me," she said, sprawling at the end of the runway where 
the Hermes show had just taken place. Post-graduate work, said the dark-haired 
beauty and former Sly Stallone flame, will be hosting a style show on the 
Disney Channel. "I'm gonna put Minnie Mouse in Lagerfeld," she boasted. (Hadn't 
"the Kaiser" dreamed up Miss Mouse's cartooney get-up in the first place?) 
</P>
<P>
 Dickinson admitted that covering the fashion shows made her nostalgic for the 
runway. "But more than modeling, I miss that time of my life." We, too, yearn 
for those madcap days of yore. 
</P>

 Young Blood: What are the signs that a young designer's star is ascending? In 
the case of John Rochas, there are quite a few. Director Jim Sheridan ("The 
Commitments") was in the audience of Rochas' Paris debut last week, working on 
a documentary about the designer. And singer Sinead O'Connor took to the runway 
to model the clothes. Ah, the luck of the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Missing in Action: Black models fairly dominated the runways in the mid-'80s, 
but the list of well-known names who worked this season's Paris shows was 
short: Tyra, Naomi Campbell, Beverly Peele, Brandi and Chrystele. Has the 
influx of Eastern European talent driven away models of color? Or were they 
discouraged by fashion's short-lived fascination with waifs? More important, 
will the dearth continue at the American designer shows in New York at month's 
end? We hope not.

 Meanwhile, Back in L.A.: We battle sluggishness with toxic chemicals like 
caffeine and sugar, but Evelyn Lauder's Rx for superhuman energy is a health

 At a press breakfast last week for the cosmetics exec's landscape photography 
book, "The Seasons Observed," she directed the Four Seasons' kitchen to make up 
enough for everyone, whether they needed it or not. She certainly did -- with 
just 24 hours to spend in L.A. last week, Estee's daughter-in-law squeezed in a 
cocktail party, TV appearance, press breakfast and book signings at Neiman 
Marcus and Bullock's. (Her book royalties go to the Breast Cancer Research 
Foundation.) This left barely enough time for her to reapply her persimmon 
lipstick, which matched her Chanel boucle jacket, before racing off to do more 
of the same in Santa Barbara.

 Party Animals: Rodeo Drive was crawling with party hoppers Thursday night on 
the stretch between Gucci and Fred. Gucci's benefit for the California State 
Summer School for the Arts was co-hosted by Kelsey Grammer and Peri Gilpin of 
"Frasier."  
</P>
<P>
 "(The character) Daphne and I aspire to Gucci," said Gilpin, who plays Roz. 
"Frasier would wear it, but Niles wouldn't -- it'd be too risque for him." 
Grammer, though, begged to differ: "If you lowered the price, either brother 
would wear it." This particular evening he settled for a tweedy blazer, boldly 
patterned cafe shirt, black jeans and cowboy boots. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Fred Joaillier, real diamonds (to the tune of millions of dollars) 
were under glass, while cubic zirconias filled Absolut vodka bottles during an 
exhibition of the 40th Annual Diamonds-International Awards Collection. 
Everyone knows -- or at least we do now -- that you can't put cut diamonds 
together in a jar without scratching them.  
</P>
<P>
 "Only other diamonds cut diamonds," says the Diamond Information Center's Cri 
Cri Solak-Eastin, who modeled Japanese winner Yuko Nakajima's autumn leaf 
brooch made of acrylic, platinum and 427 diamonds. Actress Faith Ford wore 
American designer Janis Savitt's leather and platinum choker set with five 
pear-shaped and 66 square-cut diamonds. The award winners used more than 790 
carats worth of diamonds, and the event raised thousands of dollars for AIDS 
Project Los Angeles.

 Cable News Time: Sculptor/jeweler David Yurman stopped by Neiman Marcus last 
week for a 10-year retrospective of his work and prototypes of his new cable 
watch collection -- or "bracelets that tick," as he likes to call them. They're 
to be worn with his popular cable bracelets.  
</P>
<P>
 While in town, the designer -- who apprenticed 30 years ago with artist 
Jacques Lipchitz (whose sculpture tops the Music Center's plaza fountain) -- 
told of his Angst over moving from fine art into jewelry. "I went to an analyst 
for five years to get over my fear of setting stones."

BOOK REVIEW / AUTOBIOGRAPHY; STORYTELLING BY RELUCTANT EXTRACTION; UNDER MY 
SKIN: VOLUME ONE OF MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY, TO 1949 BY DORIS LESSING ; 
HARPERCOLLINS$25, 419 PAGES

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first volume of her autobiography, Doris Lessing writes that in 1947 
and 1948 she went through the worst time in her life. Living in Salisbury in 
what then was Southern Rhodesia, she had left her first husband and two small 
children and moved into a leftist bohemian circle, where she met and married a 
German Communist refugee named Gottfried Lessing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an "unhappy though kindly marriage" and it would not last; meanwhile 
she supported herself by working for a lawyer, sold short stories to South 
African magazines, and struggled with a first novel. 
</P>
<P>
 This could perfectly well add up to wretchedness. The trouble is that Lessing 
proclaims but does not convey the wretchedness; or just where and how things 
hurt. Indeed, her tone -- detached and grimly buoyant -- is no different than 
the one she uses to recount her childhood and growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 None of it was happy in her recollecting; the problem for the reader is not 
the quality of the unhappiness but of the recollecting. 
</P>
<P>
 Asserting the particular horror of 1947-1948, for example, she writes: "I 
hinted at the dreadfulness in 'Going Home' (one of her three dozen previously 
published works)." Over and over, as she gets to some crucial part of her early 
life, she refers the reader to one or another of her novels. Lessing is a 
remarkable novelist; the good stuff is there. It is not here. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now, sex," she announces at one point, and proceeds with a few mildly 
graphic and pleasureless details of a relationship or two. This is 
autobiography by reluctant extraction. No wonder. There is not much left for 
it. It is the slurry after the gold is panned; a clothes closet containing 
hangers, most of the garments having been taken out and worn out. She narrates 
with frequent elegance and pervading emptiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there is material, and once in a while a phrase or a passage lights 
it up. Lessing was born in Persia, where her father worked for a British-owned 
bank. It was a life of some luxury, followed by a far more rigorous struggle 
homesteading on a Rhodesian farm. Lessing's father was a witty, depressive, 
restless man; broken in World War I, where he lost a leg and was hospitalized 
for months. He married his nurse, an expansive woman with a love of books and 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 She abandoned a promising career in the London hospital system to follow her 
husband's unhappiness abroad, and cultivate her own in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The shadow of her parents' discontent darkens the memoir; even the pleasures 
are under gray light. Mr. Lessing wore himself out trying to make the farm pay; 
in a society of hard-bitten settlers, his wife missed the gentilities of the 
English middle class. She had brought engraved calling cards; there was nobody 
to call on. 
</P>
<P>
 Lessing evokes a dismal epiphany at age 12: seeing her parents sitting in the 
evening, silently smoking and bowed in defeat. Her reaction was not sympathy 
but a furious determination never to fall into their trap. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting the past is revisiting the trap, one that she found herself so nearly 
caught by. And she shrinks away from its walls even as she recalls them. 
Shrinking away is not the best artistic posture; she is much better now and 
then when she bursts into full-throated rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, there are a few moments of unclouded evocation -- the beauty and 
freedom of the African back lands, the quiet rhythm of a farm day -- but they 
quickly cloud over. She attempts to portray the neighboring families they knew, 
but she wards them off by naming them. 
</P>
<P>
 Her boarding schools are recounted at a numb distance; so is her marriage to a 
young and rising civil servant. She played the competent, cheerfully quirky 
young colonial wife and mother to the point of madness. "Tigger," she recalls 
with frozen horror, was her nickname -- because of the bounciness. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband and children are present but impalpable, as if the scandal and 
pain of walking out, moving across a stuffy little colonial capital and going 
to live with artists and leftists were the exchange of matter for anti-matter, 
with no connection between them, even that of memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Only imagination -- in her fiction -- would make a bridge. Toward the end, 
before she emigrates to England and her literary career, she, Gottfried Lessing 
and their baby would occasionally picnic with her first family, but she tells 
it as if two sets of ghosts were sharing the tea cakes.

FOOTBALL FEVER KICKS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing the "big game" is mostly a fantasy for football fans. Only 
muscle-bound bruisers need apply. But the NFL is sponsoring a football 
challenge for the average fan -- men, women or children -- with the NFL 
Air-It-Out competition, making stops in 19 cities around the country, including 
two in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 There are team events (reservations required) and individual attractions (open 
free to anyone). The four-person teams compete in a four-on-four flag-football 
tournament, matched up against other teams according to size, skill and 
experience. The winners will head to the Air-It-Out Super Bowl at Universal 
Studios, Orlando, Fla., in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The attractions open to spectators include the Gatorade Field Goal Challenge, 
Quarter Challenge, Down and Out, Stadium Moon Bounce and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The first four-on-four is Saturday and Sunday, at the UC Irvine campus 
all-purpose field, 8 a.m.-4 p.m. The next Air-It-Out takes place in Encino, at 
Balboa Park, Nov. 5-6. To sign up a team, call (310) 829-5226. LAURIE K.

SCRUMPTIOUS, I'M AFRAID; UNMASKING THOSE FOODS YOU DREAD REVEALS SOME UNEARTHLY 
DELIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The food world is a fearsome place of hobgoblins and monsters. If you don't 
believe me, ask any kid. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't have gross- out foods like candy rats and gummy worms when I was 
growing up, but there were still plenty of foods that scared me to death at a 
young age: liver, beets and, scariest of all, a wriggling fish, sitting on our 
kitchen counter, waiting to be chopped and cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
 In this generation, common food fears revolve around nutrition, public health 
and excessive fat in the diet. If you're finicky, scary foods pop up all the 
time, unexpectedly. Ethnic markets have such items as pig's head, blood sausage 
and hairy vegetables. Italian restaurants serve black pastas, colored by squid 
ink (the ink is tasteless). And consider trendy food expressions: "outrageous," 
"to die for," "killer." 
</P>
<P>
 The following short list contains foods that look, sound or taste scary, 
accompanied by a small reality check. For the record, bad cooking is what 
scares me, not unusual names or exotic ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 Trick or treat, a little early. McDonald's Milkshake 
</P>
<P>
 Many of my health-food-oriented friends are scared to death of fast food. So 
I'll bet most of them would be surprised to find that, with regards to the 
commercially popular McDonald's milkshake, they have little to fear. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's San Diego office provided me with a list of ingredients that go 
into milkshakes: nonfat milk, milk, sugar, corn syrup, flavored syrup, guar 
gum, carageenan and locust bean gum. The last three are thickening agents from 
plants and contain no artificial substances. 
</P>
<P>
 The syrups do contain chemicals such as sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate or 
propyline glycol to retard spoilage, but no more than you would find in any 
commercial cookie or cracker. Of the three main flavors -- chocolate, vanilla 
and strawberry -- only the strawberry has artificial colors: red 40, yellow 6 
and blue 1. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's more good news for fans of this food giant. Consumer Reports 
tested milkshakes from several large chains, and McDonald's -- surprise -- 
turned out to be the lowest in fat calories. The shakes, for the record, 
contain between 310 and 350 calories (and 5 to 6 grams of fat) per 16-ounce 
serving. If the chalky flavors don't scare you off, the shakes can be a boon to 
dieting. If you want a richer shake, there's always Ben and Jerry's. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's, locations throughout Orange County. 16-ounce milkshake, $1.19 
(prices may vary slightly with franchise). Sea Cucumber 
</P>
<P>
 In a book called "The Sacred Cow and the Abominable Pig," anthropologist 
Marvin Harris writes about the curious reasons certain foods are reviled and 
others revered around the world. Surely the practical Cantonese would laugh at 
such a scholarly tome. They boast about eating "everything that flies except an 
airplane, everything that has wings except a table." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Sam Woo Restaurant in Irvine stops well short of that notion, but you 
will find sea cucumber on the menu. This Chinese delicacy, a.k.a. trapang, is a 
primitive, worm-like creature with a gelatinous texture. Most Chinese 
restaurants serve it in a brown sauce, accompanied by black mushroom or bok 
choy. 
</P>
<P>
 This is about as low as things go on the food chain, but not on the taste 
chain. Sea cucumber has a delicate, subtle flavor that absorbs oil and the 
flavors of vegetables admirably. Sam Woo's version is delightful, as long as 
you aren't put off by the sight of a shallow water, coastal worm sliced into 
rounds. And if you look at it from the Cantonese perspective, it's far less 
scary than a slice of fermented beast secretion -- what we know as cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Woo Restaurant, 15333 Culver Drive, Irvine. (714) 262-0888. Open daily, 
11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sea cucumber with tender greens, $10. Steak 
</P>
<P>
 It's popular to include red meat in any updated list of scary foods. Excessive 
amounts of red meat in the diet have been linked to a variety of ailments, and 
health food stores are stocked with books that explain the reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this seems to deter anyone from stopping in at Pinnacle Peak in Garden 
Grove. This homey, bargain-priced steakhouse specializes in a monstrous, 
32-ounce Porterhouse called the Trail Boss. If the sheer thought of it doesn't 
make your arteries shudder, you're in for a treat. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't fatty beef like prime cut in a high-priced steakhouse, but rather 
Select, a grade of beef available to the average consumer. What makes it 
special is a combination of two things: The restaurant uses mesquite wood to 
barbecue, and the fire gets as hot as 1,000 degrees, which sears in the meat's 
delicious flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 A steak loses approximately 25% of its weight during the cooking process, so 
count on about 24 ounces of great eating should you order this steak. If you 
are counting calories, this comes out to about 1,200 without the trimmings, a 
scary thought for weight-watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinnacle Peak, 9100 Trask Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 892-7311. Dinner only, 5 
to 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, till 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Trail 
Boss, $12.95. Kiss of Death and Chocolate Suicide 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since a Williamsburg, Va., chef named Marcel Desaulniers created his 
Death by Chocolate in 1982, dessert-makers have been bombarding us with cutesy 
names for super-saturated chocolate desserts. You can't really die from 
chocolate, of course -- unless, as in the Tommy Smothers song, you fall into a 
vat of the stuff. (Smothers, in the song, yells "fire" and is rescued; since 
nobody "would save me if I yelled CHOCOLATE!") 
</P>
<P>
 C'est Si Bon and Grandma's Sugarplums, two local bakeries, have taken this 
theme and personalized it. At C'est Si Bon, a French bakery with locations in 
Newport Beach and Corona del Mar, it takes the form of a fudgy, torte-like 
concoction called Kiss of Death chocolate cake. Grandma's Sugarplums, with 
locations in Cypress and Long Beach, primarily a sweet shop, brings us the 
self-flagellating Chocolate Suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiss of Death is not a Mafia don's farewell, but rather a flour-less chocolate 
cake with a raspberry fruit topping. Eat it at room temperature, when it is 
soft and smooth. Chocolate Suicide is a three-layer chocolate cake with 
chocolate butter cream and bittersweet chocolate chips between each layer. 
Furthermore, the entire cake is half drowned in Hershey's syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 Death be not proud. 
</P>
<P>
 C'est Si Bon, 149 Riverside Ave., Newport Beach, (714) 645-0447, and 3444 E. 
Coast Highway, Corona del Mar, (714) 675-0994. Both stores open 7 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Monday, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, and 7:30 a.m. to 2 
p.m. Sunday. Kiss of Death chocolate cake, $16 and $32.  
</P>
<P>
 Grandma's Sugarplums, 9919 Walker St., Cypress, (714) 220-5979. Open 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. 10-inch Chocolate Suicide, $39.95. Also 4908 
E. 2nd St., Long Beach. (310) 439-3363. Open 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through 
Thursday, until midnight Friday and Saturday. Slice, $3.25. Prik Kin Nu 
</P>
<P>
 If you're scared by really hot chilies, join the crowd. This is one fear that 
strikes me as rational, though I enjoy the sensation of a fiery mouth, a sweaty 
brow and a throbbing tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 Many O.C. restaurants cook up three-alarm specialties, but my candidate for 
the hottest local dish is No. 31, kai kra pao, from the menu at Thai Nakorn in 
Buena Park. Some say Thais eat the world's hottest food on a daily basis. If 
that's true, it is because of kai kra pao's active ingredient, prik kin nu -- 
what in English is called bird's chili. 
</P>
<P>
 Prik kin nu is Thai for rat-dropping chili, purely because of a long, narrow 
shape, and that alone makes it fearsome. But this chili is approximately 10 
times hotter than a jalapeno in Scoville units, a measurement of a chili's 
ability to dilute in water, and has a burn that George Hamilton would envy. 
It's not for amateurs. Have your kai kra pao stir-fried chilies with a choice 
of beef, pork or chicken and call the fire department. Cut it with some of this 
restaurant's deliciously fragrant jasmine rice. Water only makes it worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Thai Nakorn, 8674 Stanton Ave., Buena Park. (714) 952-4954. Open 10:30 a.m. to 
10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, till 10:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Kai kra 
pao, $5.95. Birria 
</P>
<P>
 Authentic Mexican food can be a shock to the chips-and-salsa set. Considering 
that some Mexicans eat the worm in a bottle of mescal -- along with brain tacos 
and that age-old hangover remedy, the tripe soup called menudo -- it's not 
exactly a church supper in Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite authentic Mexican dish is birria de chivo, essentially kid stew. 
(We're referring to the kid that grows up to be a goat, in case you scared 
yourself.) Kid is a tender, gamy meat that has a wonderfully rich taste. A 
birria is basically a spicy stew consisting mainly of meat and broth. Mexicans 
love to eat such stews after sprinkling in handfuls of cilantro and chopped 
onion. 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny, Fountain Valley hole-in-the-mall, Birria Tepechi makes a terrific kid 
stew, all crunchy bits of meat and one of the ruddiest, most flavorful stocks 
I've tasted anywhere outside Mexico. You'll find menudo, rice, beans and 
handmade tortillas here, as well as a brace of other Mexican dishes. The birria 
recipe and chef are both from a village called Tepechitlan, near Zacatecas. 
</P>
<P>
 Birria Tepechi, 16040 Harbor Blvd., Fountain Valley. (714) 839-6034. Open 9 
a.m. to 7 p.m. Wednesday through Monday. Birria de chivo, $4.10. Beans in a 
Glass 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has ever been in a Vietnamese restaurant has probably noticed 
squiggly, multicolored shapes mingling with ice in a tall glass. These are 
Vietnamese desserts, the stuff a friend has dubbed "beans in a glass." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not far wrong. Many Vietnamese desserts are based on beans -- red 
beans, lima beans, small white beans -- usually mixed with sugar, tropical 
fruits and oddly shaped bits of flavored and colored cornstarch. They do look 
bizarre, but most of them taste surprisingly banal. That monster in the closet 
usually turns out to be dad's winter coat, the case here. 
</P>
<P>
 Hue Rendez-Vous is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Little Saigon, in part 
due to the effervescent Tran family, your hosts, and in part due to the light, 
savory cooking of Hue, in central Vietnam. Che dau ngu is basically a dessert 
for purists: beans, sugar, ice, ginger on request -- perfect for a hot summer 
day. If the day is blustery, try che bot loc dua, clear cornstarch pearls eaten 
with coconut or peanut, floating in a hot broth, about as far as you can get 
from a hot fudge sundae. 
</P>
<P>
 Hue Rendez-Vous, 15562 Brookhurst St., Westminster. (714) 775-7192. Open 9 
a.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday and 
Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Desserts, $1.50. Escargots 
</P>
<P>
 The most celebrated of loathsome creatures are snails, a.k.a. escargots. No 
matter how much you dress one up, it's still a snail. 
</P>
<P>
 Many local French restaurants prepare escargot Burgundy style, swimming in 
parsley and garlic butter, stuffed into some kind of plastic shell. I can live 
with the plastic, but I do find the whole thing a little tired. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Jean-Pierre Lemanissier of Antoine's in Le Meridien has a better idea. 
Just saying the dish -- feuillete d'escargots au jus de persil -- is a 
mouthful. Eating it is sheer pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a plateful of moss green sauce, a square of puff pastry loaded with 
tiny snails out of the shell and even tinier, pearl-sized balls of turnip, 
carrot and zucchini -- the whole mixture redolent of herbs. This is one of the 
most creative and delicious interpretations of a classic I know of, even if it 
does cost a pretty penny. 
</P>
<P>
 Antoine's is French dining at its most elegant, all silver domes, white 
tuxedos and strolling musicians. If you are going to scare yourself half to 
death, you might as well go out in style. 
</P>
<P>
 Antoine's in Le Meridien, 4500 MacArthur Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 476-2001. 
Dinner 6 to 10:30 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. Feuillete d'escargots au jus 
de persil, $13.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: BOB DYLAN AND THE BAND / "THE BASEMENT TAPES" (RECORDED 
1967, RELEASED 1975) / COLUMBIA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 These legendary tracks originally weren't intended for commercial release. If 
they had been, Dylan and the Band probably would have used something more 
sophisticated than a small tape machine and three microphones.However, they 
managed to leak out to the public via the bootleg industry, and among Dylan 
aficionados "The Basement Tapes" became the most coveted of underground 
recordings. After eight years, Dylan and Columbia Records, recognizing the 
popularity and high quality of these songs, finally released these 24 tracks 
(two more from the sessions would appear on Dylan's boxed "Bootleg Series 
Volumes 1-3.") 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, this trenchant double album owes its existence in large part to a 
near fatal motorcycle accident Dylan suffered in 1966. The then-25-year-old 
folk-rock poet spent nine months recuperating at his home in Woodstock, N.Y., 
seeing only his family and closest friends, who included the members of the 
Band. It wasn't long before Dylan and the Canadian group (which had been 
working as his road band) began to jam together in the basement of a rented 
house they called Big Pink. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Basement Tapes" don't include any of Dylan's many cornerstone numbers 
like "Blowin' in the Wind" or "Like a Rolling Stone." This is instead an 
impressively consistent collection of earthy roots rock material; country, folk 
and blues textures coalesce into raw rock 'n' roll songs that sound so genuine 
and heartfelt, they seem like direct descendants of Elvis' landmark "Sun 
Sessions." Such songs as the boozy "Million Dollar Bash" and the bluesy "Long 
Distant Operator" have a sensual allure and restrained power that are 
absolutely captivating. Dylan and the Band both contributed to the singing and 
songwriting, though Dylan's songs predominate.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: THE BENT BACKED TULIPS / "LOOKING THROUGH . . ." / 
EGGBERT  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One sign of a songwriter who truly has the knack is a surplus of quality 
material that gets locked in the vaults or scattered around on the odd, 
hard-to-find B-side, movie soundtrack or import-only release. Bob Dylan and the 
Band's "Basement Tapes" (see below), The Who's "Odds & Sods" collection, Elvis 
Costello's "Taking Liberties" and "The Great Lost Kinks Album," all 
compilations of rarities and missing links, are sign posts of their respective 
creators' fertility: These were ones that didn't make the cut?! 
</P>
<P>
 The newly defunct Dramarama makes its contribution to this genre with the 
belated arrival of this pseudonymous 1989 album, previously released only in 
Europe (the band name and album title were lifted from the Beatles song, "Glass 
Onion"). The band's singer-songwriter, John Easdale, had come up with more 
material than Dramarama's U.S. label, Chameleon, was willing to put out, 
because it was busy with a concurrent official release, "Stuck in 
Wonderamaland." So Dramarama bootlegged itself in a limited release for the 
Euro fans only. Now we get to hear it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 original tracks of "Looking Through . . ." are here, along with nine 
that were never released anywhere. The only overlap with previously issued 
Dramarama work is "Long Long Gone," a stripped-down, slide guitar version of 
the ballad that was called "Hardly Enough" on "Wonderamaland." 
</P>
<P>
 Through a glass onion or any other lens you choose, Easdale's dark vision 
remained fairly constant over the course of Dramarama's five (now six) albums. 
He has been a bard of frustration and anxiety, singing in a nervous, pinched 
voice or an anguished, full-on cry about loves that fail and hopes that falter. 
His excellent ear for melody, his ability to muster verbal energy with the 
fresh lyrical turn and Dramarama's flexible and not-too-fastidious way with a 
wide range of '60s smart-pop sources were the reasons to keep going back for 
more. All those are present here. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening salvos of "Looking Through . . ." rock ahead; Side Two would have 
made a heck of an "MTV Unplugged" session, but in this, as so many other 
things, Dramarama's luck and timing were off. 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy electric tracks are "I Think," an edgy but wryly bouncy excursion 
through marital hell that finds Easdale adapting an uncharacteristically 
deadpan delivery, and "Tie Me Down," a swarming, irate song that is also 
available as a vinyl single (the B-side is Easdale's more recent solo rendering 
of Morrissey's "Last of the Famous International Playboys"). The acoustic "On 
the Streets" is a real find, a weary and bereft song that calls to mind the 
Beatles' "Across the Universe." Ditto for "Real Easy," a post-mortem on a 
relationship in which the narrator has proved no match for a perhaps 
too-alluring lover: "You really moved like a heartbreaker/You make me shake 
like a salt shaker/You make me feel like a toll-taker."

 A selection of covers, from Stevie Wonder, the Faces, the Monkees and T-Rex, 
keeps up Dramarama's reputation as an all-purpose rock fan club disguised as a 
rock band.

 "Looking Through . . ." is probably only the fourth-best Dramarama album 
(surpassed by "Wonderamaland" and the two fine '90s releases, "Vinyl" and 
"Hi-Fi Sci-Fi"). But it has some stiff competition.

KID STUFF: BLADES OF GLORY; DOROTHY HAMILL PUTS A SPIN ON HER ICE CAPADES BY 
FOCUSING ON WORLD-CLASS SKATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Equipped with 30 years of skating experience and the backing of theater, dance 
and ice show professionals, Dorothy Hamill has hit the once-ailing Ice Capades 
like a Zamboni hits the ice at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamill, whose Dorothy Hamill International purchased the 55-year-old ice show 
out of bankruptcy in June, 1993, has given the company a new sophistication and 
elegance. Instead of skating Smurfs and high-tech dazzle, Hamill and her 
creative team put the focus squarely on high-powered skating and a good story 
well told, as evidenced by last October's performance at the Anaheim Arena of 
"Cinderella . . . Frozen in Time," an elegant, mostly mute retelling of the 
classic fairy tale that featured Hamill in the title role and British pairs 
champion Andrew Naylor as the prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they got used to the change, audiences for the company's opening tour 
reacted positively, said Hamill, who presents her newest show, "Hansel, Gretel, 
the Witch and the Cat" at the Anaheim Arena through Sunday. (The show moves to 
the Forum in Los Angeles Wednesday through Oct. 30, and the San Diego Sports 
Arena Nov. 3 through 6.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say that last year when we made the change, I didn't realize how 
dramatic it would be," recalled Hamill during a phone interview from 
Scottsdale, Ariz., where her family and her company are based. "But since I 
think I've been in every ice show there ever was," she added, laughing 
ruefully, "I knew in my guts it was time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "In surveys, people tell us that when they see an ice show, what they're 
coming to see is the skating, not the biggest and flashiest (effects). So 
that's what we're giving them, world-class skating." 
</P>
<P>
 As well received as "Cinderella . . . " was, however, Hamill admits that it 
didn't reach very young children the way she would have liked. Aside from a 
brief opening narration (which was beefed up after the Anaheim run and 
rerecorded by Lloyd Bridges), "Cinderella . . . " relied chiefly on the 
skater's movements and acting abilities and a classically inspired musical 
score to tell the story. It was effective for most older viewers, especially 
those familiar with live theater and dance, but it apparently left many little 
kids in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 To remedy this, Hamill said she collaborated with her "Hansel . . . " 
designer, Tony Award-winner Desmond Heeley, to bring in visuals and characters 
that would appeal to youngsters. Inspired in part by the 1893 opera by 
Englebert Humperdinck (that's the original one, not the late-model crooner), 
the script finds Hansel and Gretel pursued by a witch with a hearty taste for 
their company, but here she uses more than your basic gingerbread house as a 
lure. She and her feline sidekick bedazzle the kiddies with a party packed with 
such storybook celebrities as Goldilocks, her three bears and the three blind 
mice. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hamill and choreographers Tim Murphy and Nathan Birch have added 
more full-cast dance numbers, with ensemble skaters portraying snowflakes, 
village children, goblins and bats. Comic skaters Jared Randolph and J. Scott 
Driscoll, who respectively played a stepsister-in-drag and Buttons in 
"Cinderella . . .," throw in plenty of physical comedy as the witch and the 
cat. Jennifer Ito skates the role of Gretel; Alexander Fadeev is Hansel, and 
Hamill plays the Evening Star, a fairy guardian derived from two other 
characters in the opera. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know from watching my own daughter, once a child gets past about 2 1/2, 
they don't sit through anything," said Hamill (her daughter Alexandra, 6, has 
traveled with her on and off for years). "So we put in some of this for the 
tiny ones, mostly in the second act. The first act is primarily great skating." 
</P>
<P>
 World-class skating is still what Dorothy Hamill's Ice Capades is about, 
maintains Hamill, who won a gold medal in figure skating at the 1976 Winter 
Olympics. The 38-year-old, who has spent years as a headliner and producer of 
other ice shows, was able to scout out an international cast of top-flight 
skaters for her own company. In the coming years, she says, she plans to step 
out of the performing spotlight to develop original shows for her troupe. (This 
season, she'll appear in half of "Hansel's . . . " 35-city tour, including all 
shows in Orange County and L.A.; Simone Grigorescu skates the Evening Star in 
the other half, which takes in the San Diego dates.) 
</P>
<P>
 A former member of the John Curry Skaters, Hamill says that Curry remains one 
of her primary influences; her casts take part in daily classes that help 
develop their abilities to work as an ensemble. Curry, who died last year, was 
internationally recognized for blending the aesthetics of dance with the 
fluidity and speed of figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never the great artist that John was, but our goal is to have the same 
quality in family entertainment," Hamill said. "John's presence is with us 
every day. This is our way of carrying on his legacy."

WET & WILD; THAT DEEP-DOWN FEELING; A PLUNGE IN CATALINA HYPERBARIC CHAMBER 
GIVES DIVERS A CHANCE TO SAFELY EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Few sport divers ever descend below 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Such depths are generally avoided because of the strange and dangerous things 
that can happen -- most notably nitrogen narcosis, or "rapture of the deep," 
and the bends, a painful and potentially fatal condition brought on by coming 
up too fast after staying too deep too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those dangers -- or perhaps because of them -- a group of fellow 
divers and I recently took a 165-foot dive. Pinching our noses all the way 
down, we forced air through our eustachian tubes to prevent the pressure from 
rupturing our eardrums. At about 120 feet, we began feeling the first twinges 
of rapture; at maximum depth, we were in full-blown ecstasy. To avoid getting 
the bends, we made several long decompression stops on the way up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound risky? Ironically, it was the safest dive I've ever made because we 
never entered the water. The dive took place in the Catalina Hyperbaric 
Chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber is there to treat injured divers, but we were there as part of a 
rescue course to learn more about it. Owned and operated by USC, the 
26-foot-long by 9-foot-wide steel tank -- also known as a re-compression 
chamber -- sits in a hangar at the Wrigley Marine Science Center on the isthmus 
of Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 There, two main types of diving injuries are treated. The first is the bends, 
in which excessive nitrogen in the blood expands into bubbles. The result is 
always painful, often crippling and sometimes fatal. The second is air 
embolism, which happens when a scuba diver ascends while holding his breath or 
experiencing some sort of blockage that prevents the air in his lungs from 
escaping. As the diver comes up, the air expands, eventually rupturing the tiny 
air sacs in the lungs and escaping into the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The treatment for both conditions is to put the patient in the hyperbaric 
chamber and pump enough air into it to increase the pressure to the equivalent 
of a depth of 60 to 165 feet. The ailing diver is then, in effect, "brought up" 
at a rate slow enough for the nitrogen or air bubbles to dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
 This treatment has been administered to 11 divers this year -- 475 since the 
Catalina chamber opened 20 years ago. Then there are the dozens of uninjured 
divers who, for $20 a head, have experienced something called a "chamber dive." 
</P>
<P>
 "Re-compression is a vital part of rescue," Sam Miller IV told me and a dozen 
other divers from the Sports Chalet in Huntington Beach. "The chamber serves a 
vital function in the dive community, and this gives them a hands-on 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 We had another reason for being here. Simply put, it was to experience the 
strange effects of nitrogen narcosis, that build-up of gas in the brain that 
gives divers below 100 feet such odd sensations. If we could learn to recognize 
the rapture in a controlled environment, we would be better equipped to deal 
with it in the ocean, where sound judgment can mean survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowding into the chamber after a briefing outside, six of us waited in 
anticipation as the countdown began. Suddenly the huge compressor jolted awake 
as the chamber began filling with air. 
</P>
<P>
 I experienced a moment of fear. Now there was no turning back. By the time the 
depth gauge read 10 feet, the fear had subsided. Holding my nose to equalize 
the pressure behind my ear drums, I rode the thing on down. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 120 feet, I had the first pleasant symptoms of nitrogen narcosis. 
Sweating in my T-shirt, I suddenly felt light-headed, a sensation that 
increased as did the pressure. By the time the compressor shut off at 165 feet, 
we were all thoroughly zonked. 
</P>
<P>
 Experiencing the rapture of the deep is like being drunk or on drugs. You feel 
a kind of euphoria, a thoroughly unreasonable sense of well-being. It is this 
feeling of imperviousness to danger, of course, that makes the condition so 
dangerous to divers. Imagining themselves invincible, divers can make fatal 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensconced in the safety of the chamber, we spent our six minutes at the bottom 
telling jokes and trying to put the square pegs of a baby's puzzle into their 
round holes. Everything seemed incredibly funny, an illusion undoubtedly 
enhanced by the fact that the pressure on our throats made us all sound like 
Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was time to surface, nobody wanted to go. As pressure decreases, the 
effects of nitrogen disappear almost as quickly as they come on. Within a few 
minutes, we were all feeling normal again. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the chamber's airtight hatch was disengaged, we had spent 44 
minutes under pressure -- a period that seemed much shorter. And though we had 
not traveled an inch, it seemed to all of us that we had been far away. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was great," said Suzanne Pefferman, a 22-year-old UC Irvine student. 
"It's valuable to experience the nitrogen effect and be able to recognize it." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Benjamin Jones, 32, of Huntington Beach: "Definitely an E-ticket ride."

 Big-name volleyball players often lend their names to camps and clinics, but 
at some of these events participants may never even meet the superstars, much 
less learn from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Laszlo says that won't be the case with the Volleyball Technique 
Training Center, a four-hour clinic planned for Saturday at the foot of the 
Huntington Beach Pier. Laszlo is with Huntington Beach-based Third Degree 
Sportswear, which is teaming with Hard Angle Sports to sponsor the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Local professional coach Kevin Bazyourous will lead the clinic with the help 
of several assistants, including at least two pro players, Craig Moothart and 
Sheri Sanders. All will work with the students, Laszlo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Topics include strategy, setting, passing, hitting, defense, blocking and 
serving. Coaches will be aided by video, with assistants shooting footage of 
all participants so coaches can play it back and sharpen the finer points of 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Laszlo said the clinic is designed for all ages and ability levels. 
Participants will get lunch, a T-shirt and other items. When the clinic ends at 
2 p.m., participants can stick around to play. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead to next weekend, two events are planned for Rancho Santa 
Margarita on Oct. 30, both presented by SBR Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the Fall Showdown, a duathlon that serves as a regional championship 
for Tri Fed (a national organization overseeing multi-sport events). The 
duathlon will include a 5K run, a 30K bike ride and another 5K run. 
</P>
<P>
 Also planned is the Run Beneath the Peaks 8K. 
</P>
<P>
 Race-day registration for both events begins at 6 a.m. Information: (714) 
858-7386. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Volleyball Technique Training Center. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, Oct. 22, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Registration opens at 9 a.m.

ALL-TOO HUMAN CONDITION; LIFE'S HARSH REALITIES SOMETIMES DANCE INTO 
NEDERLANDS' OFFERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Kaguyahime" is an ancient Japanese legend that tells the story of a beautiful 
moon child who comes to Earth and through her matchless beauty unintentionally 
wreaks havoc here. For choreographer Jiri Kylian, director of the Nederlands 
Dans Theater, the story is "almost like Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fascinating story of someone who wants to give love and peace and 
instead seeds hatred and wars," he says. "That's what (human beings) are about. 
We keep doing this over and over again -- Yugoslavia, Haiti, all over the 
place. We will repeat that way. Human beings don't have an ability to improve." 
</P>
<P>
 In its first West Coast appearance in 14 years, NDT will dance Kylian's 
full-length version of "Kaguyahime," as well as some of his shorter works. The 
engagement runs Tuesday through Oct. 30 at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Europe's most influential choreographers, Kylian is known in this 
country mostly through other companies dancing his works, because the costs of 
bringing NDT abroad are often prohibitive. At the center alone, American Ballet 
Theatre danced his "Sinfonietta" (to the familiar Janacek score) in 1991, the 
Australian Ballet danced "Return to the Strange Land" (music by Janacek) in 
1990 and the San Francisco Ballet danced "Forgotten Land" (Britten) in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Prague in 1947, Kylian fled from his native Czechoslovakia in 1968, 
literally on the last train out after the collapse of the "Prague Spring" of 
Alexander Dubcek. He found sanctuary in Stuttgart, Germany, with John Cranko's 
Stuttgart Ballet, where he began choreographing, then later moved to Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 With his emigre background, it is not surprising that a concern for the human 
situation surfaces in his work. But he insists: "I am not a political 
choreographer. I don't believe politics should be conveyed through dance. Other 
media in art convey that much clearer and better. Dance should remain dance. 
Music is about music. Dance is about dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when the opportunity presents itself, the choreographer does allow his 
pessimism about the human race to surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the repertory pieces, "No More Play," for instance, was inspired by "a 
tiny sculpture by Giacometti that looks like a little board game (that) no one 
knows how to play. Yes, like life, exactly! 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what it means to me. We come to life. We only assume as we make our 
moves that we understand the rules. We finish our life. By the last sigh, maybe 
we have understood something. It is a very abstract work. This is what it means 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 This work and others on the mixed repertory programs are characteristic of his 
latest concerns. Over the last few years, he says, "I started making works that 
are very Spartan -- stark, very little costuming, very little color. In fact, I 
went back to the essentials: music, dance, light and space, which is very 
complicated. All (of the essentials) are very complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's actually only dealing with the essential things you need. All the 
unnecessary things were chucked out. I refer to those works as like those 
children's drawings which give you the outlines and you fill in the coloring. I 
call my (new) ballets 'coloring books.' I expect the public to put in their own 
colors. I give them basically the outlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm talking about their understanding, their emotional coloring. In that way, 
I expect a lot of active participation of the audience. The audience here is 
used to that (but) I really wonder how the Orange County audience will react. 
I'm very optimistic. We're coming with full vigor."

VIDEO REWIND; 'ROMERO': FROM PACIFISM TO PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When we first meet Oscar Romero in the fact-based 1989 film "Romero," he is a 
bookish, timid priest seemingly unconcerned with the growing sociopolitical 
troubles gripping his country of El Salvador. Indeed, Romero is appointed 
archbishop largely because he is a passive figure unlikely to make political 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the film (which takes place in the late '70s and early '80s) 
progresses, the once unassertive monsignor becomes an increasingly outspoken 
critic of the violence and government oppression plaguing the small Central 
American country. Thanks to actor Raul Julia, the awakening of Romero's social 
conscience is both realistically subtle and deeply moving. Julia deftly conveys 
the internal and external emotions of a holy man desperately trying to make 
sense of the madness around him. 
</P>
<P>
 At times the actor reacts to the injustices around him with impassioned anger. 
But mostly he conveys a spirit of thoughtful though intense introspection as 
his idealistic character begins the difficult process of reshaping his role as 
a spiritual and moral leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero's lofty goal is to help achieve social justice without violent 
confrontation. He feels great sympathy for the poor who live in squalid 
conditions under the dictatorial and sometimes brutish military regime. Yet he 
cannot reconcile the armed rebellion by leftist guerrillas with his pacifist 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero refuses to view himself as a political activist. He tries vainly to 
serve as a mediator between the guerrillas and the government. Still, the 
gentle archbishop is labeled a communist sympathizer by authorities when he 
decries the extrajudicial killings of priests and peasants who favor political 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the film's most inspiring sequences, Romero attempts to reclaim a 
church that has been commandeered by the national guard. Initially, the 
courageous archbishop is threatened by gunfire and ejected from the premises by 
a surly American soldier. But soon after, Romero returns with a mass of 
believers in tow. It's a spine-tingling moment when the throng of worshipers 
marches peacefully past a group of helpless soldiers and into the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Romero" also succeeds in bringing a human face to a combustive political 
situation that for years made worldwide headlines. The film presents the 
grinding poverty of the masses and the privileged lives of the elite. While 
viewing this film it's not hard to understand why the common people want 
political and social change and why the ruling class is so insistent on 
retaining its monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Romero" (1989), directed by John Duigan. 105 minutes. Rated PG-13. JON 
MATSUMOTO

KIDS ON FILM: 'NIGHTMARE' STEPS OFF SCREEN AND HITS HOME; IN "WES CRAVEN'S NEW 
NIGHTMARE," THE STEEL-FINGERED FREDDY, STAR OF MULTIPLE PREVIOUS HORROR FLICKS, 
RETURNS TO HAUNT THE REAL LIFE OF THE SERIES' HEROINE, HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS 
HEATHER LANGENKAMP (PLAYING HERSELF) AND HER SON, DYLAN. (RATED R)

<P>
 For moms who want to be scared beyond their worst nightmare, it probably can't 
get any better than this: scene after scene of the widow Langenkamp unable to 
help her child from real and/or imagined horrors. They include a plunge into 
hell -- where the young boy knows she was his last possible hope, then watches 
screaming as she appears to die. 
</P>
<P>
 But what parent needs it? 
</P>
<P>
 Some kids, on the other hand, really love this stuff. For them, it could have 
been a lot better. In fact, they said it was better in the earlier Freddy 
movies, which they thought were scarier, funnier and more original. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to understand," said Matt Schandler, 13. "You couldn't tell if it 
was a dream or it was real." 
</P>
<P>
 And compared to some other horror movies that are also in their umpteenth 
incarnation as sequels, this Freddy film didn't always cut it. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Friday the 13th' was scarier," Matt said. "That was more suspenseful. This 
was, like, mostly dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chad McDonald, 11, who had seen every Freddy movie on video, said, "This 
one was probably the second best. The last one, No. 6 ('The Final Nightmare,') 
was probably the best because it was more of a comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one, it never really showed (Freddy) 'til the end." 
</P>
<P>
 To Chad's mind, the best part was a scary voice singing a song from the last 
Freddy movie: "One, two, Freddy's coming for you." 
</P>
<P>
 His second favorite part was in the hospital, where Freddy takes Dylan's 
baby-sitter and, similar to a scene in the original Freddy movie, puts her on 
the ceiling and "kills her and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Ohhhhh-kay. 
</P>
<P>
 But ultimately, Chad said, sequels are boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was like they put all the movies together. In 6, they took the song, and 
they took a lot of parts from 1, some parts from 4." 
</P>
<P>
 If Wes Craven does it again, Chad said he'll see the movie, but only if it is 
different from this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to have something kind of new." 
</P>
<P>
 However, this sequel, a movie within a movie, worked for some kids precisely 
because it hit closer to home. Not only could many still relate to Dylan's 
night terrors and fears of the dark, they could also understand the terrifying 
earthquakes and aftershocks depicted in the Los Angeles setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it better than the other ones," said Casey McGuire, 13. Seeing actors 
playing themselves being affected by the parts they have played "made it 
scarier," he said. "It keeps you more on the edge of your seat." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he liked the special effects, such as the scene in which Freddy's 
tongue extends to several feet and wraps around the mother like a boa 
constrictor. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Friedrich, 10, said his favorite part was when Freddy's hand kills a 
man when he's driving a car. But all things considered, he prefers Jason and 
the "Friday the 13th" movies, such as "Jason Goes to Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys all said the "Nightmare" movies have never given them bad dreams. But 
one 6-year-old came out growling and snarling like Freddy, who lived in the 
bottom of the young boy's bed. "I hated it," he hissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope he, too, can make it through the night.

SPECIAL SCREENING: NOW THIS IS A MOVIE WITH LEGS 
</P>

 Mention Rita Hayworth to my dad, and there was always a good chance he'd 
growl, something like this: "Oh yes, nobody was quite like that Rita . . . 
Grrrr. " 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure he had one of Hayworth's famous 1940s pinup posters, but he did 
confess that he thought of her more than a few times while flying over China as 
a fighter pilot during the war. There were dozens of knockout starlets in 
Hollywood during that time, but listening to my father, she was the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Hayworth became known as a sex-tress, a beauty with a jungle of red 
hair and longer-than-life legs, she began as a dancer. There were a handful of 
mediocre-to-good musicals (many for Columbia studio) with Fred Astaire, and a 
few with Astaire's main competition for king of the steppers, Gene Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those Hayworth-Kelly vehicles, "Cover Girl," will screen Friday 
afternoon in a free presentation at the Cypress Senior Citizens Center. The 
1944 movie, made at the height of Hayworth's popularity, isn't in the same 
league with recognized musical classics such as "Singin' in the Rain" or "Top 
Hat," but it does show why Hayworth was a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being camera-friendly, she was a spirited, surprisingly athletic 
dancer who could keep up with the men, including the ever-spry Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 The choreography by Val Rasat and Seymour Felix is better than average, and so 
are the tunes by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin. That's fortunate, because the 
plot, based on a short story by Erwin Gelsey, is pretty pooped out. Like most 
musicals, we don't enjoy "Cover Girl" for its great drama or insightful 
character development. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayworth plays Rusty Parker, a nice girl performing in a chorus-line revue at 
a small-potatoes nightclub in Brooklyn. Danny McGuire (Kelly) owns it, and he 
happens to be in love with the shy Rusty. 
</P>
<P>
 She has grand ideas percolating behind those big eyes, though, and enters a 
beauty contest promising fame and fortune. Rusty wins, of course, and is soon 
being seduced by a hotshot producer (Lee Bowman) and his offer of a Broadway 
role. This drives Danny crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked among all the cliches and predictability are the many song-and-dance 
sequences, illuminated like lights on a Christmas tree, thanks to the electric 
hues of Technicolor. Phil Silvers plays Genius, Danny's sidekick (think of him 
as a Kmart version of Donald O'Connor in "Singin' in the Rain") and, despite 
minor vocal and hoofing ability, provides the requisite shenanigans. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the kickiest performance comes from Eve Arden as a magazine editor 
who unwittingly puts Rusty on her path to celebrity. Arden, with her huskily 
superior voice and pinpoint comic timing, snags our attention, even in most of 
the scenes with Hayworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly is also dependable throughout, especially in his one solo, in which he 
dances with a mirror image of himself up and down a dark Brooklyn street. It's 
the picture's most inventive sequence. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's really Hayworth's movie. She was never an exceptional actress, but, 
as they say, the camera loved her. She had screen presence, the kind good 
enough to growl over. 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Cover Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, Oct. 21, at 12:45 p.m.

FINDING THE SALT OF THE EARTH AT OSAKA KAPPO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kansai (literally, "west of the barrier") is the large district of Honshu 
where many of Japan's major cities, such as Kyoto, Kobe and Osaka, are 
concentrated. To devotees of Japanese cooking, kansai means earthy, assertive 
flavors, with more salt and less soy than in other parts of Japan, all served 
with a roll-up-your-sleeves informality. It's my favorite part of Japan for 
eating. 
</P>
<P>
 A Tustin restaurant named Osaka Kappo specializes in the kansai cuisine of 
Osaka, prepared by the firm hand of a master chef named Itsuki. Kappo are small 
dishes designed to accompany beer or sake -- Japanese-style pub food, if you 
will. Itsuki-san (as he is known, using the honorific commonly attached to 
Japanese surnames) will prepare sushi if you insist, but asking for sushi 
misses the point of this kitchen by a country mile. Coming to Osaka Kappo for 
sushi is like going down to the wharf for a juicy steak. 
</P>
<P>
 That goes double when you consider that this may be the best Japanese food 
Orange County has yet seen. Sitting at the counter the other night, I got into 
a discussion with a self-styled Japanese gourmet, a native of Osaka. "I eat in 
all the best Japanese restaurants in Southern California," he confided, "and no 
one can duplicate the taste of Osaka like Itsuki-san." 
</P>
<P>
 I second that emotion. Itsuki-san makes a wonderfully smoky dashi , the broth 
of mushroom, seaweed and shaved bonito that is the heart of Japanese cooking, 
and has a subtle touch with cooked dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, one evening I ordered tara (butterfish) and waited, expecting an 
ordinary piece of broiled fish. But what was handed me over the counter was a 
slice of the flaky, rich fish, skin on, on a limpid pool of spicy yuzu 
(Japanese citrus) sauce. The fish came topped with a lightly browned cloud of 
egg white embedded with a basil-like herb called mitsuba . Three slices of 
exquisite matsutake mushroom hid out in the cloud, waiting to be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 If a chef like Nobu Matsuhisa, the bicoastal star of Matsuhisa in Los Angeles 
and the newly opened Nobu in New York, were to add this dish to his menu, he'd 
probably get national attention for it. But here in a quiet part of Tustin, 
Itsuki-san has to content himself with the gratitude of a nearly all-Japanese 
clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't help matters that most of Osaka Kappo's menu is in Japanese, 
either. The menu has a printed apologia: " Kappo dishes are hard to translate," 
it says. But the fact is that on a 133-item menu, the dishes numbered from 56 
to 133 are written in Japanese, and that doesn't even take into account the 
specials blackboard at the back of the restaurant, which is also entirely, 
maddeningly, in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Osaka Kappo is a modest place, just a few tables and a long curved counter. 
The decor is limited to a few ceramic plates (one emblazoned with a tengu , or 
demon) and a bunch of watercolors depicting golf scenes. Itsuki-san works with 
a staff of about eight. Some of the hot dishes, such as noodles in iron pots, 
come out of a rear kitchen. Four chefs work up front in full view, assisting 
the master. 
</P>
<P>
 Order an alcoholic beverage and you'll be given a dish of edamame , delicious 
cooked soybeans that you pop into your mouth direct from the pod. Ask the 
waitress for ankimo , creamy monkfish liver. It is the Japanese equivalent of 
foie gras , and a few pink slices make a masterful beginning for a meal. From 
there, you might move on to a dish of simply grilled Japanese eggplant or 
perhaps yudofu , hot squares of tofu eaten with grated carrot and radish. Both 
can be ordered in English, though as it happens, neither is on the English part 
of the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 There are good things on the English menu, too. One is written down as aspara 
bataa yaki , another as anago shichimi yaki . The first is a hearty roulade of 
grilled, marinated beef and asparagus. The beef is soft and the vegetables 
crunchy, resulting in lots of textural fun. The second is truly wonderful -- 
lightly grilled saltwater eel, sprinkled with orange- and pepper-flavored 
shichimi , which means "seven spices." 
</P>
<P>
 Kappo bento is a dinner box containing several Japanese delicacies. In the box 
you find a light tempura of fish and vegetables flanked by perfectly cut pieces 
of marinated and grilled beef, rice and pickles. On the side, you'll get a cup 
of chawan mushi , an ethereal Japanese savory custard with a surprise at the 
bottom: gingko nuts, chicken and sweet shrimp. You also get okara , a fluffy 
dish made from a byproduct of tofu -- in effect, the whey, separated out from 
the milk of the soybean. 
</P>
<P>
 Finish a meal here by insisting on chazuke (not available from the English 
menu), a hot iron pot filled with broth, cooked rice, tiny pearls of crisp 
rice, a meat or fish of your choice and a healthy dose of hot tea. When I was 
married and living in Tokyo, my late father-in-law, a proper Tokyo businessman, 
chastised me roundly for eating chazuke in public. "A gentleman never eats 
chazuke , except when he is at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not in Tokyo. But in Osaka, and in all of the Kansai region, for that 
matter, those restrictions don't exist, only the sheer joy of eating does. And 
at Osaka Kappo, joy is right across the counter, waiting to be handed to you. 
</P>
<P>
 Osaka Kappo is moderately priced. Kappo dishes are $3.50 to $12.95. Dinner 
boxes are $11.75 to $14.75. Combination dinners are $7.25 to $9.25.

LOST IN O.C.: REST STOP ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to the Times Orange County Edition. (T. Jefferson Parker is on vacation; his 
column will resume in this spot Nov. 3.) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doesn't the perpetually "just-around the corner" information superhighway 
strike you as being as lost in the distant future as the Santa Ana Freeway 
completion? I got so tired of waiting that I finally concluded that, if I lower 
my expectations sufficiently, the highway is already here. 
</P>
<P>
 The vaunted superhighway is supposed to use our telephone lines to bring us a 
broad array of interactive learning, entertainment and shopping experiences. My 
phone already has that. They call it telemarketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Like anyone smarter than a toaster oven, I used to really resent these 
intrusions on my privacy. When I'm in my little castle I want to settle down in 
front of the TV and watch commercials and movies with shameless product 
placements, not listen to sales pitches on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I can tell, these people calling must have gills, because they never 
stop to breathe as you and I must: 
</P>
<P>
 "Good evening Mister Washburn how are you tonight the reason I'm calling is to 
let you and a select few number of persons in your community namely everyone 
except chinchillas know about a limited offer to subscribe to Putsch the 
Germanic humor magazine which if you subscribe now comes with a free musical 
beer stein and a portion of your subscription goes to help chilly cheerleaders 
into their sweaters can we count on your continued support?"  
</P>
<P>
 I'd typically respond: "Excuse me. Could you repeat all that? I had a tongue 
in my ear." 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago I made a tape of my voice I'd play into the mouthpiece when these 
people called. I made it with anticipated pauses and responses to try to give 
the telemarketer the impression he or she was actually talking to someone. 
</P>
<P>
 As might be expected, there would be uncomfortable gaps, interruptions and 
non-sequiturial responses aplenty. It was appalling to hear just how much some 
people were willing to compensate to avoid realizing they were talking to a 
machine. It was still more appalling to sometimes hear my prerecorded voice 
inadvertently agree to buy whatever snake knives they were hawking. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, with the right attitude, I find it's not a chore but a challenge 
to interact with my new telephone buddies. Some moments lately have made it 
worthwhile. For example, a Pacific Bell representative recently called to try 
to sell me on some of its extra services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see you already have our Call Waiting feature," she began, as if we're 
supposed to be delighted that the phone company turns our records over to 
sales-commission commandos. "I'd like to mention some of the other services we 
offer such as blah blah and blah." 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh-huh." 
</P>
<P>
 "And are you aware of the advantages of our Call Screening feature?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well I know that if I had it I wouldn't be talking to you right now." 
</P>
<P>
 In the sparring of telemarketing phone chess, that evidently counts as a 
checkmate, since the pitch halted there. These are the kinds of retorts I 
usually think of long after the fact, but I think this interactive stuff is 
honing my skills. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite phone person to pester is a passing acquaintance, a guy who once 
sold me a guitar amp. That tenuous connection is evidently sufficient for him 
to accept me as a brother, since he keeps calling up with tremendous offers for 
me to get in on the verdant ground floor of various health elixir multilevel 
marketing schemes he's involved in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim, this company is really doing it right, with high commissions and none of 
the underhanded stuff of the other multilevels." 
</P>
<P>
 "By other , you mean like the one you were so hot for me to buy into three 
months ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well that one changed . This organization is . . . " and he started reeling 
off percentages and nets. Finally he described the product: $89.95 bottles of a 
green powder made from plankton, wheat grass and probably old Otter Pops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me cite some case histories, Jim. A Mr. C.K. began taking Green 
Bluxphena, and after three weeks his lifelong asthma cleared up. Mrs. L.M. said 
Green Bluxphena made her arthritis disappear. Chronic fatigue sufferers report 
being reinvigorated by drinking it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, that's great! Have they tried using it on dead people?" 
</P>
<P>
 The phone lines are but one of the many electronic avenues into our homes now, 
the latest being these new $800 satellite dishes the size of a hubcap that are 
supposed to carry hundreds of channels of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Add that to the phone-linked superhighway, cable TV and whatnot, and you 
realize that soon we'll have far more channels than there are things to put on 
them. Eventually, they'll have to put TV cameras in everyone's homes and we'll 
just watch each other all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, I'm determined to be prepared. I'm already having business 
cards made that read "Jim Washburn, Media Giant." I also went and got myself a 
radio show, which I'm finding isn't necessarily as much fun as starring in your 
own comic book, in case you're ever faced with a choice between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is on KUCI-FM 88.9 Wednesdays at 8 p.m., by the way. (A phrase, by 
the way, that I use here to give the impression I'm incidentally mentioning a 
little tidbit, which just happens to be the SHAMELESS PLUG that the rest of 
this column only exists to lead up to. Please listen or I'll kill myself. With 
asparagus spears, by the way.) 
</P>
<P>
 KUCI used to have a broadcast range that went about as far as they could 
projectile vomit, which, being a college station, is a pretty respectable 
heave. They have since upped the signal to where it can be heard in most parts 
of the county, if folks would just tune down to that scary part of the dial. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not until your voice is being broadcast into, gee, what must be literally 
several homes, that you realize how certain trademark words crop up in your 
vocabulary. In my case that word is "Um." I will diagram its proper use in the 
following sentence: "Um, that last, um, song . . . um, was from, um, a, um . . 
. some CD." On my debut show I used enough ums to stuff a beanbag chair. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing like hanging around a college station to make you feel old. 
Not only haven't I heard of most of the bands the other deejays play, I haven't 
even heard of the bands they tell me those bands sound like. 
</P>
<P>
 In selecting the music I play, I try to imagine that my listeners are about my 
age, vaguely dissatisfied with life and in their cars driving the county's 
highways with one hand on a button wired to 17 pounds of high explosives in 
their trunks. My job, as I see it, is to keep them listening, engaged by the 
music and curious enough about what the next song will be that they never press 
that button. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that I take the gig that seriously. If you heard several explosions the 
other Wednesday it's because the first song I played was by Yoko Ono.

3-HOUR TOUR; A GREAT PLACE TO MEET CREEPS AND CLOWNS

 Elm Street had the concession long enough. It was about time nightmares came 
to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 6 to 7:10: The capacity of pizza to cause nightmares may not yet be 
scientifically documented, but it's already made the annals of popular wisdom, 
so pizza's a perfect warm-up for the Creep Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 That's especially the case when you load up on anchovies, which is what my 
wife and I did with two anchovy-optional dishes at Peppino's down the road in 
Lake Forest: a Caesar salad gloriously sloppy with the little fish and 
mozzarella ($4.45, enough to split), and Carlo Special, a fresh tomato, olive 
oil, basil, garlic and Romano pizza on an ultra-thin crust ($10.45, enough to 
split many ways). The family restaurant offers an extensive Italian menu, and 
Italian beers including Peroni and Moretti. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign says "Italian pastries & cakes" in red, green and white neon; on the 
tables are typical red and white tablecloths and on the walls less typical 
prints including "Reclining Salad," in which various vegetables get together to 
depict a female nude from the rear. The place was bustling when we walked in -- 
there wasn't an empty table -- but by the time we left, the line was out to the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 7:10 to 7:15: The Creep Festival ticket ($9.75) includes admission to 
Halloween-inspired attractions as well as carnival games and rides. (And Linda 
Blair will be there tonight, with her head on straight.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you've got little ones (free admission for kids under 5), stop first at 
Kiddie Krypt. It's about as scary as Casper -- these ghosts shake hands! Even 
Barney was there. An animatronic skeleton puppet performed acrobatics on a gym 
bar in the middle of a pumpkin patch, but perhaps scariest of all, a slightly 
flustered Bozo asked my 7-year-old, "Would you like a little clown?" Ryan 
accepted the balloon he was actually offering. 
</P>
<P>
 7:15 to 7:35: At Nightmare Castle, we smugly noted signs such as "Warning: Not 
recommended for people with weak hearts." The greeter looked like Uncle Fester 
in monastery garb. Admittance is staggered so that castle inhabitants can give 
you their frightening best. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls literally had eyes, severed heads came alive, and a surprise waited 
around every corner. Characters jumped out from nowhere, and everywhere, 
wielding butcher knives and the like, and soon we were surprised to the point 
that we started to move as a huddled unit. Apparently endlessly recycled blood 
spewed forth from one skeleton's mouth; no bones about it, it was a veritable 
fountain of guts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cockroach Cavern offered tactile effects of an indeterminate nature. In the 
graveyard, an epitaph said, "Here lies the body of Henry Moore, he got in the 
way of a .44." I figured the great sculptor had died peacefully; that rhyme 
would have stopped him in any case. 
</P>
<P>
 7:35 to 7:50: "Look, there's even a spooky moon," Ryan noted on our way to the 
Hayride. 
</P>
<P>
 But the characters we encountered on the ride -- a truck pulled a trailer 
using bales of hay for seats -- got no respect. When one that looked like a 
bloody Al Bundy, only worse, ran menacingly behind the truck, one passenger 
commented, "I think he needs to change his clothes." When a particularly 
grotesque female character threatened, "I'd love to have you for dinner," the 
kids yelled back, "Hi, Mom!" 
</P>
<P>
 As in the original movie, Frankenstein's monster was a pitiable creature; 
Franky frankly didn't scare anybody. When one girl accepted a ghoul's 
invitation -- "Room for one more," he beckoned -- the truck began to pull away 
and leave her with the creatures of the night, to everybody's delight. Whereas 
Nightmare Castle left us a tad jumpy, the Hayride just proved a hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 7:50 to 8: The midway is dotted with a variety of activities. Kids can play, 
for instance, inside an inflated castle and apparently have as much fun as on 
more sophisticated attractions; for adults, it's a bit hard on the knees. At 
Sing Your Heart Out Creepy-oke, six preteen girls tackled "Love Shack." It's $1 
per song to sing; a recorded memento is $3, or 2 for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 8 to 9: The carnival offers several free rides. 
</P>
<P>
 The high point of my night, literally and figuratively, was the Toboggan. You 
ascend vertically, one car at a time, do six fast loops down and come to a 
bumpy conclusion. Two people in the claustrophobic little cages is bad enough; 
we squeezed in three. When it was over, we rode it again. The Spider actually 
looks like an octopus, and appears innocent enough at rest. But once in motion, 
the legs not only go around but up and down while the car itself spins in both 
directions. "You're going to barf your head off," a little girl screamed down 
to her friend. Moments after the ride began, I thought out loud, "When does it 
ever end?" "It doesn't," Ryan answered. "That's the fun of it!" I closed my 
eyes and somehow got through. Ryan went on again. 
</P>
<P>
 You can save $3, and your innards, by just watching the gyroscopic, one-seat 
Spaceball, which spins the rider in every direction. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Go Gator took off with a screech but was perfect for the truly 
wee ones. Because this ride, as well as the Toboggan, Spider and a Superslide, 
are free, even if the kids want to go on again and again and again, there'll 
still be money left over for churros and cotton candy.

O.C. MAKING DRUGS FOR OFFICERS TO SELL; CRIME: SANTA ANA POLICE ARREST 350 
SMALL BUYERS IN 'REVERSE STINGS' AFTER TAKING THE CRACK COCAINE TO STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County authorities have been secretly manufacturing rock cocaine for 
Santa Ana police to sell in undercover operations targeting small-time drug 
buyers in several neighborhoods, including the area near Willard Intermediate 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice is considered extremely risky by many law enforcement officials, 
including police in Los Angeles and San Diego. But Santa Ana police have sought 
special court orders in the last 18 months to make hundreds of sales, Police 
Chief Paul M. Walters said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not playing games here," the chief said. "We're trying to give the 
streets back to the residents and we're making progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said the department resorted to the so-called reverse sting operations 
-- where officers act as drug dealers -- because they were not making a dent in 
the trafficking by posing as prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Powder cocaine seized in Santa Ana drug busts is taken to the Orange County 
Crime Laboratory, where it is cooked into "rocks" -- also known as crack 
cocaine -- to be sold in $10 and $20 pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the operation started, officers have made about 350 arrests -- about 100 
of them within several blocks of Willard Intermediate School, said Capt. Bruce 
Carlson. Most of the others were arrested in a neighborhood targeted by the 
federally funded anti-crime program known as Weed and Seed. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two or three of those busted have been minors, said Dean Allen, head 
of the public defender's Juvenile Court office. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to keep kids away from drugs, I think there are probably a lot 
of better ways to do it than just to sell them drugs," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing serious potential liabilities involved with distributing real 
narcotics, the Los Angeles and San Diego police departments say they do not 
employ the technique used by Santa Ana officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have got to ask yourself if it is worth doing," said LAPD Lt. Sergio 
Diaz, who supervises street narcotics investigations in West Los Angeles. "What 
happens when a suspect makes off with the dope or they put it in their mouths? 
You have just introduced a drug into the community that wouldn't have been 
there. There could be problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Arenberg, executive director of the National Assn. of Police Chiefs in 
Washington, D.C., said the technique is simply too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate to be the department that permits this to happen and it turns out 
that somebody overdoses or has a heart attack after swallowing this stuff," 
Arenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters acknowledged that reintroducing drugs to the streets is somewhat 
unorthodox but he said no one -- not the police officers nor the buyers -- has 
been injured. Police said some buyers have ingested the rocks before they could 
be arrested, but Walters said there have been no reports of buyers suffering 
ill-effects from swallowing the substance. And he said undercover officers have 
tried to avoid sales to juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 During processing at the crime lab, the individual rocks are coated with a 
special dye that causes any part of the body to glow when touched by the drug 
and later illuminated under a black light. That helps police identify suspects 
who swallow the drugs or try to drop them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the sales are made in such small quantities, Capt. Carlson said, there 
is little danger in putting harmful quantities of drugs back on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason we are doing this is because there is drug activity occurring 
in these neighborhoods," Carlson said. "We're trying to do what works for 
solving our own problems here." 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called reverse sting operations are common in the high-stakes drug wars 
where investigators flash large amounts of narcotics to net big dealers. But on 
the streets, the tactic of selling small amounts of drugs to capture drug users 
is controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, a Florida appeals court put a stop to a similar operation, 
ruling that the sheriff of Broward County acted illegally in manufacturing 
crack cocaine for undercover investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court in Florida upheld the ruling, resulting in the 
reversal of hundreds of cases. "It is incredible that law enforcement's 
manufacture of an inherently dangerous controlled substance, like crack 
cocaine, can ever be for the public safety," the court said in its ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants arrested in the Florida cases have now a filed class action lawsuit 
in federal court asking for more than $1 million in assets that were seized 
from them after the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana officials, however, stress that the operation has passed California 
legal tests and scrutiny by the Santa Ana city attorney's office and the Orange 
County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department, which runs the county crime lab, did not respond to 
requests for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Carl W. Armbrust, head of the office's narcotic enforcement 
unit, declined to comment. However, in court orders filed in connection with 
the Santa Ana cases, prosecutors cite cases reviewed by state appeals courts 
and the California Supreme Court as having approved the technique of reverse 
sting operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police have also said that no problems have surfaced so far and that 
rock cocaine is being used because the substance is not water soluble and will 
have no effect on the body if swallowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson said the department chose not to use rock cocaine confiscated off the 
streets because it could contain more harmful impurities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Processing it through the crime lab ensures that it's pure cocaine that we 
use," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one police officer is granted access to the county lab to retrieve the 
drugs, police said. Carlson said the drug buys are videotaped and a supervisor 
is always on the scene. He acknowledged, however, that the drugs are not always 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is ingested on occasion, and sometimes people throw it away," he said. The 
police form used to track the narcotics actually allows officers to note 
whether the drugs were "recovered," "swallowed" or "not found." Of the 41 rocks 
sold under one court order, 10 were swallowed during arrests, court documents 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing's 100% foolproof," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional security measure requires police to obtain court orders for each 
batch of rocks released. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say they have obtained as many as five court orders 
authorizing the reverse stings. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Michael Brenner's signature appears on the 
court orders, but the judge said Wednesday that he did not recall considering 
such requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe they would go to the trouble for a court order for such a 
small amount of dope for a reverse sting," Brenner said, adding that he does 
recall approving larger quantities in the "multi-kilo range" for use in larger 
police investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenner said he did not know the role of the Orange County crime laboratory in 
the process, but had heard "some attorneys joking that they were making rock 
cocaine over there." 
</P>
<P>
 "It does have an unseemly side to it, doesn't it?" Brenner said of the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys with the Orange County public defender's office said they have seen 
hundreds of the Santa Ana reverse sting cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're mostly $10 or $20 buys. I've seen less," said Bob Knox, a deputy 
public defender who handles preliminary hearings in Santa Ana Municipal Court. 
"In my opinion, its sort of an easy way to make a lot of felony arrests for 
drugs and show statistically that you're making busts." 
</P>
<P>
 Processing the cocaine in the county crime lab for sale is drawing even more 
serious concerns among local defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why does the crime lab need to make dope?" asked Deputy Public Defender Brian 
Ducker. " And rock cocaine especially, which is even more deadly than powdered 
cocaine. I'm worried about them killing someone. Someone could overdose. 
Someone could die. There are a lot of things that are possible and hardly worth 
the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Other local police departments have opted to use decoy cocaine in reverse 
sting operations because there is no risk that real drugs will escape into the 
community. Huntington Beach Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said investigators 
there have used crushed drywall in lieu of powdered cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police have used macadamia nuts or pebbles in place of real rock 
cocaine, or actual tar to resemble black tar heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far for us, it works just as well as the real thing. If the real thing 
gets away from you, there's always the issue of why not use fake cocaine," 
Lowenberg said. "We've had good success with the prosecution of cases where we 
have used fake cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police say peddling the real thing allows police to charge suspects 
with drug possession, which merits stiffer punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney William J. Kopeny described the reverse sting process as too 
aggressive. "Here we have a situation of police not only solving the crime but 
supplying the crime," he said. "Do we really want the government to engage in 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police, however, say the drastic tactic was necessary because of the 
city's serious street drug problem. The operations have targeted the 1300 block 
of North Ross Street near Willard School and the Weed and Seed project area, 
bounded by First Street, McFadden Avenue and Sullivan and Raitt streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that we're trying to do is bring long-term change to these 
neighborhoods by eliminating signs of visible crime," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 55% of people who cruise Santa Ana's streets in search of drugs come 
from other cities, Carlson said. Cracking down on buyers discourages them from 
coming to town and eventually discourages sellers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get the message out that Santa Ana is not the place to come 
and buy drugs," Carlson said.

SOLE OFFICER SOUGHT AID AT GRANT HIGH 
</P>

 Despite signs that tensions between Armenian and Latino students at Grant High 
School were increasing this week, only one Los Angeles Unified School District 
police officer was on campus when skirmishes erupted just outside the school 
gates Tuesday that ended with two stabbings and a shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 School district police acknowledged Wednesday the officer had requested help 
because of rumors that a fight might erupt but that another officer was not 
dispatched to the school until after classes ended for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school district police Chief Wes Mitchell said the district has 
just seven patrol units for the entire San Fernando Valley and actual 
emergencies take priority over rumors of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grant officer, Jack Lee, was overwhelmed by the flare-ups, which began at 
about 2 p.m. Lee, who declined to be interviewed, called for help a second time 
to report that a large group of students were fighting, said Sgt. Steve Masters 
of the school district police. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came out of school and saw this large group of kids and they were 
polarizing and getting ready to fight," Masters said. "He was excited. It's not 
what normally happens after school." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Tuesday's melee involved between 50 and 100 students and that one 
officer would be unable to quell large-scale fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Animosity between Armenian and Latino students had been growing since a fight 
broke out last Wednesday and students said they expected more problems on the 
campus. Tensions were high Tuesday and students said rumors were rampant about 
another fight, said Andrea Bauman, a 16-year-old junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knew that something was going to go on," said Bauman, who was trying 
to drive out of the school parking lot Tuesday when the fight erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Armenian juniors suffered multiple stab wounds as they left the campus 
Tuesday afternoon. Police said they ran to a relative's house near the school 
for help. One of the boys, whose names were not made public, was released from 
Valley Medical Center on Wednesday and the other, who suffered a collapsed 
lung, remained hospitalized for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old Latino boy was wounded in the calf in a drive-by shooting three 
blocks from the campus about 10 minutes after the stabbings. The boy was 
transferred to County-USC Medical Center for observation and was listed in 
stable condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 While police said they have no suspects, they said the incidents likely were 
gang-related. School officials, family members and the victims' friends, 
however, said the boys are not gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the campus was calm Wednesday and police officers surrounded the 
campus after school to disperse students. Principal Eve Sherman, in a morning 
address, tried to reassure students, and parents were given notices about the 
incidents. The school's Back to School Night, scheduled for tonight, will 
include a discussion about the fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safest place to be is in school and in class -- you should not loiter 
when traveling to and from school," Sherman told the students Wednesday 
morning. "Please consider how very valuable and precious life is." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting behind a desk with a plaque reading, "The Buck Stops Here," Sherman 
acknowledged the continuing problems between the two ethnic groups, the largest 
at the school. But she also defended the school's response. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do our metal detection every day, we have more campus security aides, we 
have taken every precaution," she said. "One of the reasons (Tuesday's 
violence) happened off campus is because we are so visible." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the Armenian boys who were stabbed were "good kids," who studied 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the boys is an honors student in several Advanced Placement classes, 
including Spanish, she said. The other Armenian boy has only been in the 
country 2 1/2 years but was taking English-language classes. The Latino boy, 
she said, was also taking transitional English classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic tensions have been present on the Van Nuys campus for some time, and 
Armenian and Latino students have been sent to one-day retreats to discuss 
diversity and conflict resolution. Sherman said a fight erupted last spring 
between the two groups, sparking more classroom discussions about different 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers are scheduled to attend a workshop next week, in fact, on ethnic 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, the animosity reached a new height. On Monday, a lunchtime 
brawl broke out, prompting Sherman to call for more police assistance on the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, administrators also believed there could be potential problems. 
Lee called school district police at about 1 p.m. asking for assistance at 
dismissal time. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the students were let out of school at 2 p.m., Lee was alone to deal 
with the problems. Sherman and another administrator were in a car, driving the 
perimeter of the school to see if there was trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what else we could have done," Sherman said. "We called all the 
people we needed to call. We were very visible." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dismissal is always the critical time," said Lt. Walter Nelon of the school 
district police. "You have large numbers of kids leaving the campus and you 
have outsiders around the campus. That's . . . when most of your problems will 
occur."

UCI STUDY TIES MEMORY TO EMOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first study of its kind on human subjects, scientists from UC Irvine 
and a Long Beach veterans hospital have determined that people tend to remember 
emotional events best because of stress hormones such as adrenaline activated 
during and after the experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The research, to be published today in the scientific journal Nature, showed 
that drugs known as beta blockers, which block the adrenaline system's 
response, impaired people's long-term memories of emotional stories. 
</P>
<P>
 But the drugs had no effect on the memories of other people who were told 
emotionally neutral stories, suggesting that the stress hormones selectively 
enhance retention of emotional experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The research, an outgrowth of years of animal studies, was described as novel 
by memory researchers across the country because it neatly demonstrates in 
humans what specific neurochemical processes are involved in the recall of 
emotional experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows that we tend to remember exciting things," said study 
co-author James L. McGaugh, a neurobiologist at the Center for the Neurobiology 
of Learning and Memory at UCI. "Now we're beginning to understand why." 
</P>
<P>
 While the results of the study are scientifically compelling in their own 
right, McGaugh said, the research may have broader practical implications. For 
example, it raises the question of whether beta blockers might be used in 
advance to blunt the memories of people who know they are about to undergo 
traumatic experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 And it suggests the possibility that patients who take beta blockers as 
medication for heart disease or high blood pressure, for example, might suffer 
mild impairment in their long-term recall of emotional events. 
</P>
<P>
 But "no one should consider reducing the dosage of beta blockers without 
consulting their personal physician," McGaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, whose primary author was UCI's Larry Cahill, makes a crucial link 
between human and animal research, confirming much of what memory researchers 
had suspected based on animal models. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never really knew what we were studying when we gave a foot shock to a 
rat," said Dr. Larry Squire, a neuroscientist and professor at UC San Diego 
School of Medicine. "Now we have this contact point with humans. It really 
encourages the whole research enterprise in how the brain stores and retrieves 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
 It was essential to make the connection to humans because "we don't know 
really know what's going on in (animals') heads," said Joseph LeDoux, a 
neuroscientist at New York University who studies the mechanisms of emotional 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Humans have a specific kind of conscious memory called "declarative memory," 
whereas animals do not. But the UCI/Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center 
study shows that the release of certain chemicals such as adrenaline acts on 
receptors to enhance memory in both humans and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The study involved giving 36 healthy adult men and women either a placebo or a 
beta blocker, propranolol hydrochloride, before showing them a set of slides. 
About half the subjects were told an emotionally arousing story accompanying 
the slides -- about a boy injured in a car accident -- and the other half a 
neutral story about a boy who witnesses a disaster drill. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, researchers tested subjects' memories of the events, comparing 
those who had received placebos to those who had received a beta blocker. Their 
findings: Beta blockers made no difference in the recall of subjects who heard 
the neutral story; they recalled it as well as the comparable placebo group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the memories of those who heard the emotional story and received 
propranolol hydrochloride -- and thus had their stress responses diminished -- 
were significantly impaired. The placebo subjects who heard the emotional story 
recalled more slides than the group that received propranolol and performed 
better on a subsequent multiple-choice test. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the placebo group had superior recall of elements of the story 
that were emotionally arousing. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers found the beta blockers did not dull subjects' emotional 
responsiveness to the material they saw -- as assessed immediately after it was 
presented -- only their long-term recall. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the propranolol, as expected, significantly reduced subjects' 
heart rate and blood pressure, that effect was not responsible for the 
subsequent memory impairment, according to the study. If that had been the 
same, the subjects who heard the neutral story and received the beta blocker 
would have shown memory problems as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the stress response plays a role in long-term memory makes sense 
from an evolutionary standpoint, McGaugh and other scientists said. In the 
standard stress response -- often described as the fight-or-flight reaction -- 
hormones such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol act to increase the 
heart rate, blood pressure and metabolism, leading to an improvement in the 
body's overall performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI/Long Beach study suggests that though the hormones stay in the system 
only about 30 minutes, they may have lasting protective effects in the form of 
useful memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's adaptive to remember where you got hurt in the past . . . which rock you 
were standing on when you came across a leopard," LeDoux said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the study opens the door to many more questions. 
</P>
<P>
 It still is unknown precisely where the hormones are acting -- whether it is 
in the peripheral nervous system or in the brain, McGaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, others said, it is unclear what effect more emotionally arousing 
experiences than the one used in the study would have on memory and whether 
there are limits to the enhancing effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, McGaugh said there is abundant evidence that extremely high 
doses of adrenaline administered in animal studies can create the opposite 
effect -- amnesia. But, he said, it is unknown whether those amounts can be 
produced naturally during emotional arousal.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: UNIVERSAL CITY; LUNCHEON TO BENEFIT COLITIS FOUNDATION

 For three years, doctors were stumped. At first, they told Valerie Krasner 
that her daughter was anorexic. Then, they thought it was some type of cancer, 
then a blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went through all kinds of testing," said Krasner, a Woodland Hills 
resident whose 26-year-old daughter has had Crohn's disease for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The little-known disease causes the intestines to narrow to the point that 
food digestion becomes painful. Krasner's daughter, Jodi, an interior designer 
has had part of her intestines narrow to the size of spaghetti.  
</P>
<P>
 Crohn's and a related disease, ulcerative colitis, can produce a wide range of 
symptoms such as diarrhea, cramps, fever, pain, joint aches and infections, 
Krasner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Krasner is president of the San Fernando chapter of the Crohn's and Colitis 
Foundation of America, which represents 1,200 people throughout the Valley and 
from as far away as Bakersfield. The group is holding a fund-raising luncheon 
Sunday at the Universal Sheraton Hotel in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a problem because not a lot of people know about it (the disease)," 
said Barbara Price of Woodland Hills, who is co-chairwoman of the luncheon. 
Three hundred people are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Price has a daughter, 29, who was found to have colitis at 18. With the 
condition believed to be hereditary, Price said she is very concerned about 
finding a treatment. "I now have two infant grandsons and I am hoping they 
won't have to suffer from this."  
</P>
<P>
 With ulcerative colitis, unlike common ulcers which form in the stomach, a 
hole forms in the intestine, Krasner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Schweitzer of Tarzana, the other co-chairwoman for Sunday's event, 
suffered the symptoms of Crohn's disease for 15 years before the disease was 
finally diagnosed six years ago. Doctors had told her it was a nervous stomach, 
a congenital anomaly related to a pregnancy, and a hernia before they finally 
made the proper diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was relieved when they finally diagnosed me," said Schweitzer, whose 
disease has been in remission since part of her bowel was removed almost six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon, dubbed "Reach for the Stars," is the third annual fund-raising 
event for the local chapter. Donations or inquiries to the chapter can be made 
at P.O. Box 1305, Woodland Hills, 91364, or by calling (818) 999-0448. ED BOND

AROUND THE VALLEY: SENIOR CITIZENS TAKE PRIDE IN ABILITY TO SPELL, A TALENT OF 
YORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Count spelling among the talents lost with the passing of "the good old days." 
Time was students had to memorize long lists of words and then match their 
skills against their peers in a contest known by the odd name of "bee." There 
are a few spelling bees left, the national contest among them, but most 
students now could go their whole lives without experiencing the intense 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The veterans, however, relish their days of saying a word, spelling it, and 
then saying it again. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Valley Storefront in North Hollywood, a senior citizens' center 
sponsored by the Jewish Family Services, employees decided to give their 
clients a go at an old-fashioned spelling bee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling was that people 60 and older are really the spellers in this 
country," Judy Raffel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, with spell-check and everything, people don't learn how to spell." 
</P>
<P>
 They had my number. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never written a newspaper story on a typewriter -- let alone a computer 
that didn't have spell-check. Tiny little silicon chips know all those 
anomalies like enough and buff and trough and scoff. 
</P>
<P>
 And I have never been in a spelling bee. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, those times when I'm not shouting a spelling query across my 
terminal, I'm humming the alphabet as I thumb through my Webster's. 
</P>
<P>
 After the spelling bee, I promised myself, I would confess my shortcoming. In 
the meantime, I would watch. 
</P>
<P>
 All 12 or so contestants were older than 60. All were women. Some were happy 
to reveal their ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Others hedged. ("I'm as old as my tongue and a little older than my teeth," 
said contestant Louise Norman.) 
</P>
<P>
 Before the contest, there was some confusion about the day's activities. One 
small, round man with a gray mustache tugged at Raffel's sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 "WHAT'S HAPPENING?" the man shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 Raffel explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "WELL, ARE THERE GOING TO BE REFRESHMENTS?" the man asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Raffel sighed and assured him that no food had been ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 The man shrugged and walked into the room anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the simple dining room, some reconfigured their chairs around the 
faux-oak tables. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hearing aids went berserk when their wearers sat too close to the 
microphone. Others had to move up to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Raffel explained the rules: Words would be said as many times as the speller 
needed. They were advised to repeat the word to be sure they had heard 
correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Those disqualified would have to move to the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Norman raised her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed what you said when we started because I had to take a drink of water 
because I had to take a pill," Norman said. Raffel patiently restated the 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading the words for the contestants was Selma Glasser. 
</P>
<P>
 Round one was easy. Ann Edelman spelled "banquet." Millie Ain spelled 
"embarrassment." Rose Unger spelled "parachute."  
</P>
<P>
 I felt better. These, I thought, even I could spell. 
</P>
<P>
 The first incorrect spelling was almost missed. A latecomer, who was allowed 
to participate anyway, reversed the vowels on the word "niece." 
</P>
<P>
 When Glasser moved on in spite of the mistake, Shirley Greenberg pointed out 
the error and the woman was quickly asked to move to the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Other falterers weren't as gracious. One woman responded too quickly, spelling 
"faucet," as "fawcet," and grumbled as she moved to the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman, who didn't repeat the word before spelling, spelled "recede," 
instead of the given word, "receive."  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she said 'recede'! " the woman said. "She's not very good. They 
should have someone with a clearer voice." 
</P>
<P>
 The words got harder, and I was soon outgunned in my attempts to play along. 
My earlier pride vanished and I prepared to confess that although I make my 
living writing, I could no sooner write without my dictionary than I could 
drive without my car. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize went to Edelman, 70, of Studio City. Even back 60 years ago, there 
were "progressive" school districts that didn't believe in spelling bees or 
other competitions and Edelman grew up in one in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 I expressed my admiration. My deep admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought it was something I could win," Edelman said. "Finally, at 
age 70, I won a spelling bee." 
</P>
<P>
 Her prize? In mostly single dollar bills, probably collected as fees for other 
Center events, there was $25 cash. There were also 15 movie passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lillian Friedman, who spelled the wrong word, continued to curse her bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't hear the right word!" she said. "I don't have trouble hearing 
ordinarily, but I guess you get uptight."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glasser, whose giant name tag identified her as the "contest conductor," had a 
pragmatic view of the contest results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's got to lose," she said as she gathered up her spelling books and 
headed out. "If somebody's going to win, somebody's going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 I, I said, would have had no trouble being the loser. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought I would be revealing something when I confessed that I never 
remember the exceptions to the i-before-e rule. But I discovered that the 
contestants would have assumed as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many people my age, Edelman said with as much kindness as she could 
muster, can spell.

REFERENDUM FAILS ON FEE INCREASE; CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE: ATHLETIC PROGRAM MIGHT 
DROP FROM DIVISION I AFTER STUDENTS AGAIN VOTE DOWN PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now what? 
</P>
<P>
 Having failed Wednesday in its second attempt this year to pass a referendum 
increasing student fees allocated to Cal State Northridge sports programs, the 
school's athletic department was left to mull its future. 
</P>
<P>
 Included on the list of worst-case options is a major retooling of the 
athletic program, including a drop from NCAA Division I to Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge students, participating in a two-day election by touch-tone 
telephone, voted 2,315 to 2,116 against the referendum. The proposal would have 
raised money allocated to athletics from $4 to $49 a semester per student. 
</P>
<P>
 The referendum, which generated the largest election turnout in school 
history, would have generated $2.25 million annually for athletics based on 
current enrollment levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we did pretty much everything we could do," said Bob Hiegert, 
Northridge's athletic director. "I don't think I'd do anything differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult time (economically) to ask people for fee increases. But I 
don't think this is a good thing for the university." 
</P>
<P>
 When the vote was announced Wednesday night at 10:10 p.m. at Northridge 
athletic department headquarters, the timbre changed from nervous anticipation 
to unqualified gloom. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of approximately 75 student-athletes gathered for the verdict and 
groaned when Hiegert quietly read the final tally. Several swore and at least 
one broke out in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 The interpretation of the final tally was clear: Northridge students, who 
voted down a similar proposal last spring, don't place a high priority on 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what 4,000 of them think," Hiegert said. "I'd like to know where the 
other 16,000 or so were." 
</P>
<P>
 An athletics referendum was narrowly defeated last spring, 993-906. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge administrators, attempting to raise awareness to the issue, this 
fall mounted a month-long campaign to sway student opinion in athletics' favor. 
</P>
<P>
 The referendum was necessary to keep the program afloat at the current level, 
Hiegert said. Northridge athletics, with a budget of $3.6 million for 1994-95, 
stands to lose approximately $700,000 the following year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession and declining enrollment -- the fall student population of 
24,378 is down approximately 7,000 from the school's high-water mark of the 
late 1980s -- trimmed enrollment-based accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the feedback the athletes received was that (voting against) the 
increase was a fee issue, not an athletics issue," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school faces a series of tough decisions regarding its long-term course. 
Northridge, which has competed at the Division I level for five seasons, may be 
forced to trim selected men's sports to satisfy gender-equity requirements of 
the California State University system. 
</P>
<P>
 Football, which plays at the Division I-AA level, could face elimination. To 
remain at the Division I level, Northridge must field seven sports each for men 
and women. It currently fields the NCAA-recognized equivalent of 16, Hiegert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert wouldn't speculate on what restrictions would apply to athletes 
seeking to transfer to another school if Northridge eventually moves to 
Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 For the remainder of the student body, the referendum's defeat could come with 
a price tag -- at least for those who frequent athletic events. Northridge is 
considering charging admission to students to make up for the budget losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, students with a valid Associated Students activities card were 
admitted free to all athletic events. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletics dangled several carrots before the student body, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 If the referendum passed, two women's teams were scheduled to be added. 
Scholarship limits were to be raised to the Division I maximum for every team 
but football, allowing Northridge to compete more realistically against fully 
funded opponents. Donations and corporate funds previously used to augment the 
day-to-day budget instead would be dedicated to facilities improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 After failing in its referendum attempt last spring, the athletics department 
campaigned for the past month as Matador athletes gave informational speeches 
to their classmates and distributed promotional literature on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice beaten, thrice shy? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not. Hiegert wouldn't count out another referendum attempt in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not ruling anything out at this point," he said, fingering the paper on 
which the final tally was handwritten. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said he has a meeting tentatively scheduled Tuesday with Ron Kopita, 
the dean of students. The pair, along with President Blenda Wilson, will then 
begin plotting out the program's future and begin addressing predicted funding 
shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert, who seemed somewhat stunned by the tally, was at a loss to explain 
the department's next move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know what we'll do," Hiegert said.

REQUIEM OF A RELUCTANT RUNNER; WELL-TRAVELED WILSON BECOMES CROSS-COUNTRY STAR 
AT MOORPARK COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good luck convincing Jeff Wilson that he has accomplished anything noteworthy 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark College sophomore is undefeated heading into Friday's Western 
State Conference cross-country meet at College of the Canyons, but too much has 
been made of that fact, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you want to talk to me?" Wilson asked a reporter earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Informed that his unblemished record had established him as one of the top 
junior college runners in the state, Wilson still was uncomfortable about 
conducting an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a fluke," he said. "It's just one of those things that has happened 
and I have no idea why." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Wilson says he is "totally surprised" by his success, it comes as 
little shock to those familiar with his high school exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 At Newbury Park High, Wilson won a pair of State Division III cross-country 
titles and was the runner-up in the 1991 Kinney national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 track season, he ran personal bests of 4 minutes 9.75 seconds 
in the 1,600 meters and 9:06.73 in the 3,200. He finished fourth in the 1,600 
in the State championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Those credentials and a solid academic background made Wilson one of the most 
highly recruited distance runners in the country before he signed a letter of 
intent with Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the Mormon Church, Wilson always had wanted to attend BYU, but he 
lasted only one year at the Western Athletic Conference school before returning 
home. Wilson enjoyed a solid -- if unspectacular -- freshman season in Provo. 
He typically finished fourth, fifth or sixth on the cross-country team that 
finished second in the WAC championships. He also ran 3:52.1 in the 1,500 
during track season. 
</P>
<P>
 His problems at BYU arose when he balked at starting a scheduled two-year 
mission in the summer of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Because BYU expected Wilson to be away from school during the 1993-95 academic 
years, his scholarship money was earmarked for other athletes. Wilson could no 
longer afford to stay at BYU, but he doesn't regret his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt like I wasn't ready to go on a mission," he said. "The time 
wasn't right." 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilson returned home, he planned to work before starting his mission in 
the spring of 1995 and returning to BYU in the fall of 1997. He wasn't thrilled 
with full-time work, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Characterizing himself as someone "who was going nowhere," Wilson enrolled at 
Moorpark last spring and occasionally worked out with the Raider track team. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke of running cross-country, but Raider Coach Manny Trevino figured he 
was joking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff is a very happy-go-lucky kind of guy," Trevino said. "So we weren't sure 
if he was serious or not. We thought he might just be saying those things to 
see how we would react." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Trevino was convinced of Wilson's sincerity, he realized that he would be 
working with a tremendously talented runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Many coaches would have been tempted to give someone of Wilson's caliber a 
heavy training load, but Trevino refrained from doing that for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Wilson had been running only 15-20 miles a week during his layoff. 
Second, Wilson had told Trevino that he felt pressured as a scholarship athlete 
at BYU. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just kept talking about how much pressure was put on athletes there," 
Trevino said. "So I said, 'Let's just do this under a low-key atmosphere. Let's 
just have fun and see what happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude, combined with a relatively light training regimen of 40-45 
miles per week, has fit Wilson well.  
</P>
<P>
 Although his expectations were almost nonexistent, he opened the season Sept. 
16 with a course-record time in the Santa Monica Invitational.  
</P>
<P>
 He followed that with a victory in the first Western State Conference meet in 
San Luis Obispo before winning the Bakersfield Invitational and the Santa 
Barbara Invitational.  
</P>
<P>
 After winning the first two meets by margins of six and nine seconds, 
respectively, Wilson has won the last two by 18 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid he would start off the season well and then perhaps stagnate 
after the newness of it all wore off," Trevino said. "But that hasn't happened. 
It appears that Jeff is getting stronger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's strength will be tested Oct. 29 at the Johnie O Invitational at 
Moorpark. The meet, named after the late Yuba City Coach, John O'Rognen, serves 
as the Southern California championships, the qualifying competition for the 
State championships in Fresno on Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside's Wilhelm Gudabuday of Ethiopia and Abderrazak Merchoud of Morocco, 
who finished second and sixth in last year's State championships, are the 
favorites.  
</P>
<P>
 "(The Johnie O meet) will be a good test for Jeff," Trevino said. "It'll be 
interesting to see how he responds to that type of competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is taking a typically nonchalant approach to the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manny is always talking about how much work it takes to put on the meet and 
how it's on our home course, so I guess it's a big meet," Wilson said. "But I 
haven't given it much thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson might appear to downplay the significance of the Johnie O meet 
to keep pressure off himself, Trevino said it is not an act. He describes 
Wilson as one who "honestly doesn't think he's accomplished much" this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't view himself as anything special," Trevino said. "I don't think he 
realizes how talented he is or how good he could be. 
</P>
<P>
 "With his speed, strength and durability, I think he could be a national-class 
runner someday."

HERRINGTON TRANSFERS TO CSUN; SOFTBALL: SHE HAD 190 HITS IN CAREER AT HART, 
RANKING SECOND IN SOUTHERN SECTION HISTORY, AND MADE STOPS AT HAWAII, CANYONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former Hart High second baseman Jamie Herrington, who ranks second in Southern 
Section softball history for hits in a career, has transferred to Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrington, 20, batted just under .400 at College of the Canyons last season, 
after transferring from Hawaii.The Matadors, runners-up in the NCAA Division I 
Women's College World Series last season, have given Herrington a partial 
scholarship and have moved her to the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrington's name was Jamie Dean until she recently married Rick Herrington, 
defensive coordinator of the Hart High football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a compliment that they wanted me, or just to be asked," she said of 
landing at Northridge. "I'm a rookie. I don't want to be a team leader. I'm 
laying low. You have to let people see how you play." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrington had 190 hits at Hart, second only to Julie Smith of Charter Oak 
(206) in Southern Section history. 
</P>
<P>
 She led the Indians to the section 4-A championship game, where they lost to 
Santa Ana Foothill, 5-2, in her senior year. She accepted a scholarship to 
Hawaii in 1992 but withdrew after one semester, never playing a game for the 
Rainbow Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrington, a left-handed slap hitter who usually bats leadoff, said she 
played at Canyons last year in hopes of getting another scholarship. After she 
was named first-team All-Western State Conference while playing third base for 
the Cougars, Northridge came calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Northridge has lost some good players, but this team has a lot of heart," 
Herrington said. "I think we can do good things."

PARADISE LOST; DESPITE 5-1 RECORD, WESTLAKE PLAYERS ARE HAUNTED BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Football Coach Jim Benkert shoves his hands in the front pocket of his 
pullover jacket and squints through the diminishing sunlight that drenches the 
Westlake High practice field. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all good kids," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As if on cue, a football tumbles across the hard-packed dirt toward Benkert 
and his guest. Running after it is one of the Warriors, mouth guard between 
molars and helmet buckled up. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor stoops and tosses the ball to the player, who says, "Thank you, 
sir," and sprints back to the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Benkert smiles and nods. "They're all like that. This is paradise if you're a 
kid. It's a great place to go to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly if you're associated with Westlake football this fall. The team 
is 5-1 and third in The Times' area poll. In his sixth year as head coach, 
Benkert has a program of dedicated and disciplined players and construction on 
a gleaming, 4,000-seat stadium on campus is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has two players on his roster who have learned that even a town known 
for serene prosperity is occasionally rocked by real-world violence, to a point 
that one player's family plans to move out of the state once their son finishes 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 David Behling and Scott Smith, seniors and good friends, suffered gunshot 
wounds in a Feb. 3 fracas at North Ranch Park in Thousand Oaks. The two had 
driven to the park with former football teammate Curtis Simmons, who intended 
to use his fists to settle a dispute with schoolmate James Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was expecting guns to be there," said Behling, a reserve defensive 
lineman. "If you're in L.A. or the San Fernando Valley you have to watch out 
for that. We know what's going on and we're not naive, but we didn't expect it 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 40 or more students -- only five or six of whom were football 
players, Smith said -- gathered at the park for the planned altercation. When 
Lee and five carloads of his supporters arrived and the fight began, Behling 
and Smith saw Simmons outnumbered and surrounded by assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 Running toward the struggle, Behling and Smith heard gunshots and turned to 
retreat. Smith was shot in the back of the right shoulder and kept running; 
Behling was shot in the back of the head and immediately collapsed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't feel my head but my body felt like it was on fire," Behling said. 
"I was in shock. The first thing I thought of was that my parents were going to 
be mad because we were supposed to go to Mammoth that weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was treated and released at Westlake Medical Center that night, but 
Behling underwent a number of procedures to locate and remove the bullet in his 
head. He was hospitalized for five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Westlake students, Lee and John Yi, were arrested within a day of the 
incident for their roles in injuring Smith and Behling. Two more juveniles, 
Oubansack (Andy) Sonethanouphet of Brea and William Huang from Rowland Heights, 
were arrested and charged. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, all four were ordered to stand trial as adult co-defendants on a 
variety of charges. However, Lee, a 16-year-old Thousand Oaks resident, is 
believed to have fled to Taiwan to avoid prosecution after his parents posted 
$5,000 bail to free him from juvenile custody. Charges against Sonethanouphet 
were dropped after a Ventura County judge ruled that police obtained his 
confession illegally. Trial dates for Yi and Huang have been set for this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 5-11, 190-pound linebacker, was lifting weights three weeks after the 
shooting and said football contact has caused pain in his shoulder only four or 
five times this season. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 6-1, 200-pound Behling, rehabilitation took longer. He missed a month 
of school, and after leaving the hospital and regaining his strength, underwent 
frequent brain scans. Some days he suffered numerous severe headaches. Still, 
by the end of the academic year he was able to compete in two late-season track 
meets and has had no medical limitations this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, halfway through their senior seasons, the physical ramifications are few 
for both players, yet the emotional consequences linger as they and their 
families try to put the incident behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about (the shooting) a lot, but when I look back it seems like a 
dream," Behling said. "All of a sudden I will be sitting there . . . and think 
how lucky I am to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
 David's mother, Kathy Behling, said her son now avoids places where other 
students congregate and gets nervous when cars roll up alongside him. She and 
her family likely will leave Thousand Oaks once David finishes high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to get on with our lives; to be honest, we're looking forward to 
moving out of state," she said, adding that her son tends to discuss the 
incident more with his friends than with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "But (the shooting is) something that's always on David's mind. They fire a 
starter's gun four times at football games and he jumps. For that millimeter of 
a second it really startles him."  
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that after several months of not wanting to talk about the 
shooting, he and Behling are able to kid about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Billy Miller, who was headed to North Ranch Park with Behling 
and Smith that day in February but stopped to eat on the way, said the incident 
is rarely discussed among team members. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first it was a huge deal, but it's died down," Miller said. "We're a close 
team and we're able to joke with them when we do talk about it, even though 
it's no joking matter. You just try and give them all the support you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is obvious Benkert doesn't relish discussing the incident with those 
outside his program, he and his staff are vigilant in their efforts to keep 
Westlake players out of trouble. He distributes handouts advising players on 
the possible dangers of parties and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he established a voluntary drug testing program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're constantly having conversations where we remind them that they 
represent their families, the school and the community," Benkert said. "When 
they walk outside the gates we hope they take it to heart and don't get 
themselves involved in a negative situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "But who would think going to a park in Westlake would have ramifications?"

BEAUREGARD'S BAIL INCREASED; JURISPRUDENCE: NEW AMOUNT OF $100,000 SET FOR CAL 
STATE NORTHRIDGE FOOTBALL PLAYER CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jonathan George Beauregard, the Cal State Northridge football player charged 
with two counts of attempted murder, was hit Wednesday with a dramatic bail 
hike and led out of court with his head down and his hands in cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino Municipal Court Judge Ronald M. Christianson increased bail 
from $15,000 to $100,000 at a brief hearing after a prosecutor argued that the 
lesser amount was too low for two charges of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 As a marshal approached, Beauregard took his hands out of his blue jean 
pockets and allowed himself to be cuffed. He sat in the front row of the 
courtroom and defense lawyer Grover L. Porter tapped his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "You OK?" Porter whispered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Beauregard replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was escorted out of the courtroom, walking past his former 
girlfriend and the mother of his child, Dunyella Darshell Smith. As he walked 
past, she brushed away a tear. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, 22, was arrested Aug. 29 just hours after Smith, 21, of San 
Bernardino, and her male acquaintance, Von Eric Thompson, 26, of Rialto, were 
shot outside a San Bernardino bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Smith and Thompson were shot as they sat in Thompson's truck after 
the bar closed. Smith was hit once in the hip. Thompson was shot twice, in the 
arm and the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, a security guard at the bar, was wearing a bullet-proof vest. The 
second shot hit him "right about where his heart would be," police Detective 
Roy Izumi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was arrested near his mother's home shortly afterward. Smith told 
police that Beauregard had refused to leave her alone since they had broken up, 
Izumi said. 
</P>
<P>
 A police report in the court files indicated Smith "has been victim of (2) 
assaults by (Beauregard) in past but no filing. This time she is shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Beauregard was booked for investigation of assault with a deadly 
weapon. He was released after posting $15,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Bernardino County District Attorney's office then upgraded the charges 
to attempted murder, and added the special circumstances of using a handgun and 
inflicting "great bodily injury." 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of all charges, Beauregard could draw a maximum of 21 years in 
state prison, Deputy Dist. Atty. Dwight Moore said. But, Moore said, "Since he 
has no criminal record, the prospects of us getting a 21-year sentence on this 
are unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, a senior majoring in criminology and a two-year starter on the 
offensive line, did not tell his teammates or coaches of the arrest. He started 
at right guard in each of the Matadors' first four games. 
</P>
<P>
 The school learned of the charges Sept. 30, and Northridge officials announced 
Oct. 5 they would take no action against Beauregard. 
</P>
<P>
 He managed to sideline himself, however, when he broke his right ring finger 
in practice Oct. 4. Had he not been injured, Beauregard would have been allowed 
to play while the case worked its way through the courts, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement on Wednesday, CSUN athletic director Bob Hiegert said: 
"The status of Jonathan Beauregard as a member of the CSUN football team is 
unchanged till the university gathers additional information." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the hearing Wednesday, Beauregard said his finger has healed. Asked 
whether he would be ready to play this weekend, he said, "I think so." 
</P>
<P>
 But CSUN football coach Bob Burt said: "I don't see how. He hasn't practiced. 
Obviously he wasn't at practice yesterday or today." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the criminal case, Beauregard said, "I'm dealing with it. I'll be all 
right." The case has generated unusual publicity in part because Beauregard's 
grandmother, Valerie Pope-Ludlam, is a San Bernardino city councilwoman, and 
that publicity, he said, has been unnecessary and "difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing Wednesday had been set as an arraignment, meaning the formal 
charges against Beauregard were due to be read for his plea of guilty or not 
guilty. But Porter, the defense attorney, asked that the reading of charges be 
pushed back, and no plea was entered Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyer said he preferred to take no action because he had not yet 
been given a detailed police report of the shootings. But, he said before the 
hearing of Beauregard, "He's not guilty until the district attorney proves 
otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge set a preliminary hearing for Oct. 31. Moore then argued that bail 
of $15,000 was considered low for an assault case and far too low for charges 
of attempted murder. Over Porter's objection, Christianson raised Beauregard's 
bail to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If Beauregard makes the "fairly high" bail, the judge added, he is to have no 
contact with either Smith or Thompson. Christianson also ordered a hearing at 
which another judge can review the higher bail, scheduling it for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 On her way out of the courthouse, Smith kept brushing away tears. When 
Beauregard was paraded before her in handcuffs, she said, "I was upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he was guilty, she said: "I don't have no comment."

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: TRYING TO WIN ONE FOR THE TUTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 John McLaughlin and Leon Blunt spend most of their nights in a cramped 
dormitory room studying philosophy, theology and the Notre Dame football 
playbook until the wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the academic demands alone have been overwhelming for these 
18-year-old freshmen who dream of being standout players for perhaps the 
nation's most-storied college football program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's horrible," they said during separate interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin, from Hart High, and Blunt, from San Fernando, sought the challenge 
of making the grade at Notre Dame. Neither realized how difficult it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel like giving up sometimes," said Blunt, a reserve quarterback and 
wide receiver. "Especially (at) this school. It's like Harvard." 
</P>
<P>
 Said McLaughlin: "Sometimes the coaches will yell at you and threaten to kick 
you off the team to make you work harder. That shakes you up. It gets in your 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 And McLaughlin has had several coaches in his 2 1/2 months in South Bend, Ind. 
He started at tight end, was switched to wide receiver, then outside 
linebacker, then free safety. Now he's back at outside linebacker and plays on 
the kickoff-coverage team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a joke around here," he said. "People are saying, 'Are you going 
to be taking snaps tomorrow?' 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is Notre Dame. Coach (Lou) Holtz tends to get everybody uptight and 
worried about making a mistake. You gotta keep plugging. It's a pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Both players have been hobbled by injuries. McLaughlin has tendinitis in his 
right knee. Blunt, who saw minimal action early, missed two games and is still 
hobbled by an ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blunt admits he has been hurting more in the classroom, where he scored 
badly on his first round of tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grades ain't too good now," he said. "I've got tutors. I'm trying to get 
everything together." 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt's course load consists of philosophy, theology, English composition and 
literature, a math-science class and swimming. Blunt said he was forced to take 
swimming because he failed a swimming test. "But they want me to be an Olympic 
swimmer." 
</P>
<P>
 Said McLaughlin, who shares classes with Blunt: "The schoolwork has been 
tougher than anything. High school work was like a joke compared to this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't wait to leave home. I didn't think I'd get homesick. But my 
parents went to the Michigan game. And my brother (Kevin) came to the Stanford 
game. When they left, I realized I was homesick. It's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 But this freshman rite of passage is not without reward. Holtz has his eyes on 
both players. The Irish keep moving McLaughlin to see where he will best 
benefit the team next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz, at Monday's press conference, said he might use Blunt as an option 
quarterback to spark an offense that has sputtered near the goal line in 
consecutive upset losses to Boston College and Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I would do whatever to help the team," Blunt said. "I want to get 
on the field and do what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Three losses this season have taken the Irish out of contention for the 
national championship, dropped them out of the Top 25 and put added pressure on 
Holtz. 
</P>
<P>
 "After last game (a 21-14 loss to BYU at home), Holtz was devastated," 
McLaughlin said. "He didn't know what to say. He said, 'I sincerely love each 
and every one of you. I'm feeling pain right now.' And he canceled practice 
Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 But McLaughlin and Blunt said each week loyal fans who flock to the campus 
strengthen their resolve. Each Friday, the bookstore is jammed with out-of-town 
folks buying Notre Dame football paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come out of our pregame Mass and there are hundreds of them lined up and 
waiting for us, clapping and cheering," McLaughlin said. "They'd be behind us 
if we won only one game a year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Irish: A goal by Notre Dame sophomore midfielder Cindy Daws (Louisville 
High) helped the second-ranked Irish women's soccer team defeat No. 11 
Portland, 2-1, Sunday. Notre Dame (13-0-1) is on a roll, having posted a 6-0-1 
record against Top 20 opponents, and Daws is playing well. 
</P>
<P>
 She has seven goals and 11 assists after recovering from surgery to repair a 
broken foot. She suffered the injury in January, had surgery in March because 
it hadn't healed properly and had not kicked a soccer ball for nearly nine 
months before the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Daws didn't score two weeks ago against No. 1 North Carolina, but a 0-0 tie 
broke the Tar Heels' streak of 92 consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country: It is showdown week for No. 18 Utah (6-0) and No. 12 
Colorado State (7-0). The winner of Saturday's game in Fort Collins, Colo., 
likely will win the Western Athletic Conference championship and a trip to the 
Holiday Bowl. Colorado State senior fullback Leonice Brown (San Fernando) has 
gained 466 yards in 60 carries, a team-high average of 7.8 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 He rushed for 94 yards in only his second start of the season last week, a 
47-9 victory over Texas El Paso. Brown ranks eighth in career rushing at 
Colorado State with 2,216 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 At Utah, senior wide receiver Curtis Marsh (Simi Valley, Moorpark College) 
ranks third in the WAC in receptions (33) and first in touchdowns (seven). He 
had five receptions for 51 yards, including an 18-yard touchdown catch, in a 
14-3 victory over Hawaii last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior safety Steve Rudisill (Thousand Oaks) of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo ranks 
second on the team in tackles with 35. The Mustangs will play Cal State 
Northridge at 7 p.m. Saturday at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting guards Nathan Gibbs (Camarillo) and William Knight (Antelope Valley) 
helped BYU upset Notre Dame last week. . . . Senior Brad Faunce (Hoover, 
Glendale College) averages 41.1 yards a punt at Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio junior running back LaKarlos Townsend (San Fernando) rushed for 117 yards 
against Miami (Ohio) last week. It was his first 100-yard game of the season. 
He had 99 against Pittsburgh in the opener.

 Jorge Brescia is a frustrated man. He is also fed up and exhausted because his

 Brescia, men's soccer coach at Oxnard College, has tried desperately to 
preserve two world-class soccer fields built on campus over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating them was part of a plan to bring the city publicity by luring a World 
Cup team to train there. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the coach should be listened to or Oxnard could lose a top-notch 
sports facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Brescia worked for more than a year with city and school officials to complete 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 He did everything from ensuring the sprinkler system worked to locating funds. 
The project cost $180,000 and the city of Oxnard dished out only $20,000, so 
Brescia was a busy man.  
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the money and most of the equipment came from private donations. 
Brescia attended more meetings with potential donors and officials than he 
cares to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the fields were completed, Brescia was instrumental in getting the 
Cameroon soccer team to set up camp in Oxnard during the World Cup. FIFA, the 
sport's governing body, approved the facility and the deal was set. 
</P>
<P>
 They were beautiful, lush fields that brought Brescia, an engineer, memories 
of his 10 years as a professional soccer player in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the sight of them brings tears to his eyes. Both fields are in horrible 
condition and the South field is so neglected Brescia considers it a danger 
zone for his players. 
</P>
<P>
 The field has become a large mass of dirt with a few patches of worn grass. A 
fallen wind screen sits where it first landed and a broken goal post serves as 
a monkey bar for local kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The North field is still being used by the men's and women's soccer teams, but 
it's not a pretty sight. With no maintenance, Brescia anticipates it will be 
unplayable in fewer than six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see them now, I feel like crying," he said. "Seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, Brescia says, is that no one wants to provide the maintenance 
for the facility.  
</P>
<P>
 He has contacted everybody he thinks might be able to help: the city officials 
who asked for his assistance when the project was merely a thought, and Oxnard 
College president Elise Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody cares," Brescia said. "The World Cup is over so why should we care, 
right? The show is gone and the media are no longer here. We had press from 
Japan, Austria, Colombia, Chile . . . worldwide. Now it's over and there's 
nothing more to get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment required to keep the fields in playing condition is not 
expensive, according to Brescia. A mower and sweeper would do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem is that there is no person to coordinate all the work," 
he said. "The school doesn't want to do it. I wrote to the president of the 
school about two months ago and I have not even received a response from her." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider tells a different story. The facility has not been abandoned, she 
says, and is being kept up. 
</P>
<P>
 She attributes the South field's dreadful condition to a mystery fungus that 
has attacked many other Ventura County fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working on it," she said. "They are very important to us. There is 
nothing to be alarmed about." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said regular maintenance has never ceased, but she had no simple 
answer for the fields' increasingly poor condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is ignoring the whole thing and believe me, they know," Brescia 
said. "I've told them." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's time for college administrators and city officials to act. The 
alternative is allowing the fields to deteriorate completely. 
</P>
<P>
 That could also mean 180,000 bucks down the drain and in these tough financial 
times that would be scandalous.

IS AMERICA READY FOR 'NATURAL BORN KILLAZ'?; THE STORY LINE OF DR. DRE AND ICE 
CUBE'S MUSIC VIDEO IS CERTAIN TO ENRAGE MEDIA WATCHDOGS ON TWO LEVELS: THE 
GRAPHIC VIOLENCE DEPICTED IN THE DUO'S MURDEROUS EXPLOITS, AND THE IDENTITIES 
OF THEIR VICTIMS.

<P>
 It's midnight on Terminal Island and rap stars Dr. Dre and Ice Cube are 
dancing on a blood-drenched pile of bones and body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on dual electric chairs surrounded by dangling corpses, the brawny 
rappers bob their shaved heads and boast about a brutal murder spree as the 
cameras begin rolling on what promises to be the most talked about music video 
of the year: "Natural Born Killaz." 
</P>
<P>
 The story line -- in which the rappers portray ruthless serial killers -- is 
certain to enrage media watchdogs on two levels: the graphic violence depicted 
in the duo's murderous exploits, and the identities of their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In the video, the rappers satirize the gruesome stabbings of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, as well as the shotgun ambush of Jose and 
Kitty Menendez -- all of whom die in dramatic re-enactments at the hands of Dre 
and Cube. 
</P>
<P>
 The song's lyrics also spoof the recent suicide of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain, 
the 1969 Manson family murders, and seem to make light of the vicious assault 
on trucker Reginald O. Denny during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample lines: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm down with Dre  
</P>
<P>
 like A.C. is for O.J.  
</P>
<P>
 . . . so kill Charlie Manson  
</P>
<P>
 I snatch him out his truck  
</P>
<P>
 hit him with a brick  
</P>
<P>
 and I'm dancin' . . . 
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 . . . I'm gonna eat 'em up  
</P>
<P>
 like Jeffrey Dahmer  
</P>
<P>
 and now I'm suicidal  
</P>
<P>
 just like Nirvana . 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural Born Killaz" is the first single from Dre and Cube's much anticipated 
reunion album, "Helter Skelter," due out in January on Death Row/Priority 
label. (The song is currently available on the soundtrack to "Murder Was the 
Case," a short film directed by Dre and starring his Long Beach protege Snoop 
Doggy Dogg.) 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview during a break from filming at an abandoned factory on the San 
Pedro waterfront, Dre defended the parody as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on 
the public's obsession with unsolved high-profile murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shock value -- that's what it's about," said the 28-year-old Grammy-winning 
recording artist, whose real name is Andre Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows that the most exciting thing going down in the news right now 
is O.J.'s case. So we decided to play on that and the Menendez trial too -- and 
just have a little fun with it all. People can think whatever they want about 
me, but the fact is I'm just an artist doing my best to entertain." 
</P>
<P>
 Ice Cube, an acclaimed rapper and actor who co-starred in "Boyz N the Hood," 
also downplayed potential negative fallout from the song. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true that it's a b-boy gangsta record on the macabre tip," said Cube, 
25, whose real name is O'shea Jackson. "But what would be the point of Ice Cube 
and Dr. Dre doing a project like this if we didn't freak people out? The point 
of the song is to poke fun at serial killers, like Oliver Stone's movie did. 
It's supposed to be humorous." 
</P>
<P>
 While the video is not expected to be released until Halloween, the parody 
concept is already under attack by the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau, a 
nonprofit group that has lobbied California lawmakers for pro-victims rights 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a sick society and it's horrendous for an artist as big as Dr. Dre 
to put out something this irresponsible," said Kelly Rudiger, the Crime Victims 
Bureau executive director. "How would Dr. Dre like it if somebody made fun of 
his relatives getting murdered?" 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman could not be reached for 
comment, but representatives for the families expressed outrage Wednesday about 
the video. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ridiculing the tragedy surrounding a murder victim is very hurtful to the 
families of anyone closely involved in such a case," said Terri Towery, a 
court-appointed attorney representing Lyle Menendez in his upcoming murder 
trial. "Entertainers certainly have free speech rights, but sometimes it can 
cross the boundaries of good taste." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time Dre and Cube have raised eyebrows in the music 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Before embarking on solo careers, the duo made a name for itself as the 
creative force behind NWA, the brash Compton rap quintet once accused by an FBI 
official of writing music that encouraged violence against law enforcement 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous hit albums by the two rappers were also attacked by feminists and 
ethnic groups for promoting violence against women, Koreans and Jews. At the 
same time, however, Dre and Cube have been repeatedly singled out by pop 
critics as, respectively, hip-hop music's most talented producer and lyricist. 
</P>
<P>
 Dre, who has been charged with battery three times in as many years and will 
soon begin serving a five-month jail sentence for drunk driving, shrugs off 
criticism of his angry music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could care less whether the pop people think my music is too crazy," said 
Dre, whose Death Row record label has sold more than 10 million records in the 
past two years. (Death Row is distributed by Time Warner-affiliated Interscope 
Records.) "I didn't get where I am by catering to mainstream tastes. I started 
out by making my art for the underground and I still subscribe to that theory 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Heading back for the set, Cube also defended the violence employed in their 
latest collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we're exploiting violence, but there's nothing unusual about that 
in America," Cube said. "This country's national anthem is full of rockets' red 
glare and bombs bursting in air. That's just the way America is, so why 
shouldn't Dre and Cube be able to exploit a little violence every now and then? 
If people don't like it, let 'em ban it. Who cares?"

A PEEK AT 'POCAHONTAS' WHEN 'LION' RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Disney's megahit "The Lion King" returns to theaters just before 
Thanksgiving, movie audiences will get a first glimpse of what the studio hopes 
will be its next animated blockbuster, "Pocahontas." 
</P>
<P>
 More than four minutes of continuous footage from Disney's latest animated 
creation -- featuring one of the movie's eight original songs -- will debut 
with the "Lion King" re-release at theaters Nov. 18 on 1,500 screens. 
"Pocahontas," the studio's 33rd full-length animated feature and its first to 
be inspired by a real-life figure, will bow next June. 
</P>
<P>
 The "featurette" (as the studio calls the "Pocahontas" sequence) is one of the 
key elements of Disney's new $10-million-plus campaign to relaunch "The Lion 
King," which sold a whopping $267 million in tickets before it was 
intentionally yanked from theaters in late September with plans for re-release 
during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's unprecedented move to pull the film when it was still grossing 
millions each weekend was timed to when its core audience of children would 
likely drop off with the start of school. Disney is hoping to re-attract 
families just as the holiday season gets under way, and the studio presumably 
wants to refreshen the movie for Oscar consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 In giving moviegoers their first exposure to "Pocahontas" so far in advance of 
its actual release, Disney is looking to generate an early buzz as it 
successfully did last fall when it previewed the four-minute opening sequence 
of "The Lion King" in front of its live-action movie "The Three Musketeers." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Pocahontas" sequence, which runs approximately four minutes and 20 
seconds, features the film's heroine (voice of actress Irene Bedard) singing 
"Colors of the Wind," a musical lesson on the Native American philosophy toward 
life, to her new acquaintance Captain John Smith (voice by Mel Gibson). 
Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken and Broadway lyricist Stephen Schwartz 
("Pippin") wrote the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not unlike what we did with 'The Lion King' last year in terms of 
giving the public a real sense of what the movie is about -- the feeling, the 
emotion, the depth," says Disney's distribution president Richard Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailers of "Pocahontas," showing various scenes from the movie, will begin 
showing in theaters in early spring. Disney animation president Peter Schneider 
expects the movie, which began production approximately three years ago, to be 
complete by April. A total of 450 artists, including 45 animators, are working 
on the production. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the new "Lion King" campaign, a fresh trailer for the movie will 
debut this weekend on about 8,500 screens. The campaign also includes new 
posters and theater lobby displays with proclamations such as "The King Has 
Returned." New print ads and TV spots will begin appearing in early November.  
</P>
<P>
 Another promotional lure Disney is using to attract audiences the first 
weekend of the re-release is offering the first 100 moviegoers at each show a 
special commemorative poster of "Lion King" featuring a holiday greeting and 
new artwork of all the characters from the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if we're launching a brand-new movie," says Cook. "There are families 
who will certainly want to share the emotion, fun and excitement of this movie 
again. We've found with movies that are evergreen, audiences just can't get 
enough of them." The relaunch also includes new promotional tie-ins from 
Disney's corporate sponsor partners, including Burger King, which will give 
away another 20 million figurines from the movie. The interactive "Lion King" 
video game is also due out during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 While most rivals hail Disney's strategy as a clever and savvy business 
strategy, industry skeptics see the company's motivation as greed and conceit. 
Some speculate the re-release was a calculated attempt to sabotage New Line 
Cinema's animated feature "The Swan Princess," which opens the same day. 
(Several former Disney animators worked on the movie.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were smart to reissue their movie to get the holiday playing 
time, but I also believe that they don't want 'The Swan Princess' to be 
successful and would do anything to try and sabotage it," said Mitch Goldman, 
president of marketing and distribution at New Line Cinema. Goldman added that 
his movie was screened Saturday morning for exhibitors and the response was 
"overwhelmingly positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook dismisses speculation that competition with "Princess" figured into 
Disney's plan to reopen "Lion King" on the weekend prior to Thanksgiving. "It's 
not anything new for us," he said. With the exception of "Lion King," which 
originally opened in the summer, all of Disney's new animated movies -- 
including last year's "Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas," "Aladdin," 
"Beauty and the Beast" and "The Little Mermaid" -- traditionally open during 
the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider explains that the strategy to relaunch "Lion King" was "to maximize 
the film's potential both financially and artistically. And it helps set up the 
release in the foreign market." The movie, which has opened in some overseas 
markets, including England and Japan, will debut throughout Europe beginning 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives estimate that "Lion King's" re-release in the United 
States could yield as much as an additional $30 million at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I hope we get to $300 million because that's an incredible 
benchmark," says Schneider, "and for the artists it's thrilling for them to 
find that kind of recognition of their work." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook declined to estimate how much more money he thinks "Lion King" can bring 
in. "This is a grand experiment. I honestly don't know what to expect -- none 
of us do."

STEVE MARTIN, THE PLAYWRIGHT, ON EINSTEIN, PICASSO AND FRUIT TEA; THEATER: HIS 
ONE-ACT PLAY, WHICH CREATES A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE ARTIST AND THE 
SCIENTIST, IS READY TO OPEN IN L.A. 'IT'S NOW READY TO BE DONE SOMEWHERE WHERE 
THERE'S A RISK TO ME,' HE SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Steve Martin greets a visitor politely enough outside the Four Seasons Hotel 
dining room before a scheduled 4 o'clock tea -- but his voice is tinged with 
disappointment. You see, it's still 10 minutes to 4, and Martin had planned to 
use those 10 minutes to finish the crossword puzzle he carries clutched under 
one arm. Partly inked in with tidy black letters, the puzzle does indeed appear 
to have a good 10 minutes worth of blank squares to go. 
</P>
<P>
 But, once done, running into someone ahead of schedule is difficult to undo. 
So Martin gamely heads for his window table to talk about his new comedy, 
"Picasso at the Lapin Agile," which opens at the Westwood Playhouse on 
Saturday. The one-act play creates a hypothetical meeting between Pablo Picasso 
and Albert Einstein in Paris, 1904, shortly before Einstein published "The 
Special Theory of Relativity" and Picasso painted "Les Demoiselles D'Avignon." 
</P>
<P>
 But, before launching into heady discussions of this explosive fictional 
meeting, Martin has something else on his mind. He makes a habit of not 
watching his old movies and TV appearances ("strange and horrible"), but 
happened to catch an old interview with himself on TV the night before and 
wondered how that dull, pedantic fellow on the screen could possibly be Steve 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was (studying) quarks -- you know how, when you look at them, they change?" 
Martin said, using the scientific term for the hypothetical building blocks of 
subatomic particles (a word that rarely finds its way into casual 
conversation). "I know I'm exactly the same doing interviews. I know I just 
change ." He paused. "And then I looked at myself and said, like, 'Maybe I am 
this deadly boring, serious person.' " He laughed, then turned somber again. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin is hardly dead serious and boring. However, he exhibits none of the 
wild and crazy persona one might expect from a man who first came to national 
prominence in the zany laboratory of "Saturday Night Live." As Martin talks 
about his most recent incarnation as a playwright, he seems professorial, 
intellectual, introspective and maybe just a little . . . quarky. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are any laughs in a conversation with Martin, they are of the kind 
described in "Lapin Agile" as "icebox laughs." Einstein: "You don't laugh now, 
but an hour later you're at home, standing at the icebox, and you laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Take tea at the Four Seasons, for example. Martin is presented with a dizzying 
array of options. "Orange pekoe. No. Lemon verbena? Black currant, that sounds 
cute. But is that caffeinated?" Martin ends up with passion fruit tea -- which 
has caffeine, but about half as much as the other flavors. Later, back at the 
icebox, the situation is reminiscent of the coffee scene from Martin's "L.A. 
Story," in which a table full of Westsiders, deep into the designer coffee 
religion, order such bizarre permutations as double half-caf espresso with a 
twist. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin is buoyed today not just by the dose of half-caf, but by the fact that 
his play, to be performed here by the Chicago-based Steppenwolf Theatre 
Company, has enjoyed critical success in Chicago and Boston. He has also 
written another play, "Wasp," a surreal comedy about a '50s family much like 
Martin's own, which has been performed twice -- at the Ensemble Studio Theatre 
and at Vassar -- and is slated to open in New York in the fall, at a yet-to-be 
named venue. 
</P>
<P>
 He is happy to be bringing "Lapin" home to Los Angeles, and happy that 
critics, so far , have not adopted the stance that a Hollywood comedy star 
couldn't possibly write good theater. "New York is a place (where the critics) 
would really kill me because I'm in movies, so I'm not really eager to take 
("Lapin") there," he says. "But it's now ready to be done somewhere where 
there's a risk to me, and that's L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already been reviewed 20 times with it, so I pretty much know what the 
critical position is, or can be. You are always vulnerable to someone's bad 
mood, or other vision. But at least it's not a horrible celebrity exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 While he has no plans to give up movies -- he stars in Nora Ephron's "Mixed 
Nuts," a black comedy about a suicide hot line slated to open in December -- 
right now Martin is happiest as a playwright. When he decided to try writing a 
play, in 1991, Martin says, "I was starting to get really interested in 
theater. It looked like a real challenge. I thought, 'I wonder if I could do 
that, because if I could do that . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I think you go through your career trying to prove to yourself that you can 
do something. And even after you've done it, you're still trying to prove it. 
So I thought that would prove if I were a writer or not, if I could write a 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin says he was tempted to take a role in "Lapin Agile" but didn't want the 
play to transform into a one-man show. In "Wasp," he says, there is a role for 
him, but thus far he hasn't been able to bring himself to play it because it 
hits a little too close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lapin Agile," Martin said, was inspired by a Picasso painting, titled "At the 
Lapin Agile," painted in about 1904. Martin saw it in a book about Picasso. 
"There was a photo of this painting kind of hanging there, unstretched, 
unframed on the wall -- Picasso just kind of did it to decorate the place," 
Martin says. "And that year, whenever it was, 1992, the painting was hanging at 
the Metropolitan Museum, all stretched out, with a $40,000 frame on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I knew it had recently sold for $1 million, and it just sent me back to 
those days when nothing had any (monetary) value and everything was just about 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin jokes that he's not afraid of going over the heads of his audience 
because that group will be self-selecting. "Going against (the play) already is 
the title," he says cheerfully. "People are already going: 'Picasso, what's 
this?' And then by the time you get to lapin agile , people are going: 'I'll go 
see something else.' " He pauses. "But there is no other title. I suppose I 
could Anglicize it, but then it would be 'Picasso at the Agile Rabbit.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's interest in Picasso stems from a longtime devotion to art; he sits on 
the board at Los Angeles County Museum of Art, whose galleries he roller-skated 
through in "L.A. Story." He has in some past interviews refused to discuss his 
art collecting, but says he's more than willing to talk about art . 
</P>
<P>
 "(Collecting) is what I don't want to talk about -- that's just numbers and 
greed and values," he says. "Especially in Hollywood." Martin, who started 
collecting in the mid-'70s before the activity became an '80s symbol of 
Hollywood chic, notes happily that the prestige collecting has slipped out of 
vogue in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 About LACMA, recently troubled by financial and personnel problems, Martin 
says he has not been directly involved but notes that most of the Hollywood 
money has gone to downtown's Museum of Contemporary Art. "Everyone was 
interested in contemporary art, or 'modern,' so-called," Martin says. "I think 
LACMA is fantastic, beautiful. I mean, there are Rembrandts there. Rembrandts 
and Picassos and major collections of Indian art. . . . At LACMA, they have a 
great collection of American paintings from the 19th Century. That's rare, very 
few museums have that. They have German Expressionist stuff. In Los Angeles ."

INDEED, 'IT'S BETTER TO TRAVEL'; POP MUSIC: SEVEN YEARS AFTER ITS HOT DEBUT, 
ENGLISH GROUP SWING OUT SISTER KICKS OFF ITS FIRST U.S. TOUR TONIGHT AT THE 
COACH HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Swing Out Sister's Corinne Drewery is a longtime admirer of American jazz, R & 
B and classic pop. So it's understandable why the English singer is nervous 
about touring the U.S. for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 When she tries to anticipate how U.S. audiences will react to her soul- and 
jazz-inflected pop band, Drewery said she can't help but think back to a 
raucous scene in "The Blues Brothers" film. The two soul singers played by Dan 
Aykroyd and John Belushi encounter a less-than-hospitable small-town American 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the film, the barmaid (in this club) says, 'We play both kinds of music: 
country and Western,' " recounts Drewery by phone from a tour stop in Japan. 
"When (Aykroyd and Belushi) get up on stage, they have to bring the 
chicken-wire fence down, because they're getting bottles, bones, beer cans and 
chairs thrown at them! (The American audience) may be an expressive audience, 
but I hope it's expressive in a good sense."  
</P>
<P>
 It should help that Swing Out Sister has had seven years to prepare. The 
group, which kicks off that tour tonight at the Coach House, began its career 
like a house afire in 1987. That year, Swing Out Sister's "It's Better to 
Travel" debut album spawned a No. 6 pop hit with the brassy and sassy 
"Breakout" single. The band also earned a Grammy nomination for best new 
artist. It was an even bigger sensation in England, where its first album 
entered the sales charts at No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the nascent group (which also includes keyboardist Andy 
Connell) hadn't established itself as a live attraction when "It's Better to 
Travel" became a popular album. "Our commercial success came before our 
touring," Drewery said. "We were always at the wrong stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Swing Out Sister had grand plans to tour with an orchestra in support of its 
second album in 1989. An infectious tapestry of strings, horns and soaring 
vocals, "Kaleidoscope World" offered a striking reinterpretation of '60s-styled 
pop and soundtrack music. 
</P>
<P>
 But when this ambitious work proved unfashionable amid the high-energy dance 
music of the late '80s, U.S. tour plans were nixed. The group did, however, 
play some dates with a small backing band in England and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed American tour following the release of "Get in Touch With Yourself" 
in 1992 was also scrapped. The duo couldn't persuade its record company to pay 
for a tour using the horn players, guitarists, percussionists and backup 
singers it needed.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've been offered to do shows using DAT recordings or sequencers, which 
would be less costly," said Drewery, who writes most of the band's material 
with Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've also been asked to strip the band down or perform as a piano and voice 
(duo)," she said. "But that's not the way we like to do things. People would be 
disappointed if they heard that. We could come back (at some point), and do an 
unplugged show, but (a lot of people) haven't heard the plugged version yet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the recent release of the band's fourth album, "The Living Return," 
Drewery and Connell insisted on a tour with an eight-piece support band. 
Mercury Records finally consented. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't tour with this record, there would have been no way we could 
possibly do any kind of promotion here, because every time we've come to 
America to do promotion we've talked about coming back to tour," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've done it three times. If we didn't tour this time, people wouldn't 
(trust us again). The record company would rather stick you on a few TV 
programs where you can get a few more million people than you can playing a few 
club-like venues, which is what we will be playing," Drewery said. "So we had 
to kick and fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting is on behalf of "The Living Return," which has a rawer feel than 
the group's pop-early albums. A handful of songs on the new album resulted from 
jam sessions.  
</P>
<P>
 The harder jazz and R & B feel to "The Living Return" is partially a result of 
the month Drewery and Connell spent in 1993 in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We set up a little studio in the Mayflower Hotel overlooking Central Park," 
said Drewery, a fashion designer before Swing Out Sister was formed. "We had a 
great time. We went out to clubs and saw McCoy Tyner, Poncho Sanchez. . . . 
Thank goodness for the blizzard of '93. We couldn't leave the hotel, so we had 
to sit there and start writing some tunes. It did help getting that direct hit 
of energy from New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Drewery expresses unabashed enthusiasm when discussing her numerous 
influences, which range from Diana Ross to John Coltrane.  
</P>
<P>
 "To be recognized in a place where we've received most of our inspiration from 
would be a great achievement," she said. "There are so many American artists we 
are awe-struck by. You would like to perform to people they've performed to and 
be appreciated by them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we won't need the chicken wire." 
</P>
<P>

Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. 8 p.m. $19.50. (714) 496-8930.

'DIARY' OPENS A NEW, LURID CHAPTER; AUTHOR: FAYE RESNICK'S BUMPS IN THE FAST 
LANE WOULD BE UNREMARKABLE EXCEPT THAT SHE SHARED SOME OF THEM WITH NICOLE 
SIMPSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO and SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By her own account, she was an abused child, a bed-wetter who suffered the 
beatings of a stern stepfather and warnings from a harshly religious mother 
that perdition awaited those who indulged. 
</P>
<P>
 But indulge she did, a darkly exotic self-described "Beverly Hills socialite" 
who danced at nightclubs such as the Gate, flew to Aspen and Cabo San Lucas, 
had numerous husbands and lovers, and snorted and smoked cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from her third tour of a drug rehab clinic, Faye D. Resnick's life story 
would be no more than a speed bump in Hollywood's fast lane -- unremarkable 
except for the fact that one of her buddies was Nicole Brown Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Resnick's book, "Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life 
Interrupted," has opened the most lurid chapter yet in the double murder trial 
of football legend O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although friends say Resnick wrote the book with the best intentions -- to 
stick up for her friend in the face of what she perceived as O.J. Simpson's 
powerful public relations machine -- the book has been condemned for everything 
from content to tone to timing. 
</P>
<P>
 "T-R-A-S-H," said Lou Brown, Nicole's father, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the family knew Resnick, 37, but "she wasn't that close to Nicole. 
She was a girl in need. Nicole was a giving person. This girl had a drug 
problem. She (Nicole) took her in for a couple of weeks, then she (Resnick) was 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where she got all of her misinformation, but it's not anything 
we can confirm. And Nicole is not here to defend herself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Robin Greer, an actress who knew Nicole for 14 years, said the book 
rings true. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer said she and others in Nicole's circle at first had made a pact not to 
speak to the press, but have since come forward in the belief that O.J. 
Simpson's camp was controlling the public's interpretation of his relationship 
with Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public needs to understand that there is a duality in O.J.," Greer said. 
"They're only seeing his show-biz personality. They don't see the darker side 
of him. And if people don't see the darker side of him, he could get away with 
murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Resnick's intentions, Judge Lance A. Ito on Tuesday halted jury 
selection to weigh the impact of the salacious 244-page account. On Wednesday, 
Ito asked three television programs to postpone broadcasts of interviews with 
Resnick. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one show complied (Larry King's CNN talk show) and the reasons were 
obvious: The book's sexual passages alone have made it the talk of the town. 
But Ito's reasons had more to do with the book's portrayal of the celebrity 
defendant. In the book, Resnick recounts several angry arguments and alleged 
threats by Simpson, and claims that Nicole was a target of ongoing domestic 
abuse who feared that Simpson would eventually kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 In prior interviews with The Times, Resnick and other friends of Nicole 
Simpson have said that Resnick was a close friend of the murder victim, 
especially during the last year of her life. Even some who criticize the book 
said Wednesday that, if nothing else, Resnick accurately repeats the stories 
Nicole confided to intimates about her post-divorce private life. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the book hit the stores Monday, other members of Nicole Simpson's 
inner circle read proofs and lashed out at Resnick, who declined to be 
interviewed for this article. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Nicole always used to say, Faye's a drama queen," inveighed one friend in 
an interview prior to the book's publication. "I mean, she only really knew 
Nicole for, like, a year. . . . Faye is just desperate for money. She's a 
jet-setter, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Kansas City Chiefs running back Marcus Allen said it was 
"just not true" that, as Resnick says, Allen had an affair with Nicole after 
she separated from Simpson. Resnick wrote that the trysts took place when 
Allen, one of O.J. Simpson's best friends, was engaged and even after he 
married his wife in a ceremony at Simpson's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although there may be some truth about some things in the book, when it 
relates to Marcus Allen it is absolutely false," said Ed Hookstratten, Allen's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer, who defended the book, admitted she lobbied the publisher to excise the 
more lurid passages, including an alleged romantic kiss between Nicole and 
Resnick and a casual sexual encounter between Nicole Simpson and an unnamed man 
after her divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it made her look sexually frivolous, and she wasn't like that," said 
Greer. "I never saw her as a girl who sexually flitted about."  
</P>
<P>
 Another friend said that Resnick was "distressed" by her sudden fame. 
Nevertheless, Resnick managed to dish up an interview in Wednesday's New York 
Post -- complete with picture -- and is scheduled to appear on Maury Povich, 
Connie Chung and the "Today Show" over the course of the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael A. Viner, president of Dove Books, said Resnick received a six-figure 
advance for her literary effort, which was rushed to stores in an unusually 
heavy first press run of about 750,000 hardcover copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could have done what some of the other girls in the circle did, sell 
things to The Star and the tabloids and made a lot more money than she'll 
make," he said. "If she was in it for the money, this isn't what she would have 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 The chatty book was written while Resnick worked with a writer on leave from 
the National Enquirer in seclusion in Stowe, Vt., said Viner. And the haste of 
their effort is evident: The first 250,000 copies misspell one alleged lover's 
name; they also give two ages -- 23 and 29 -- for Brett Shaves, the young law 
clerk who briefly dated Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 Few will dwell on such imperfections, however, as Resnick takes the reader on 
an odyssey of clubs, vacations, secondhand pillow talk and bellicose 
confrontations between Simpson and Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times in June, Resnick said she was introduced to 
Nicole Simpson five years ago by Kris Jenner, who was then in the midst of a 
divorce from Simpson's close friend Robert Kardashian. Resnick said Jenner 
brought her by Nicole's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick said at the time that she saw "a lot of pain in (Nicole's) eyes." And 
in her book, which ends with telephone numbers for domestic abuse hot lines, 
Resnick said she and Nicole "bonded so powerfully, literally becoming soul 
mates" because Resnick had also been abused -- not as a woman, but as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was raised by an Italian-Spanish mother and a German stepfather, 
and that he spanked Resnick every morning for wetting the bed as a youngster, 
discipline that grew into "hideous beatings" as she matured. Even the family 
poodle barked a warning when the old man got home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother ignored his rampages, she said. Resnick said her mother, a nurse by 
day and a budding journalist by night, became a successful Latino columnist who 
wrote about holistic medicine and later joined the Jehovah's Witnesses, making 
the girl's childhood "even more chaotic." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised thinking that the world would end in 1975 -- that Armageddon 
would come when I was 18 years old," she wrote. "I think that's why I had my 
first sexual encounter at 16 -- I didn't want to miss the experience before The 
End." 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving to live with an aunt in the Bay Area, Resnick -- then Faye 
Hutchison -- was crowned 1975 Maid of Hayward, a moment captured in a newspaper 
photograph showing her on the verge of tears. No apocalypse, it was a beginning 
of sorts because it gave what Resnick described as "both an ego boost and some 
career ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 She dropped law classes at a community college and became a director of a John 
Robert Powers finishing and modeling school, she said. After divorcing her 
first husband, she moved to London and then married an "eccentric heir" whose 
life stretched from Europe to Australia, she wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 After that marriage fizzled, she married Paul Resnick, a Westwood businessman, 
and became involved in activities related to the Beverly Hills School District, 
where her daughter attended elementary school. The Resnicks paid $1.3 million 
for a home formerly owned by Michael D. Eisner, Walt Disney Co. chairman.  
</P>
<P>
 During the 1990-91 school year, she served on the board of the Beverly Hills 
Education Foundation, a position that requires a donation of at least $1,000 
and recognition as a school activist, said Judy Vaturi, director of 
administration for the nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Resnick championed the idea of sponsoring a benefit tennis 
tournament. It only made a few hundred dollars and the event was dropped, said 
Vaturi. 
</P>
<P>
 The Resnicks divorced amicably in 1991. In her book, Resnick said she has had 
three husbands, two fiances and several lovers. She also admitted to going 
through drug rehab three times over eight years, the last visit after an 
"intervention" arranged by Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick said she began "tooting and smoking coke two or three times a day" as 
her own romantic relationship came apart and she found herself in the middle of 
escalating fights between O.J. and Nicole Simpson during the weeks leading up 
to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, she said, Simpson threatened to tell the Internal Revenue 
Service that Nicole had improperly listed his Rockingham Way residence as her 
home address, instead of the Bundy Drive condo where she lived. The revelation 
would have required Nicole to pay a huge fine or face jail, Resnick claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. knew that would really hurt her. That $90,000 was almost exactly what 
Nicole had in the bank. She had paid cash for the Bundy condo, so she didn't 
have a lot of cash left," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 It was her alleged role as emotional sounding board, however, that gave 
Resnick grist for the most chilling passages in the book.  
</P>
<P>
 She said Nicole, who had resolved to finally break free of Simpson, once said 
while watching her former husband on Entertainment Tonight: "I look at his arms 
and think, 'God, are these going to be the arms that will kill me someday?' " 
</P>
<P>
 As events spun out of control last June, Resnick writes, Simpson became ever 
more irate about the thought of Nicole with another man. "I can't take this, 
Faye," she quotes Simpson as saying. "I can't take this. I mean, I'll kill that 
b----."  
</P>
<P>
 She said Nicole had a budding romantic interest in the man who was killed with 
her, Ronald Lyle Goldman, and Resnick believed that "inevitably" the two would 
have become intimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick said she had her last conversation with Nicole on June 12, the night 
of the murders. Already checked into a drug rehabilitation center in Marina del 
Rey, Resnick called Nicole to see how her daughter's dance recital had gone. 
She said Nicole, still fuming over the IRS threat, said she had told Simpson he 
was no longer welcomed as part of her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll help you through this, Faye," she quoted Nicole as saying. "When I told 
you that I'd never abandon you, I meant it sincerely." 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick said she wrote the book to speak for Nicole, a mental vow she 
described making at Nicole's funeral. "I'll find a voice for you, Nic," she 
said. "I don't know how, but I'll tell the world all about you, I swear it." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's supporters are not moved with the result. Simpson pal Kardashian 
made no effort to hide his contempt for Resnick and her book while speaking to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disgusting that she would write this type of book about her best 
friend," Kardashian said outside the courthouse. "It serves no purpose. The 
poor woman is brutally murdered. She can't defend herself. Everything is 
hearsay in the book. I'm just glad I'm not her best friend."  
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he thought Resnick wrote it, Kardashian paused and smiled. 
</P>

NOT FADE AWAY; MUSIC: IT MAY BE A DRAG GROWING OLD, BUT GRAYING ROLLING STONE 
FANS STILL CAN ATTEND CONCERTS BY THEIR FAVORITE BAND.

 Robert Friedman was one of the defiant ones: Dressed brazenly in hip 
sunglasses and a long-tailed satin jacket, he was a fortysomething rock 'n' 
roller, another now-antique Rolling Stones fan who showed up at Wednesday 
night's Rose Bowl show with that same old fire in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hermosa Beach resident, with graying shoulder-length hair, what was left 
of it, was in no mood to relive the moment he first heard Mick Jagger's 
snarling voice -- while on an acid trip somewhere in India during the 1960s. He 
was here to party in the here and now, memories be damned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'm a child of the '60s," he said. "But this is the 1990s, and the 
Rolling Stones are playing to a packed house in the Rose Bowl. This is not 
something to be missed, I don't care how old you are." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the aging fans entered the Voodoo Lounge -- the West Hills 
grandmothers wearing Woodstock T-shirts and white-haired company executives in 
tattered blue jeans -- all in search of a little satisfaction, Rolling 
Stones-style. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 80,000 strong, the crowd included "Big Chill" types who had weaned 
their children on rock 'n' roll, baby boomers who have seen some of the music 
that first aroused their passions 25 years ago reduced to TV jingles and 
nostalgic romps on oldies stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Rose Bowl, you could actually see the scalps of the ticket 
scalpers. Heck, even the little old lady from Pasadena showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 But these concert-goers realized that it's not the age lines that count, it's 
the music. So, get off of their cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if I am 54," said Libby Garramone of Las Vegas, perched on a 
curb outside the stadium. "I have a right to be here. This is my generation. 
And as far as age goes, hell, it's only a number, not a state of mind. People 
talk like 50-year-olds are already dead. Not even close." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Hayot, a 39-year-old Los Angeles restaurant owner, left work early to 
drink in the heady concert atmosphere of Jagger and company. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 At the group's recent Las Vegas concert, the lifelong Stones fan gazed across 
the sea of faces -- the laugh-lined, gray-bearded visages -- feeling like part 
of a movement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The graying fans might sing the once-naughty sounding, "Let's Spend the Night 
Together" with an added refrain: As long as we're asleep by 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayot was surrounded by fellow rock veterans taking part in what might be 
their final encore party performance: Old men with bellies protruding over belt 
buckles, mothers in too-snug tie-dye dresses, 50-year-old men suddenly looking 
a bit insecure in their dusted-off skull-and-crossbones bandannas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of weird, kind of scary," Hayot said of the Vegas show, "all 
these people trying to relive a past era -- drinking beer, smoking pot, 
whooping it up, but at the same time looking each other in the eye with a look 
that said, 'We've all gotten old, haven't we?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Bowl officials expected 75% of the crowds at both the Wednesday and 
Friday performances to be "senior Stones fans," many of whom saw their first 
Stones concert when Richard Nixon was president -- 25 years and 25 fewer pounds 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a pretty mellow crowd," said David Jacobs, the Rose Bowl's 50ish 
general manager. "It will also mark the first time in the history of the 
stadium that a lead singer is older than the general manager." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, you can't always get what you want: At the Rose Bowl, there was a 
waiting line for luxury boxes. Unlike at other recent concerts, Stones fans 
snapped up the Rose Bowl's 40 luxury boxes -- some of which go for $2,000 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have sold those boxes four times over," said David Sams, who markets 
the boxes. "I guess Stones fans want to keep champagne in the fridge. And -- 
who knows? -- maybe be closer to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 As fans tick off their years, so too do their idols -- and not always 
gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, three veteran performers suspended tours for health reasons: 
Crosby, Stills & Nash scrapped their remaining concert dates because the 
53-year-old Crosby needs a liver transplant. The Eagles postponed their reunion 
tour because of guitarist Glenn Frey's gastrointestinal problems. And 
42-year-old John Mellencamp was sidelined by heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the concert road takes it toll -- even for fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the plane back from Vegas there were all these guys my age and older, 
totally spent. . . . Our minds still want to party like the old days. But our 
bodies won't let us," Hayot said. 
</P>
<P>
 And for some aging rockers, there's an urge to arrive at the show four hours 
early, so there's ample room to park the car. And when that last encore comes, 
they don't all dance at their seats; some head for the exits to beat the 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could think of all day before the concert was 'Boy, am I gonna be tired 
tomorrow,' " said 51-year-old Dennis Peterson of West Hills, who first heard 
"Satisfaction" in a bar on Lankershim Boulevard in the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Said his 22-year-old daughter, Stephanie, who came more to see the opening Red 
Hot Chili Peppers and Buddy Guy: "Yeah, we left the new car home so it wouldn't 
get nicked. And we all left the house at 3 p.m. so we'd have room to park. I 
mean, c'mon Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Together, young and old alike, they came ready to rock, to watch the 
5-year-old girls do somersaults on the grass outside the stadium, to laugh at 
the bearded Bible-thumper with the megaphone who railed against the sinful 
wages of fornication and rock music. 
</P>
<P>
 And though the music makes fans like Hayot feel almost young again, there's a 
jolt back to reality when the aging band members take the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at Mick Jagger is like looking into a mirror," he said. "And that 
mirror made me feel old." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Stones said it best themselves: What a drag it is getting old.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: 'DIARY' OPENS A NEW, LURID CHAPTER; MEDIA: IN TRYING 
TO CONTROL COVERAGE AND ACCESS TO A NEW BOOK, JUDGE ITO IS FINDING THAT THE 
PROCESS IS OUT OF CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was only one copy left of Faye Resnick's disgusting new Nicole Brown 
Simpson book when I arrived at the neighborhood Crown Books early Tuesday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick is a cocaine addict who wrote a book about Simpson, who she claims was 
her dear friend. A cocaine addict recalling memories of a woman who can't 
answer from the grave. Why should anything in it be believed? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet her book was selling like mad. "I could kick myself," the bookstore 
manager said. "I only ordered 20." Three had been purchased by CBS. Counting 
mine, it adds up to four bought by the news media. That means the rest, 80%, 
had been snatched up on the first day of sale by the public, no doubt including 
many of the self-righteous who berate the press for covering the O.J. Simpson 
story, then read everything written about it. 
</P>
<P>
 These consumers, and the entrepreneurs who supply them, have turned the 
Simpson story into big business, with ratings at stake as well as the sales of 
magazines and newspapers. And in the rush for bucks, forget good taste -- as 
you can see by the O.J. Simpson and Nicole Simpson costumes on sale for 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The saga of Resnick's book began quietly enough in the Criminal Courts 
Building on Tuesday. A summary had been published in most New York papers that 
morning, and accounts of it had been on television the night before. But in the 
mass of garbage that has been published about this case, Resnick's book looked 
to be just one more bag of trash. 
</P>
<P>
 In midmorning, however, Ito announced that "something has been brought to my 
attention of significant import to the case." It was the Resnick book.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge sent the jury out of the courtroom, and talked briefly with a few 
reporters. He asked them to be restrained in covering the book story. One of 
the reporters said the book was already out and excerpts had been published and 
broadcast. "It's out already?" he said. "Boy, they don't waste any time." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Ito wrote to CBS' Connie Chung of "Eye to Eye"; CNN's "Larry 
King Live" and syndicated talk show host Maury Povich, asking them to withhold 
the broadcast of interviews they had with Resnick. "I hope you will find it in 
your conscience, corporate and otherwise, to cooperate with this request . . . 
until after the jury in this case has been selected and sequestered," the judge 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS and Povich said they would go ahead, but CNN agreed to the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge was trying to control the case, to prevent it from being thrown out 
on an appeal based on defense charges that publicity has denied Simpson a fair 
trial. But as it has turned out, Ito is fighting something bigger than him, 
bigger than any court -- a runaway media, fueled by undisciplined competition 
and a hunger for bucks. This has always been the case with television, radio 
and the various forms of print. But today, USC journalism professor Ed Guthman 
told me, "the means for exploiting it are much, much greater." 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick's book is an example of how the process works. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier day, if I had obtained a copy of the book and tried to convince 
one of my editors at The Times to run a story on it, I would have been laughed 
out of the newsroom. I bet a reporter would have had the same reaction at NBC 
Nightly News or the KCBS-TV newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometime around when Gary Hart appeared to have violated the biblical 
injunction against adultery, private lives became public news, and barriers of 
good taste began to disappear. This coincided with the growth of television 
tabloid news shows, which competed against one another for sensations. 
</P>
<P>
 So after sequestering herself with co-author Mike Walker in the romantic White 
Mountains of Vermont to write her book, Resnick embarked on a selling campaign 
that was more important to her literary success than the words of her book. 
This included the television interviews and leaks of the material to the New 
York tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with all this, the Resnick book might have disappeared into the sewers of 
Beverly Hills, where it had been published by Dove Books of North Canon Drive. 
But Judge Ito, in trying to control the impact of the book, gave it a 
tremendous boost. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ito took judicial notice of the Resnick memoirs, making it part of the 
court record, papers such as The Times had to move in. We're covering the trial 
and Ito made it an important part of the proceedings. Boosted to Page 1, the 
Resnick book was on its way. I'm sure the manager of my neighborhood Crown 
Books, and his counterparts elsewhere, were on the phone first thing Wednesday 
ordering more copies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, I read Esquire magazine's current cover story. It painted 
Simpson as a killer so powerful that the author, in her dreams, was tempted to 
follow him to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek was just as bad a few weeks ago, with a story on the two sides of 
Simpson, one outwardly good, the other darkly evil. It was full of racism, 
mocking Simpson for taking elocution lessons before going to work on television 
and for associating with white people. Before that, stories in the New Yorker 
and Newsweek smeared Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Fuhrman. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to compete, to boost ratings and sales through the marketing of the 
sensational murder trial obviously threatens the rights of the defendant. 
That's what worries Judge Ito. But as he found out when he tried to control the 
runaway process, it's beyond him, beyond anyone.

COMEDIAN MARTHA RAYE DEAD AT 78 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martha Raye, the charismatic comedian with the oversized mouth, polished 
pratfalls and mimicking manner, died Wednesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Raye, born in a charity ward to Irish immigrant vaudevillians, was 78 and 
had been in failing health for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Wise, spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where she died, said "her 
death follows a lengthy illness" including very severe circulatory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 50 years she had teamed up with the preeminent entertainment 
talents of the 20th Century: Charlie Chaplin, Jimmy Durante, Bob Hope, Al 
Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Milton Berle, Bing Crosby and many more. 
</P>
<P>
 She had opened her monstrous maw in Broadway musical comedies, radio and 
television shows and an assortment of motion pictures. And each time out of it 
came volume and warmth, for she had -- if even for a fleeting moment -- the 
ability to transcend foolishness and produce genuine sentiment and melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was that more evident than during World War II and in Korea and 
Vietnam, when she traveled tens of thousands of miles to carry her merry 
insanity to American troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Her performances on film, a medium for which she first became well known, 
included a rendition of "Mr. Paganini," in the 1936 Crosby film "Rhythm on the 
Range," which made her an overnight star; "The Big Broadcast of 1938," 
"Hellzapoppin" in 1941 and dozens of perfunctory, long-forgotten and low-budget 
pictures including "Give Me a Sailor," "Never Say Die" and "$1,000 a 
Touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 She told the New York Times in a 1972 interview that she felt she had been 
badly used in pictures, making an exception for "Rhythm on the Range" and 
"Monsieur Verdoux," in which she portrayed Annabella Bonheur, the cacophonous, 
domineering wife of Chaplin, a Bluebeard who satisfies her demands for money by 
secretly marrying and murdering rich women. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaplin, who told Miss Raye he had her in mind when he wrote the part, called 
it "the most brilliant film he had ever made"; some critics agreed and said it 
marked a return to his early triumphs in silent pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Raye acknowledged that it may have been her only venture into "art." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 foot, 3 inches, she was much smaller than her professional persona. It 
was when she smiled or spoke that people realized they were in the presence of 
a genuinely oversize personality with volume to match. Her personal appearances 
had been known to turn into celebrations. Her self-deprecating manner 
encouraged everyone around her to share in the warmth and belly laughs she 
tried hard to find in life. 
</P>
<P>
 But the final years proved to be anything but that.  
</P>
<P>
 Ailments that had begun to plague her as a young star entertaining at Allied 
military bases in the mid-1940s continued to trouble her through her later 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 She suffered from anemia for many years, was found unconscious on the beach in 
Malibu in 1962, suffered a series of strokes that forced her to use a 
wheelchair, and in October, 1993, underwent heart bypass surgery and treatment 
for gangrene poisoning in her foot. 
</P>
<P>
 She was married seven times, most recently to Mark Harris, a show business 
promoter 32 years her junior who had been trying to get her awarded the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom to go with the Motion Picture Academy's Jean 
Hersholt Humanitarian Award Oscar she had received in 1968 for entertaining 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 His efforts proved successful and in November, President Clinton awarded her 
the medal, citing her "great courage, kindness and patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were among the happiest moments of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the legal battles with ex-husbands and her daughter over her 
$2.5-million estate. At the end she had been hugely successful and ravishingly 
hungry, loved by audiences but often ignored by those whose love she sought. 
During periods she described as filled with melancholy, she said sadly that her 
career had really been "my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Raye and her mother had hoped she would become a serious singer when they 
sat down with the telephone book in 1929 to find a more suitable name for 
Margaret Teresa Yvonne O'Reed, who had become part of her parents' vaudeville 
act. Martha Raye was an amalgam of what they found. 
</P>
<P>
 At 13 she was entertaining in nightclubs while performing with the Benny Davis 
Kid Revue. Her first big break came when she landed a small part in an all-star 
revue called "Calling All Stars." It featured many of Broadway's top players, 
including Phil Baker, Lou Holtz, Ella Logan and others. Miss Raye said years 
later that "the only two unknowns in the whole show were Judy Canova and me." 
</P>
<P>
 One night Logan was too ill to perform and Miss Raye was dropped into her 
spot. Foreshadowing the corny plots of some of the pictures in which she later 
appeared, the evening made her a success. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she made "Rhythm on the Range" she had been married a couple of 
times -- to makeup artist Buddy Westmore and composer David Rose -- but after 
several routine pictures in the mid- and late 1930s she tired of Hollywood and 
returned to Broadway. There she co-starred with the legendary Al Jolson in 
"Hold On to Your Hats," a 1940 musical revue that ran for 158 performances. 
Jolson made her a regular on his radio show for the next two years, where she 
worked with such comics as Cantor, Hope and Durante. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1944 she came back to Hollywood for "Four Jills in a Jeep," a wartime film 
built around the antics of four female entertainers touring bases in England 
and North Africa. The New York Post wrote that she had "never been more 
raucous, rough and pleasing." 
</P>
<P>
 After "Monsieur Verdoux," she gravitated toward television, doing several 
guest shots with Milton Berle, who had the nation's No. 1 program in the early 
1950s. Finally, after a series of summer replacement programs, she became host 
of "The Martha Raye Show" (1955-56). A New York Herald Tribune critic called 
her "the unqualified queen of buffoons." She had been nominated for an Emmy in 
1952 and 1953 for some specials and received another nomination in 1975 for an 
episode of "McMillan and Wife." 
</P>
<P>
 She did sketches on other people's programs throughout the 1950s and in 1958 
began to appear on the New York stage in revivals ("Annie Get Your Gun") and 
nationwide in repertory theater. Her interpretations of "No, No Nanette," 
"Wildcat" and "Hello, Dolly" were particularly praised. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1982 to 1984 she was seen on TV in the long-running series "Alice," which 
starred Linda Lavin as the acerbic waitress, and was one of dozens of stars 
featured on the comedy anthology "Love, American Style." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, at age 69, the boisterous mistress of slapstick returned to a New 
York cabaret, this time to one called the Ballroom, where she sang classic 
ballads as they were written, sans the Raye sarcasm and gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time she had switched from her comedy style. The first was 
in the early 1930s when her husband at the time, composer Rose, had her record 
such popular ballads as "Body and Soul," an experience that she said "brought 
me 58 cents in royalties." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This time the response to "Little Girl Blue," "My Funny Valentine" and others 
was enthusiastic and profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 By then her only national appearances were on TV commercials in which she 
espoused the advantages of Polident, a denture cleaner. She said she enjoyed 
the commercials because a season's worth were filmed in three days. 
</P>
<P>
 There were to be no more performances. The rest of her years were marked by 
court actions in which her daughter tried to declare her mentally incompetent 
and her friends split over her marriage to Harris, some of them hinting that it 
was only a money arrangement for him while others took his side, saying he had 
made a physically failing and mentally diminished old woman happy. 
</P>
<P>
 In another lawsuit, she alleged that the 1991 Bette Midler-James Caan film 
"For the Boys" wrongfully appropriated her life story. The lawsuit was 
dismissed this year after Midler testified that there was no similarity between 
her part and Miss Raye's life except for the fact that they both entertained 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Columnist Sidney Skolsky, in a 1962 interview in which Miss Raye briefly 
lowered her comedic barriers, quoted her as saying: "Few people actually know 
me, or take me seriously. . . . It's great for my career though, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 And then: "I thought success in show business was the answer to everything. It 
isn't. I don't know what is."

'DIARY' OPENS NEW, LURID CHAPTER IN SIMPSON SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO and SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By her own account, she was an abused child, a bed-wetter who suffered the 
beatings of a stern stepfather and warnings from a harshly religious mother 
that perdition awaited those who indulged. 
</P>
<P>
 But indulge she did, a darkly exotic self-described "Beverly Hills socialite" 
who danced at nightclubs such as the Gate, flew to Aspen and Cabo San Lucas, 
had numerous husbands and lovers, and snorted and smoked cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from her third tour of a drug rehab clinic, Faye D. Resnick's life story 
would be no more than a speed bump in Hollywood's fast lane -- unremarkable 
except for the fact that one of her buddies was Nicole Brown Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Resnick's book, "Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life 
Interrupted," has opened the most lurid chapter yet in the double murder trial 
of football legend O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although friends say Resnick wrote the book with the best intentions -- to 
stick up for her friend in the face of what she perceived as O.J. Simpson's 
powerful public relations machine -- the book has been condemned for everything 
from content to tone to timing. 
</P>
<P>
 "T-R-A-S-H," said Lou Brown, Nicole's father, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the family knew Resnick, 37, but "she wasn't that close to Nicole. 
She was a girl in need. Nicole was a giving person. This girl had a drug 
problem. She (Nicole) took her in for a couple of weeks, then she (Resnick) was 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where she got all of her misinformation, but it's not anything 
we can confirm. And Nicole is not here to defend herself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, Robin Greer, an actress who knew Nicole for 14 years, said the book 
rings true. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer said she and others in Nicole's circle at first had made a pact not to 
speak to the press, but have since come forward in the belief that O.J. 
Simpson's camp was controlling the public's interpretation of his relationship 
with Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public needs to understand that there is a duality in O.J.," Greer said. 
"They're only seeing his show-biz personality. They don't see the darker side 
of him. And if people don't see the darker side of him, he could get away with 
murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Resnick's intentions, Judge Lance A. Ito on Tuesday halted jury 
selection to weigh the impact of the salacious 244-page account. On Wednesday, 
Ito asked three television programs to postpone broadcasts of interviews with 
Resnick. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one show complied (Larry King's CNN talk show) and the reasons were 
obvious: The book's sexual passages alone have made it the talk of the town. 
But Ito's reasons had more to do with the book's portrayal of the celebrity 
defendant. In the book, Resnick recounts several angry arguments and alleged 
threats by Simpson, and claims that Nicole was a target of ongoing domestic 
abuse who feared that Simpson would eventually kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 In prior interviews with The Times, Resnick and other friends of Nicole 
Simpson have said that Resnick was a close friend of the murder victim, 
especially during the last year of her life. Even some who criticize the book 
said Wednesday that, if nothing else, Resnick accurately repeats the stories 
Nicole confided to intimates about her post-divorce private life. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the book hit the stores Monday, other members of Nicole Simpson's 
inner circle read proofs and lashed out at Resnick, who declined to be 
interviewed for this article. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Nicole always used to say, Faye's a drama queen," inveighed one friend in 
an interview prior to the book's publication. "I mean, she only really knew 
Nicole for, like, a year. . . . Faye is just desperate for money. She's a 
jet-setter, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Kansas City Chiefs running back Marcus Allen said it was 
"just not true" that, as Resnick says, Allen had an affair with Nicole after 
she separated from Simpson. Resnick wrote that the trysts took place when 
Allen, one of O.J. Simpson's best friends, was engaged and even after he 
married his wife in a ceremony at Simpson's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although there may be some truth about some things in the book, when it 
relates to Marcus Allen it is absolutely false," said Ed Hookstratten, Allen's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer, who defended the book, admitted she lobbied the publisher to excise the 
more lurid passages, including an alleged romantic kiss between Nicole and 
Resnick and a casual sexual encounter between Nicole Simpson and an unnamed man 
after her divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it made her look sexually frivolous, and she wasn't like that," said 
Greer. "I never saw her as a girl who sexually flitted about."  
</P>
<P>
 Another friend said that Resnick was "distressed" by her sudden fame. 
Nevertheless, Resnick managed to dish up an interview in Wednesday's New York 
Post -- complete with picture -- and is scheduled to appear on Maury Povich, 
Connie Chung and the "Today Show" over the course of the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michael A. Viner, president of Dove Books, said Resnick received a six-figure 
advance for her literary effort, which was rushed to stores in an unusually 
heavy first press run of about 750,000 hardcover copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could have done what some of the other girls in the circle did, sell 
things to The Star and the tabloids and made a lot more money than she'll 
make," he said. "If she was in it for the money, this isn't what she would have 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 The chatty book was written while Resnick worked with a writer on leave from 
the National Enquirer in seclusion in Stowe, Vt., said Viner. And the haste of 
their effort is evident: The first 250,000 copies misspell one alleged lover's 
name; they also give two ages -- 23 and 29 -- for Brett Shaves, the young law 
clerk who briefly dated Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 Few will dwell on such imperfections, however, as Resnick takes the reader on 
an odyssey of clubs, vacations, secondhand pillow talk and bellicose 
confrontations between Simpson and Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times in June, Resnick said she was introduced to 
Nicole Simpson five years ago by Kris Jenner, who was then in the midst of a 
divorce from Simpson's close friend Robert Kardashian. Resnick said Jenner 
brought her by Nicole's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick said at the time that she saw "a lot of pain in (Nicole's) eyes." And 
in her book, which ends with telephone numbers for domestic abuse hot lines, 
Resnick said she and Nicole "bonded so powerfully, literally becoming soul 
mates" because Resnick had also been abused -- not as a woman, but as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was raised by an Italian-Spanish mother and a German stepfather, 
and that he spanked Resnick every morning for wetting the bed as a youngster, 
discipline that grew into "hideous beatings" as she matured. Even the family 
poodle barked a warning when the old man got home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother ignored his rampages, she said. Resnick said her mother, a nurse by 
day and a budding journalist by night, became a successful Latino columnist who 
wrote about holistic medicine and later joined the Jehovah's Witnesses, making 
the girl's childhood "even more chaotic." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised thinking that the world would end in 1975 -- that Armageddon 
would come when I was 18 years old," she wrote. "I think that's why I had my 
first sexual encounter at 16 -- I didn't want to miss the experience before The 
End." 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving to live with an aunt in the Bay Area, Resnick -- then Faye 
Hutchison -- was crowned 1975 Maid of Hayward, a moment captured in a newspaper 
photograph showing her on the verge of tears. No apocalypse, it was a beginning 
of sorts because it gave what Resnick described as "both an ego boost and some 
career ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 She dropped law classes at a community college and became a director of a John 
Robert Powers finishing and modeling school, she said. After divorcing her 
first husband, she moved to London and then married an "eccentric heir" whose 
life stretched from Europe to Australia, she wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 After that marriage fizzled, she married Paul Resnick, a Westwood businessman, 
and became involved in activities related to the Beverly Hills School District, 
where her daughter attended elementary school. The Resnicks paid $1.3 million 
for a home formerly owned by Michael D. Eisner, Walt Disney Co. chairman.  
</P>
<P>
 During the 1990-91 school year, she served on the board of the Beverly Hills 
Education Foundation, a position that requires a donation of at least $1,000 
and recognition as a school activist, said Judy Vaturi, director of 
administration for the nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Resnick championed the idea of sponsoring a benefit tennis 
tournament. It only made a few hundred dollars and the event was dropped, said 
Vaturi. 
</P>
<P>
 The Resnicks divorced amicably in 1991. In her book, Resnick said she has had 
three husbands, two fiances and several lovers. She also admitted to going 
through drug rehab three times over eight years, the last visit after an 
"intervention" arranged by Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick said she began "tooting and smoking coke two or three times a day" as 
her own romantic relationship came apart and she found herself in the middle of 
escalating fights between O.J. and Nicole Simpson during the weeks leading up 
to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, she said, Simpson threatened to tell the Internal Revenue 
Service that Nicole had improperly listed his Rockingham Way residence as her 
home address, instead of the Bundy Drive condo where she lived. The revelation 
would have required Nicole to pay a huge fine or face jail, Resnick claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. knew that would really hurt her. That $90,000 was almost exactly what 
Nicole had in the bank. She had paid cash for the Bundy condo, so she didn't 
have a lot of cash left," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 It was her alleged role as emotional sounding board, however, that gave 
Resnick grist for the most chilling passages in the book.  
</P>
<P>
 She said Nicole, who had resolved to finally break free of Simpson, once said 
while watching her former husband on Entertainment Tonight: "I look at his arms 
and think, 'God, are these going to be the arms that will kill me someday?' " 
</P>
<P>
 As events spun out of control last June, Resnick writes, Simpson became ever 
more irate about the thought of Nicole with another man. "I can't take this, 
Faye," she quotes Simpson as saying. "I can't take this. I mean, I'll kill that 
b----."  
</P>
<P>
 She said Nicole had a budding romantic interest in the man who was killed with 
her, Ronald Lyle Goldman, and Resnick believed that "inevitably" the two would 
have become intimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick said she had her last conversation with Nicole on June 12, the night 
of the murders. Already checked into a drug rehabilitation center in Marina del 
Rey, Resnick called Nicole to see how her daughter's dance recital had gone. 
She said Nicole, still fuming over the IRS threat, said she had told Simpson he 
was no longer welcomed as part of her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll help you through this, Faye," she quoted Nicole as saying. "When I told 
you that I'd never abandon you, I meant it sincerely." 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick said she wrote the book to speak for Nicole, a mental vow she 
described making at Nicole's funeral. "I'll find a voice for you, Nic," she 
said. "I don't know how, but I'll tell the world all about you, I swear it." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's supporters are not moved with the result. Simpson pal Kardashian 
made no effort to hide his contempt for Resnick and her book while speaking to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disgusting that she would write this type of book about her best 
friend," Kardashian said outside the courthouse. "It serves no purpose. The 
poor woman is brutally murdered. She can't defend herself. Everything is 
hearsay in the book. I'm just glad I'm not her best friend."  
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he thought Resnick wrote it, Kardashian paused and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money, my friend. Money."

HELLO, DELI; STUDIO CITY: A REBUILT ART'S DELICATESSEN REOPENS NINE MONTHS 
AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE. PATRONS BREATHE SIGHS OF CONTENTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON D. MARKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The pastrami rose from the ashes Wednesday. Nine months and a day after its 
fiery destruction in a Northridge earthquake aftershock -- long enough to have 
a baby, long enough to whet a million appetites -- Art's Deli reopened on 
Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a birth, it was the rebirth of a Valley and show-biz institution -- 
a return from limbo for an entire neighborhood that was smashed in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was it like around here without Art's? A four-letter word: D-e-a-d," 
said Marty Petersil, owner of The Flask liquor store a few blocks away. "That 
proved, as if anyone doubted it, that this is the hub of the boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 Added his friend, lawyer Hugh Lipton: "You knew it was bad around here when 
you could always find a parking space." 
</P>
<P>
 Parking was scarce again Wednesday morning, even at 6:30 a.m., as friends and 
customers drove from as far away as Simi Valley, Newhall and Culver City to 
line up outside in the chilly dawn for a chance to have eggs and onions, maybe 
some lox (could it hurt?), and welcome their mishpocheh , their family, back to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Ginsburg himself -- the restaurant's owner, maitre d', godfather, 
impresario -- looked as high as a helium-filled balloon, his feet barely 
tethered to the ground, a rose pinned to his blue dress shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so excited this morning that my legs were shaking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The deli, founded 37 years ago with a few tables and a long counter, survived 
the main shock of the Jan. 17 quake with only a cracked front wall. At 3 a.m. 
the following morning, however, an aftershock caused an electrical fire that 
burned it down. Ginsburg, who lives a few blocks away, arrived with family 
members just in time to see flames shoot through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cried and watched it go -- and then smiles came across our faces and we 
began to plan what we wanted to fix!" said Ginsburg. "It was like watching a 
child get hurt, then it was like watching it in the hospital getting chicken 
soup as the workmen built it back up from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ginsburg family credits their accountant, David Levi, with quickly 
developing the menu for recovery: Hire a contractor, wrangle with a 
recalcitrant insurance company and lobby their councilman for help with a 
variance on city parking requirements. (The deli has only six spots -- the city 
originally demanded 65.) 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, consiglier e Levi sat at a table of honor with Ginsburg's 
son-in-law and other regulars. Between bites of poppy-seed bagels and sips of 
hot coffee, they showed off the new wainscoting, the graceful wooden chairs 
("Roberta picked them out, you like 'em?"), the shiny white-and-black tiled 
floor. And they toasted their new fire walls and foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-wishers stopping by to offer them mazel tov were gratified to see hanging 
overhead the restaurant's trademark photos of turkey, corned beef and other 
sandwiches -- a lineup so simple yet lascivious that Ginsburg refers to them as 
"Jewish pornography." 
</P>
<P>
 Price tag on the remake: $1.7 million, about a million over their original 
estimate, but unbegrudged. "People rallied around this family, and I'm sure 
they'll make Art's a habit again," said Levi. 
</P>
<P>
 There seemed little doubt of that. Relaxing at their usual tables for the 
first time in 271 days, actors, agents, producers, composers and writers who 
walk over from nearby studios recounted how the fire that torched Art's also 
burned a hole in their lives. Routines were upset and bellies went unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Said TV-movie producer Hugh Benson: "For years I've had breakfast here almost 
every single day I'm in town, and sometimes lunch, too. It's like home except 
the food's better." 
</P>
<P>
 TV-music composer Steve Dorff likewise considers Art's an anchor in his life. 
"My friends joke that if they want to talk to me, they come here instead of 
calling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delis are important at this end of town, as entertainment-industry types like 
to compare their merits almost as much as they like to eat and schmooze in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Best deli west of New York!" exclaimed Vernon Scott, a UPI entertainment 
columnist who has sat at the same table on Saturday mornings for 16 years with 
writer Joe Hyams, producer Walter Seltzer, ABC Vice President Ron Sunderland 
and publicist Jerry Pam. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only place that'll let these guys stay as long as they want," chided 
Hyams' wife, Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsburg and his wife, Sandy, profess that they'd no sooner rush a guest than 
spread mayonnaise on the brisket. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's haimisch , it's homey, it's like a big Jewish family here," said Manny 
Celnik, a veteran barber who recalled attending Art's opening in 1957. "My 
wife, Goldie, and I missed it when it was closed; we didn't go anywhere else. 
We waited! Fish like this you cannot find." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a cluster of celebrity noshing, too, you shall not find -- at least for 
breakfast. Now you want name dropping? No Ginsburg would hesitate to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Ivan Reitman is a regular, said Art's son-in-law, and so are MCA 
chief Lew Wasserman, producer John Landis, comedian Steve Martin, and actors 
Richard Dreyfuss, Ed Asner and Rob Lowe. Warner Bros. has a regular Saturday 
table; their late chairman, Steve Ross, had Art's cater meals to his corporate 
jet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous CBS television shows order up to 200 lunches a day. The restaurant 
keeps accounts running for 500 individuals and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The waitresses are proud of their boss and proud of their customers. Kitty 
Sherman called Ginsburg "the greatest boss in the world," then caught sight of 
a favorite ponytailed customer and alternately whispered and yelled: 
</P>
<P>
 "He's OJ and coffee. . . . How ya doin' honey! . . . I remember when he came 
to town and drove a truck. Now he's a millionaire -- a real Hollywood story!" 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, all but four employees returned to the restaurant. During 
rebuilding, they received unemployment insurance checks for a while, then 
Federal Emergency Management Agency money. 
</P>
<P>
 Now neighborhood businesses are likewise waiting to reap the rewards of having 
the deli back. By some merchants' estimates, business on the block is down 40% 
since Art's 1,000 customers a day stopped walking off their meals by window 
shopping along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Valley Gem Shop co-owner Susan Frieder: "I have a feeling of completion 
now after the earthquake. With Art's back, and people looking in our door 
again, you feel like things will finally get back to normal."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; PUMPKIN FESTIVAL SLATED FOR WEEKEND 
</P>

<P>
 More than 40 celebrities from television and movies will be at Paramount Ranch 
Saturday and Sunday for the Calabasas Days Pumpkin Festival, a family-oriented 
annual event that celebrates autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand marshals for the third annual event are Cassidy Rae from the television 
series "Models Inc." and Jenna von Oy from "Blossom," said Margery Gould, a 
spokeswoman for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 There also will be appearances by Kathy Baker of "Picket Fences," Laurie 
Metcalf of "Roseanne," and K Callan, "Lois & Clark," Gould said. Devon Odessa 
and A. J. Langer from "My So-Called Life" are also scheduled to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fabulous. It's fun for everyone. There are hay rides, pony rides and 
music on all the stages all day long," said Arlene E. Bernholtz, executive 
assistant of the Calabasas Chamber of Commerce, which along with the city of 
Calabasas sponsors the event. "It's a great time to kick back and put on your 
Western costumes and Halloween costumes and just come out and have a ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival features a variety of games and contests for adults and children. 
In keeping with the pumpkin theme, there will be a pumpkin-seed spitting 
contest, a pumpkin cook-off, a pumpkin-pie-eating contest and pumpkin bowling. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate Halloween, there will be a costume contest, as well as contests 
to see who can make the scariest sounds and tell the scariest stories, Gould 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival organizers say they expect at least 25,000 people during the two 
days. Paramount Ranch is an Old West-styled village just south of Agoura Hills 
off the Kanan Road exit of the Ventura Freeway. The ranch, which has been the 
setting for various Westerns over the years, is currently the setting for the 
television show "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will also feature a celebrity corral, where the public can meet 
celebrities, Gould said. Also scheduled to appear are cast members from 
"Melrose Place," "Beverly Hills, 90210," "Saved by the Bell (The New 
Generation)" "Step by Step," "Days of Our Lives," "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper," 
and "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the festival is $7.50 for adults, $6 for seniors and youths ages 
12 to 17 and $3.75 for children aged 4 to 11. Children 3 and under get in free. 
The event runs from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. both days. For further information, 
call (818) 225-2227. FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 48-HOUR WATCH TO HONOR 241 KILLED IN BEIRUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the deaths of 241 U.S. Marines in Lebanon that prompted two former 
soldiers to turn their shared home in Arleta into a veterans memorial in 1983.  
</P>
<P>
 To mark the 11th anniversary of that tragic day, Joe Crowley and William Knuth 
will keep a 48-hour watch over the memorial this weekend. And they are inviting 
other patriots to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is especially for the 241 . . . who died in Beirut" said Joe Crowley. 
But, he added, those wanting to honor American veterans of any war can stop by 
the U.S. Veterans Remembrance Memorial, 13645 Osborne St., from dawn Saturday 
until dawn Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial, which also serves as home to World War II veteran Crowley, 71, 
and Korean War veteran Knuth, 58, will hold special ceremonies throughout the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two flags will be hoisted at dawn Saturday in honor of the Marines 
killed in Beirut, veterans still considered missing in action in Vietnam and 
all who have served in the armed forces. A taps ceremony will take place at 11 
a.m. Sunday, and patriotic music will ring out the rest of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial, which has become a local landmark and receives regular honks of 
approval from passing motorists, was born after a suicide bomber leveled a 
Marine barracks in Beirut on Oct. 23, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two hundred and forty-one men died, and no one was doing anything about it," 
Crowley recalled. "So, we decided to put up the three flags we usually hung on 
holidays." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors, touched by the gesture, offered to add their American flags to the 
display. And it grew. When the media caught on and spread the story around the 
country, flags began arriving by the armload, finally totaling 315. 
</P>
<P>
 The two could hardly care properly for so many, and eventually limited the 
display to six, all of which had flown over the White House and now wave 24 
hours a day. They erected monuments in the front yard, one of which reads "In 
memory of all veterans that have served their country in its time of need." And 
they opened a tiny military museum in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is their life. They answer the phone not with a "hello" but with a 
friendly "U.S. Veterans Remembrance Memorial." ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; TOUR ARRANGER SINGS PRAISES OF BICYCLE TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hima Singh sings the songs of adventure to distant places. She can tell the 
tales of bicycling and hiking in exotic lands and experiencing treasures in 
rich cultures.  
</P>
<P>
 And she helps people sample those treasures by organizing bicycle tours to her 
native Nepal and other Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh, who moved to Reseda three years ago, said she is very familiar with 
bicycle travel -- a bicycle was her main form of transportation during her 
college days from 1978 to 1982 in Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh's parents run a travel agency in Nepal, long a popular destination for 
bicycle tours. So it was easy for Singh to begin organizing the bike tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she arranges bike tours for groups of six to eight people who want to 
see such countries as China, Vietnam, Bhutan and Nepal and to experience 
different Asian cultures.  
</P>
<P>
 Travel has always been in her blood, Singh said. "My family has always been in 
the travel industry."  
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from college, Singh completed courses in hotel management in 
Switzerland, England and the United States. Then, she returned to Nepal to help 
out in her family's travel agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, she opened a Santa Monica branch of the agency to market 
tours to India, Nepal and China. But that agency failed in the late 1980s after 
the Tian An Men Square uprising, upheavals in Tibet, the closing of the 
Nepal-India border and other political tensions led to mass tour cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, she went to work organizing bicycle tours for Asian Pacific 
Adventures, a Los Angeles travel agency that specializes in such tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh said she can help people with any type of tour ranging from first-class 
accommodations and a rental car to very inexpensive accommodations and hiking 
or bicycling. Her preference is clear.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is much more fun to see a town by walking than in a car," she said. RAY

DEVIL WINDS; FLOWING FROM DESERT TO MOUNTAIN TO SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the season for Santa Ana winds, and with them comes the reminder of the 
wildfires last fall that claimed 1,241 structures, almost 200,000 acres and $1 
billion in damages. Three people lost their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anas usually occur in autumn and sometimes in winter, knocking out 
power, tripping burglar alarms and whipping up other bits of mischief. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon originates hundreds of miles from Southern California in a 
high-pressure system over Utah and is generally strongest in the Riverside-San 
Bernardino area. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana winds move through the mountains from the north-northeast, funneling 
through the canyones into the basin. The heat of the wind is more the result of 
its downhill motion than its movement across the desert. This is the path: 1. 
Air is cool and holds fair amount of moisture. 2. Air loses moisture as it 
moves up the mountains. 3. Wind speed increases as air funnels through mountain 
passes. 4. Temperature of the air increases 5.5 degrees for every 1,000 feet it 
descends. 5. Air that passes over and through mountains has lost almost all 
moisture. * Tracing the Name There are many theories as to why the winds are 
called Santa Anas. Some believe the name comes from 'Satanas,' Spanish for 
Satan. But it is generally accepted that they are named for Santa Ana Canyon, 
the narrow gap in the Santa Ana Mountains in Orange and Riverside counties, 
where the winds are especially strong. Contributing Factors Dry cold fronts 
passing through the Great Basin states are followed by a high-pressure system 
over the Utah-Nevada border, creating westerly winds that eventually become 
Santa Anas. *

 "There was a desert wind blowing that night. It was one of those hot, dry 
Santa Anas that come down through the mountain passes and curl your hair and 
make your nerves jump and your skin itch. On nights like that every booze party 
ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study 
their husbands' necks. Anything can happen."- Raymond Chandler, "Red Wind" * 
How Other Winds Compare Sustained winds from Santa Anas generally range from 15 
m.p.h. or less for a weak system to 35 or 40 m.p.h. for a strong one, although 
gusts of up to 90 m.p.h. have been recorded in mountain and canyon passes in 
San Bernardino County. Here are generally assigned values for sustained wind 
speeds for other storms: Sandstorm: 30 m.p.h. or more Dust Storm: 30 m.p.h. or 
more Tropical depression: 38 m.p.h. or less Tropical storm: 39-78 m.p.h. Gale: 
39-54 m.p.h. Severe blizzard: 45 m.p.h. or more Hurricane: 74 m.p.h. or more

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY HALL 
REORGANIZATION WOULD PROMOTE BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing its push to make Los Angeles more responsive to the business 
community, Mayor Richard Riordan's Administration on Wednesday proposed 
reorganizing several city departments to place more emphasis on economic 
development and affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the mayor's plan, the city Housing Department would take over the 
housing programs now handled by the Community Redevelopment Agency.The efforts 
of the Community Economic Development Department also would be broadened to 
include a centralized office for government loan applications and an office 
that secures bonds for construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose is to bring focus, to bring renewed energy to the economic 
development activities of the city," said William Ouchi, Riordan's chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles until very recently has not had to compete for jobs. It has not 
had to take seriously the need to develop affordable housing for its labor 
force because we could sit here, fat, dumb and happy. We all know those days 
are over." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi presented the mayor's proposal to a joint session of the council's 
Housing and Community Redevelopment Committee and the Community and Economic 
Development on Wednesday, but no action was taken.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VENICE; OFFICER CHARGED 
WITH ASSAULT ON TEEN-AGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Compton police officer who allegedly struck a teen-ager with a pistol when 
the boy mistook the officer's Venice apartment for a girlfriend's was charged 
Wednesday with assault and battery. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.Joseph D. Shidler said that on Sept. 2, the 15-year-old 
Inglewood boy went to the apartment house where the girlfriend lives. Shidler 
said that because the youth was unfamiliar with the building, he mistakenly 
knocked on the door of the apartment rented by officer Ivan Swanson, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 When no one answered, the boy opened the unlocked door, realized it was the 
wrong apartment and closed the door, Shidler said. Swanson, who had watched the 
boy peek inside, immediately reopened the door, hit the boy in the face with 
his handgun and kicked and beat him while waiting for Los Angeles police to 
arrive, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arriving officers arrested Swanson, who was later released on his own 
recognizance. His arraignment is scheduled for Nov. 8 in Los Angeles Municipal 
Court.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; FIREFIGHTER 
PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN TIRE SLASHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pasadena firefighter who reportedly moonlights as a tire repair kit salesman 
pleaded not guilty Wednesday to one count of vandalism in connection with a 
tire-slashing incident at the Plaza Pasadena shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Stephens, 42, is also a suspect in at least 16 other tire slashings in 
the mall's underground parking area, said city prosecutor Tracy Webb.Those 
incidents are still under investigation, Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens was ordered to appear Dec. 28 in Pasadena Municipal Court for a 
pretrial hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pasadena firefighter since 1987, Stephens turned himself into police Sept. 
13 after a warrant was issued for his arrest, Webb said. Stephens was released 
that day on his own recognizance, Webb said. He is still on the job as a 
firefighter and told The Times that he did not slash the tires. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Fire Department supervisors) know me and my performance record," Stephens 
said. "They know this type of thing doesn't fit. It is unfortunate that I am 
being falsely accused." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said an off-duty security guard saw Stephens at the scene of a tire 
slashing in the mall parking lot and wrote down the license plate of the car he 
left in. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators traced the vehicle to a Pasadena car rental agency. The rental 
agency spokeswoman told police that Stephens regularly rented cars there and 
also sold the company tire-repair kits.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CONDO EMBEZZLER GETS 6-YEAR SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Westwood man who pleaded no contest to embezzling $1.4 million from a 
Calabasas condominium owners' association while on probation for a similar 
offense was sentenced Wednesday to six years in state prison, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer John (Jay) Gobus, 46, must serve at least three years before he is 
eligible for parole, said Allan C. Fork, of the Major Fraud Division of the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Gobus, who operated a property management company, has been in jail in lieu of 
$1.4-million bail since his arrest Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge George Schiavelli handed down the sentence in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Gobus stole the money from the Oak Park-Calabasas homeowners association 
between Feb. 1, 1985, and July 31, 1993, Fork said. Gobus used some of that 
money to pay $45,000 in restitution for a prior conviction in 1992 for 
embezzling money from the Old Orchard Condominium Assn. in Santa Clarita, Fork 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gobus diverted money from the Calabasas association's bank account to his own 
account, prosecutors said. He also forged the signature of an association board 
member and altered another check for his services by writing in a higher 
figure, Fork said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven members of the association were at the sentencing, Fork said. Two, he 
said, told the judge that Gobus had caused the association a financial 
hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners have been hard-pressed to maintain their 268-unit complex on 
Park Granada, because there was only $31,000 left in reserve when Gobus quit 
managing the property in June, 1993, said Ronald Stone, a professor of 
accounting at Cal State Northridge, who helped uncover the theft.  
</P>
<P>
 The $1.4 million has apparently been spent and the association's only probable 
recourse is to recover the money through an insurance policy the organization 
had against such losses, according to Stone.  
</P>
<P>
 Banks, he said, might also be held liable for cashing some of the forged 
checks. FRANK MANNING

TROUBLED SCHOOL HAD LONE OFFICER; VIOLENCE: SINGLE OFFICIAL WAS UNABLE TO QUELL 
DISTURBANCE THAT LED TO TWO STABBINGS, A SHOOTING AT GRANT HIGH IN VAN NUYS. 
DISTRICT DEFENDS STAFFING.

 Despite signs that tensions between Armenian and Latino students at a Van Nuys 
high school were increasing this week, only one Los Angeles Unified School 
District police officer was on campus Tuesday when skirmishes erupted just 
outside the school gates, leading to two stabbings and a shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 School district police acknowledged Wednesday that the officer at Grant High 
School had requested help because of rumors that a fight might erupt, but that 
another officer was not dispatched to the school until after classes ended for 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Mitchell, the Los Angeles school district police chief, said the district 
has just seven patrol units for the entire San Fernando Valley and that 
emergencies take priority over rumors of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grant officer, Jack Lee, was overwhelmed by the flare-ups that began about 
2 p.m., school district police said. Lee, who declined to be interviewed, 
called for help a second time to report that a large group of students was 
fighting, said Sgt. Steve Masters of the school district police. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came out of school and saw this large group of kids and they were 
polarizing and getting ready to fight," Masters said. "He was excited. It's not 
what normally happens after school." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. John Dunkin, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department, said 
Tuesday's melee involved between 50 and 100 students and that one officer would 
be unable to quell such large-scale fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Animosity between Armenian and Latino students had been growing since a fight 
broke out last Wednesday and students said they expected more problems on the 
campus. Tensions were high Tuesday and students said rumors were rampant about 
another fight, said Andrea Bauman, a 16-year-old junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knew that something was going to go on," said Bauman, who was trying 
to drive out of the school parking lot Tuesday when the fight erupted and sent 
her back into the lot. "There was that tension." 
</P>
<P>
 Two Armenian juniors, whose names were not made public, suffered multiple stab 
wounds as they left the campus Tuesday afternoon. Police said the two ran to a 
relative's house near the school for help. One of the boys was released from 
Valley Medical Center on Wednesday and the other, who suffered a collapsed 
lung, remained hospitalized for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old Latino boy was wounded in the calf in a drive-by shooting three 
blocks from the campus about 10 minutes after the stabbings. The boy was 
transferred to County-USC Medical Center for observation and was listed in 
stable condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Rhudy of the LAPD said there were no suspects, but said the incidents 
probably were gang-related. School officials, family members and friends of the 
victims, however, said the boys were not in a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the campus was calm Wednesday and police officers surrounded the 
campus after school to disperse students. Principal Eve Sherman, in a morning 
address, tried to reassure students, and parents were given notices about the 
incidents. The school's Back to School night, already scheduled for tonight, 
will include a discussion about the fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic tensions have been present on the Van Nuys campus for some time, and 
Armenian and Latino students have been sent to one-day retreats to discuss 
diversity and conflict resolution. Sherman said a fight erupted last spring 
between the two groups, stemming more classroom discussions about different 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, the animosity reached a new height. On Monday, a lunchtime 
brawl broke out, prompting Sherman to call for more police assistance on the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, administrators also believed there could be potential problems. 
Lee called school district police about 1 p.m. asking for assistance at 
dismissal time. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the students were let out of school at 2 p.m., Lee was alone to deal 
with the problems. Sherman and another administrator were driving the perimeter 
of the school to see if there was trouble.

JOINING FORCES TO COMBAT POLLUTERS; CONFERENCE: REPRESENTATIVES FROM U.S., 
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDERLINE THE NEED FOR MULTI-AGENCY COOPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 David Wilma was sharing a "war story" with almost 200 federal, state and local 
officials who crowded into a conference room in Downtown Los Angeles on 
Wednesday to talk about busting environmental criminals. One night in 1991, an 
Oakland policeman discovered a truck dumping green sludge into the Oakland 
estuary. The Oakland Police Department's environmental crimes team -- 
consisting of one officer -- investigated, but the sludge turned out to be food 
waste, and could not legally be considered a hazardous material. So the police 
could not file charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Wilma's branch of the federal Environmental Protection Agency's 
investigative force got a call from police describing the situation. EPA 
officials told the police that the trucking company could be prosecuted for 
violating the Clean Water Act, and a multi-agency investigation was under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real typical example of a case that started with a phone call," Wilma 
said. It resulted in prosecutions in four judicial districts across California 
of a trucking company that dumped waste at night. And, Wilma said, it is also 
an example of why prosecuting environmental crimes requires interagency 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from at least a dozen agencies, including the Los Angeles and Orange 
County district attorneys, Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn and U.S. Atty. 
Nora Manella, were at the conference Wednesday to aid that collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The polluters of our land, air and water are hoping this conference is a 
failure," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan Hochman. But "the partnership 
between federal, state and local agencies is growing stronger" -- important, he 
said, because "the fist will always be mightier than five separate fingers." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, the first of its type and size in Southern California in 10 
years, underscores the fact that environmental crimes join violent crimes and 
health fraud as the top priorities for federal prosecution, said Manella, head 
U.S. attorney in the district that includes Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environmental crime committed by any one criminal, such as the 
contamination of our water supply, poses as much of a threat to our safety as a 
violent crime," Manella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said his jurisdiction contains 
20,000 to 25,000 businesses involved in storing hazardous waste, making 
environmental enforcement a high priority in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to assure you that my office does more than handle one case," said 
Garcetti, as the crowd laughed at the quip by the man whose office is 
prosecuting O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said his jurisdiction has special 
reason to be concerned with environmental enforcement, citing a surge in 
industrial manufacturing and the pitfalls of the effects of agricultural 
methods once considered safe and now deemed environmentally harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 John Morris, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles 
bureau's white-collar crime unit, said his agency is interested in 
investigating environmental criminals partly because those involved usually 
commit other crimes . 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the conference was devoted to going through regulations and 
prosecution procedures. Wilma told the participants it was crucial that 
agencies be aware of their goals in each case, noting that strategies can 
differ depending on whether one wants a conviction, fine or a court order to 
stop dumping.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; STUDY FINDS PARKING SPACES TO BE AMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While motorists might think parking spaces are eternally hard to find, a new 
study of downtown Glendale shows that despite the recent opening of the Alex 
Theater and other businesses, the area has ample parking -- it just isn't being 
put to its best use. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, conducted for the Glendale Redevelopment Agency by a private 
consultant, covered the entire downtown from the Ventura Freeway to Colorado 
Street.  
</P>
<P>
 It concluded that plans for a new municipal parking structure, for which 
officials have eyed several locations, can be put off if the city erects signs 
to direct shoppers and night-life patrons to under-used parking lots on side 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parking supply on the whole for the (downtown) retail area is adequate to 
accommodate the demand even during peak Christmas shopping season," said Pat 
Gibson of Kaku Associates, which performed the study.  
</P>
<P>
 In the downtown area there are about 16,000 parking spaces in privately owned 
garages and another 1,800 spaces in off-street city lots.  
</P>
<P>
 But some lots not immediately adjacent to the Glendale Galleria mall or 
downtown shops are only half full during the holiday shopping season. And on an 
average business day, the public parking lots in the core downtown area are 
only about 40% full, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The low percentages during midday conditions cannot justify a new parking 
garage for the area at this time. Instead, better management of the existing 
parking spaces in the evenings is needed," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking survey was commissioned by the redevelopment agency last year to 
help devise a "parking strategy" for the downtown area. Agency officials said 
they were concerned that a lack of parking spaces in the area was preventing or 
discouraging new businesses from moving in and shoppers from patronizing the 
area.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the many short-term solutions recommended in the report is an ordinance 
allowing restaurants to move into buildings formerly occupied by stores without 
having to meet the tougher parking demands required of restaurants. The city 
planning commission will consider such an ordinance next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recommendations include installing parking meters on free curbside 
spaces and converting a number of meters with 10-hour limits that are "within 
reasonable walking distance" of downtown with new two-hour meters, and 
extending meter operations for both on- and off-street city lots until 9 or 10 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes, officials said, would discourage people who work downtown from 
parking in public spaces, leaving more room for shoppers and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city can begin moving toward a parking system that encourages customer 
and visitor parking and, at the same time, provides (adequate) employee 
parking," said Gibson. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM SEEKS TO LURE VISITORS

<P>
 Most people don't stop -- or even think about stopping -- when passing through 
Sun Valley, residents say.  
</P>
<P>
 That's probably because they're zooming through Sun Valley at about 65 m.p.h. 
on the Hollywood or Golden State freeways, which meet in the middle of the 
community of 41,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the local postmaster and his team of organizers continue at the rate 
they're going, Sun Valley will be the first of eight Los Angeles communities to 
fund major transportation improvements through a new federal program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, the Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative, or LANI, is aimed at 
transforming deteriorating, freeway-corridor communities into more attractive, 
accessible neighborhoods -- the kind of place that might lure travelers off the 
highways to stop, shop or just smell the roses. 
</P>
<P>
 LANI, a federal grant program administered by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority, was conceived a year ago after state Department of Transportation 
officials met with city officials to discuss ways to spur economic 
revitalization and "humanize" transportation issues, said Joyce Perkins, LANI's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight Los Angeles-area communities located in major transportation corridors 
were selected to become part of a 30-month demonstration project. In addition 
to Sun Valley, the only other San Fernando Valley community included in the 
project is North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members appointed community leaders to make recommendations and 
submit applications for state transportation funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The eight demonstration areas have shown different degrees of intensity," 
Perkins said. "But Sun Valley has set the pace. They were the first area to 
produce sponsor dollars. They are extremely enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Valley's efforts are driven by a group appointed by Councilman Richard 
Alarcon and headed by Postmaster Jon Eshback, who was elected chairman. Eshback 
and his group have met weekly since June and plan to begin major community 
improvement projects by Christmas -- well before the deadline to submit their 
list of proposed improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get our work plan in 45 days early and get started working," says 
Eshback, who was born and reared in Sun Valley. "Everybody's opinion is, let's 
push as hard as we can until we get the projects accepted." Some improvements 
likely to stem from the $250,000 in federal funding Sun Valley received through 
the program so far this year include: repaving and curbing, installing 
sidewalks, street lights, bus-stop kiosks and benches, landscaping, and 
constructing jogging paths. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is create an identity for Sun Valley," said Lance 
Reynolds, director of Neighborhood Empowerment and Economic Development Inc., 
the community management firm hired by Sun Valley to implement its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to drive in, be able to stop and shop and maybe enjoy the 
mariachis in the town center," he said. "That means fixing up the streets, many 
of which are unpaved. It means landscaping and painting buildings. It means 
giving people a reason to get out of their cars and do something in the town."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; OBSOLETE COMPUTERS BOON TO HIGH SCHOOL

 For students at San Fernando High School, computers that are obsolete to local 
businesses can be what helps prepare them for the future, said Barbara Garry, 
assistant principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids are mostly from homes where a computer would be a dream come true," 
said Garry, an administrator in a school of 3,200 students but with no more 
than 80 computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Garry would like to see computers in each of the school's 150 classrooms and a 
bank of 10 computers in the school library. Because of a foundation based in La 
Jolla, the school may have a chance to see that happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detwiler Foundation, which would like to make every student computer 
literate by the end of the decade, is offering to match every computer donation 
that San Fernando High School obtains with a computer it has collected from big 
businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 But the donations must be made by Nov. 23, Garry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school also may obtain computer software through the program. Donations of 
computer equipment must come from companies with less than 200 employees, Garry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies can donate software, printers and other computer accessories. The 
school is looking for workable IBM compatible computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really important that all our kids, especially our college-bound kids, 
know how to use a computer," Garry said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make a donation, call Garry at (818) 365-1121. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; NEEDY STUDENTS TO GET FREE HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Going to school with a toothache because their families can't afford a dentist 
may become a thing of the past for children with a new program being put 
together by Glendale health professionals and school district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy Kids is a nonprofit program sponsored by three local hospitals, 
calling themselves the Glendale Hospital Coalition, and the school district. It 
will provide medical, dental and mental health services to children from 
low-income families who are not adequately covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the program is only in its infancy, organizers say they expect to soon 
begin treating eligible students at five elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program will improve the quality of life for many children in Glendale by 
providing medical services that were previously inaccessible," said Carrie 
Reynolds, the program's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Healthy Kids program will be available only to students at 
Cerritos, Edison, La Crescenta, Mann and Marshall elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The campuses were selected because they serve students from some of the city's 
lowest-income neighborhoods, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the pilot program is a success in its first year, organizers plan to expand 
it to some of the 12 other elementary schools in the district, depending on the 
availability of funds, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has already enlisted a number of physicians, dentists and mental 
health professionals who have volunteered to provide free services to children 
identified with acute or chronic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 School teachers and principals who identify students with these problems will 
send them to the school nurse, who will determine whether the child should be 
referred to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos Principal Kim Bishop said her school, located in southern Glendale, 
has "a significant number of families that are not receiving dental care or 
have unmet health needs" and will undoubtedly benefit once the program is fully 
operational. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're already starting to make referrals," Bishop said. "If kids come to 
school and their teeth are hurting, or they have other health problems on their 
mind, they're not going to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be overseen by a board of directors with representatives from 
Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Glendale Memorial Hospital, Verdugo Hills 
Hospital, the school district, the city and local business people. 
</P>
<P>
 Its offices will be located at the district headquarters. For more 
information, call (818) 241-3111. STEVE RYFLE

COUNCIL OKS BONDS FOR PHOENIX DRUG CENTERS; COMMUNITY: APPROVAL INCLUDES 
BOOSTING SECURITY AT LAKE VIEW TERRACE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to help issue tax-exempt bonds 
for two local drug-abuse treatment centers in exchange for a promise to beef up 
security at the recently opened live-in center in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the city will hold hearings needed to issue $10 million 
in tax-exempt bonds to refinance the mortgage of the Phoenix Academy in Lake 
View Terrace and fund improvements at the Phoenix House in Venice. The city, 
however, would not be financially liable for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, administrators for the drug treatment centers have vowed to 
add new security measures at the northeast San Fernando Valley academy -- 
measures that they had long opposed for fear of turning the honor-system 
academy into a jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was a small victory for those Lake View Terrace neighbors who 
have pressed for added security at the Phoenix Academy -- an effort that was 
rekindled following two recent incidents involving academy residents leaving 
the facility and straying into surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets us off of the extremely tenuous ground we have been on and on solid 
footing," said Sandy Hubbard, president of the Lake View Terrace Improvement 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Hubbard, Phoenix officials have agreed to install a front gate 
to complete fencing of the center's entire perimeter, electronic security 
communications for the front entrance and add routine patrols of the facility, 
among other improvements. Some of the changes are to be implemented 
immediately, while others are to be completed within 60 days.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Phoenix officials were hesitant about increasing security at the 
academy because they consider it a rehabilitation facility, not a detention 
center, with a program based on cooperation not enforcement. But they were 
pleased to reach an agreement with neighbors that would clear the way for the 
bond sale hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are happy that everything has been worked out," said Judy Corman, a 
spokeswoman for the Phoenix House Foundation, the New-York based group that 
operates the academy and 14 other residential treatment centers nationwide. 
"The idea is to become part of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, the state cannot issue tax-exempt bonds for Phoenix House 
unless the local governing body -- in this case the city of Los Angeles -- 
agrees to hold public hearings on the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the rehabilitation center opened six months ago, neighbors fought 
the proposal. At first they tried to keep it from locating in the vacant Lake 
View Terrace hospital. When that battle appeared futile, they pressed for added 
landscaping and security measures to reduce the center's impact on the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors and city officials called for the increased security after two 
July incidents involving academy residents leaving the grounds without 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the incidents, a boy distraught over the death of his grandmother 
ran off the grounds with a counselor in pursuit. The youth ran to a nearby 
house and startled a woman when he asked if he could hide in her house. The 
counselor was able to coax him back. That same month, several Phoenix youths 
stole an academy van and took it on a joy ride before returning it a short time 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidents prompted Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents Lake View 
Terrace, to postpone a vote last week on the $10-million bond issue. In an 
interview Wednesday, he said he was happy that the city and neighbors could use 
the academy's desire for bond financing to leverage new improvements at the 
facility.

BERNSON GAINS BACKING IN FIGHT TO PRESERVE AREA; ENVIRONMENT: TWO POTENTIALLY 
KEY ALLIES ACCOMPANY THE COUNCILMAN ON A TOUR OF CHATSWORTH RESERVOIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilman Hal Bernson gained two potentially key allies Wednesday in an 
effort to preserve Chatsworth Reservoir as a wildlife area, perhaps through a 
land swap that would involve state or federal agencies and the Department of 
Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson was accompanied on a tour of the reservoir by Rep. Anthony Beilenson 
(D-Los Angeles) and the chief of staff for Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland 
(R-Granada Hills), who could not attend because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this tour was to get the attention of the elected officials 
and to do everything in our power to protect this wild game and bird preserve," 
Bernson said. "I've been bringing up legislation on this since I was elected," 
said the councilman, who has held office since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 90-minute tour, the group walked up a steep hillside to the site of 
a Chumash settlement and enjoyed a scenic view of the Santa Susana Mountains on 
one side and the San Fernando Valley on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir is a favorite spot for bird watchers and school-sponsored nature 
hikes. Canada geese also have made the 560-acre reservoir an annual stop during 
their winter migration south. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit impressed Scott Wilk, Boland's chief of staff, who said the 
assemblywoman would "throw the full weight of her office behind preserving the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was absolutely pristine. You can see what the Valley actually looked like 
at one time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who has been to the reservoir before, said he would support any 
effort to preserve the area, including helping broker a federal land swap with 
the public utility company. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he would push for a lease agreement between the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy and the DWP, a move that would save the utility company 
an estimated $500,000 in annual operations costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the conservancy has the right of first refusal if the utility 
company ever decides to sell it, Beilenson said. It was purchased in the 1920s 
for about $255,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job at the moment is to help persuade the DWP to offer it to the 
conservancy," Beilenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the federal government appropriating funds to purchase it, that's 
not in the cards," he warned. "It would be hard to convince members of Congress 
to get involved with what is a local land decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's office began the first stage of the process with a draft letter sent 
to DWP General Manager Bill McCarley, said Francine Oschin, Bernson's 
legislative aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Through spokesman Dorothy Jensen, DWP General Manager Bill McCarley said he 
has not seen a formal proposal from the councilman, but said he was willing to 
cooperate and discuss any proposal Bernson has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his career, Bernson has fended off all kinds of ideas for the 
property, from turning it into a recreation area that included batting cages to 
golf courses to low-cost housing for schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will never be able to develop it as long as I'm around, and I know I 
won't be here forever. But I'd like to see it either traded to the federal 
government or leased to the conservancy," Bernson said.

5 ARRESTED IN ALLEGED BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five gang members were captured Wednesday as they attempted to flee from what 
was apparently the latest of two burglaries, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Sanchez, 26, and Manuel Xolo, 26, both of Pacoima, were arrested on 
suspicion of burglary, receiving stolen property and violation of parole, said 
Officer M. Halaby of the LAPD's Devonshire Division.Three juveniles were also 
arrested on suspicion of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 The five are admitted members of a gang, police said. Sanchez and Xolo were on 
parole for other violations, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the men and boys had just burglarized the home of Harold Holland, 
61, in the 17500 block of Kingsbury Street, when a neighbor called police to 
report unfamiliar cars in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived at 11:30 a.m., the alleged burglars sped off in a van and 
a car in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief chase, officers caught both vehicles. Discovered in the van were 
$5,000 in jewelry, electronic equipment, a television set and four rifles -- 
all taken from Holland's home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 One vehicle contained jewelry from a previous burglary in Santa Clarita, 
Halaby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had at least 500 pieces of jewelry," he said. "Each of them had a whole 
bunch of jewelry in their pockets. It was like whatever you can grab you can 
keep." 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were being held without bail at the Devonshire Division and the 
three juveniles were sent to San Fernando Valley Juvenile Hall.

SEPULVEDA BASIN IMPROVEMENTS OKD; PARKLAND: ELEVEN MILLION WILL BE SPENT ON 20 
ACRES OF ATHLETIC FIELDS, 185 ACRES OF WILDLIFE AREA AND RECLAIMED WATER 
SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City park commissioners approved an $11-million agreement Wednesday with the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that will pay for major improvements in the 
Sepulveda Basin, including development of 20 acres of athletic fields and more 
than 185 acres of wildlife territory and an expansion of the basin's reclaimed 
water system. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the improvements will be split evenly between the Corps of 
Engineers, which owns the 2,100 acres of the basin, and the city's Department 
of Parks and Recreation, which leases it for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's $5.5 million share of the funding will come from two sources: 
$3 million from Proposition A funds for the athletic fields and wildlife 
projects, and $2.5 million to be shared by the Department of Water and Power 
and the Department of Public Works for expansion of the reclaimed water 
distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
 Work is scheduled to begin in May and will conclude by the winter of 1996, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sepulveda Basin serves as the San Fernando Valley's largest public park. 
While the primary purpose of the open land is to provide a runoff basin for 
flood control, as a park it is a mecca for golfers, soccer and softball 
players, as well as for fishermen and other visitors to the 11-acre Lake 
Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 The basin is viewed by environmentalists and others as one of the most 
important wetland areas in the Valley, forming an important link in a chain of 
five remaining urban open space areas along with the Encino Reservoir, Pierce 
College farm, the Chatsworth Reservoir and the Van Norman Dam area. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the reclaimed water system in the basin services only Lake Balboa 
and the pond in the wildlife area. After the expansion, reclaimed water -- 
filtered waste water -- will be used to irrigate both the Woodley and the 
Balboa and Encino golf courses, said Bob Faucett, a landscape architect with 
the parks department. Eventually, the reclaimed water system will service the 
entire basin, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty acres of new athletic fields also will be built using the funds. The 
fields will be in the northeast corner of the basin near the Tillman Water 
Reclamation Plant and will include soccer, cricket and softball fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to those, we're putting in more athletic fields adjacent to 
existing fields at Hjelte Park and Balboa Sport Centers," said Deborah Lamb, a 
landscape architect with the Corps of Engineers. Other fields will be north of 
Lake Balboa, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb said the expanded wildlife areas, to be north of Burbank Boulevard on 
both sides of Woodley Avenue, were originally slated for use as athletic 
fields. But due to drainage problems in that area, planners decided to use the 
acreage for an expanded nature preserve and wildlife trails. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The area will be sewn with plants native to the area, perennial grasses and 
buckwheat, Lamb said, noting that the area is within the Pacific Flyway, an 
international corridor traversed by migratory waterfowl including Canada geese. 
Raptors, songbirds, shorebirds, snowy egrets and blue herons have also been 
seen in the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement prompted little immediate reaction among environmental groups. 
But Glenn Bailey, director of the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation 
District and a founding member of the Coalition to Save the Sepulveda Basin, 
criticized park commissioners for providing only one day's notice of the 
meeting regarding the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sounds like a good agreement," Bailey said, "But the public needs to 
know if you're locking it into things we might not support. Give us time to 
review it."

REDEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR QUAKE REPAIRS DEBATED; RECOVERY: OPPOSITION AT COMMUNITY 
MEETING SUGGESTS AN UPHILL STRUGGLE FOR THE PROPOSAL TO USE AGENCY POWERS TO 
REBUILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Supporters and opponents of a proposal to use redevelopment agency powers to 
rebuild quake-damaged neighborhoods clashed Wednesday at a Sherman Oaks 
community meeting, forecasting an uphill struggle for Los Angeles redevelopment 
officials who are pitching the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting -- the first of several scheduled throughout the city during the 
next month -- drew a crowd of about 50 residents and business owners to 
Millikan Middle School to hear redevelopment officials explain the proposal and 
field questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, a stretch of commercial and residential blocks along 
Ventura Boulevard and adjacent neighborhoods in Sherman Oaks and Studio City 
would form one of six proposed emergency redevelopment zones throughout the San 
Fernando Valley and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal takes advantage of emergency provisions in state law that allow 
local redevelopment agencies to establish project areas in disaster zones 
without completing the usual time-consuming environmental studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The law allows the agencies to keep some of the property taxes generated by 
new construction in a project area and use that money to pay for improvements 
such as new streets, parks and sewers, as well as loans for earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The instructional meeting quickly turned into a forum for opponents and 
supporters of the redevelopment plan to debate its merits. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the opponents said they fear the plan will only siphon more taxes away 
from vital city services without producing much-needed fixes. Supporters, on 
the other hand, argued that the proposal would give the city another tool to 
restore damaged commercial and residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Epstein, chairman of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., said his group 
opposes the plan, in part because there is no limit to how much the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency can spend on administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want is to tighten this plan up," he told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fred Gaines, a Sherman Oaks attorney, argued that the proposal will 
guarantee that tax dollars will be spent in Sherman Oaks instead of going to 
the city's general fund to pay for city services on the other side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that this is just another tool to rebuild the area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the Sherman Oaks redevelopment zone could generate as much as 
$18.7 million, most of which would provide loans to rebuild housing in the 
area. However, the redevelopment guidelines require that 20% of housing 
repaired with the funds be set aside for tenants with moderate or low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision on whether to establish the zones is expected to be made 
Nov. 16 at a joint meeting of the City Council and the Community Redevelopment 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial element of traditional redevelopment projects elsewhere 
in the city has been the power redevelopment officials have to condemn and 
acquire private property. To quell fears about the abuse of such powers, city 
officials have promised that the power to condemn properties in the proposed 
quake rehabilitation zones will be used only in extreme cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But that did not appease many speakers at the hearing. Some suggested that the 
city give residents and landowners some authority over the rebuilding efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Betz, who owns apartments in Sherman Oaks, said he feared that the CRA 
would condemn apartment buildings if the owners want to delay rebuilding until 
the demand for housing increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel these people have a right to wait for a market to come back and not 
be forced to go into debt when there is no market," he said.

BLACK, WHITE PENTECOSTALS UNITE IN ONE ASSOCIATION; RELIGION: EUPHORIA PREVAILS 
AMONG LEADERS, BUT FEW DOUBT THAT A FORMIDABLE TASK LOOMS IN OVERCOMING 88 
YEARS OF RACIAL SEPARATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Amid the speaking in tongues and symbolic washing of feet, the nation's most 
prominent African American and white Pentecostal denominations joined hands 
here Wednesday to form a new multiracial national association. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Pentecostal Charismatic Churches of North America, the 
interdenominational group will be led by a 12-member executive committee of six 
blacks and six whites. White delegates voted to disband their 46-year-old 
racially segregated Pentecostal Fellowship of North America in a separate 
action Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel excited and euphoric," said B.E. Underwood, who led the all-white 
group to disband. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Ithiel Clemmons of the predominantly black Church of God of Christ was 
elected chairman of the new organization. Underwood, who is general 
superintendent of the Pentecostal Holiness Church, was elected first vice 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Pentecostal leaders embarked with high spirits on a new path of 
reconciliation, few doubted the formidable task ahead in overcoming 88 years of 
racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
 From members of local congregations to prominent bishops, the assessment was 
much the same -- bringing the spirit of Memphis to local churches will be a 
long and arduous task. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody here knows what it's going to cost us," said Del Tarr, 
president of the Assemblies of God Theological Seminary in Springfield, Mo. 
"But I believe it will be far-reaching worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
 One challenge will be overcoming ingrained racial prejudices among some 
members of local churches, both black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lucy Ntrek, who attends a black church in Memphis: "I hope we can 
experience a bigger fellowship (with whites) and that they will no longer be 
ashamed to identify with us as Pentecostals." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the absence of the Rev. L.H. Ford, the presiding bishop of 
the 5.5-million-member Church of God in Christ, has not gone unnoticed by 
delegates here.  
</P>
<P>
 Ford, 80, could not be reached for comment, but others in his denomination 
said that he is unlikely to actively resist interdenominational cooperation. 
They said, however, he remains suspicious of whites and protective of the 
church he has helped build into the largest black Pentecostal denomination in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other challenges as well, including the job of enlisting local 
congregations in their national leaders' drive for reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we come down from the mountain we will have to walk this thing out," 
said Bishop Charles E. Blake of the West Angeles Church of God in Christ in Los 
Angeles. Blake was elected to the new group's executive committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, there appears to be the potential for disagreement over how political 
the new association should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, for example, said he envisions not only cooperation with white churches 
to address pressing inner-city problems, but their support in pushing for 
federal and state action to meet the needs of the poor. He noted that white 
Pentecostals are generally politically conservative, whereas blacks are 
liberal.  
</P>
<P>
 "This presents some complications," Blake said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, another new committee member, Pastor Jack Hayford of the 
Church on the Way in Van Nuys, said he would be very surprised to see the new 
Pentecostal association adopt an overtly political agenda. He said there has 
long been a "steadfast resistance" among Pentecostals to political activism. 
But he said he recognized the need for churches to meet inner-city needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever problems may lie ahead, delegates Wednesday reveled in the 
atmosphere of what they called a mountaintop experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In a moving -- and unplanned -- moment Wednesday, an unidentified delegate in 
the audience began speaking in "tongues" -- ecstatic utterances that believers 
see as evidence that the speaker has been filled with the Holy Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 As the delegate spoke, cries and ecstatic shouts filled the auditorium on the 
banks of the Mississippi River, moving Hayford, he explained later, to 
"interpret" the delegate's words to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look if you will from the heavenward side of things and see where you have 
been -- two separate streams," said Hayford. "But now look! Look! Not only is 
there a new purity but multitudes more who will gather at one mighty river."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 10 STABBED, 6 INJURED IN JAIL FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten inmates were stabbed and at least six more received other injuries in a 
riot at the Pitchess jail Wednesday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight broke out just before 9 p.m. in a dorm at the East Facility of the 
Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho and involved all 140 inmates housed in that 
dorm, said Sgt. Ron Spear of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-minute fight was between African American and Latino inmates, Spear 
said. Deputies broke up the riot with "sting ball" grenades and rubber bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inmates broke up some toilets and used the shards of ceramic as weapons," 
Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two inmates in critical condition with chest wounds were airlifted to Henry 
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, said Los Angeles County Fire 
Department spokeswoman Charlotte Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other inmates were taken to Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills, where 
their conditions were listed as critical and serious, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest of a series of 52 such mass brawls between African American 
and Latino inmates at the jail this year.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; AGUA DULCE BICYCLIST, 13, KILLED BY VAN ALONG 
SIERRA HIGHWAY 
</P>

<P>
 A van struck a 13-year-old bicyclist on Sierra Highway Wednesday, killing him, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Martin, of Agua Dulce, apparently was swerving back and forth for 
unknown reasons as he rode a BMX-type bicycle south on the right shoulder of 
the two-lane road, said Highway Patrol Officer Ruben DeAvila.A van driven about 
40 m.p.h. came alongside Kevin, striking him, just north of Shady Lane Road at 
about 4:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we don't know if the van veered and hit the kid or the kid 
veered and hit the van," DeAvila said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Kevin's friends who gathered at the accident scene, unaware of the 
severity of his injuries, described him as a quiet, home-schooled youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pretty much kept to himself," said Frank Keehner, 14, who lives near 
Kevin's house. 
</P>
<P>
 The van's driver, Mark Graham, 45, was driving below the speed limit and was 
not cited, although the investigation into the accident was still being 
conducted Wednesday evening, DeAvila said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses tried to make Kevin comfortable and were talking to him when 
emergency workers arrived a few minutes later, said Los Angeles County Fire 
Department Capt. Juan Gonzalez. He said the teen-ager was conscious, but had 
suffered severe injuries to his torso and complained of difficulty breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was pale and it was extremely hard to get any vital signs out of him," 
Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin's heart stopped about 15 minutes later, with firefighters performing 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him as a rescue helicopter arrived. The boy 
was airlifted to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, where he was 
pronounced dead.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BUILDING EXPECTED TO BEGIN ON DELAYED SCHOOL 
PROJECT; SANTA CLARITA: MOUNTAINVIEW ELEMENTARY WAS TO BE FINISHED MONTHS AGO. 
BUT THE SITE DEVELOPER WAS REPLACED. 
</P>

<P>
 On site construction is finally expected to begin next week on a new 
elementary school that was supposed to be finished several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mountainview Elementary School, to be located on donated land near a new 
residential development, is now set to open at the end of April, according to 
Art Clark, assistant superintendent of business services for the Saugus Union 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was delayed when the developer of the site was replaced by the 
landowner, Clark said. The original developer, Paragon Homes, donated the 
10-acre school site as part of its deal to build a 1,600-unit residential 
development. Paragon also agreed to provide roads for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's more than any other developer has done," said Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paragon didn't follow through on several matters, Clark said, including 
obtaining a key license agreement from the state Department of Water and Power 
to build two roads that will cross an underground aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year the landowner, First Nationwide Bank, replaced Paragon with 
FN Development of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second developer had to go back, review what the first developer had done 
up to that date, and pick up some strands that were important that had not been 
followed through by the first developer," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction has also been slowed because the Department of the State 
Architect, which must approve the school's building plans, has still not 
reviewed all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once begun, construction at the site should go relatively quickly because the 
school will be comprised of modular structures now being built off-site. 
</P>
<P>
 The 525 students who would attend Mountainview are instead attending classes 
in temporary buildings on the campus of Charles Helmers Elementary School in 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 This brings the total student population on the Helmers campus to more than 
900, far above the norm at the facility, said Mountainview Principal Kathy 
Wolfson. Lunchtimes, recesses and the start and end of school days have been 
staggered to accommodate all the students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a little crowded, but because of the schedules we've been able to work 
it out," Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several parents of students who are supposed to now be in Mountainview say 
they have lost confidence the new school will be open on its new target date. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they tell me (the school will open in) May, I know it's going to be May of 
the following year," said Rebecca Mills, mother of a 7-year-old student.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 300 ACRES BURNED IN POPPY AREA; LANCASTER: 
OFFICIALS SAY BLAZE PROBABLY DID NOT CAUSE LASTING HARM TO THE PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A grass fire swept across 300 acres of Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve Park 
Wednesday, fire officials said, but probably caused no irreparable harm to an 
area that attracts thousands of visitors annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, authorities said the noon fire will probably rejuvenate the land for 
next year's bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is perfect for the poppies," said County Fire Captain Doug Brickey, 
referring to the golden-orange flowers that bloom at the park from March 
through May. "There will be more flowers there next year than they have had in 
years. It is all part of nature's process." 
</P>
<P>
 On good years for wildflowers, the poppy -- the official state flower -- is 
the star attraction in this sparsely populated area 13 miles west of Lancaster. 
The reserve is the only one in California dedicated to growing the state's 
flower. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's blaze started in the northeast corner of the 1,745-acre preserve 
near 140th Street West and Lancaster Road, according to Los Angeles County Fire 
Inspector Gil Sanchez. Department of Forestry hand crews used shovels to cut a 
fire line at Avenue I and 110th Street West to stop the fire from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on hand to help was the county's recently acquired Super Scooper aircraft 
that dropped large loads of water on the flames. Four helicopters dropped 
fire-retardant foam and water. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the two hand crews, 100 Los Angeles County firefighters fought 
the fire, which was brought under control in two hours, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 No structures were threatened and there were no evacuations or injuries, 
Sanchez said. The cause of the fire is under investigation by the United States 
Department of Forestry.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CHARGES FILED AGAINST TRIO IN DRUG LAB CASE; 
ANTELOPE VALLEY: AUTHORITIES SAY REMOTE LLANO HOME WAS USED TO MANUFACTURE 
METHAMPHETAMINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two men and a woman suspected of running a methamphetamine lab in a remote 
desert house east of Palmdale were charged Wednesday with drug and firearms 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The moderate-sized lab, raided by narcotics agents two days before the 
arrests, was allegedly capable of manufacturing two to five pounds of the drug 
during each 48-hour session, according to authorities. That amount of the drug 
could be sold for up to $250,000 on the street, narcotics investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies sought Monday to arrest William 
Ziepke, 34, on a $1-million warrant in connection with a methamphetamine lab 
case in that county. The deputies went to a house in the 25800 block of East 
Avenue U in the small desert community of Llano, where Ziepke was believed to 
be living. 
</P>
<P>
 When the deputies arrived, they detected an odor associated with drug labs and 
noticed glassware commonly used in such operations, said Gary Brody, a Los 
Angeles County sheriff's narcotics investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went there to arrest him for their case and stumbled onto this lab," 
Brody said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the house was in Los Angeles County, the San Bernardino deputies 
summoned a narcotics team and hazardous materials technicians from Palmdale, 
who entered a washroom area that had been converted into a lab, Brody said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies seized several ounces of material they believe to be methamphetamine, 
plus an assault rifle and a semi-automatic handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziepke was arrested by the San Bernardino deputies. Los Angeles County 
investigators arrested another man living at the house, Dwayne Calkins, 28. 
After further investigation, Los Angeles County authorities also arrested 
Calkins' wife, Deborah Calkins, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 A deputy district attorney in Lancaster on Wednesday charged the three 
residents with manufacturing methamphetamine, possession of the materials used 
to make the drug, possession of methamphetamine for sale and possession of 
loaded firearms when illegal drugs are present. 
</P>
<P>
 Bail for each of the three suspects was set at $150,000, but deputies said 
Ziepke must face charges in San Bernardino County prior to the Los Angeles 
County case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mick Kelleher, a narcotics investigator in Palmdale, said 
methamphetamine labs are often found in the Antelope Valley because it has many 
remote locations where the drug can be manufactured without being detected by 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Llano lab was inside a two-bedroom house with no other dwellings nearby, 
Kelleher said. "There's no street signs, no landmarks out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigator said other arrests may occur soon, stemming from the raid on 
the lab. "We believe there's other money behind it, and other dealers working 
with them," Kelleher said. "We believe these people weren't working alone."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : CAMARILLO; WOMAN'S DEATH NOT RELATED TO SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The death of a Camarillo woman who suffered a severe asthma attack five days 
after helicopters sprayed malathion near her home was in no way connected to 
the aerial Medfly eradication, a state health official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Barker, 26, who had a lifelong asthma condition that required previous 
trips to the hospital emergency room, died Monday at a Camarillo hospital, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 She had left the area before the malathion spraying began Oct. 12 and returned 
four days later, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason to believe that malathion played a role in this 
unfortunate fatality," said Dr. Richard Kreutzer, a physician and 
epidemiologist with the California Department of Health Services. Kreutzer made 
his findings after examining records and interviewing doctors who attended 
Barker. 
</P>
<P>
 The county coroner's office elected not to perform an autopsy because Barker's 
private physician had signed the death certificate, citing an asthma attack as 
the cause of death, a coroner's official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker's parents, Tim and Mary Ann Barker do not believe their daughter's 
death was connected to the spraying either, said Lisa's sister, Sarah Barker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dad is a farmer and has dealt with malathion for a long time," she said. 
"My sister had a chronic asthma problem, probably since she was about 3." 
</P>
<P>
 But Leonard Mehlmauer, a malathion spraying opponent and a holistic 
practitioner who was treating Lisa Barker, said he believes the malathion may 
have played a role. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker sought Mehlmauer's help to replace her asthma medication with good diet 
and a healthy lifestyle, Mehlmauer said. JOANNA M. MILLER

MAGEE GLAD TO BE BACK IN THE U.S.A.; BASKETBALL: FORMER UC IRVINE STANDOUT IS 
READY TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF HIS SUCCESSFUL 12-YEAR PRO CAREER IN EUROPEAN 
LEAGUES. 
</P>

<P>
 How long has it been since Kevin Magee spent an autumn at home in Southern 
California? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, a very, very long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most exciting time of my life," said the former UC Irvine 
All-American who recently retired after 12 years of playing pro basketball in 
European leagues. "I can't wait to see the leaves turn colors on the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh , Kevin, you might be in for a disappointment there. But you can't deter 
his enthusiasm. He'll settle for watching Buddy Ryan's face turn colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then Monday Night Football," he said. "Isn't Monday Night Football great?" 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years ago, Magee was deeply disappointed that he wasn't a first-round 
pick in the NBA, then hurt when the Phoenix Suns didn't offer him a guaranteed 
contract. He finally decided to take his chances in Verase, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 For 12 years, he fought his crusade in Italy, Spain, Israel and France, and 
has returned home with a capitalist's version of the Holy Grail -- a string of 
investments that will allow him to live a life of leisure. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Magee is a very wealthy man of 35, sending his children off to school, 
having lunch with the contractor who is landscaping his new Rancho Santa 
Margarita home and pondering what to do with his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Magee smiles a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years ago, he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 At UC Irvine, Magee was unstoppable, indefatigable and simply incredible. Game 
after game, he faced special defenses, double- and triple-team schemes and game 
after game, he foiled them. During his two seasons at Irvine, he twice was a 
first-team All-American and twice he was in the top 10 nationally in field-goal 
percentage, scoring and rebounding, a feat never before accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Magee's chances to make it in the NBA, Jerry West said, "He's a 
great rebounder and a tremendous runner and that's what this league is all 
about." In March, 1982, West predicted Magee would be drafted in the first half 
of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months and a less-than-inspired performance in an NBA pre-draft camp 
later, Magee ended up going in the second round, the 39th selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always counted on playing in the NBA, but I really have no regrets," he 
said. "At first, I was hurt that they didn't think I was worth a guaranteed 
contract in the NBA and I thought I got the raw end of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in the NBA, I just would have been another player, another number. In 
Europe, I was almost like a Michael Jordan. I was voted most valuable player 
six times in three different leagues. I won eight rebounding titles in 12 
years. I had an illustrious career." 
</P>
<P>
 Magee made more than $600,000 playing in Paris during his second-to-last 
season. In the mid-1980s, he signed a four-year, $1.2-million deal with Maccabi 
Tel Aviv that included a rent-free, five-bedroom home in an upscale suburb, a 
new car, the hefty tuition for his kids to go to a private American school, 
travel expenses for his family and a clause that paid all foreign taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs the NBA? 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and kids had the chance to experience different countries and 
different cultures," he said. "I did what I wanted to do, I had fun and I made 
a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I wouldn't change nothing about my basketball career." 
</P>
<P>
 The money was always guaranteed, but each move was a bit of a gamble 
nonetheless. Magee usually only had a notion of what he was getting into. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel?" he says, smiling. "I expected nothing but sand and people riding 
camels." 
</P>
<P>
 After a year in Italy, Magee signed a contract with Zaragosa of the Spanish 
League. He and his wife, Melanie, stayed in a hotel for the first two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeremy was 10 months old then," Melanie said, "and we didn't have a 
refrigerator so we either had to keep the formula in the sink or go to the 
kitchen downstairs. It was pretty depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kevin: "We weren't used to being overseas, we both were crying like 
babies all the time. You go to the grocery store, you can't read what anything 
is. You turn on the TV, you can't tell what anyone is saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called Dennis (Harwood, Magee's attorney/agent) and said, 'Get me out of 
this contract. I'll come home and get a job at McDonald's.' I just didn't think 
I could take it. But Dennis told me to just hang in there because it will get 
better. I figured it couldn't get worse. And we hung in there . . . we hung in 
there for 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Magee's next stop was a stint in Israel where he immediately endeared himself 
to the Tel Aviv fans by telling reporters how "damned rude" the people were and 
how bad the food was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin's kind of opinionated," Melanie said, smiling. "The journalists were 
really (angry) when he complained about the food and said the only reason he 
was in their country was to make money for his family." 
</P>
<P>
 Magee tried to explain that "I didn't mean no harm," but his rebounding and 
ability to flash the numbers on the scoreboard did more to soothe the fans' 
anger than his semi-retraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I played a few games, everything changed. But if I had been a (lousy) 
player, they probably would have ran me and my family out of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 The Magees stayed six years and Maccabi played in the European Cup finals 
three times. By the time Magee decided to move on and signed a contract with a 
team in Torino, Italy, one would figure he would be a seasoned traveler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been in the city two weeks and went out to a restaurant with some guys 
from the team," Magee said. "It was only 10 minutes from my apartment, so I 
figured I'd be macho and drive myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left and started driving and driving and suddenly I was outside the city 
limits. I said to myself, 'Let me turn around. If I'm going to be lost, I'm 
going to be lost in Torino.' I didn't have a number to call anybody or anything 
so I just kept driving and driving in circles. It was foggy and cold and it was 
scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, about two hours later, I made it back home. And for a month 
afterward, I didn't go anywhere without somebody who knew their way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how good of a college player was Kevin Magee? That depends on who you 
ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Pick your favorite hyperbole: 
</P>
<P>
 * During his first season at Irvine, the Anteaters played Texas A&M, which 
featured a towering front line called "The Wall." Magee went over it like a low 
hurdle. He scored 31 points and grabbed 14 rebounds in a 91-74 upset. "It was 
like a man came into the YMCA to play with the boys," A&M Coach Shelby Metcalf 
said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bill (Mulligan, then Irvine's coach) would call timeout at a crucial spot," 
said Chapman Coach Mike Bokosky, then an Anteater assistant. "Maybe we'd make a 
little adjustment, Simple-Simon stuff, and then Bill would grab Kevin with both 
arms on his shoulders and look straight in his eyes and say, 'Kevin, go 
dominate.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And Kevin would go back out, grab a rebound, dunk on somebody, run the floor, 
block a shot, run the floor, catch it back and finish. And then he'd run by the 
bench and look at us like, 'Is that enough?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * "I've played with and against a lot of big guys who went on to play in the 
NBA, (Bob) Thornton, (Johnny) Rodgers, (Tod) Murphy and others, and I always 
thought Kevin was the best," said Mark Spinn, a teammate at Irvine. "The rule 
in pick-up games was simple: The team that got Kevin won. If you needed a 
bucket, you dumped the ball into him and he scored. It was that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, they set up this game between some Irvine alumni and the 
South high school all-star team. There were seven of us who showed up, 
including Kevin and Wayne Englestad. I was talking to one of the (high school) 
coaches before the game and he said, 'Gee, only seven guys, I hope you guys can 
give us a decent game because we're really going to be running up and down.' I 
couldn't help but laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we beat them like 160-108 or something and Kevin had about 80." 
</P>
<P>
 * "I've got a player now," said Mulligan, who coaches at Irvine Valley 
College, "who is 6-11, can run the floor like you've never seen and shoot three 
pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a chance to be as good as Kevin. If he had Kevin's heart, he could be 
better than Kevin. But I don't think anyone will have Kevin's heart." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, when Mulligan was coaching at Saddleback College, he took under his 
wing a 255-pound steel worker from Mississippi on recommendation from a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 In two seasons, Saddleback lost only twice with Magee in the lineup, in the 
State semifinals and final. When Mulligan took the coaching job at UC Irvine, 
Magee went with him. It is a fusion of loyalty that has never waned. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man is like a father to me," Magee said. "I love him. I would do 
anything for him. I would dedicate my life to this man. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made me a man, made me accept responsibility and I love him for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Magee was the fourth of six children born to Willie and Ina Mae Magee in the 
Ivanhoe Projects of Gary, Ind. When Magee was 12, some gang members tried to 
persuade one of his older brothers to join, at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie moved his family to Magnolia, Miss., for safety reasons, but he stayed 
in Gary to keep his well-paying union job in the steel mill. 
</P>
<P>
 In their back yard in Magnolia, the Magee boys cleared a spot of dirt, punched 
a hole in the bottom of a metal wash basin and hung it on a fence post. By the 
time he attended South Pike High, basketball was second nature for Kevin Magee. 
</P>
<P>
 The college recruiters came and were duly impressed, but Magee -- something of 
a momma's boy -- decided on Southeastern Louisiana, just 40 miles from home. 
Still homesick, he came home every day. After three months, he came home and 
never went back. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a three-week stay at the University of Houston before he was back 
home working at a lumber mill. The late Jack Holly, then coach at College of 
the Ozarks in Clarksville, Ark., persuaded Magee to give college basketball 
another try. Holly liked Magee, but Magee didn't like the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a call to Mulligan. Seems Magee had a sister in Oceanside and 
thought he might like California. Mulligan says the first time he saw him, 
Magee was nailing jumpers while wearing work boots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't rich, that's for sure," Magee said, "but I did have a pair of gym 
shoes. The point is, my career was going down the drain and the man saved my 
career. I wouldn't be where I am today without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a breath of fresh air for me. He was understanding and fair. He may 
have shot from the hip sometimes, maybe you didn't want to hear what he had to 
say, but he was always honest with me. And that's all you can ask from a coach 
. . . or anybody for that matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan can't help but shake his head when Magee suggests he is responsible 
for his success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin says that stuff about me, but it's really the other way around," 
Mulligan said. "Kevin got me the job at Irvine. Kevin built the Bren Center. I 
owe a great deal to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's campus arena carries the name of the man who donated much of the 
money to build it, but Mulligan still calls it the "house that Kevin built." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine officials may not be ready to concede that, but on Saturday, Feb. 4, 
during a game against New Mexico State, Irvine will officially retire No. 44, 
"the number of the best player ever to play at UC Irvine," according to Coach 
Rod Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to hang a banner up in the rafters, just like Boston Garden," 
Magee said, beaming. "That's gonna be great." 
</P>
<P>
 Each morning, Magee runs four laps around Lake Santa Margarita -- 4.4 miles -- 
and about once a week he shows up at a South County gym and wows the gym rats 
in a pickup game. 
</P>
<P>
 At 216 pounds, the 6-foot-8 Magee looks as fit as ever, but he doesn't have 
any regrets about his decision to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired of being overseas and the last couple of years Melanie and the 
kids weren't with me because the kids wanted to stay in school here," Magee 
said. "But that wasn't really the biggest part. I was getting (angry) all the 
time, upset with my teammates. I just didn't seem to love the game like I used 
to. I was just in it for the paycheck and when you're just in it for the 
paycheck, it's time to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 And Magee has no illusions about a future in coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the patience," he says. "Anyway, I've been playing basketball 
since I was 12 and it's time to do something else. I'm sick of basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Magee is aware that he needs to find something to do. Not the idle type 
and with no interest in golf or most other leisure pastimes -- and an acquired 
aversion to travel -- Magee admits he and Melanie are getting on each other's 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been off since April and I'm going crazy," Magee said. "I've put a 
resume in at Converse, looking for something in sales or promotions. I don't 
want to start my own business yet, because I don't want to throw a lot of money 
into something that two months down the road I might decide I don't want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've got to get out of the house. What's the deal with all these talk 
shows? I told Melanie I'm going to go out and pick up cans if I don't get 
something else to do soon."

HAMELIN WINS ROOKIE AWARD IN LANDSLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Hamelin, who inherited Kansas City's designated hitting job from George 
Brett after spending six seasons in the minor leagues, was an easy winner 
Wednesday as American League rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamelin, a standout at Irvine High, Rancho Santiago and UCLA, was the first 
designated hitter to win the award, and the first Royal since Lou Piniella in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamelin hit 24 home runs, breaking Bo Jackson's Royal rookie record of 22 set 
in 1987, had 65 runs batted in and was batting .282 when the players' strike 
started Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 He also led AL rookies in homers, RBIs, runs (64), hits (88), doubles (25), 
walks (56) and games (101). 
</P>
<P>
 "I did spend quite a few years in the minor leagues," said Hamelin, 26, whose 
progress was slowed by back problems. "I definitely paid my dues. That does 
make it a little more rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamelin showed flashes of what was to come in his first season in pro ball, 
leading the Northwest League with 17 homers for Class-A Eugene, after being 
picked by the Royals in the second round of the June 1988 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 After several years of back trouble, he went through an injury-free 1993 and 
hit 29 home runs for triple-A Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamelin made his major league debut in 1993, hitting two home runs in 49 
at-bats. At the time, though, the Royals already were counting on him to take 
over the DH spot left open by Brett's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Hamelin's biggest homer was a two-out, three-run shot in the 
bottom of the 12th inning off Chicago reliever Roberto Hernandez on July 25 for 
a 6-4 victory that kept alive Kansas City's eventual 14-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals closed to within four games of the AL Central-leading White Sox 
when the strike started. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamelin, who also played 24 games at first base, received 25 of 28 first-place 
votes in balloting by the Baseball Writers Assn. of America. He also got three 
second-place votes and totaled 134 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland outfielder Manny Ramirez, who hit .269 with 17 home runs and 60 
RBIs, was runner-up with 44 points. Pitcher Brian Anderson and outfielder Jim 
Edmonds of the Angels finished seventh and eighth.

DUCKS, KINGS JOIN SHARKS WITH TICKET REFUND POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks and Kings announced ticket refund and exchange policies for 
games postponed or canceled by the lockout, joining the San Jose Sharks as the 
first teams to issue policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Though no NHL games have been officially canceled, the league is expected to 
announce some cancellations by the end of the week. A league spokesman also 
said the reconfigured schedule will not extend the playoffs beyond the end of 
June because of potential problems with maintaining adequate ice surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several options for fans who purchased individual game tickets for 
the Ducks or Kings -- holding the tickets to see if games are rescheduled, 
exchanging the tickets at the point of purchase for future home games this 
season or receiving a refund for missed games. Exchanges and refunds are 
available only after the date of the scheduled game, and to receive a refund, 
tickets must be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who purchased Duck tickets by phone through TicketMaster can return 
tickets by writing to TicketMaster/Mighty Ducks, P.O. Box 76838, Los Angeles, 
CA 90005. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck season-ticket holders or mini-plan purchasers can receive a credit toward 
tickets for potential playoff games or 1995-96 season tickets or mini-plans, 
and can also receive a discount of 5% of the amount credited toward the 
purchase of playoff tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with Duck packages who want refunds may request reimbursement on a 
monthly basis as games are postponed or canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 For more Ducks' information: (714) 704-2701. 
</P>
<P>
 King season-ticket holders or purchasers of mini-plans have three choices. For 
those who wish to maintain their priority position, the team will provide a 6% 
interest payment as incentive, including a guarantee that prices for their 
seats will be not be raised next season.  
</P>
<P>
 Or, instead of a refund, subscribers have the option of receiving "Kings 
Dollars" equal to 10% of the total value of their package, as games are 
canceled or missed. "Kings Dollars" can be redeemed for future games, other 
Forum events or Forum concessions, or be used at any of the Slap Shop outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The final choice is a refund for all canceled games in their package. But no 
refunds will be made until all of the games in the first segment -- home games 
1-10 -- are missed.

FETERIK IS UPHOLDING A PASSING TRADITION AT LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Feterik still has a thing or two to learn about being a Los Alamitos 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 You walk onto the field with the linemen, Kevin. It's a tradition, kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgot," Feterik said. "I was so excited that I ran onto the field the 
first game." 
</P>
<P>
 He's young, forgive him. He'll learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, Feterik has this Los Alamitos-quarterback thing down pretty 
good. The torch has been passed and the Griffins are still burning opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik, a junior, stepped into the premier job for the No. 1-ranked team in 
Orange County, and shined. 
</P>
<P>
 He has handled all the pressure and the scrutiny and the notoriety of being 
Los Alamitos' quarterback. He has been so efficient that he's the No. 1-rated 
quarterback in Orange County despite missing 3 1/2 games with a broken hand -- 
his throwing hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik had never started a varsity game before this season. But, oh, was he 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was born to play this position," Coach John Barnes said. "He thrives on 
it. It gives me a real comforting feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes has had it before. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a long, distinguished line, dating to J.T. Snow in 1985. Todd Gragnano, 
Tim Carey, Mike Good and others have followed, all piling up big numbers at 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Feterik. He has thrown for 775 yards and 10 touchdowns in 2 1/2 
games. Not one of his passes has been intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why the Griffins' unbeaten streak keeps stretching -- 41 
games now and counting. It spans four quarterbacks, including sophomore Sean 
Stein, who filled in when Feterik was injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus is on the quarterback here," Feterik said. "Coaches expect me to be 
perfect. I have to know everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially his escorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos' starting linemen have led their quarterback onto the field the 
last three years. Carey knew it. So did Good. Somehow, it slipped Feterik's 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "That started with (lineman) Caleb Kemp," Barnes said. "He said that Carey was 
their little puppy and they had to protect him. Well, Kevin just ran onto the 
field and I thought, 'Hey, come back here and do it right.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only thing Feterik gaffed on in the season opener. He completed 18 
of 20 passes for 276 yards and three touchdowns in the first half. But he broke 
his hand just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost him 3 1/2 games but not momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik threw for 254 yards and four touchdowns in his return and the Griffins 
beat Long Beach Millikan, 56-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just really enjoys being the quarterback here," Barnes said. "He thrives 
on the pressure. It doesn't bother him. He thinks it's neat." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a quality Barnes looks for in quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Alamitos quarterback has thrown for more than 2,400 yards in four of the 
last five seasons. Carey, now at Stanford, threw for 3,397 yards in 1992. Good 
passed for 2,969 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants to know who's my quarterback and how good is he going to be," 
Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 But living up to your predecessor can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being the quarterback at Los Alamitos is not an easy thing," said Good, now 
at Northern Arizona. "You always have eyes watching you and critiquing you." 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik, well versed on the Griffin lineage, knew that going in. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik was called up to the varsity as a freshman for the playoffs and got a 
sideline view of Carey's work. Last season, Feterik was Good's caddie.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming to Los Alamitos games since I was in the fifth grade," 
Feterik said. "I loved watching Gragnano, but I never envisioned being down 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Others did, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Every summer, Barnes spots an incoming freshman, sometimes a couple, during 
his football camp. He usually knows then who will be his quarterback in years 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik was tabbed, though he didn't know it. He guided the freshman team to a 
9-1 record, losing only to Esperanza, but he was not prepared for the 
anointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched Carey throw and everything was a perfect spiral," Feterik said. "I 
remember thinking I wasn't going to be half as good as this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the training began. Barnes has lunch with his quarterbacks four days a 
week during the off-season. Twice a week, they work on throwing technique. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so prepared," Feterik said. "Our practices are like games." 
</P>
<P>
 Tougher, even. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of coaches treat quarterbacks with kid gloves," Barnes said. "You can 
yell at your linemen, but not your quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect my quarterbacks to be perfect. If they make a mistake, I yell at 
them just like I would a lineman who missed a block. If they can't take my 
pressure in practice, they can't take the pressure of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 It works, even if the number of proteges dwindles. Los Alamitos has only three 
quarterbacks in the entire program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be every kid wanted to be a quarterback," Barnes said. "Now it's 
like if they don't think they can measure up, they want to play some other 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 But Feterik was a survivor. He was ready to be the quarterback and all that it 
entailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barnes: "It's starting to get to the point where the kids who come here 
remember watching Gragnano play. They saw Mike Good and Tim Carey and want to 
be just like them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin was prepared for this. I bet there's some kid who comes to our games 
who wants to be just like Kevin Feterik." LOS ALAMITOS VS. EDISON

KEEPING TRACK / JASON REID: GONZALEZ FOOTLOOSE AFTER FIRST SCORE AT CAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Gonzalez admittedly looked silly, downright foolish, he quickly adds, but 
he couldn't have cared less. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, California's freshman tight end, caught a four-yard touchdown pass 
from quarterback Dave Barr against visiting UCLA on Oct. 8 and jumped, yelled, 
flexed, etc., in celebration while clutching the football and flashing that 
grin of success Huntington Beach High football/basketball fans know so well. It 
was touchdown No. 1 of Gonzalez's collegiate career and the first of the 
afternoon, sparking Cal's 26-7 Pacific 10 Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually not the type for flamboyant displays, Gonzalez felt he owed himself 
this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was just looking at me and laughing," Gonzalez said. "I was just 
hoping to play when I got here, I never even thought about (scoring a 
touchdown) so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just incredible. It was so cool." 
</P>
<P>
 That assessment also applies to Gonzalez's first year at Cal, he says. So far, 
college life in Berkeley has been more than he told himself it would be, which 
means things are going according to plan. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Gonzalez, 18, is a big-time pessimist. He enters every situation 
counting on the worst -- but usually winds up with the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I look at things and always think they're going to be negative," 
Gonzalez said. "That way, I can hope for the best. It usually works out." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is one guy you wouldn't figure ever had negative vibes. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 6 feet 6 and 230 pounds, and he can do just about whatever he wants on a 
football field or basketball court. He was the object of most Division I 
recruiters' interest in both sports, and on the wish lists of those who knew 
they didn't have a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 As an Oiler senior last season, Gonzalez shared The Times Orange County player 
of the year award in football with Chris Draft of Valencia. Gonzalez caught 63 
passes for 950 yards and scored 14 touchdowns, and led Huntington Beach with 
131 tackles while playing inside linebacker. He also was all-county as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as skilled, if not more, on the hardwood, Gonzalez finished second in the 
county in scoring with an average of 25.3 points. He averaged 9.3 rebounds and 
completed his all-county double-double. 
</P>
<P>
 After wading through more mail last year than some small towns receive in the 
same span, Gonzalez decided to allow Cal to pay for his college education. The 
football and basketball teams split the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's stats (five catches, 31 yards, one touchdown) are modest, but he 
shares the starting tight end spot as a true freshman for the Bears (3-3), 
definitely an accomplishment worth writing home about. Gonzalez sat out the 
team's first game while recovering from an injury he suffered to his right knee 
in the Orange County North-South All-Star game July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 He wears a knee brace as a precautionary measure, but has suffered no 
lingering effects from the injury. In fact, his position coach is surprised by 
his smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest concern was the time factor," Cal tight end coach Scott Auker 
said. "He had to miss all of training camp, so we weren't sure if the knee 
would come around in time for us to get him up to speed to play in this league. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he came in and worked really hard, and he's feeling more comfortable 
every week with what we're doing on offense. He's a talented, talented young 
man who has unlimited potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, though, admits his transition has not been bump-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowds are incredible," he said. "I'm used to like 5,000 people at high 
school games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get crowds of 30,000, 50,000. When you look up there and see all those 
people, well, it takes some time to get used to." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a safe bet this, too, will work out in Gonzalez's favor. 
</P>

 Brad Saindon walked into the Laguna Beach High gym, looked at the player he 
had traveled from Colorado to see play and wondered with disgust if he could 
catch an earlier flight back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Saindon, women's volleyball coach at Colorado, traveled to the county in 1992 
to recruit Rachel Wacholder, a player whose exploits, he heard, placed her 
among the nation's elite high school volleyball players. 
</P>
<P>
 But what Saindon initially viewed almost made him sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was so small and unassuming," Saindon said, "I thought I flew out there 
for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Wacholder's play, however, quickly changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first ball I saw her spike was incredible," Saindon said. "I knew right 
there she is a great volleyball player." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Wacholder, 19, is a sophomore outsider hitter and starter at Colorado. 
And despite her size (5-9), Wacholder is still convincing people she is for 
real. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really hear much about my height anymore," she said. "I'm not the 
tallest person, and I don't look very strong, but I don't think that really 
matters as long as I can do the same things someone really tall can." 
</P>
<P>
 There's little Wacholder can't do on a volleyball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Wacholder was The Times Orange County player of the year two consecutive 
seasons (1991-92), and left Laguna Beach with more trophies, certificates and 
plaques than a lot of taller girls. But, still, some people wondered whether 
she could cut it at a major Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
 Saindon was one of the few without doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can play this game," he said. "I wasn't worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Wacholder rewarded her coach's faith with a solid freshman season, helping 
Colorado win the Big Eight title. She was a key contributor in relief at 
outside hitter as the Buffaloes finished 26-6, 11-1 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Wacholder moved into the starting lineup this season. Colorado (13-4, 5-0) is 
again rolling, thanks in part to Wacholder. 
</P>
<P>
 And she wouldn't rather be anyplace else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it here," she said. "I lived in Laguna (Beach) my whole life, so 
getting out of California was really good for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to grow up and be on my own. I'm really happy." 
</P>

<P>
 Lisa McNamee, The Times Orange County girls' basketball coach of the year in 
1991 and '93, has resigned her post at Costa Mesa High School. 
</P>
<P>
 She has accepted an offer to coach Irvine Valley College's first-year women's 
basketball program, pending approval of the district board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamee, 32, who coached Costa Mesa to the Southern Section Division III-A 
championship and a berth in the State Division III title game in 1993, spent 
two seasons at Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls who played for me were great at Costa Mesa," McNamee said. "It was 
a timing thing, an opportunity to go to the collegiate level came up and I 
jumped at it." 
</P>
<P>
 McNamee coached at Estancia from 1985 to '91. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

MCDONNELL IS LIKELY TO BUILD JET OUTSIDE STATE; AVIATION: LONG BEACH IS CALLED 
TOO COSTLY FOR THE PROPOSED MD-95. DALLAS APPEARS TO HAVE THE INSIDE EDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A McDonnell Douglas executive strongly hinted Wednesday that the company will 
not build its newest commercial airliner in Long Beach, saying California's 
labor and overall business conditions are too costly compared to other 
potential sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is Long Beach, Calif., is not a cost-competitive 
environment," said Herbert J. Lanese, McDonnell's chief financial officer. He 
added in a telephone conference call with reporters: 
</P>
<P>
 "We have customers that not only demand high quality but very low cost. Long 
Beach, both from a labor relations standpoint as well as from a business 
environment standpoint, needs to demonstrate it's as attractive as other places 
we can go, like Dallas and Salt Lake City." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, other sources familiar with McDonnell's search said the company is 
close to selecting an outside contractor in Dallas to assemble the proposed 
100-seat plane, called the MD-95, and that an announcement could come within 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, it would mark the first time in the 74-year history of McDonnell's Long 
Beach-based Douglas Aircraft division that production of one of its commercial 
jetliners was based outside of California. (Douglas has built some jets in 
China under a special program.) 
</P>
<P>
 Placing the MD-95's production in Texas would also deliver another blow to 
California's shellshocked aerospace industry, which has been battered by 
layoffs and plant closures in both the commercial and military markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders at the Long Beach plant greeted the statement with anger, while 
California economic development officials said there appeared to be little the 
state could do to change the firm's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, which builds its MD-80 and MD-90 twin jets and its larger MD-11 
airliner in Long Beach, has been forced to slash its employment there to about 
10,000 from 43,000 in mid-1990. But orders for those planes are expected to 
keep the Long Beach plant open for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has struggled for new orders both because of a slump in the 
commercial aircraft industry and from having a narrower range of planes 
compared to its larger rivals Boeing Co. and Europe's Airbus Industrie. The 
MD-95 would help solve that problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But Douglas has not yet decided whether to produce the twin-engine MD-95. The 
company began soliciting orders in July and is waiting to see whether airlines 
place enough of them to justify launching production. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanese told reporters that Douglas would need more than 50 firm orders before 
it would launch the MD-95, which is expected to sell for $20 million to $25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said Douglas won't build the plane unless it can enlist suppliers and 
other partners to share the plane's $500-million development costs. And he said 
no decision has yet been reached on where to assemble the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources familiar with the negotiations said McDonnell is close to 
announcing that Dalfort Aviation, an aircraft maintenance firm at Dallas' Love 
Field, will build the MD-95, creating jobs for about 2,500 to 3,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalfort owner Bruce Leadbetter declined to comment, but Dallas newspapers in 
recent weeks have reported efforts by Dalfort to secure financial assistance 
from the City Council so the firm can expand its operations and accommodate the 
MD-95 contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Griffith, president of United Aerospace Workers Local 148 in Lakewood, 
the union that represents about 9,000 of the Douglas Long Beach workers, said 
that "we haven't had a lot of hope" that the MD-95 would be built in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith, whose union members earn $19 to $20 an hour on average, acknowledged 
that Douglas can get lower-cost labor elsewhere. But he blasted company 
officials for "abandoning Long Beach and California," saying that "they expect 
loyalty" from employees "but they give none in return." 
</P>
<P>
 California officials attempted to put the best face on what also amounts to a 
huge setback in longstanding efforts to stem the industrial exodus from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Meier Wright, secretary of the California Trade and Commerce Agency, 
said McDonnell "is not running out of California. They don't have the space in 
Long Beach that is equipped." 
</P>
<P>
 The state offered to form a so-called red team, which would have formulated a 
package of incentives to attract the McDonnell project, but the company never 
accepted the offer, Wright said. Without a detailed statement of need, the 
state was in no position to make any offers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, McDonnell said its third-quarter profit rose to $161 million, or 
$4.07 a share, from $142 million, or $3.62 a share, a year earlier. Revenue 
rose to $3.46 billion from $3.43 billion. But operating profit at its 
commercial aircraft group alone fell to $8 million from $14 million.

KARCHER DEALT FINANCIAL SETBACK FROM LOAN RULING; COURTS: FOUNDER OF CARL'S JR. 
MUST PAY BANK $600,000 THAT HE GUARANTEED. BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS ARE POSSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Hamburger mogul Carl N. Karcher could soon be forced to seek bankruptcy 
protection from creditors after a legal setback Wednesday on a lawsuit 
involving the Karcher family trust and a former business partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by National Bank of Long 
Beach regarding a $600,000 real estate loan that Karcher guaranteed in 
connection with a troubled 1991 real estate development in San Bernardino 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Eric E. Younger on Wednesday granted the bank's motion to summarily 
force Karcher to pay back the loan amount, said Gail B. Greenberg, an attorney 
whose firm represented the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher was unavailable for comment on Wednesday, but his personal attorney 
said the decision could push Karcher, 78, toward a bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't get this judgment stayed, Mr. Karcher is going to have to 
seriously consider the option of Chapter 11" bankruptcy proceedings, said 
Andrew Puzder. "But Mr. Karcher remains adamant that he will not have to file 
bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer said that Karcher would ask the State Court of Appeal to reverse 
Younger's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The unfavorable legal decision was the latest in a series of recent 
developments for the fast-food legend who in October, 1993, lost a bitter 
boardroom fight and was forced out as chairman of the company he founded more 
than half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, CKE Restaurants announced that Karcher, now the company's chairman 
emeritus, would return to his cherished role as television pitchman for the 
Carl's Jr. hamburger chain. CKE Restaurants also said it would return the 
chain's marketing focus to quality food rather than competing on lower price -- 
a strategy Karcher long has endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Donald E. Doyle, CKE Restaurants president and chief executive 
officer, said he was resigning to become chief operating officer of Hardee's 
Food Systems Inc., a larger national fast-food chain with headquarters in 
Raleigh, N.C. Karcher and Doyle had been at odds over the chain's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher's finances remain shaky despite his highly publicized debt 
restructuring last year, when a group led by businessman William P. Foley II, 
the current chairman and chief executive of CKE Restaurant, assumed $30 million 
of Karcher's personal debt in exchange for about 30% of CKE Restaurants' 
outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher and his family trust still hold about 1.63 million, or 9% of the 
company's outstanding shares.  
</P>
<P>
 Karcher also has been seeking negotiated settlements with other creditors, 
including National Bank of Long Beach. Failure to reach agreement with any one 
of those creditors "would be major enough to force Mr. Karcher to consider 
options that he doesn't want to consider," Puzder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's court hearing involves a business deal Karcher had with Maurice 
Monnig, 52, a longtime family friend and business associate. The two men were 
involved in a series of troubled real estate deals in the Inland Empire through 
a now-failed company called Monnig Development Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Superior Court suit, National Bank of Long Beach contended 
that Karcher was ultimately responsible to repay the $600,000 development loan 
because he guaranteed it through his family trust. But Karcher unsuccessfully 
argued that his obligation was limited because Monnig and National Bank of Long 
Beach had failed to fully disclose the actual terms of the loan transaction.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: GATES HAS THE CHECKBOOK; CAN HE BALANCE AN 
EMPIRE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just how serious is Microsoft about its future in the multitrillion-dollar 
personal finance marketplace? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," says Scott Cook, who simultaneously became the software juggernaut's 
latest centimillionaire and its first vice president of electronic commerce 
when Microsoft acquired his Intuit for $1.5 billion, "the idea of Microsoft 
buying a bank is kind of loony." That should come as a welcome relief to Alan 
Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, like a bank, Intuit offers a credit card to complement customers 
who use its popular Quicken brand of checkbook software. So when will Microsoft 
credit cards -- replete with frequent-flier, frequent-caller and 
frequent-on-liner tie-ins -- start popping up in people's wallets and purses? 
</P>
<P>
 "Microsoft is not going to have a credit card," insists Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? After all, what's strategic for Intuit and AT&T ought to be at least 
as strategic for Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to support everyone else's credit cards," Cook says. That should come 
as a welcome relief to the folks at Visa and American Express . . . or maybe 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft doesn't enter markets with the goal of becoming a profitable niche 
player; it enters markets with the intent of redefining and dominating them. 
The Intuit acquisition neatly crystallizes Bill Gates' latest intuition: 
peddling client-server software is nice and video games may be good at sucking 
discretionary dollars out of asocial adolescents, but the real money will be 
found in managing money. Personal finance -- not interactive entertainment or 
high-bandwidth groupware -- will be the "killer app" of the next decade, the 
one really useful thing that will get millions of people to buy a new 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, while Microsoft may not become a bank, an insurance company or a 
mutual fund, it is clearly prepared to invest billions to become a new kind of 
financial institution. Microsoft's failures -- despite tremendous resources -- 
to turn its own personal financial software into a market leader have now been 
completely obscured by its ruthlessly pragmatic decision to acquire not only 
Intuit but Scott Cook's vision as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply stated," says Cook, "our goal is to revolutionize how people manage 
their financial lives." 
</P>
<P>
 But how will the Microsoft that dominates desktop operating systems evolve 
into a Microsoft that dominates desktop personal finance? Clearly, the answers 
will be found as much in the networks Microsoft creates as in the software it 
designs. Indeed, it can fairly be said that the evolution of personal finance 
in America over the last 25 years is as much the byproduct of new network 
technologies as the result of deregulating old financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the leadership of Dee Hock in the 1970s, for example, technology enabled 
the regional BankAmericard to be transformed into a global Visa; banks 
collaborated to create a technical standard for credit transactions and 
settlements. The 1980s saw an explosion of automated teller machines -- in no 
small part due to the recognition that networks of ATMs made more sense than 
each bank having its own proprietary technology.  
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, reservation systems like American Airlines' Sabre created new 
kinds of competition in the travel industry that gave a competitive edge to the 
network provider. More recently, mutual funds and banks have begun offering 
touch-tone transactions for their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these technologies have combined and converged to create the 
infrastructures for today's overwhelming array of personal financial services. 
Intriguingly, these network technologies frequently demand new organizational 
structures to manage them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the technical infrastructure for fulfilling Scott Cook's vision of 
revolution does not yet exist. The financial service companies don't yet 
understand software, and the leading on-line service companies don't yet 
understand financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 H&R Block -- which owns CompuServe -- has recently acquired MECA, a leading 
personal finance software house, but it's not clear if and how the two might be 
combined. There's a huge infrastructure gap. That's the marketplace Microsoft 
wants to create, define and dominate. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft, Cook predicts, will become an "honest broker," a digital 
intermediary that will let individuals virtually sample mutual funds, annuities 
and other financial instruments on their personal computers as if they were 
shopping in a financial services mall. "Mall is an old-fashioned metaphor," he 
says, "and I think we need to come up with a better one."  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, picking the right metaphor is Microsoft's real challenge. Cook 
promises that Microsoft will work cooperatively and collaboratively with 
financial service companies to help build this infrastructure. But does 
Microsoft want to become like Visa, coordinating a consortium of hundreds of 
financial institutions? Or does it want to be more like American Airlines' 
Sabre -- a proprietary transactions network? Or does Microsoft expect to set 
the personal financial operating systems standards for Bank of America and 
Citicorp, much as it does computer operating standards for IBM, Compaq and 
thousands of independent software developers? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gates has shown himself to be good at everything except creating the 
kinds of alliances needed to build the personal finance infrastructure. And the 
Justice Department is likely to look askance at any effort to buy the 
infrastructure and control it -- the kind of alliance building Microsoft seems 
to prefer.  
</P>
<P>
 So the question becomes whether Microsoft has really bought into Scott Cook's 
more cooperative vision and plans to let him implement it -- or whether the 
software giant really is, as its rivals insist, seeking nothing less than world 
domination.

 The nation's trade deficit dropped nearly 13% in August to $9.74 billion, as a 
shrinking trade imbalance with Western Europe offset record imports from Japan 
and China, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Increases in the export of aircraft, autos, tobacco, semiconductors and 
industrial machinery pushed U.S. exports to a record high. The total August 
deficit in goods and services was an improvement over the revised 
$11.19-billion shortfall in July, the second-worst trade gap ever. The drop in 
the deficit was the first since a 1.6% decline in October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength of American trade was notable in relation to Western Europe, 
whose nations are slowly pulling out of a punishing recession. U.S. exports 
there grew and imports fell. "We did a very good job in selling goods abroad," 
said Larry Moran, a research economist at the Commerce Department's Bureau of 
Economic Analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts pointed out that 1994 continues to be a bad trade year for the 
United States, which is importing far more than it exports, particularly now 
that the U.S. economy is growing strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first eight months of the year, the trade deficit was running at an 
annual rate of $147.4 billion. The record is $152.1 billion, set in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the trade deficit with Japan, one of the United States' major 
trading partners, soared to its third-highest level ever, mainly because 
Americans continue to import and buy large numbers of Japanese cars. The growth 
was also tied to the strength of the yen against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our economies are in quite different stages of the business cycle," said 
Robert Z. Lawrence, a professor of international trade at Harvard University's 
Kennedy School of Government. "We are growing rapidly, and they are not. . . . 
That clouds the question of whether or not they are becoming more open." 
</P>
<P>
 As for China, whose economy continues to blossom, it is sending a record 
volume of goods to a voracious U.S. market, including toys and apparel, while 
buying relatively little, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, investors who worried that the August trade figures indicate 
the nation's economy is running too hot sent yields on the benchmark 30-year 
Treasury bond up to 7.89% from Tuesday's 7.86%. But the Dow Jones industrial 
average closed up 18.50 points at 3,936.04. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade deficit with Japan rose in August to $5.8 billion from $5.7 billion 
in July and prompted a renewed call by U.S. auto makers for Japan to live up to 
its commitments to open its markets.  
</P>
<P>
 "Without a doubt, we are headed for a record deficit in automotive trade with 
Japan this year, despite the effects of the strong yen and improved 
competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry," Andrew H. Card Jr., president of 
the American Automobile Manufacturing Assn., said in a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Imports of goods from Japan reached a record $10.67 billion, surpassing the 
$10.6 billion reached in March. Auto imports accounted for more than half the 
increase, said Haydn R. Mearkle, assistant chief of the foreign trade division 
of the Commerce Department's Bureau of the Census. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in imports more than offset an increase in U.S. exports of goods to 
Japan, which climbed to $4.87 billion from $4.37 billion. Much of the increase 
was in the form of aircraft exports. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be months, if then, before the trade figures reflect the effects of 
the recent agreement between Washington and Tokyo on opening Japanese markets 
in telecommunications and medical equipment, government procurement and other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation was different in Western Europe, where the trade deficit shrank 
to $1.62 billion in August from $2.37 billion in July. Imports from Europe fell 
3.1% to $10.7 billion; exports rose 4.6% to $9.1 billion. The Commerce 
Department provided no details of either. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts attributed the performance to improved financial conditions on 
the Continent. "Europe is on the road to recovery, so exports are starting to 
pick up and may explain why there's a better balance there," said Cynthia 
Latta, senior financial economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. deficit with China rose a whopping 21.3% to $3.24 billion in August, 
one of the highest deficits with a nation other than Japan. Imports grew to 
$4.15 billion in August from $3.64 billion in July, reflecting a wide variety 
of goods, including toys and apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 A decrease in U.S. fertilizer shipments to China, meanwhile, offset an 
increase in aircraft exports and contributed to a drop in overall exports, to 
$919 million from $971 million in July. U.S. Trade Picture Improves 
</P>
<P>
 Month-by-month changes in the government's new trade report, which includes 
trade in services as well as goods. The charts track the overall deficit, the 
deficit in goods and the surplus in services, in billions of dollars: 
</P>
<P>
 OVERALL DEFICIT: -9.74 
</P>
<P>
 DEFICIT IN GOODS: -14.30 
</P>
<P>
 SURPLUS IN SERVICES: +4.56

MCDONNELL LIKELY TO BUILD JET OUTSIDE STATE; AVIATION: LONG BEACH CALLED TOO 
COSTLY FOR PROPOSED MD-95. MOVE WOULD MARK DOUGLAS UNIT'S FIRST FORAY FROM 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A McDonnell Douglas executive strongly hinted Wednesday that the company will 
not build its newest commercial airliner in Long Beach, saying California's 
labor and overall business conditions are too costly compared to other 
potential sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is Long Beach, Calif., is not a cost-competitive 
environment," said Herbert J. Lanese, McDonnell's chief financial officer. He 
added in a telephone conference call with reporters: 
</P>
<P>
 "We have customers that not only demand high quality but very low cost. Long 
Beach, both from a labor relations standpoint as well as from a business 
environment standpoint, needs to demonstrate it's as attractive as other places 
we can go, like Dallas and Salt Lake City." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, other sources familiar with McDonnell's search said the company is 
close to selecting an outside contractor in Dallas to assemble the proposed 
100-seat plane, called the MD-95, and that an announcement could come within 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, it would mark the first time in the 74-year history of McDonnell's Long 
Beach-based Douglas Aircraft division that production of one of its commercial 
jetliners was based outside of California. (Douglas has built some jets in 
China under a special program.) 
</P>
<P>
 Placing the MD-95's production in Texas would also deliver another blow to 
California's shellshocked aerospace industry, which has been battered by 
layoffs and plant closures in both the commercial and military markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders at the Long Beach plant greeted the statement with anger, while 
California economic development officials said there appeared to be little the 
state could do to change the firm's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, which builds its MD-80 and MD-90 twin jets and its larger MD-11 
airliner in Long Beach, has been forced to slash its employment there to about 
10,000 from 43,000 in mid-1990. But orders for those planes are expected to 
keep the Long Beach plant open for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has struggled for new orders both because of a slump in the 
commercial aircraft industry and from having a narrower range of planes 
compared to its larger rivals Boeing Co. and Europe's Airbus Industrie. The 
MD-95 would help solve that problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But Douglas has not yet decided whether to produce the twin-engine MD-95. The 
company began soliciting orders in July and is waiting to see whether airlines 
place enough of them to justify launching production. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanese told reporters that Douglas would need more than 50 firm orders before 
it would launch the MD-95, which is expected to sell for $20 million to $25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said Douglas won't build the plane unless it can enlist suppliers and 
other partners to share the plane's $500-million development costs. And he said 
no decision has yet been reached on where to assemble the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources familiar with the negotiations said McDonnell is close to 
announcing that Dalfort Aviation, an aircraft maintenance firm at Dallas' Love 
Field, will build the MD-95, creating jobs for about 2,500 to 3,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalfort owner Bruce Leadbetter declined to comment, but Dallas newspapers in 
recent weeks have reported efforts by Dalfort to secure financial assistance 
from the City Council so the firm can expand its operations and accommodate the 
MD-95 contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Griffith, president of United Aerospace Workers Local 148 in Lakewood, 
the union that represents about 9,000 of the Douglas Long Beach workers, said 
that "we haven't had a lot of hope" that the MD-95 would be built in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith, whose union members earn $19 to $20 an hour on average, acknowledged 
that Douglas can get lower-cost labor elsewhere. But he blasted company 
officials for "abandoning Long Beach and California," saying that "they expect 
loyalty" from employees "but they give none in return." 
</P>
<P>
 California officials attempted to put the best face on what also amounts to a 
huge setback in longstanding efforts to stem the industrial exodus from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Meier Wright, secretary of the California Trade and Commerce Agency, 
said McDonnell "is not running out of California. They don't have the space in 
Long Beach that is equipped."

WASSERMAN AND SHEINBERG: THE CLOCK IS TICKING; HOLLYWOOD: BOTH COULD LEAVE MCA 
NEXT YEAR IN FEUD WITH MATSUSHITA. IT WOULD DEAL A SERIOUS BLOW TO JAPANESE 
PARENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An inconclusive meeting in San Francisco with their Japanese bosses heightened 
a Hollywood drama Wednesday for MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman and MCA President 
Sidney J. Sheinberg, as the two venerable executives faced the prospect of 
ending their long careers at the entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
 After the two sides returned to Los Angeles and Tokyo from five hours of 
secret talks Tuesday, officials at Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. held out 
the possibility of further meetings to resolve a dispute over strategic control 
of MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 But the clock is running for Wasserman and Sheinberg, not only on their 
contracts -- due to expire in late 1995 -- but more immediately on their 
business association with music mogul David Geffen and filmmaker Steven 
Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Without clear assurances that Sheinberg will remain at MCA, Geffen and 
Spielberg and former Walt Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg have declared 
that they won't affiliate their much-anticipated new film studio with MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 And the absence of the talent-laden threesome would deal a serious blow to 
Matsushita, which acquired MCA for $6.6 billion in 1990 but whose oversight of 
the company has caused Wasserman and Sheinberg to chafe ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in building our studio from scratch, and if Sid and Lew are 
there (at MCA), we intend to be allied with them," Geffen reiterated Wednesday. 
"If they are not there, we will not be there." 
</P>
<P>
 According to some news reports from Japan, the MCA executives were rebuffed 
Tuesday at a meeting in San Francisco when they requested total control in 
running the entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, Matsushita spokesman Setsuo Mizoguchi said merely that "the 
meeting produced little," but added that "the issue has yet to be resolved, 
possibly through further meetings in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources say there is still an outside chance that Matsushita will decide 
to sell a minority stake in MCA, or the entire company. In an auction, however, 
the company could slip from the grasp of Wasserman and Sheinberg to a higher 
bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So unless the Japanese relent on the issue of control, Hollywood observers 
suspect, the Wasserman-Sheinberg era could conclude next year, ending one of 
the town's longest-running dynasties at a major studio. Wasserman, 81, has 
served as MCA's chief executive since 1946, and Sheinberg, 59, has been chief 
operating officer for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men reiterated their tough positions Wednesday. Sheinberg, reached by 
telephone Wednesday, said tersely, "If (the problems) cannot be resolved, I've 
told them I'm not re-signing" a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Wasserman said, "They have asked me to sign a new five-year 
contract at the end of '95 and I have not agreed." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman's failure to agree to a new five-year contract was apparently the 
basis for a news report from Tokyo on Wednesday that Matsushita had accepted 
Wasserman's "resignation." That was flatly denied by a Wasserman aide, who 
added that the executive has not decided whether to sign a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman declined to discuss the meeting or its outcome other than to say, 
"Keep your options open; that is the password." 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the two argued for total control at MCA in order to allow 
them to manage the asset more successfully for the Japanese owners -- but they 
did not propose to buy financial control. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a normal industrial situation," one MCA insider said, contending 
that the cultural differences between the Japanese industrial concern and its 
U.S. entertainment operation have fueled the unorthodox push for control by 
MCA's top brass. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, both men are said to be distressed by events that led to the 
meeting, and the resulting distraction to MCA's work force headquartered in 
Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three years, MCA has been curbed by Matsushita in its efforts to 
acquire Virgin Records or a stake in a broadcast network, and it has even been 
limited in the scope of its plans to build a theme park in Osaka, Japan, where 
Matsushita is located. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't take a company and leave it in suspended animation," said one MCA 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wasserman and Sheinberg depart, no one is certain who the Japanese would 
enlist to run the giant conglomerate. As one possible candidate warned: "The 
problems don't go away simply because you change the management." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Hollywood observers suggest that Matsushita might promote Tom Pollock 
or Charles S. Paul, currently MCA executive vice presidents who are said to be 
close to the Japanese. However, Paul and Pollock are also described as 
intensely loyal to Sheinberg, who brought both executives to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation also centers on QVC Chairman Barry Diller, who was thwarted over 
the past year in a hostile takeover attempt of Paramount and a merger between 
QVC and CBS in which he would have emerged as chief executive. People who know 
Diller do not believe, however, that he would work for the Japanese, which 
means he would have to enlist with a backer to mount a bid for the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible backer: the acquisitive John C. Malone, who heads Denver-based 
cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc.

KOLL MOVES UP WITH THOMPSON CO. BUYOUT; DEVELOPMENT: REAL ESTATE GROUP MAKES 
FIRST BIG PUSH INTO HOME BUILDING. MOST ANALYSTS PRAISE O.C. FIRMS' MERGER BUT 
SAY INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS FORCED IT.

 Koll Real Estate Group Inc., making its first major push into home building, 
on Wednesday agreed to buy Kathryn G. Thompson Co., a prominent Orange County 
home builder, for about $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the privately held home construction company, Kathryn Thompson 
and her partner, former Koll Co. executive J. Harold Street, are to receive 
$1.7 million in cash, 2 million shares of newly issued Koll Real Estate Group 
stock and a chance to buy an additional 2 million shares. Koll Real Estate also 
assumed nearly $5 million of Kathryn G. Thompson Co.'s debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition is a perfect fit for the two companies, said Thompson: "I've 
known Don (Koll, chairman of Koll Co.) for a number of years. . . . Koll is 
commercial, we're residential -- it's a wonderful blend." 
</P>
<P>
 Local real estate analysts generally praised the merger but said it indicated 
how increasingly competitive Southern California's home building industry has 
become. Smaller, regional builders, including Thompson, have found it difficult 
to obtain sufficient capital to compete with large public builders, such as Los 
Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad, California's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal calls for Thompson, 53, to remain chairman and chief executive of the 
Aliso Viejo-based building company, which will retain the Kathryn G. Thompson 
Co. name as a Koll subsidiary. The company has erected 8,000 homes and 
condominiums. Thompson also will become a director of Koll Real Estate, which 
is 15% owned by the management of the Koll Co., a privately held commercial 
developer in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson will help Koll Real Estate develop its large landholdings, which 
include 1,200 acres of the Bolsa Chica wetlands, a controversial coastal 
property near Huntington Beach and 870 acres already zoned for more than 550 
homes in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, which will build mostly entry-level homes priced below $200,000, 
brings to the deal partnership interests in a 230-acre project in Aliso Viejo 
where 1,435 homes are planned, and a 92-unit development under construction in 
Oceanside. At least one Thompson project, the Vistas, a 119-unit condominium 
project in Aliso Viejo, is not part of the deal because construction has 
already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathryn and her company bring to KREG expertise in residential design, 
regulatory approval, construction and marketing," said Donald M. Koll, Koll Co. 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Republican activist, Thompson attracted controversy for actively 
campaigning for Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992. Thompson started her first real 
estate company in 1967 and established her current residential development 
company in 1985. In 1991, she became the first woman home builder voted into 
the California Building Industry Hall of Fame. She is also a major figure in 
Orange County's arts and charity community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Real Estate deal "makes a lot of sense," said Al Gobar, a 
Placentia-based real estate analyst, because it gives Thompson's company access 
to capital and expands its geographic scope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financing is critical for home building today and publicly traded companies 
have better access to capital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the acquisition was announced after the markets closed, Koll Real 
Estate Group stock fell 3.13 cents to 31.25 cents in Nasdaq trading Wednesday. 
In August, the company reported a second-quarter loss of $4.5 million, or 11 
cents a share, compared to a loss of $3.5 million, or 9 cents, a share a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 To close the deal, Ray Pacini, chief financial officer of Koll Real Estate, 
said his company agreed to provide Thompson and her partner with warrants that 
allow them to eventually buy 2 million additional Koll Real Estate Group shares 
at 25 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the county and the state come out of the recession, the home-building 
industry represents a very good opportunity for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacini said that given Koll Real Estate's extensive landholdings, discussions 
with other home builders are continuing and his company might buy another 
residential builder by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interesting launching platform for Koll into this buoyant Orange 
County home-building market. Their timing is excellent," said Kenneth Agid, 
president of the Marketing Department, an Irvine real estate consulting firm.

 Marvel Entertainment President Quits: The company confirmed that Bruce Stein 
resigned over differences over the company's operating and management style.The 
Wall Street Journal previously reported that Stein disagreed with the toy, 
comic book and licensing company's hiring policies. The Journal said Stein 
wanted to bring in his own management team but that those plans were rejected 
by executives of Toy Biz, one of Marvel's licensees. Stein joined Marvel after 
leaving toy maker Hasbro Inc. in June. Stein had been the head of Hasbro's 
Kenner Products division, which includes Nerf products and Jurassic Park toys. 
Marvel said Stein's duties will be taken over by Chief Executive William Bevins 
Jr.

 Chrysler Plans Joint Venture in Vietnam: The auto maker, seeking to expand 
into new markets, said it hopes to build Jeeps, trucks and other vehicles in 
the country.The deal, expected to be formalized in a few months, would make 
Chrysler Corp. the first U.S. car maker to establish assembly operations in 
Vietnam, a relatively poor country with unknown potential. Chrysler officials 
said the company will probably start out with exports from North America, 
followed by assembly of import kits and eventually a full-fledged manufacturing 
operation. Earlier this month, Ford Motor Co. announced plans to open showrooms 
and service facilities in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon).

KOLL REAL ESTATE TO TAKE OVER HOME BUILDER; DEVELOPMENT: BUYING KATHRYN G. 
THOMPSON CO. WILL AID IN CONSTRUCTION OF MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.

 Koll Real Estate Group, making its first major push into home building, agreed 
Wednesday to buy Kathryn G. Thompson Co., a prominent Orange County home 
builder, for about $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for her privately held home construction company, which has built 
8,000 homes and condominiums, Kathryn Thompson and her partner, former Koll Co. 
executive J. Harold Street, will receive $1.7 million in cash, 2 million shares 
of newly issued Koll Real Estate Group stock and warrants for an additional 2 
million shares.Koll Real Estate will also assume nearly $5 million of Kathryn 
Thompson Co. debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, Thompson, 53, will remain chairman and chief 
executive of the Aliso Viejo-based subsidiary, which will retain the Kathryn G. 
Thompson name. Thompson will also become a director of Koll Real Estate, which 
is 15%-owned by the management of Koll Co., a developer in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson will help Koll Real Estate develop its large landholdings, which 
include 1,200 acres of controversial coastal property near Huntington Beach 
known as the Bolsa Chica wetlands and 870 acres already zoned for more than 550 
homes in northern San Diego County. The company will build mostly entry-level 
homes priced below $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition, which includes partnership interests in a 230-acre project in 
Aliso Viejo where 1,435 homes are planned, is a perfect fit for the two 
companies, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Don for a number of years. . . . Koll is commercial, we're 
residential -- it's a wonderful blend," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, a longtime Republican activist, attracted attention in 1992 for her 
open support of Democrat Bill Clinton.

CONSUMERS UNION BACKS SUIT OVER INVESTMENT; BANKING: GROUP HOPES ACTION AGAINST 
GREAT WESTERN WILL IMPROVE DISCLOSURE ON FUND RISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's largest consumer advocacy group Wednesday threw its weight behind 
a lawsuit filed by an elderly Santa Monica widow, who claims she lost $8,000 
after a mutual fund salesman at her bank wrongfully led her to believe that the 
value of her shares was insured by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing at a press conference announcing the lawsuit, Consumers Union 
attorney Gail Hillebrand said she hopes that 94-year-old Ruby Rosenthal's 
action against Great Western Bank will force lenders to do a better job of 
evaluating their customers' financial situation before "selling them a mutual 
fund that they shouldn't be in." 
</P>
<P>
 "Financial institutions are aggressively marketing mutual funds to their 
customers, but they're not doing a good job of explaining all the risks," 
Hillebrand said. "Maybe this (lawsuit) will encourage them to do better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,500 U.S. banks now sell mutual funds, and the amount of money flowing 
into those funds has been growing at a 40% annual rate -- nearly twice as fast 
as the fund industry in general. Regulators are now studying whether those 
financial institutions are fully disclosing the risks to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators and consumer groups are particularly concerned that longtime bank 
customers -- many of whom, like Rosenthal, have never invested in a mutual fund 
before -- mistakenly believe that the value of the funds cannot drop, or that 
any losses would be covered by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Although deposits at most banks and thrifts are insured for up to $100,000, 
mutual fund investments that are offered by those same institutions have no 
such a guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal's suit, filed by Pasadena attorney Michael Linfield, claims the 
widow invested $60,000 after visiting a broker in the Great Western branch 
where she had banked for the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit claims the broker told Rosenthal that she could double the return she 
was earning on her $60,000 certificate of deposit by investing the money in 
"U.S. Government securities." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rosenthal's mutual fund invested in government-backed securities, the 
value of her shares in the fund dropped by about $8,000 when interest rates 
rose. Only then did she realize that the investment was not risk-free, her suit 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 She soon closed the account, she said, "because I lived through the Depression 
. . . and I was afraid I was going to go to the poor house" if the value of her 
investment fell further. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Linfield said he'll ask a judge for an injunction to stop Great 
Western "from misleading investors," and to award Rosenthal "millions and 
millions" of dollars in punitive damages. He might also ask the court to give 
the suit "class status," which would allow him to represent other consumers who 
have lost money after purchasing mutual funds through the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 William C. Tak, the Great Western broker who sold Rosenthal the mutual fund 
investment, was unavailable for comment. But Brian Cerini, who heads Great 
Western's brokerage unit, said he had discussed Rosenthal's complaint with Tak, 
and that Tak had said the risks of investing in the fund were completely 
explained to both Rosenthal and a nephew of hers who had accompanied her on 
visits to the branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Rosenthal was well informed about the investment that was presented to 
her," Cerini said, adding that she had also signed a statement acknowledging 
that the investment was not insured.

ALTERNATIVE FUELS SHINE IN U.S. STUDY; ENERGY: TESTING SHOWS THEY BURN CLEANER 
THAN REFORMULATED GASOLINE TOUTED BY THE OIL INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the most extensive comparison yet, natural gas, methanol, propane and 
electricity are indeed cleaner-burning vehicle fuels than even improved forms 
of gasoline, according to preliminary results of a federal study to be released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the oil industry have maintained that gasoline reformulated to be 
cleaner-burning -- which will be required in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities 
beginning in January -- can provide much the same emissions reductions as most 
alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when you talk to the oil companies, they say that reformulated 
gasoline is as good as the alternatives," said Cindy Sullivan, technology 
advancement program supervisor for the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. The study "confirms that alternative fuels do have emissions benefits 
over gasoline, even reformulated gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
 The other key early finding: All the alternatives provided performance that 
allows specific uses in everyday fleet work. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year, $10-million study -- called "CleanFleet" -- involved 111 Federal 
Express delivery vans in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Final data, including cost-benefit comparisons, will become available in a 
series of reports beginning in November, as the vehicle motors are dismantled 
and tested. The reports -- available through the AQMD or Battelle Memorial 
Institute in Columbus, Ohio, which conducted the study -- will allow fleet 
managers to consider which specific fuel would be most practical for meeting 
their regional air pollution rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "This also lays the groundwork for other projects in the advanced 
transportation arena," said Doug Campbell, an assistant to Rep. Howard L. 
Berman (D-Panorama City), who solicited funding for the study from the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy.ALTERNATIVE FUEL

 Fed Proposes Allowing Discounts by Banks: Banks should be allowed to give 
discounts on some products to customers who buy other services, the Federal 
Reserve Board said. The proposal stems from a Fed ruling that gave Fleet 
Financial Group Inc. a limited exemption from the "anti-tying" laws.The laws 
were designed to keep banks from making customers buy products before giving 
them loans, which is deemed unfair to consumers and anti-competitive. 
Regulators have been particularly concerned in recent months about banks making 
companies agree to let them underwrite their debt offerings as a condition for 
providing financing. The Fed said there should be an exception to the rules for 
traditional bank products such as checking accounts and for products offered by 
bank subsidiaries, such as brokerage accounts.

HEAD OF PIONEER MORTGAGE ADMITS WIDESPREAD FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The head of a San Diego County mortgage investment firm accused of bilking 
hundreds of retirees out of their life savings pleaded guilty Wednesday to 
federal fraud and money-laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary F. Naiman, president and principal owner of Pioneer Mortgage in La Mesa, 
faces up to 45 years in prison and fines of up to $1.25 million, the U.S. 
attorney's office in San Diego said.The three-count guilty plea in U.S. 
District Court in San Diego also requires Naiman to make restitution to 
victims, federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Naiman was indicted for his involvement in a scheme to defraud only 
one elderly couple, prosecutors said he admitted to charges of engaging in a 
broad scheme to defraud hundreds of Pioneer investors and others to stave off 
the firm's bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,300 investors, many of them retirees from the San Diego Jewish 
community, lost more than $200 million when the firm collapsed three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Attracted by the supposed stability of the company and the promise of annual 
returns of as much as 12%, investors flocked to Pioneer during the 1980s when 
the real estate market in San Diego flourished. But as the market cooled in the 
late '80s, Naiman claimed that plunging real estate loan rates and tax law 
changes resulted in huge losses for Pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
 Naiman admitted to soliciting new investors without disclosing the true 
condition of the troubled firm and improperly using those new funds to pay 
Pioneer's operating expenses, including making payments to previous investors. 
He also admitted to systematically transferring money among accounts to create 
artificial balances to pay Pioneer's expenses.

 Strong third-quarter corporate profit reports helped Wall Street spark to life 
Wednesday, despite a weak bond market and another selloff in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 18.50 points to 3,936.04, closing 
within 42 points of its all-time high of 3,978.36 reached last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the broad market also rallied, after limping along Monday and 
Tuesday. The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 2.62 points to 470.28 and the 
Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks leaped 5.81 points to 770.62. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, winners edged losers 1,099 to 1,015, as volume 
shot up to 319 million shares. Nasdaq winners topped losers by a 15-13 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just an accumulation of good corporate earnings reports," said Jack 
Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest, commenting on what fueled buyers' 
interest. Earnings are "proving to be the overriding consideration" now, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks headed lower at the open as bond yields rose, reacting to the 
government's report on the nation's trade deficit in August. Although the 
deficit overall was lower, Japanese imports to the United States surged to a 
record high. 
</P>
<P>
 James Schroeder, MMS International market analyst, called the trade report "an 
indication of continued economic strength." 
</P>
<P>
 With bond investors still fearing another Federal Reserve Board 
credit-tightening move this fall, any report of economic vitality can bring out 
sellers -- driving yields up anew. 
</P>
<P>
 Another jump in key commodity prices also spooked the bond market Wednesday, 
traders said. Copper, lumber, gold and oil, among other commodities, rose in 
futures trading, and the Commodity Research Bureau index of futures advanced 
1.44 points to 231.17. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, bond yields retreated somewhat later in the day, and the 30-year 
Treasury bond yield closed at 7.89%, compared to 7.86% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bond market stabilizing, stock investors returned their focus to 
corporate earnings reports and found plenty to cheer about, analysts said. 
Stocks rising strongly on earnings reports included Digital Equipment, Amgen, 
Johnson & Johnson and Alaska Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Institutional Brokers Estimate System, which tracks earnings, said that as of 
Wednesday, 57% of the major companies reporting so far this quarter have 
exceeded Wall Street average estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, many Wall Streeters remain bearish on stocks. Investors 
Intelligence newsletter's weekly poll of market newsletter writers found 53.8% 
bearish this week, the highest bear percentage since Jan. 25, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tech stocks renewed their rally, helped by earnings reports. Compaq rose 1 
1/8 to 36 5/8 after saying third-quarter net income rose to 75 cents a share 
from 42 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital Equipment jumped 1 7/8 to 31 1/4. It said its first-quarter net loss 
narrowed to 98 cents a share, compared to $1.14 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tech winners included Intel, up 1 3/4 to 60; Motorola, up 1 5/8 to 56 
1/8; Texas Instruments, up 1 7/8 to 70; Cirrus Logic, up 1 5/8 to 29 3/4, and 
IBM, up 7/8 to 75 3/8 as analysts anticipated a good third-quarter earnings 
report due today. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the health sector, Thousand Oaks-based biotech giant Amgen surged 4 1/16 
to 58 after it reported quarterly earnings up 11%, exceeding estimates. The 
firm also said it is confident it will report full-year 1994 results at the top 
of Wall Street's expectations of $3 to $3.10 a share, and 1995 results near 
$3.70 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency markets, the dollar fell to within a yen of its all-time low 
against the Japanese yen on news of the August trade data. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 97.25 yen, down from 97.81 late Tuesday. 
Immediately following the trade report, the dollar tumbled to a session low of 
96.75 yen, just shy of its post-World War II low of 96.60. Against the German 
mark, the dollar was quoted at 1.5016, down from 1.5025 on Tuesday.

GATES SEES A WINDOW IN TRIO'S NEW STUDIO; ENTERTAINMENT: HEAD OF MICROSOFT 
EXPECTS TO DISCUSS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS WITH SPIELBERG ET AL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates said Wednesday that he will probably meet 
with Steven Spielberg and other media moguls who are setting up a new Hollywood 
film studio to discuss how his software would fit into their vision. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Gates denied speculation that he has already discussed 
cooperating with Spielberg, former Walt Disney Studios head Jeffrey Katzenberg 
and music mogul David Geffen. The three announced plans to form their own 
studio last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates, the chairman of the world's largest software company, said he 
expects to discuss the application of Microsoft software to the trio's 
futuristic animation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably will meet with them in time. The idea of animated characters used 
in computer software, particularly CD-ROM software, as well as in movies -- you 
know everybody sees potential there," Gates said during a stop on a European 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so if they are really going to go and do animated films, you can use 
software to make those very effectively and you can use the characters you 
create in the software. This is all fairly futuristic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-profile entertainment trio said last week that its as-yet-unnamed 
studio will produce movies, animated films and television shows. The three also 
plan a music unit and an interactive entertainment unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said Spielberg used software from Microsoft's high-end animation unit, 
Softimage, to create the dinosaur animation in the hit film "Jurassic Park." 
Microsoft acquired Montreal-based Softimage Inc. this year, after it had worked 
on the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft has also been instrumental in developing software that would run 
interactive television programs on the so-called information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The founder of Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft, which has cornered the computer 
software market with various applications of his Windows programs, said he saw 
Hollywood as a "very strategic set of customers." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to work with all the studios, so we have to be a little careful. Who 
knows what they'll come to us and suggest," Gates said.

 China to Declare Factories Bankrupt: The government said it will soon declare 
bankrupt an unspecified number of state-owned factories that have been soaking 
up state subsidies with no hope of reversing their losses. The State Council, 
or Cabinet, will identify the firms in an imminent decree that will also 
specify how their debts and workers will be managed, the China Daily newspaper 
reported. State Councilor Li Tieying, in charge of economic restructuring, said 
last week that reforming the state sector will be Beijing's key focus for 
reform in 1995.

 Bank Urges Russian Tax Reform: The system needs reform to prevent the budget 
deficit -- blamed for the recent ruble crisis -- from widening still further, 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said. The bank urged 
reforms in both Russia and other former Eastern bloc countries and chided 
European Union countries for hampering such reform by erecting trade 
barriers.Russia sharply reduced its budget deficit in 1993 and during the first 
half of 1994. The deficit has since begun climbing again, to 10% of national 
output, even though the government has chopped spending this year. Tax revenues 
have slumped. The government has been forced to borrow from the central bank to 
cover the shortfall, swelling the money supply and rekindling inflation.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; U.S. RULING A THORN IN COLOMBIAN ROSE GROWERS' SIDE; 
TRADE: COMMERCE DEPARTMENT DECISION IMPOSES PUNITIVE ANTI-DUMPING LEVIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This nation's $100-million-a-year rose industry has been imperiled by a recent 
American anti-dumping ruling in favor of U.S. growers, Colombian industry 
representatives say.  
</P>
<P>
 Colombian growers, who send an estimated 90% of their production to the 
American market, say a tentative decision last month by the U.S. Commerce 
Department could force them to hold back 50% of their rose exports over the 
next three months and could cost Colombians about 50,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In its decision, the Commerce Department sided with two U.S. industry groups, 
the U.S. Floral Trade Council and Roses Inc., in finding that Colombian and 
Ecuadorean producers exported roses at unfairly low prices. In addition to job 
losses in South America, the Colombians say, the ruling could cost jobs in 
south Florida among companies that import and distribute Colombian flowers. The 
department is expected to issue a final ruling in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of Colombian rose companies are small and-or highly leveraged and will 
have a very tough time placing their product in the States with this measure," 
said Jack Goldstein, manager of Flora Intercontinental, a flower exporter.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result of its ruling, the Commerce Department imposed anti-dumping levies 
averaging 33.87% on Colombian roses and 50% duties on the Ecuadorean product; 
it subsequently reduced the Colombian duty to 22.73%. The additional duties 
could make imported flowers much more expensive than U.S.-grown varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say half the 180 companies that produce roses in Colombia could go out 
of business if the measure is upheld; that would put out of work thousands of 
poor women who make up 80% of the labor force in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Many more U.S. jobs have been lost and greenhouses closed because of low-cost 
competition from foreign growers, said Jim Krone, executive vice president of 
Haslett, Mich.-based Roses Inc. "I'm anticipating that the decision will stop 
the closure of greenhouses across America. This action doesn't bar anyone from 
bringing their roses in here. They'll just have to do it fairly now." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report by the Floral Trade Council, also based in Haslett, the 
number of commercial rose growers in the United States fell to 213 last year 
from 323 in 1971. Foreign imports have risen to 61.7% of the $13-billion U.S. 
market, from 0.2% in 1973, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Krone said the U.S. industry declined because growers could not compete with 
foreign prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian flower producers, who supply 57% of the roses sold in the United 
States, note bitterly that this is the fifth time in the last eight years that 
American producers have pursued legal actions against them. 
</P>
<P>
 While the previous penalties had generally been small -- duties ranging from 
1% to 5% -- the levies, they say, also cost them millions in legal and 
administrative fees and punished them for competing in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a typical protectionist attitude in favor of U.S. flower producers 
who try to compensate for their inefficiencies with duties," Juana Maria Unda, 
president of the Colombian Assn. of Flower Exporters, complained to the 
newspaper El Tiempo. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, Colombia's rose industry has been hurt by winter 
frosts, a steady revaluation of the peso and a growing world supply that has 
caused prices to drop an estimated 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers here argue that the Commerce Department failed to account for seasonal 
pricing differences when comparing the prices in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the agency also ignored the fact that while U.S. sales are usually on 
consignment, allowing the market to set prices, European sales are usually 
"fixed order" -- that is, for special occasions and at special quality 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are realistic and consider that Holland, Mexico, Costa Rica and 
Guatemala also sell roses to the U.S., you will see the disadvantage that 
Colombia is at with roses 22% more expensive," Unda said.

 Vietnam Gives Initial OK to Telephone Deal: The government's tentative 
agreement to buy wireless telephones from Hughes Network Systems Inc. is worth 
at least $100 million, the company said. Hughes Network, a subsidiary of GM 
Hughes Electronics, plans to supply Ho Chi Minh City, which has fewer than five 
telephones for every 100 people, with up to 120,000 digital phone lines. 
Vietnam, which has only three telephones for every 1,000 people nationwide, 
hopes to improve that to one for every 100 by the end of next year.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; SURVEY FINDS FIRMS CLOSELY 
SCRUTINIZING EMPLOYEES' SPENDING 
</P>

 As companies try to keep business travel spending in check, corporate travel 
policies are becoming increasingly restrictive, according to an American 
Express survey released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The biennial survey of more than 1,700 companies shows that although 
two-thirds have increased their travel budgets, they are spending less per 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel and entertainment "is the third-largest controllable expense behind 
salaries and data-processing costs. Therefore, smart management of T&E costs 
can significantly impact the bottom line," said Roger Ballou, president of 
American Express Travel Services Group. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the survey, spending per traveling employee was $2,484 in 1993, 
compared to $3,113 in 1991. The ratio of business travelers to total employees 
also dropped. In 1991, 28% of all employees took at least one business trip a 
year, compared to 21% last year.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are seeing a trend toward tightening up," said Valerie Estep, vice 
president of Topaz Enterprises Inc., a travel management consulting firm in 
Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, many firms are restricting the classes of service they will 
authorize for overseas flights. Executives who used to fly first class are now 
flying business class, and those who flew business are now going coach, she 
said. "That trend is also carrying over into domestic travel." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of employees allowed to fly first class on international 
flights decreased from 4% in 1991 to 3% in 1993, the survey shows, and the 
percentage allowed to fly first class on long domestic flights fell from 3% in 
1991 to 2% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Cora Wen, travel manager for clothing company Bugle Boy Industries in Simi 
Valley and a director of the Los Angeles Business Travel Assn., said her 
company is part of the trend. A new, more restrictive policy stipulates that 
the company will no longer pay business-class fares on domestic flights, she 
said. "We're only using (frequent-flier) upgrades, which is a great savings for 
the company." 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also sending fewer people on trips, and those who do travel do 
so less frequently, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 More companies are asking employees to book flights with the lowest available 
fares and to take advantage of deals even if they mean restrictions such as 
Saturday night stays, Ballou said. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are also saving by requiring a wider latitude of arrival and 
departure times to take advantage of lower fares. For example, instead of 
searching for the lowest possible fare within one hour of when the traveler 
wants to leave and return, travel managers are asked to search for the lowest 
fare within a two-hour window. 
</P>
<P>
 "That gives you more flight options and can save money," Estep said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said there is less use of nonstop flights when they would cost more. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the American Express findings was evidence of the growth in 
international business. Private sector companies spent 13% of their travel and 
entertainment dollars overseas, up from 10% in 1991 and 8% in 1989. And more 
than 40% of private-sector companies in the survey operated business units 
abroad, up from 35% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for lodging, an increasing number of companies have started dictating where 
their employees can stay, preferring to have them booked into chains with which 
the company has negotiated rates, Ballou said. In 1989, 42% of companies 
required travelers to stay at certain hotels. Last year, the figure was more 
than 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Car rentals have also come under closer scrutiny, the survey shows, with 79% 
limiting the size of cars employees can rent. Nearly two-thirds (63%) expected 
employees to refuel the cars before returning them, and 73% expected employees 
to refuse the additional charge for insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 To implement these types of cost controls, companies are coordinating their 
travel planning through a single agency or office. According to the survey, 73% 
of companies made all their travel arrangements through a single agency in 
1993, up from 68% in 1991 and 51% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Bugle Boy, for instance, now requires its employees to book all car, hotel and 
air travel arrangements through its corporate travel office so the company can 
take advantage of corporate discount rates with hotels and car rental chains, 
Wen said. "A $20 savings may not seem like much, but multiplied by 100 
travelers times several trips a month -- it does add up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Centralized booking also helps the travel department track expenses and keep 
tabs on employee travel patterns, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is companies are not doing as well as they were in the 
1980s," Wen said. "Everybody is looking for ways to streamline. We're not 
putting them in Motel 6s, but then again, we're not putting them in the 
Ritz-Carltons, either."

</P>
<P>
 Travel Network Ltd. of Chicago has started its own frequent-flier program for 
tickets bought through its 334 travel agencies -- opening the way for double, 
perhaps even triple, mileage credit for frequent travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The company says this is the first time such a promotion has been tried 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: 
</P>
<P>
 Each time a traveler books a flight through one of the agencies, he or she is 
credited in a separate account with the number of miles flown on the trip. Once 
the account reaches 25,000 miles, the customer can collect a free round-trip 
coach ticket to any of about 200 major cities within the 48 contiguous states. 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets are not certificates like those the airlines offer, but actual 
tickets from Travel Network's inventory. They are good on any of eight 
airlines: American, America West, Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA, United or 
USAir. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's mileage is separate from that earned for the same trip by 
members of frequent-flier programs on those or other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the possibility of turning the transaction into a high-flying triple 
play if the traveler buys the ticket with a credit card offering one of the 
increasingly common affinity programs that earn additional mileage, or if the 
customer rents a car or hotel room during the trip from vendors who offer 
additional mileage credits. 
</P>
<P>
 The program doesn't stop at 25,000 miles. When the traveler's account reaches 
40,000 miles, he or she has earned a round trip to any major destination in 
Mexico; at 65,000 miles, to Alaska, the Caribbean or Honolulu; at 80,000, to 
South America; at 90,000, to Europe and, at 120,000 miles, to Asia or the 
Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Brent, president and chief executive of Travel Network, said the 
response has been "fabulous" in the program's initial weeks, with more than 
2,100 callers seeking to enroll.  
</P>
<P>
 "The advantage we have is that as a chain we can purchase bulk-rate tickets. 
We have the where-withal to promote it and to set it up. We have an edge," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent said Travel Network will record about $1 billion in gross ticket sales 
this year.

 A recent Chilton Research Services poll of 1,000 likely fliers indicates that 
frequent-flier mileage is well behind other factors in importance."Since 
frequent-flier packages are offered by all the major airlines, they don't seem 
to hold the same attraction for consumers as they once did," notes Chilton 
transportation specialist Bill Augustyn. They appear to be an "entry ticket" in 
the marketplace, not a differentiating feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Important Factor in Selecting a Flight: 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: 46% 
</P>
<P>
 Airline safety record: 32% 
</P>
<P>
 Time of arrival-departure: 14%

SENIOR EXECUTIVE RESIGNS IN LATEST SHAKE-UP AT AST; COMPUTERS: DEPARTURE OF 
JAMES FORQUER FOLLOWS WORD OF PLANT CLOSING, MAJOR LAYOFF AT AILING COMPANY. 
ANALYSTS SUSPECT PRESSURE FROM NEW BOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A top manufacturing executive at AST Research Inc. resigned Wednesday, 
following the computer maker's announcement last week that it will shut its 
Fountain Valley plant, cut 10% of its worldwide employees and report a loss of 
up to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 James L. Forquer stepped down from his post as senior vice president of 
worldwide operations, effective immediately. His duties will be split between 
two people who reported to him, Kirby Coryell and Robert A. Parmelee. 
</P>
<P>
 All three had joined the company last year -- Forquer and Coryell from Apple 
Computer in Cupertino, Parmelee from Western Digital Corp. in Irvine -- to help 
AST integrate its scattered manufacturing operations. Their hiring came soon 
after AST's $105-million acquisition last year of Tandy Corp.'s computer 
manufacturing division in Texas and the construction of new plants in Ireland 
and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's financial woes this year started with manufacturing lags, 
quality control and supply shortages, and were exacerbated by fierce 
competition that has contributed to making AST's profit margin one of the 
lowest among major computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said Forquer's resignation appears to be the result of 
pressure from James T. Schraith, who took over as AST's president and chief 
executive in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Schraith could not be reached for comment, and a corporate spokesman would not 
discuss Forquer's resignation. Forquer declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks to me like Schraith has decided to put his stamp on the management 
team," said Eric Lewis, an analyst at International Data Corp., a market 
research firm in Mountain View. "Schraith was specifically promoted so he could 
focus on the management and integration of AST's plants. He wants to show he's 
going to address those problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The company is sending Wall Street a signal that it intends to fix the 
production problems that have dragged down its earnings and revenue, said Mike 
McGuire, an analyst at Dataquest. Forquer inherited a difficult position, he 
said, and the new managers probably have only two quarters to show that "they 
have the right stuff to pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, AST said it will lay off all 440 workers at its Fountain Valley 
plant and close the plant, moving part of its portable computer-making 
operation to Taiwan. At the same time, the company said it expects to post a 
fiscal first-quarter loss of up to $40 million on revenue of $495 million. 
Analysts had expected a profit on sales of at least $515 million. 
</P>
<P>
 AST's stock price closed Wednesday at $12 a share, unchanged from Tuesday's 
close on the Nasdaq market system.

THOMPSON MAKES SALE OF A LIFETIME; SHE'S GONE HER OWN WAY AND PROSPERED AS 
RIVALS WENT BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Like most home builders in Southern California, Kathryn Thompson has struggled 
in recent years, including a major setback in 1992 when bankers forced her to 
sell most of her company's land holdings to her then financial partner, fellow 
developer William Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson has steadfastly refused to discuss the matter, but others in the 
industry say that transaction stripped Kathryn G. Thompson Co. of most of its 
cash-producing assets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the former premed student and door-to-door real estate saleswoman has a 
keen head for business, development insiders say. She has survived and 
prospered -- becoming one of the most prominent businesswoman in Orange County 
-- while many of her peers have folded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were talking a couple of years ago about how tough things were," said La 
Jolla real estate consultant Sanford Goodkin, "and she looked at me and said, ' 
There's no way they're going to take me down, I've worked too hard for this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Thompson came back with a roar, buying 162 acres in Aliso Viejo in 
partnership with Los Angeles investment banker Freeman, Spogli & Co. and 
announcing plans to build 1,200 homes in the planned community -- a four-year, 
$200-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Wednesday, Thompson scored what may be her biggest business coup, 
signing papers to sell her Kathryn G. Thompson Co. to Koll Real Estate Group 
for about $7.5 million in cash, stock and notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson not only handed off $5 million in debt, she picks up a seat on 
publicly traded Koll Real Estate's board, remains in charge of her company -- 
which continues under its own name as a wholly owned subsidiary -- and will 
help develop several huge and highly visible developments, including Koll's 
controversial 1,200-acre Bolsa Chica coastal project north of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, 53, is no stranger to controversy: a powerhouse in the Orange County 
Republican Party for 20 years, she astounded fellow party members by backing 
former entertainer Sonny Bono against the county GOP's favorite, conservative 
commentator Bruce Herschensohn, in the 1992 Republican Senate primary. She also 
violated the GOP rule against abandoning incumbents, supporting moderate Judith 
Ryan's 1992 primary challenge of Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 But she really declared her independence by breaking completely with the party 
and actively boosting Democrat Bill Clinton's presidential candidacy that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson still is widely reviled in county GOP circles for what many party 
loyalists consider an act of treachery. This was from a woman who gave more 
than $100,000 to GOP candidates in 1988. The decision to back Clinton cost her 
the friendship and business partnership of home-building mogul William Lyon -- 
who had long been regarded as her mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 She told a Times reporter in March, 1992, that her support of Clinton had 
resulted in "threats and innuendo and pressure." She still complained privately 
late last year that Orange County's largely Republican business hierarchy 
seemed bent on punishing her financially for backing a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 True to her maverick nature, she remains both a registered Republican and a 
Clinton supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said Thursday that she has been asked by the Administration to serve 
on several federal boards and to consider appointment to a Cabinet-level post 
but has declined each advance because she has no political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's husband, Gus Owen -- an Orange County commercial real estate 
investor and longtime Republican stalwart -- has accepted a Washington job from 
the Clinton Administration, however. In May, Owen was appointed to the 
Interstate Commerce Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's future empire had its roots in baby-sitting jobs. As a teen-ager 
she took $500 in savings and made a down payment on a run-down house in Dallas. 
After refurbishing it with help from her father, a Texas policeman, Thompson 
rented out the home -- the monthly income helped her pay the tuition at 
Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson started college as a premed student but later changed to business. 
During college she worked first at Texas Instruments as an engineering 
assistant and later at a Ford Motor Co. regional office as a personnel 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first marriage brought her to Orange County in 1964, when her husband 
enrolled in college in Fullerton, and she spent a year with a mechanical 
engineering firm there. But she decided that real estate was where she could 
make her mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first real estate job involved going door to door to ask people to list 
their homes. But she also met a broker named John Seymour, who helped introduce 
her to the county's Republican Party leadership. Seymour later became mayor of 
Anaheim, a state senator and U.S. senator and now is director of the California 
Housing Finance Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, Thompson started her first company, New Dimension Inc. in Santa Ana, 
which specialized in buying and refurbishing apartments. That led to apartment 
building and, in 1985, to the founding of her home-building business.  
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s her company was flourishing, and in 1991 she became the 
first woman inducted into the California Building Industry Assn. Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, Thompson has shared her energies with a number of charities 
and arts programs: she teamed with William Lyon to raise $8 million for the 
Orangewood Children's Home for abused children, is a member of the Orangewood 
Foundation board and has sat on the boards of United Way, the Boy Scouts of 
America, Orange County Performing Arts Center, Opera Pacific, Children's 
Hospital Foundation and UCI College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the latest chapter in her saga, Thompson is sanguine about selling her 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really won't be much change for the company or for me," she said. "I'll 
still be running things, and as long as I make profits that won't change."

HOTEL, NURSERY, DATA STORAGE FIRM WIN STERLING AWARDS FOR QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hotel that treats guests as individuals, a nursery that communicates well 
with its employees and a data storage company that reversed a revenue slide by 
paying more attention to customers won recognition Wednesday night during the 
second annual Sterling Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sterling Awards, sponsored by a consortium of Orange County companies and 
organizations, were given to the three companies for their commitment to 
quality, event organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Modeled after the U.S. Commerce Department's annual Malcolm Baldrige National 
Quality Awards, the Sterling Awards are designed to promote quality in 
business, government and nonprofit ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's winners were honored in a ceremony Wednesday night at the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach was recognized in the "large service 
provider" category for its policy of empowering employees, a strategy designed 
to help provide personalized care for guests. The hotel's senior management 
team meets twice a day with managers to discuss individual customers' needs and 
tries to help employees exceed customers' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hines Nurseries in Irvine, a wholesaler that specializes in ornamental plants, 
was honored in the "large manufacturing" category for an employee 
communications program that, according to award organizers, "has done an 
exceptionally good job of communicating its vision, mission, goals, objectives 
and strategies . . . throughout the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Hines, the presenters said, encourages employee feedback and bases its 
compensation plan on quality, safety, productivity and team development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sterling Award winner in the "small service provider" category was 
Datavault, a company that provides off-site information storage to corporate 
customers. Datavault was honored for a quality control program adopted several 
years ago after the company realized that it was losing business to newer 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's program clears communication between sales and service 
representatives, which has helped reduce customer attrition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sterling Awards are co-sponsored by KPMG Peat Marwick, The Times Orange 
County Edition, UC Irvine's Graduate School of Management, Xerox Corp., the 
city of Santa Ana, Disneyland, Marriott Hotels, Bank of Newport, Beckman 
Instruments Inc., St. Jude Medical Center, American Airlines, Western Digital 
Corp., the Automobile Club of Southern California, the law firm of Corbett & 
Steelman, Fluor Corp., Bergen Brunswig and Taco Bell Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's judges were: Steve Roney, president, Coldwell Banker Relocation 
Services; Ron Dominguez, former executive vice president, Walt Disney World 
West; Jack Stranberg, Stranberg Associates; Peter Shea, chief financial 
officer, Entrepreneur Magazine Group; Tom Nielsen, managing director, U.S. 
Trust, and Leslie Kossoff, LLK Associates.

GIRL: YOU'RE A WOMAN NOW; LOOK OF INNOCENCE APPEALS TO SOME, WHILE OTHERS THINK 
IT'S CHILDISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Baby-doll dresses, pleated plaid miniskirts and black patent leather Mary 
Janes -- such girlish styles ordinarily wouldn't raise an eyebrow, except that 
this season one can find them in the women's department. 
</P>
<P>
 The ingenue look has women dressing up like little girls in youthful styles 
such as short, A-line dresses with Peter Pan collars and empire waists that 
conceal womanly figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the look is just innocent fashion fun, a feminine alternative to 
power suits and killer shoulder pads. Others view girlish styles as a dangerous 
trend. They claim the look demeans and infantilizes women, making them appear 
like naive girls who need taking care of instead of competent working women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would grown women want to look like little girls?" asks Lois Banner, 
author of the book "American Beauty" and a professor at USC who specializes in 
fashion and feminism. 
</P>
<P>
 "These fashions infantilize women. It's a reaction to women in the workplace 
and to powerful women," Banner says. "It's an attempt to contain women . . . to 
react to the feminist movement from a negative point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Sharp, fashion designer and owner of the Holly Sharp Signature Boutique 
in Corona del Mar, who has made ingenue dresses one of her trademark looks for 
fall, disputes the idea that these styles are anything more than playful 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's totally ridiculous to think that any dress can disempower anybody," 
she says. "Your power and intelligence come from a much deeper place than 
anything you wear." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp says it's confidence that is making women unafraid to flaunt their 
femininity and don Lolita looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a difference between being feminine and infantile. A woman who 
dresses this way is not being a victim; she's just showing her femininity. The 
confidence is there," Sharp says. 
</P>
<P>
 The ingenue look has become a huge trend, she says, starting a couple of years 
ago when baby-doll dresses went mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 " Cute used to be a nasty word," she says. "Five years ago I would never have 
done anything in pink or baby blue, but those colors are really popular. . . . 
It's confidence. We feel better about our femininity." 
</P>
<P>
 Among her current ingenue looks are plaid jumpers and short dresses with 
A-line silhouettes, such as her black crepe cocktail dress with an empire 
waist, white Peter Pan collar and tiny pearl buttons ($110). 
</P>
<P>
 "Baby buttons and Peter Pan collars are details that are taken from little 
girls' dresses," Sharp says. "From a design standpoint, it just works on small 
dresses to use tinier trims and details." 
</P>
<P>
 She creates such styles with an under-35 customer in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't really work if you're in your 40s," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She also doesn't envision her ingenue dresses, short plaid skirts and baby 
T-shirts in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't intend these for the office," says Sharp, holding up a plaid 
miniskirt. "That doesn't work unless you're Heather Locklear." 
</P>
<P>
 Image consultants who counsel clients about what to wear to work agree that 
girlish fashions don't belong at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're emphasizing your innocence, your naivete and childlike qualities. 
That's not how you want to be perceived at the office," says Sandi Clark, 
co-owner of Image Works, an image-consulting firm in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real hard to be taken seriously when you're wearing a baby-doll look." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Clark is not above wearing a baby-doll dress herself if she's headed 
for a night on the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of appropriateness. You have to ask, 'What type of person will 
I attract to me if I wear this?' If you want to look like you want to be taken 
care of, maybe it's not a bad idea. But in the workplace, it puts women at a 
definite disadvantage. It looks playful and vulnerable. We've worked too hard 
to overcome these perceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 She worries that young women out of high school or college who don't have 
large clothing budgets will wear their girlish party clothes to work to stretch 
their fashion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman in her 20s often wants to spend her money on fun, sexy things. She 
tries to wear these to work and then gets upset with how she's treated," Clark 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 For after-hours and weekends, though, feminine dresses are a welcome break 
from conservative business attire, says Wakim Kirvorkian, owner of the Michael 
Nusskern women's clothing boutique in Fullerton. His boutique has a variety of 
little slip and baby-doll dresses, many fitted to the bust with flowing skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally like the look. It's fun and young and very up," Kirvorkian says. 
"Women want anything soft and pretty. They're tired of putting on a trouser or 
skirt, a blouse and a belt. It's nice for them to slip on a dress and be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Banner sees a different motive behind the popularity of baby-doll dresses. She 
speculates that girlish looks are popular with younger women now because of 
their deep-seated desire to be free of adult responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young women are very frightened," she says. "They know they're supposed to go 
out into the work force, and yet jobs are very scarce right now. This could be 
a response to that. They don't want to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Heathyr Lawrence, owner and designer of the young women's line Mantrap, in 
Costa Mesa, disagrees: "It's just a look and has nothing to do with insecurity 
and wanting to be taken care of. I've never thought of it like that. We don't 
have to dress in a suit to feel powerful. I don't think there's some deep 
secret to it. It's just a fad."

IT'S A NEW WAVE: SURFER GIRLS GET THEIR FEET WET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH GLAZNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another hot morning in Palm Springs, and Dana Simrin's father is in the garage 
again listening to Jan and Dean on a scratchy transistor radio, standing 
perpendicular to the neat stripes of his Hang Ten T-shirt. A pharmacist stuck 
in the desert with a surfer's mentality, he can dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana turned out to be the surfer in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad never actually went surfing," says the 21-year-old graphics student. 
"When I was a little girl, he was into the surfing culture -- he dressed like a 
surfer and listened to all the music, but surfing seemed unreachable to him." 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny wave slaps the sand in front of Simrin, who has walked down to this 
spot at 9th Street from her apartment adjacent to the Huntington Beach pier. 
She says her father visits occasionally, and watches her surf from the beach 
through binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more women are taking up surfing, in spite of strong gender biases 
that would have them beached forever in thong bikinis. They represent a swell 
of young female athletes claiming a place for themselves in a competitive 
lineup already loaded with male egos in the form of radical body surfers, 
body-boarders, long-boarders and teen-age boys on short boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Duarte, who has taught the surfing class at Golden West College in 
Huntington Beach since 1971, says there were no women in the class when he 
started, but since the mid-'70s, their numbers have been steadily increasing. 
Now, "if there are 20 beginners in my class, 15 of them will be girls," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Duarte, who also coaches the surfing team, says of eight spots on the team, 
one is reserved for a woman, and "a lot of girls want that spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Drummy of the Women's International Surfing Assn. says the increase 
of females in the water is because their parents are less inclined to 
discourage their daughters from taking up the sport. "They don't seem to think 
it's just a guy's sport anymore," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last few years we've seen more women in the water than ever before," 
says Drummy, who founded the Endless Summer Surf Camp in La Jolla three years 
ago. "There are more and more girls learning to surf -- maybe one in five." 
</P>
<P>
 Jodi Holmes of the Assn. of Surfing Professionals, the Huntington Beach-based 
organization that conducts professional surfing contests worldwide, agrees in 
part with Drummy's estimate.  
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the new surfing population -- those who are learning to surf -- 
such a ratio is pretty realistic, especially for recreational surfing in 
Southern California," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 An increase in the number of female recreational surfers, however, isn't yet 
translating into more female competitors. Holmes says in the ASP, there are 582 
men to 57 women, or about 1 in 10. Of the 1,200 amateur surfers competing this 
year in the National Scholastic Surfing Assn., only 25 to 30 are women, 
according to Janice Aragon, executive director of the Huntington Beach-based 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a push by the ASP board to increase the number of competitions 
including women, which would bring a lot more of them into professional 
surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 But "sometimes (male surfers) still look at you as if you're from outer 
space," Holmes says. "And, in that regard, women are still a novelty. But the 
education process has improved our acceptance in the lineup. The guys seem to 
rate your surfing abilities," rather than just automatically moving in on your 
wave.  
</P>

 In Hawaii, they call a surfer girl "wahine" (usually pronounced wa-HEE-nee) -- 
a special word that connotes beauty, strength, stamina, fluidity and balance. 
Yet surfing has always been dominated by territorial young men, perhaps because 
there are too few waves on God's blue Earth, and too many kooks (surfer's lingo 
for unskilled surfer) in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "In surfing, you get to be perfect for like one second," says Simrin, 
dreamily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfing allows women to explore their strength, their natural affinity with 
the ocean, and their beauty," says Debbie Beacham, 1982 world champion surfer 
who lives in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa LeMasurier began surfing a few years ago and says it's one of the most 
difficult activities she's ever pursued.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lifestyle, not really just a sport. It goes deeper than that," says 
LeMasurier, 18, of Huntington Beach. "You practice and practice and then one 
day it just clicks, and you have this realization that you can surf. . . . A 
lot of people beginning are either before that point or just at that point 
where they decide if they're gonna go for it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 LeMasurier was a body-boarder when she entered Huntington Beach High School. 
She wanted to be a part of the surf team because of her affection for the 
ocean, and surfing coach Andy Verdone encouraged her to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of girls wanted to join the team, but many were intimidated by the huge 
learning curve the sport presented. LeMasurier pushed herself, joining the 
"dawn patrol" every morning on a $30 board she bought a garage sale. By her 
senior year, she was voted female most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>

 Many young people find their favorite athletic pastimes supplanted by the 
growing demands of adulthood: the pursuit of higher education; dating and 
marriage; geographic changes; credit cards, taxes. Their track shoes and tennis 
rackets are inevitably kicked to the back of the closet. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMasurier says that won't happen here. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what I'm doing, I'm always thinking about surfing -- the feeling of 
the water, of riding on the waves, of getting out there and doing it," says 
LeMasurier, now a nursing student at Golden West College, where she plans to go 
out for the surf team again. "I'm always gonna make time for surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Hamrock of Huntington Beach began surfing when she was 16. Three years 
later she got married, but that didn't curtail her time in the water. Neither 
did the birth of her son Chris, now 12, followed by Nina, 9 and Margeaux, 6. 
Nina already shreds on waves. She should; she's been surfing since before she 
was born. Her mother surfed through most of her pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, at 33, Hamrock, at just under 5-foot-2 and 117 solid pounds, is the 
top-ranked amateur in her age division nationally, riding a long and short 
board with equal prowess. She believes her greatest contribution to surfing is 
as a teacher and mentor to young women serious about competing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfing is right up there with family and God," she says. "You design your 
life around it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because she hopes to find a place for herself in the athletic world of surfing 
competition, Connie Clark, 23, recently read a pile of books on the subject.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to know what society thinks about that. It's hard for them to accept 
women as athletes," she says, noting pro beach volleyball has made the biggest 
strides in gaining acceptance because, though the women are brilliant athletes, 
their bikinis tend to draw the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has done well on the amateur circuit, and hopes to turn pro eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the major ways to get better is by having role models," says Clark, 
who started a surf league for women in Huntington Beach. The league meets once 
a week for lessons and support. Clark says the goal is to compete up and down 
the coast with other leagues, which she says are slowly forming.

 At Huntington Surf and Sport on Main Street, women crowd around a rear counter 
buying smoothies -- pineapple/guava/mango or date and yogurt with banana. They 
flip through racks of clothes hung with the grunge look appropriated by the 
surfwear industry -- oversize flannel shirts and baggy jeans, hooded sweat 
shirts they could drown in -- looking for something that might fit. Surfing is 
still mostly a man's world, or so the industry thinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet women entered both the OP Pro and U.S. Open in record numbers this year, 
while Joyce Hoffman was an inductee into a women's category at the new 
Huntington Beach Surfing Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, surfing is still plagued by sexism. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfer Allen Lambert, 28, says he doesn't mind an increase of girls and women 
in the water, but admits most guys would rather they "decorate the beach." 
Lambert, who sells surfboards for Robert August of "Endless Summer" fame, says, 
"I've seen more girls in the water in the last month than I've seen in my whole 
life," adding, "People in the way are people in the way -- it doesn't matter if 
you're a girl or a guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Verdone, who has about a half-dozen girls on his Huntington Beach High School 
surf team vying for three spots while guys have 12 spots, says, "There's 
nothing more cocky than a male surfer -- it's the most arrogant human being you 
can run into." 
</P>
<P>
 He compares the female surfer to guys in their 30s, 40s and 50s who are 
learning or relearning the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get harassed. It's frightening," says Verdone. "And you put in the 
elements of the ocean, which is a pretty scary environment. You have to have 
self-confidence when you surf." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There is a peak forming at 9th Street -- two- to three-foot glassy waves with 
nice shape and no wind. Slightly high tide. Mostly rights. Linda Laszlo of Seal 
Beach thinks the water is still pretty warm, though the air feels like it does 
at the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 She stands on the beach wrapped in a wet towel, still wearing her short john. 
In other parts of the world, surfers can surf in the skin, but this is 
California. Laszlo has a dolphin tattooed on her right ankle, and a palm tree, 
discreetly marking the inside of the same ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other foot is a weathered booty -- only one. She has worn it in Fiji, 
Tahiti, Australia, New Zealand, the Cook Islands, France, Spain, Portugal, 
England, Costa Rica. Once in Bali she paddled out three-quarters of a mile to 
waves that from the beach looked as if they were only three or four feet. When 
she got there, she was battered by a 12-foot wall of water and dashed against 
the infamous reef, which accounts for the booty. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 6-year-old, Laszlo says she was forced into ballet lessons, like most 
little girls, and later coerced her parents into letting her take up gymnastics 
instead. She learned grace, stamina, balance, agility and courage -- qualities 
she exploited when she took up surfing at the age of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 One more thing, adds Laszlo: "Surfers need faith to learn not to be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind her, three young women in short johns and sun-bleached hair approach 
the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Laying their boards down on the wet sand, they stretch languidly, like 
gymnasts, for several minutes as the tide keeps time. They have caught the 
attention of some guys climbing out of the water after a long morning session, 
but they don't seem to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 They bounce onto their surfboards and plane perfectly into the white water. 
One of them pauses to cup her hand in the salty water, then crosses herself 
before hopping on and paddling out to the lineup.

SOME TEENS TAKE LICENSE WITH DRIVING PRIVILEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 When the school day ends at St. Mary's Academy in Inglewood, Juliet Gurrola 
hits the parking lot. She takes off her schoolgirl oxfords in favor of black 
Skechers tennies. Then she scales her parents' timeworn '87 Jeep Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>
 In regulation pleated skirt and pressed white blouse, the 5-foot-3 18-year-old 
looks the part of an anti-criminal. But when Gurrola turns the key, the law 
says she turns into a menace. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurrola is part of a growing population on the streets of Southern California: 
unlicensed teen-age drivers. Their numbers have soared, officials say, because 
of the virtual elimination of free high school driver-training courses, the 
high cost of training and insuring a young driver, and a law that took effect 
this year requiring proof of legal residency for license-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was waiting till I reached 18 so I didn't have to go through driver 
training," says Gurrola, who still plans to get her license this year. "That's 
$200 I didn't have to spend." 
</P>
<P>
 She's driven without so much as an illegal-U-turn ticket since she was 12, 
Gurrola says proudly, although she acknowledges that she's had a few mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Others haven't been so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 1, a car driven by an unlicensed 15-year-old collided with two other 
vehicles in Santa Clarita, killing the teen and her two passengers. Three 
months earlier, a car driven by an unlicensed 18-year-old collided with another 
vehicle in Sun Valley. His teen-age passenger, who was not wearing a seat belt, 
was thrown from the car and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 But to many teen-agers, it remains a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got caught driving without a license two months ago," says an East Los 
Angeles high school senior who is still without a license. "I have to pay $81." 
A minute later, she drives off in her old convertible with two passengers. A 
nearby school police officer surveys the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds 18-year-old driver Karen Cardona of East L.A., "I've never even been to 
the DMV." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Parker, coordinator for driver education at the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, estimates that the number of teen-agers in district schools 
who forgo licensing has increased by 60% over the past two years. "They don't 
have the money to pay for driver training," he says, "so they drive illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 The state quit funding driver training -- the actual behind-the-wheel 
component -- in 1990, leading the Los Angeles school district and most others 
to discontinue the driving lessons, which are required for under-18 
license-seekers. So students must turn to for-profit driving schools, which 
charge $225 and up for classroom education and training. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a law that went into effect in the spring requires proof of legal 
residency before licenses are issued. "We see illegal alien kids come into 
court," L.A. juvenile traffic Judge David Searcy says. "They say, 'I can't get 
a license. I'm here illegally.' That's the end of it. They're going to go out 
and drive some more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of insurance (about $860 and up), registration (2% of a car's 
value), and permit and license ($24 -- the bargain of the process), authorities 
say, have also fed the surge in unlicensed teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 While the teen-age population remained about the same from 1981 to 1991, the 
percentage of licensed drivers 16 to 19 fell nearly a third, according to the 
most recent DMV statistics. Experts say there are as many as 2 million 
unauthorized drivers in the state -- one of every 10 motorists -- although no 
one is sure how many are teen-agers. Says DMV spokesman Evan Nossoff: "The 
number of licensed teen drivers continues to decline." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the California Highway Patrol logged a 7% increase over 1992 in the 
number of citations given to those who have never held a license. Judges can 
fine unlicensed drivers from $81 to $675. With repeat offenders, the DMV can 
deny licensing into their adult years. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlicensed drivers are also causing a majority of hit-and-run accidents in the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Central and Valley traffic divisions, officers 
say. Some of those arrested are teen-agers. "Mom says it's OK to drive," a 
Valley traffic officer says. "These people don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Troubled by unlicensed drivers who flout the system, Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) authored a law that mandates confiscation of an unlicensed driver's 
own car the second time he or she is caught driving it. "The bill came from a 
frustration in watching all the attempts in the past several years, including 
fines," Katz says, "and all these things seemed to have no impact." 
</P>
<P>
 A law authored by state Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) picks up where 
Katz's leaves off. It allows 30-day impoundment of any car used by an 
unlicensed driver, regardless of who owns it. "The bill is based upon the 
inordinate amount of injury, damage and death on California roadways caused by 
unlicensed drivers," Kopp says. Both laws take effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAUSD's Parker say restoring state money for driver training is a better 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker backs a suit against the state, filed by the nonprofit California Assn. 
for Safety Education and now being weighed by a state appellate court. It 
accuses Sacramento of collecting money for a driver-training fund (through 
traffic tickets), then diverting it to the state's general fund. It demands 
that the money be put back into driver training. "The kids have been 
shortchanged," Parker says. "They want to drive -- they just don't have the 
money to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Shellyanne Chang counters that "the Legislature and the 
governor have joint legislative authority" to spend traffic-ticket money on any 
state program they deem most needy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, association President James M. Lewis says: "We're creating a 
generation of outlaws." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The children of immigrants seem to be especially hard-hit by the costs of 
driving. They often must work while bearing the traditional responsibility of 
driving parents to their chores and serving as their guides to the outside 
world -- as Juliet Gurrola has done. "We needed her to drive," says her dad, 
Alfonso Gurrola, a carpet layer. 
</P>
<P>
 She saw no reason to lay out the money for driving lessons, because she'd been 
behind the wheel for years. Now she drives with a permit in pocket, but she 
admits that she doesn't always have a licensed driver 18 or older next to her 
-- as the permit requires. 
</P>
<P>
 Juliet Gurrola has been in two minor accidents. During a warm afternoon 
cruising around Inglewood (which included a close call with a tiny car whose 
driver tried to cut her off), she recalled the worst of the two mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
 She had just dropped a friend off after soccer practice on a cold, dark eve in 
January. A white Mustang had stopped suddenly in front of her at an Inglewood 
intersection. Gurrola, following too closely in her parents' clunky old Datsun, 
traded paint with the Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 The other driver told her he had no insurance; Gurrola had no license. Her 
father paid the driver $40 for his trouble -- a mangled muffler. The Datsun 
lost a headlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, "My mom said she would never let me drive again," Gurrola 
says. "But I convinced her." Wheels of Fortune 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the costs of getting a teen-age driver on the road legelly: 
</P>
<P>
 Annual insurance 
</P>
<P>
 * State Farm offers this scenario: A family of three lives in Torrance and 
owns a 1993 Pontiac Bonneville and a 1986 Ford Escort. Full coverage for the 
good-driving mother and father is set at $1,989.38. Adding a 16-year-old son as 
a fully insured occasional driver on the Escort would cost as extra $1,577.38. 
If the child is a 16-year-old girl, the family's insurance would go up by 
$860.02. 
</P>
<P>
 * Under the state-approved California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan, minimum 
liability insurance costs about $1,450 for a male under 25 and $1,280 for a 
female under 21. This does not cover the driver's car. This program for 
high-risk drivers is available through many brokers. They are not allowed to 
charge additional fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Driver education and training 
</P>
<P>
 * $225 and up for both. Driver training alone can cost $145 and up. (Many 
school districts, including Los Angeles Unified, still offer driver education 
-- the classroom component -- for free.) 
</P>
<P>
 Car registration for a new owner 
</P>
<P>
 * 2% of the car's value. Required smog checks start at about $22. 
</P>
<P>
 Permit and license fees 
</P>
<P>
 * $12 each

SHOPPERS' SPECIAL; CASH, CHECK OR CHARGE?; THINK EXCESS IS PASSE? THINK AGAIN. 
SOME WOMEN AREN'T SHY ABOUT ADMITTING THEY SPEND THOUSANDS A YEAR ON CLOTHING. 
NEW THINGS, IT SEEMS, ARE QUITE A PICK-ME-UP -- PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY'RE ON 
SALE.

 She walks into Armani, the temple of the sleek latter-day L.A. woman, and buys 
seven outfits. That will hold her for four months. Last week, she strode into 
the Harari boutique on Melrose Avenue, known for its beautiful print silk 
dresses and funky jackets, and scooped up three suits, a shirt and a jacket. 
The transaction took her 1 1/2 hours and cost $4,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always spend in one fell swoop $2,500 to $4,500," says Beth Cannon, a 
personal manager in the entertainment industry. "What clothes do is, they make 
you feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon, 37, estimates her annual clothing tab at $30,000. She also makes a 
mid-six-figure salary, dashes from business meetings to political dinners and 
shares the expenses of a house and a 20-month-old son (she spends $5,000 on him 
) with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't do anything with guilt," Cannon says, then amends: "I just eat with 
guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Couture is dying, excess is incorrect, and Wal-Mart is thriving. Americans 
spent $586 per household on women's apparel in 1992, according to the U.S. 
Labor Department, down from $607 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Austerity may be the byword of the '90s, but not in some women's closets. 
These shoppers don't flinch when admitting that they spend four or five figures 
a year on clothes, whether they can afford it or not. And others confess that 
they might spend more if only they knew what to buy. For most everyone, it 
seems, new clothes (preferably on sale) are still one powerful feel-good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the smell of new clothes. I love the way they feel. I love to be 
wearing something new," says hairdresser Nicole Kramer, 28, a cellulite-free 
former actress. 
</P>
<P>
 She juggles her estimated $500 a month in clothing expenditures among a passel 
of credit cards, from Barneys New York to Bullock's, and admits that she 
outshops her income. "If I didn't shop, I could probably have a savings 
account," she says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 This level of shopping, whether financially painful or painless, is the 
province of the privileged and the professional, of course. These are women who 
do business on the fast track, who want to convey a certain image -- and 
clothes are part of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to keep up with the fashions because you're selling the way you 
look," says Kramer, who wears short skirts, leggings and jodhpurs to the Amato 
salon in Beverly Hills where she cuts hair. 
</P>
<P>
 But work is sometimes just an excuse to clothe the soul. After all, Cannon 
wears her exquisite clothes only to thrice-weekly meetings and events. In her 
office, "I dress every day the same way," she says. "Black leggings and a top 
and sneakers." 
</P>
<P>
 Women who spend a lot know how costly style can be, so they're skeptical of 
anyone who weighs in too low. Told that one young professional woman spends 
only about $300 a year on clothes, another woman scoffed: "Oh, she's lying." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some professional women do allocate less money for clothes in a year 
than they would pay for a pair of in-season Manolo Blahniks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I don't have taste," says 34-year-old Alicia Wollerton, a fourth- 
and fifth-grade teacher at Providencia Elementary School in Burbank. A former 
actress, Wollerton traces her last spending binge to a 1990 L.A. theatrical 
production.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was in 'Tamara' with all these actresses who had such a unique style," she 
says. "I thought, 'I'm going to do that.' " But her shopping spree at Bullock's 
was less than successful. She felt awkward in her new clothes: "I'm just a 
sweat pants kind of girl." She now spends a mere $300 a year on comfortable 
pants and tops, and fishes $20 shoes from Sacha of London outlets and $10 
Birkenstocks knockoffs from discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Other women, unable to justify large expenditures, have forced themselves to 
scale back. 
</P>
<P>
 When Marj Baker was a senior publicist at Lorimar seven years ago, she spent 
$200 to $300 a month on clothes. Now that she's an independent entertainment 
publicist with a home office, she can't rationalize the expense. "And it breaks 
my heart," says Baker, 44, laughing. Her uniform of jeans, T-shirts ("shoes are 
optional") and other casual wears adds up to about $1,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every once in awhile you have to splurge," she says, confessing to buying a 
jacket and slacks, a vest and two cotton tanks for $270 at Robinsons-May last 
year. "That was a fabulous sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Some buyers suffer at least momentary remorse: "Every time I ever have 
anything in my car, I feel terribly guilty," says Kramer of the post-shopping 
drive home. "I think I've made a terrible mistake, but never terrible enough to 
return the clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who can take the plunge into serious spending, taste and credos 
dictate how those dollars are divvied up. If it's expensive, you must love it 
to buy it. And almost everyone has some economic stance on shoes.  
</P>
<P>
 "To me, over $120 on shoes is out of line," says Kathy Garmezy, executive 
director of the Hollywood Policy Center, who often wears $50 Nine West shoes 
but spends $4,000 to $5,000 a year on clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say it's rare that I would spend less than $150 on shoes," says Sue 
Himmelrich, a partner in the Downtown law firm Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, who 
favors Ferragamos that may cost $300 a pair. "I had a grandfather who said you 
can always tell who the person is by the shoes they're wearing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Himmelrich contends that she rarely scrutinizes someone else's shoes, but she 
adheres to her grandfather's rule: "I always wear good shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing seems universal among shoppers: Everyone loves a tale of a good 
sale, those triumphant stories of a $1,400 cashmere coat snagged for $500 or a 
Michael Kors suit marked down from $800 to $170. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really do buy everything on sale," Garmezy says. She uses family trips back 
to Minneapolis, where she hits Neiman Marcus and Dayton's, and business trips 
to New York to stock up on deeply discounted designer clothes too lightweight 
for hard winters but perfect for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Himmelrich has discovered such a jewel of a designer discount store here that 
she refuses to identify it more explicitly than as "a secret place in the 
garment center where they sell David Hayes and St. John's knits." 
</P>
<P>
 Francie Murphy, a 38-year-old vice president at the Casey & Sayre public 
relations firm in Santa Monica, piggybacks business trips to New York with 
twice-yearly pilgrimages to sales at the Tahari store. She has the clothes 
shipped back to L.A., so "I don't have to pay the sales tax," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who estimates her yearly clothing expenses at $1,500, shuns the pricey 
boutiques. "When I first moved to Santa Monica, someone told me I should go to 
Savannah," she says of the chic Montana Avenue boutique. "I walked in and just 
laughed. $1,000 for a suit? I walked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Even women who can afford the boutiques get a thrill out of the hunt for 
discounts. Actress Lynnie Godfrey, who starred in last season's television 
sitcom "704 Hauser Street," found a $4,000 Nolan Miller black jacket for $700 
among the designer discount stores in the Downtown Cooper Building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just put on some dark shades and go," says Godfrey of the Cooper Building. 
"And believe me, right next to me are people of superstar status." 
</P>
<P>
 For actresses, whose faces and bodies are always under scrutiny, looking good 
is a constant concern. "I don't have any sitting-around clothes," says Godfrey, 
who spends "tens of thousands" a year on clothes, venturing to South Coast 
Plaza in Costa Mesa for designer clothes and to the Crenshaw area for Ahneva 
Ahneva's one-of-a-kind fabric crowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "My style is very eclectic," Godfrey says. "Being African American, I go very 
American and quasi-African." 
</P>
<P>
 She shops the Sunset Plaza strip of tony stores for shoes. "But I have to 
compete with the Hollywood divas who wear the same size and buy them in every 
color," she says with a chuckle, noting that she once ran into another actress 
scooping up everything. "I said, 'Miss Thing, would you leave me a pair of 
shoes here?' She had seven pairs of shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some celebrities wear grungy clothes as a disguise against the 
paparazzi, others accept the impromptu photo sessions as part of the job -- and 
shop accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got off a plane at LAX after a six-hour flight, and there were 
photographers snapping pictures," says actress and singer Gloria Loring, who 
spends about $10,000 a year on clothes. "The other thing is, when you do a 
number of interviews, you don't want to be seen in every picture and on every 
show in the same outfit." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, many actresses have exclusive access to the best kind of 
secondhand sales around. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brenda Strong finished up her stint as the character Jones on the 
television series "Twin Peaks" ("I tried to kill the sheriff"), she bought her 
wardrobe from the show. "I probably got about $15,000 worth of clothes for a 
few thousand dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong grew up shopping at Goodwill and still makes occasional rounds of the 
thrift shops, searching for such finds as a butter-colored suede London Fog car 
coat in mint condition, discovered at Savers in Huntington Beach. "It would 
probably sell for $500," she says. "I got it for $25." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most dedicated sales shoppers will splurge on some luxury items. 
Garmezy limits herself to $240 for a jacket but will spend $250 on a Furla 
handbag. Murphy may wait for Tahari to go on sale, but she owns four of Hermes' 
famous luxurious printed silk scarves at more than $200 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, even the appearance of extravagant shopping carries a stigma. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, the PR executive, says her eternally frugal mother was stunned a few 
years ago to witness her daughter spending $250 on Ferragamos. "I go out and 
visit with CEOs," she says. "I can't shop at the corner store. I can't wear 
polyester. But I have to explain that to my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Other women justify their habit by pointing to selfless expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give more to charitable causes and political causes than would be in 
proportion to my income. . . . It's sort of the flip side of spending on 
clothes," Garmezy says. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the rare woman who has spent a lifetime amassing the finest 
clothes. Dona Powell, once the wife of a wealthy man and his partner in a music 
company, for years spent more than $100,000 annually on European couture 
clothes. "I am not a compulsive shopper," Powell says. "I'm a collector." 
</P>
<P>
 She owns a tea dress by Fortuny, the fashion equivalent of owning a Picasso. 
But even she is changing her ways. Divorced for several years and running her 
own business, she's reluctant to spend much -- until $20,000 designer clothes 
go on sale after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 75% off, it's $5,000. Am I going to buy it?" she muses. "I might."

HAS SHE BEEN BRANDED WITH THE SCARLET 'A'?; SCANDAL: LINDA MEDLAR SAYS ONLY 
$256,000 COULD HELP MAKE UP FOR WHAT SHE SAYS HER CELEBRATED AFFAIR WITH HENRY 
CISNEROS COST HER -- HER CAREER, HUSBAND AND SELF-RESPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GUY GUGLIOTTA, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They might have made quite a pair, the big-haired blond Anglo fund-raiser and 
the elegant Latino mayor with the presidential ambitions, but they never got a 
chance to show it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in her mid 40s, Linda Medlar can still don a deep purple suit and make it 
work, but since her celebrated love affair with then-San Antonio Mayor Henry 
Cisneros made headlines six years ago, she has lost her career, lost her 
husband and, she said, lost her self-respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it was almost as if I wasn't a person -- Henry was the star and I 
was expendable," she said in her lawyer's office. "That's just the way things 
are in this life." 
</P>
<P>
 Twice hospitalized and suffering from anxiety and depression, she is a 
brittle, teary caricature of the femme fatale she was once purported to be. 
With debts she said she can't pay, and jobs she can't get, she decided to take 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Medlar sued Cisneros for $256,000, conscience money she said Cisneros 
agreed to pay her for the heartache and destitution that she said has been her 
lot for so long. She said that she hates that she had to do it, and she hates 
the publicity it has brought her. She talks now because she said her story has 
never been told. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cisneros, as well, it has been a long road, but where Medlar has remained 
silent, he has talked. And talked. And talked. He acknowledged the affair when 
it became public, and he left City Hall rather than further complicate his 
life. Eventually, he and Medlar broke it off, and he put his marriage back 
together. While the experience was humiliating, he managed to salvage his 
reputation and turn himself into a figure of some sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned enough money to make payments to Medlar for four years, even after 
he decided to seek a position in the Clinton Administration. And he talked to 
the transition team and the FBI about the payments. It was "humanitarian 
assistance," they concluded, and Clinton made him Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development, warts and all. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the Justice Department has opened a "preliminary inquiry" into whether 
Cisneros told the whole truth to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cisneros has talked about that: "The essential facts were there at every 
step of the vetting process," he said. "We welcome the inquiry." An initial 
finding is scheduled by the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome for Cisneros is uncertain, but for Medlar it has already caused 
serious damage. She got several jobs, but quickly lost them, she said, when her 
employers found out who she was. Her lawyers contend that she fell victim to a 
double standard: Society could forgive Cisneros' marital indiscretion, but 
Medlar would be a scarlet woman for all time. 
</P>
<P>
 As Medlar tells it, the fateful agreement was made at her home in January, 
1990. After a love affair that had lasted almost three years, she was out of 
money and no closer to marrying Cisneros than she had ever been. But the affair 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros understood that he had caused her grief, she said, and wanted to do 
the right thing. They agreed that he would pay $4,000 per month to support her 
and her teen-age daughter. This was a bit more than the $44,000 per year Medlar 
had earned working as a fund-raiser for Cisneros, and about what she thought 
she needed to run her household. 
</P>
<P>
 But only until I can get a job and get back on my feet, Medlar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no," she quoted Cisneros as saying. "This is forever." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as she was concerned, the deal was a verbal contract "etched in stone." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros remembers it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he thought he should help. But not forever: "I have said publicly before 
that the honorable course was to assist her as long as I could," Cisneros said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit, Medlar alleged breach of contract when the payments stopped in 
1993, saying the $256,000 would tide her over at $4,000 per month, including 
arrearage, until her daughter finished college in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last month, she accepted a $15,000 fee to tell her story on the tabloid 
television program "Inside Edition." She also provided 14 transcripts of 
telephone conversations with Cisneros she began to tape secretly in late 1992. 
The Justice Department is comparing the tapes with the statements Cisneros made 
to the FBI before his January, 1993, confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Cisneros made payments to Medlar may have been known to the 
Clinton Administration and the FBI -- in all, he paid $213,000 over four years, 
including $55,000 in 1993 when he was a sitting Cabinet secretary. But the 
public didn't know until Medlar filed suit and talked on "Inside Edition." 
</P>
<P>
 She never wanted to ruin Cisneros, she said in a long interview in her 
lawyer's office. She went on "Inside Edition" because she was "desperate" for 
money for home mortgage payments, and she never thought that the show would 
play up her suspicion that Cisneros lied to the FBI. All she wants, she said, 
is for the payments to resume: "Logically, if Henry's career is over, it 
doesn't help me at all." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the affair began in 1987, Cisneros, not yet 40, already had people 
touting him as potentially the first Latino president of the United States. He 
was in his fourth term as San Antonio mayor, a striking man and a compelling 
speaker who entertained thoughts of running for governor of Texas. Medlar was a 
year younger, handsome, willowy, with a blossoming career as a political 
fund-raiser. She had started working for Cisneros in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The affair did not end until 1991, when Cisneros' wife, Mary Alice, filed for 
divorce and named Medlar as a co-respondent. Cisneros stopped seeing Medlar, 
and the divorce filing was dropped. By this time, on the advice of a friend, 
Medlar was taping all her telephone conversations with Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the payments kept coming. The investment company Cisneros organized did 
well, and supporting Medlar did not seem a problem. And she continued to need 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 By late 1992, when the "Inside Edition" tapes begin, it is clear that while 
Cisneros and Medlar still shared intimacies on the telephone, they had also 
begun to talk past each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlar said that she knew for several months that Cisneros, deeply involved in 
the Clinton campaign, would seek a job in the new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 For Medlar this was bad news. From a job where, by his own estimate, he was 
earning in the neighborhood of $350,000 per year, Cisneros would go to a 
salaried position with virtually no outside income. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do it," she told him on a tape, "there's no way to work out the 
financial." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that she was fighting a losing battle, Medlar listed reasons why 
Cisneros shouldn't take a Cabinet job. She mentioned other alleged extramarital 
affairs and brought up a $10,000 cash payment he supposedly accepted from Texas 
developer Morris Jaffe while he served as mayor. Cisneros repeatedly denied any 
indiscretions with either women or money. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple reading of the transcripts suggests that Medlar was trying to get 
Cisneros to incriminate himself on tape, but Medlar said no. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she never saw $10,000 changing hands, and knew of this and the other 
alleged problems only from conversations she had had with Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
 What is clear from the tapes, however, is that Cisneros was desperately 
worried that his financial arrangement with Medlar could sink his political 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton picked Cisneros to be HUD secretary, the vetting process had 
begun. First the transition team sent Webster Hubbell to talk to Cisneros, and 
Cisneros told Hubbell about the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But he appeared to low-ball the numbers: "I told them, well, it came to 
$10,000 to $15,000 over a year," he said to Medlar. While it is clear that 
Cisneros never knew exactly how much he had paid, he later acknowledged much 
more than $15,000 -- closer to $50,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI never talked to Medlar, and the investigators decided that the 
payments were "assistance, understandable under the circumstances," Cisneros 
told Medlar in mid January. They had decided that Cisneros had paid Medlar 
$60,000, "virtually the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a grand total for three years, however, $60,000 was not accurate, but 
Cisneros said in a recent interview that he understood the FBI meant $60,000 "a 
year." The Justice Department presumably has reviewed the record. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1993, Cisneros made three payments to Medlar totaling $55,000, then 
stopped, saying he could no longer afford them on his $148,400 Cabinet salary. 
Medlar said she has not spoken with Cisneros since late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros, by all accounts, is an excellent HUD secretary -- a powerful 
spokesman for the poor, a sound administrator and a skilled innovator. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlar said she is not faring well. Reclusive and nervous, she is depressed, 
worried about house payments and debts, and desperately looking for work. "This 
is behind the scenes and nobody's going to care who I am," she said of her 
latest plans. "I'll do anything at this point that's not nudity or going on a 
talk show." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Medlar said, she is looking for work cleaning houses.

 Did you hear the one about the woman who got locked in a New York department 
store dressing room? She called her rescuers via the cellular phone in her 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
 For every amusing shopping story, though, there is an infuriating one, usually 
involving a salesperson who won't stop chatting on the phone to wait on you. 
And, unfortunately, very few of us feel the satisfying zing of revenge, as 
Julia Roberts' snubbed character did in "Pretty Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, store employees also put up with a lot, like the customer unable to 
commit to a basic blue blazer and the buy-wear-return scam artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in the interest of fairness, we recount the horror stories of shoppers 
and salesclerks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tag, She Was It: Sometimes a horror story begins after leaving the store. 
Frances Lippman of Los Angeles raced into Robinsons-May and bought a silk dress 
to wear to a wedding. When the big day came, she took the dress out of the 
closet to find the store security tag clinging to the hem. "I literally had 
nothing else to wear, and you know there's no way to get that thing off short 
of dynamite," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After an "I Love Lucy"-like episode involving pliers, she got the tag off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ruined the dress and wore it anyway," Lippman says. "It was very pretty 
except for the hole at the bottom." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Kids Do the Darndest Things: "I was never big on taking my kids shopping 
because I thought they'd be bored," Westside mom Adrian Miller says. "Or, when 
they were older, because they'd want everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had friends lose their children in stores and find them under a rounder 
of clothes after they've been hysterically searching and screaming. The kids 
thought it was a game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had that happen, but once, when my son Daniel was a baby, I took 
him in a stroller into a crowded store. When I got home, I was unpacking the 
diaper bag and found a bikini. He was shoplifting at the age of 8 months." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 An Affair to Remember: Shirley Sacks of Los Angeles had a friend in her native 
South Africa who was having an affair with her boss. "A married man, 
naturally," Sacks recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took her into the most expensive dress shop in Johannesburg and bought her 
a suit, which had to be altered. In the meantime, his wife went into the same 
store to pick up something she had altered and they gave her (my friend's) 
suit. They had the same hairdo, they looked similar. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The wife said, 'This isn't my suit.' And the salesperson said: 'Of course it 
is. You came in the other day with your husband and tried it on.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It ended up in a divorce." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I'm Trapped and I Can't Get Out: Getting locked in a department store might be 
someone's idea of heaven, but a New Yorker trapped in Bloomingdale's after 
closing had a heart-pounding experience. As Katia Ramsey-Read told the New York 
Times, she lost track of time while trying on Calvin Kleins in an 
off-the-beaten-aisle dressing room. When she emerged, the store was dark and 
empty. She groped her way down a motionless escalator and stumbled upon an 
employees' entrance staffed with a security guard and got out. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Thanks, but No Thanks -- Really: Photographer Anne Bradford of Westwood is a 
stylish woman who recently experienced a quick weight gain after breast-cancer 
treatments. Her wardrobe suddenly didn't fit, so she went from department to 
department in a Century City store, merrily picking up necessities -- until she 
was told to pick up a courtesy phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't over my credit limit," she recalls. "The man on the other end said 
they are usually alarmed with sudden shopping sprees, which can mean a stolen 
card. But my spree was especially alarming because, he said, 'You used to buy 
8s. All of a sudden you're buying 14s.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After she proved to him that she was the rightful cardholder, Bradford says, 
"He admonished me for the weight gain." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradford then tried a high-end Beverly Hills store, heading to designer 
clothes on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I zeroed in on a formal dress by a Japanese designer in muted rust, bronze 
and silver metallic gauze. About $1,500. A man greeted me and asked if I were 
interested in acquiring this. I said yes and told him I was a Size 14. 'Oh my 
God,' he said with astonishment. 'We don't carry 14s here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then, suddenly feeling helpful, he grabbed a lavender Fortuny-type gown and, 
stretching out the waistline, said, "Maybe this would fit you." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable," Bradford says. "I'd look like a sausage. I walked 
away." 
</P>

<P>
 Maybe the Dress Had a Double: The incident happened 20 years ago, but it is 
embedded in the salesman's memory. A socially prominent woman went to Joseph 
Magnin in San Francisco, ordered a full-length beaded Halston gown to wear to 
the opening night of the opera and had it altered.

 "It was at least $7,000 or $8,000," recalls Tom Bruno, a former salesman for 
the store. "She brought it back the following Monday morning and said she 
hadn't been able to wear it because the alterations were awful. We took it back 
and apologized. A month later, a magazine ran photos of opera-goers, and way in 
the back corner of one photo you could see her in the gown," he says. "I 
recharged her account and sent her the picture, the dress and the receipt. She 
paid it."

 A Flasher in the Pan: Karen Meena, co-owner of the women's contemporary 
clothing boutique Persona in Beverly Hills, can top almost any salesperson's 
horror story. One day, a man came in and said his girlfriend had tried on a 
blouse there that she liked. He wanted to buy it for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "But first he wanted to try it on himself ," Meena says, "to make sure it was 
the right size. He went into the dressing room, then opened the curtains and he 
had nothing on. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "My (male) partner told him to put his clothes on and leave. It took a while, 
but he left -- in his own clothes and without the blouse."

BY DESIGN; SHOPPERS' SPECIAL; NEW TREATMENTS MAY CURB SHOPPING BINGES 
</P>

 People joke about the need for a shopping fix, but it's not funny to everyone. 
Compulsive shopping affects up to 6% of all Americans, mostly women, with 
perhaps 3 million on the brink of bankruptcy, divorce or both as a result of 
severe addictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a small corps of experts studying the disorder has drawn up a 
compulsive-shopper profile and has found that antidepressants and other 
mood-modifying drugs can curb the urge. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical compulsive shopper is a 36-year-old woman who, at about age 17, 
developed the habit of scooping up clothes, shoes, jewelry and/or makeup that 
often go unused, says Dr. Gary Christenson of the University of Minnesota. He 
and his colleagues compared 24 compulsive shoppers to 24 people with normal 
spending patterns, discovering that the compulsive shoppers were more likely to 
report substance abuse, eating disorders, depression and anxiety. Their 
findings were published this year in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
 A drug called fluvoxamine, developed to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder 
and not yet approved in the United States, looks promising as a 
compulsive-shopping treatment, says Dr. Donald W. Black of the University of 
Iowa College of Medicine. He is leading an eight-week manufacturer-sponsored 
study of the drug's effects on 10 shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he has given it to six women. "Everybody improved," Black says. "After 
four or five weeks on the medicine, they were doing well." They reported fewer 
shopping urges and ultimately stopped their compulsive shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug is believed to work, Black says, by increasing the brain chemical 
serotonin, which in turn decreases compulsive behavior. But once the drug is 
withdrawn, the problem seems to resurface. "Three women are off the medicine 
now and it appears as though they are relapsing," says Black, who speculates 
that treatment must be ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 In another study led by Dr. Susan McElroy of the University of Cincinnati, a 
variety of antidepressants and similar drugs helped quell the shopping urge for 
nine out of 13 compulsive shoppers, at least temporarily. Fluoxetine (Prozac) 
and sertraline (Zoloft) were among the antidepressants given by the 
researchers, whose findings were published in the American Journal of Clinical 
Psychiatry.

BY DESIGN; SHOPPERS' SPECIAL; DECONSTRUCTING THE LABELS THAT ARE ARMANI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN SAJBEL, SPEICAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

 Every Hollywood agent, Century City lawyer and Beverly Hills investment banker 
knows the difference between Italian designer Giorgio Armani's black label and 
his white label, right? But exactly where do Mani, Emporio and A/X fit in? Here 
are the crib notes for Armani 101. Label: GIORGIO ARMANI/A MILANO BORGONUOVO 21 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently referred to simply as "black label," it's Armani's premier 
collection for men and women, the one seen on runways and wrapped around 
celebrities on Oscar night. ( Milano Borgonuovo 21 is taken from Armani's 
address.) The line is suits, separates, dresses and coats breathtakingly 
tailored in the most exquisite fabrics. Available at the Giorgio Armani 
boutique in Beverly Hills as well as Neiman Marcus and I. Magnin (women's wear 
only), Maxfield (menswear only) and Barneys New York (men's and women's). Cost: 
An average of $2,000 for a man's suit. Label: GIORGIO ARMANI/LE COLLEZIONI 
</P>
<P>
 Usually called "white label," it's the secondary, or diffusion, line of 
well-tailored clothing, sportswear, coats and accessories for men and women. 
Widely available in most fine department stores and high-caliber specialty 
stores, including Charles Gallay (women's wear only) in Sunset Plaza and Ron 
Ross (men's and women's) in Studio City. A man's suit averages $1,200. Label: 
MANI 
</P>
<P>
 A line of professional clothes for men only, with that sleek Armani style but 
less of a fashion voice. Jackets, suits, trousers and coats can be found 
hanging with fine business suits in most upscale department stores and in finer 
men's shops, such as the Bullock's Men's Store in the Beverly Center. A suit 
runs about $800. Label: EMPORIO ARMANI 
</P>
<P>
 Armani shows just two lines on his runway -- the black label and this one, 
which includes everything from tuxes to bathing suits. It's his idea of what 
young urban clothes should be. Besides evening wear, suits, sportswear, 
swimwear and sunglasses, you'll see home accessories, toiletries and stationery 
carrying this label. Available at Emporio Armani in Beverly Hills and Costa 
Mesa. Suits start at less than $600. Label: ARMANI JEANS 
</P>
<P>
 This is the label stitched into everything in the A/X Armani Exchange shop, 
the designer's answer to the Gap. Weekend basics in denim, knits, flannel. 
Jeans start at $48, shirts and sweaters run up to $100, and jackets top out at 
about $250 at the stores in Sunset Plaza, Santa Monica and Pasadena.

A HEALTHY ATTITUDE; MIRABELLA MAGAZINE TAKES SMART APPROACH TO PREVENTION AND 
WELLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Pairing a panel discussion on women's health issues with a fall fashion 
preview might seem to undermine the complex gravity of the health issues. After 
all, what does breast cancer prevention have to do with hemlines? 
</P>
<P>
 But at an event sponsored by Mirabella magazine Saturday at Nordstrom in South 
Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, participants and guests knew only too well the 
connection. Since its first issue five years ago, Mirabella has been a smart 
lifestyle source for thinking women. Its pages have featured both intelligent 
approaches to fashion and a commitment to raising women's awareness about 
preventive health. 
</P>
<P>
 Its founder, Grace Mirabella, stated this point best: "We know that clothes 
don't rule our lives, but looking good is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Good health is achieved by "prevention, prevention, prevention," she told the 
400 attendees. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of women let things go until it's too late," said another panelist, 
Susan Stangl, associate director of postdoctore education at UCLA Family 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Vandermolen, an oncologist at Hoag Cancer Center in Newport Beach, 
reminded the audience of mostly women that the most common cancers they face 
are preventable. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures suggested by the third panelist, Michele Hamilton, were basic: 
stop smoking and reduce fat and cholesterol intake. 
</P>
<P>
 Women tend to think that heart disease and certain cancers won't happen to 
them, added Hamilton, who is assistant clinical professor of 
medicine/cardiology and co-director of the clinical heart failure program at 
the University Cardiovascular Medical Group in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "But more women than men die of heart disease," she said. "And they do less 
well than men after a heart attack or surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 She advised that women not delay seeking medical attention for chest pain or 
any other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's seminar grew out of a May 1993 health symposium Mirabella held in 
Washington, D.C., with Hillary Rodham Clinton as keynote speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Mirabella started, I wanted the soul of the magazine to be health," 
explained its founder, who also served as Vogue's editor-in-chief for 16 years, 
until the late '80s. She thanked her husband, William Cahan, a surgeon, for 
influencing her interest in health. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask Bill, 'What did you do for Grace's career?' " she said. "He tells 
them that there are more medical pages in the magazine (because of him). I 
didn't want to take some superficial approach to dealing with health." 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's approach has been to display provocative photographs of a woman 
undergoing a face lift and the weeks of healing, and the emaciated nude torso 
of an anorexia victim. "What I try to do is show what women will do to be 
beautiful," Mirabella said. "No one ever tells you the hard part or the way 
you'll feel." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Following the panel discussion, a short video highlighted some of the wilder 
looks from the Paris and Milan runways: braided horns, nose rings, fake fur 
minis, vinyl dresses and skirts so short that they could pass for belts. They 
elicited laughs from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a live parade of what was billed "real clothes for real women," 
modeled by women of various ages, ethnicities and sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The selections shown for fall were from St. John, Donna Karan, Gianni Versace, 
Emanuel Ungaro, Anne Klein, Richard Tyler, Dana Buchman, Nicole Miller and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothes reflected the renaissance of femininity and glamour -- even among 
examples of menswear shown with glossy patent leather shoes and shapely 
silhouettes. Hemlines usually hung above the knee, except for evening, when 
they fell to the calf or skimmed the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailoring and texture tied the trends. Deconstruction is totally out, clean 
shapes and finished style in. Fabrics were colored from brown and stone all the 
way to neon brights against black. They came in tweed, mohair, nylon, wool, 
velvet and even some polyester blends that are thoroughly modern. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoes, however beautiful, sometimes hinged on the precarious. The strappy 
stilettos for evening and even some of the skinny heels on over-the-ankle boots 
are a departure from the solid footing of chunky heels. Still other boots offer 
a more practical feel, including thicker-heeled short boots and flat, knee-high 
military boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Details such as a faux fur muff, a felt beret or a leopard shoulder bag with a 
suit evoked a confidence much more entrenched in reality than anything shown 
these past seasons.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's a small, copper booklet handed out to the audience that could prove 
the best accessory for the season. In it, an overall view on trends is 
summarized concisely and practically.

HOT PROPS: FUN IN FRONTIERLAND

 Western wear -- and cowboy boots in particular -- is witnessing another phase. 
Call it the fun phase; after all, industry watchers keep bringing up that word. 
Scott Downes, vice president of Thieves Market, headquartered in Irvine, says 
the money being spent on colorful cowboy boots reflects an optimistic view of 
the economy. "First-time buyers always feel a little radical to buy something 
pointed and with a top," he says. "A lot of people have already done that, and 
now they're ready for something fun." And in conservative times, customers want 
neutral and conservative looks, he says. "Now people are looking for something 
other than oiled leathers in black or brown." For kicks, boot fans can soon 
expect a wild spectrum, including salmon, fuchsia, greenish gold and burnt 
orange. More Than Just Fluff 
</P>
<P>
 It's mohair madness this fall. But it's not all a matter of going with the 
season. Instead of the traditional neutrals or dark colors, a vivid palette 
usually only seen in late spring and summer is coloring your favorite 
cold-weather sweaters. Adrienne Vittadini contributes to the trend with a 
tank-style halter ($75) and cabled cardigan ($175) in delicious mango, pink and 
pimento. "A must-have in any wardrobe for fall is a wonderful cuddly, bright 
mohair sweater for those dreary winter days," Vittadini says. Just as 
comforting: The shift to brights at this time of the year represents another 
example of the tossing out of age-old rules. Fuzzy Legs 
</P>
<P>
 The fad for all things fuzzy has spread to legs, with textured knits being 
stretched from the ankle to thigh-high lengths. Hot Sox reaches for Angora, 
wool, acrylic, chenille velveteen and sweater cable and rib ($4 to $21). "The 
idea comes from the popularity of mohair and furry textures for fall that will 
continue through spring," notes Hot Sox spokeswoman Gayle Goodman. "For leg 
wear, it's a trend that really hasn't been here before and looks very, very 
new. It's a natural because you can still stretch it, especially with the 
addition of Spandex." Goodman adds that sales of over-the-knee styles in every 
fabrication have run wild this season. Apparently so have fans of their 
campaign. In L.A. and N.Y., Hot Sox bus shelter posters featuring a hot young 
thing in an Angora body suit and thigh-highs have become targets of talk and 
theft. Even "Entertainment Tonight" got in on the act with a spot on the rage 
last weekend. ROSE APODACA JONES

CLOSET RX; POOF! PUT TOGETHER A COSTUME LIKE MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Halloween is about ghosts, goblins, witches and haunted houses. But those 
supernatural highlights aren't what scares us about this holiday. It's that 
terrifying call just as the sun is going down on the 31st. You pick up the 
phone and the voice on the other line says "Wanna go to a party?" Ahhhhhhhhhhh! 
</P>
<P>
 What is a woman going to wear? 
</P>
<P>
 It's too late get a hot costume, so what can she pull out of her closet that 
won't make her look like she was invited at 5 p.m.? Besides the obvious ghost 
made from a top sheet, with some creativity she probably can make a great 
costume in an hour or less from the average wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The easiest look for most women to make is a Gypsy," says Liz Menzies of 
Swept Away Clothes to Go in Irvine. "Usually when you go out you're careful 
about the amount of jewelry you wear, but when you dress up as a Gypsy you just 
wear whatever you have, the more bangles the better, with big hoop earrings and 
lots of makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 The floral, flowing skirt is a staple in many closets, and that worn with a 
black top, a scarf for the hair and one for the hip will complete the outfit. 
If you have one of the new push-up style bras, now's the time to try it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can also do a belly dancer pretty easily," Menzies says. "You use a 
bathing suit top, a big wrap for your waist and a chain around the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Both outfits can easily be modified. For one sponsored by the local PTA, you 
can tone it down, but you can make it racier for the late night bash at the 
fraternity house. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've been to Disneyland recently, you may be able to turn a simple 
souvenir into a great costume. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take the average pair of mouse ears and wear a black unitard and red pumps," 
says Cassie Piasecki of Body Issue in Laguna Hills. "Add a black nose and 
whiskers made with eyeliner ,and you're Minnie Mouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Cut off the leg from an old pair of black nylons, pin it on the back and 
you're ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Another look that can be done quickly is the Lost Tourist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd wear my husband's ugly Hawaiian shirt, or you could use any loud shirt or 
top along with some khaki shorts, sunglasses and a camera," says Piasecki. Add 
tennis shoes and some black socks, and people will start asking if you got lost 
on the way to Knott's. 
</P>
<P>
 Demented costume ideas include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Monica Seles: A simple tennis outfit with a piece of wood resembling a 
knife handle attached to the back. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Leftover: Wrap yourself up in about three Price Club-size boxes of 
plastic wrap. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Heidi Fleiss: A skimpy dress and a big black address book. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, Closet Rx offers costume ideas for men.

OFF THE CUFF; LET'S FACE IT: SKIN CARE ISN'T SUPERFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 M any of us worry about drinking tap water. All those chemicals, all those 
impurities, all those worries. But it's OK to clean our faces with the stuff, 
isn't it? Not so, warns Olga Moreno, a "facial therapist" at Salon Salon in 
Dana Point.  
</P>
<P>
 A better approach is a purer solution, says Moreno, who has specialized in 
skin care for 24 years. She recommends using a cream or lotion-based cleanser 
that goes on without water.  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allow people 
connected to the fashion industry to talk about their encounters.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm asked all the time why soap and water are not enough for cleansing. It's 
because, I think, the water system in California is not of the best quality. It 
has chlorine and pollutants in it. 
</P>
<P>
 And soft water is no better; it's attained by putting a lot of sodium in it, 
and that sodium has a stripping element that leaves the skin open for bacteria. 
You will not get the results you are seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you use a lotion- or cream-based cleanser, you're not stripping your 
skin. It protects the skin from the corrosive effects of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people think that if they don't have the money, they shouldn't have a 
facial. I have another way of seeing this: You come first. 
</P>
<P>
 We live in a stressful world. Women have to simply know that they are worthy. 
If it's something they want to do for themselves, it is totally justified. 
</P>
<P>
 There is more than just skin care in what I do. It's sharing with my clients 
wisdom and an aspect of themselves that they have not been in touch with. When 
I look through a magnifying glass, I can see so much about them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I call myself a facial therapist. The room I work in provides a 
respite, a place where people find themselves. Not only can they have good 
skin, but they can let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Stress and psychological problems cause conditions in your skin, nails and 
hair. How you deal with emotions has an incredible impact on your skin. Stress 
must be released.  
</P>
<P>
 The skin is the major outpost of your immune system, and the immune system is 
connected to your nervous system, and the nervous system is connected to your 
emotions. When people understand this, skin care takes on a new look. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the types of facial treatments I offer is using oxygen in a stabilized 
cream form, so when it comes in contact with your skin it's like a 
micro-explosion. The Vitamin A contained in this oxygen cream promotes 
collagen, a necessary ingredient for young-looking skin. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that the integrity of the products I use is of utmost importance. 
These products need to deliver exactly what was promised because women and men 
want results.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; DECORATIONS OF INDEPENDENCE; JUNIOR LEAGUE EXPECTS 
$20,000 FROM ITS HOLIDAY FUND-RAISER CHRISTMAS COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 1,000 party-goers got a jump on their holiday shopping Tuesday when 
the Junior League of Orange County kicked off its 19th annual boutique, the 
Christmas Company. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests armed with champagne flutes and shopping bags wandered among 45 
exhibitors' stalls filled with holiday decorations and gifts at the Orange 
County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. The gala was held to honor patrons of the 
Christmas Company, the league's largest fund-raiser, which is expected to net 
more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let it snow . . ." is the theme of this year's show, which will be open from 
10 a.m. to 9 p.m. today through Saturday. Admission is $6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christmas Company also includes luncheons and special events, such as a 
reception and talk by Jill Eikenberry and Michael Tucker of the former "L.A. 
Law" TV series at 6 p.m. tonight. For more information call (714) 261-0823. 
Christmas in October 
</P>
<P>
 Building 10 of the fairgrounds has been transformed into a winter wonderland 
for the show, complete with twinkling lights and decorated Christmas trees. 
Women in glittering holiday dresses and men in suits checked out booths stocked 
with quilts, pottery, chenille teddy bears, bread dough ornaments and assorted 
Yuletide merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This allows supporters of the Christmas Company to get a preview of the show 
and get a head start on their shopping," said Kathy Hancock, Christmas Company 
chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors come from all around the country to sell their wares and are chosen by 
a committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to find things that are unique, and that's difficult because we live 
in Orange County -- shopping nirvana," said Shannon Zech, league president. 
Food and Fashion 
</P>
<P>
 When party-goers weren't shopping, they could ogle models showing the latest 
styles from Emporio Armani in South Coast Plaza or sample food and drink 
provided by a dozen local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the specialties were roasted leg of lamb from Tutto Mare, grilled 
chicken breast with honey Dijon from Garden Bistro, crab cakes from the Yankee 
Tavern, fettuccine with cream and prosciutto from Villa Nova and karahi chicken 
from Royal Khyber. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the Christmas Company will go to benefit the league's child 
abuse and teen-age pregnancy prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending the gala were co-chairwomen Suzanne Cameron and Christy Dean, Roger

CISNEROS AND MEDLAR: DIVERGENT TALES OF A LOVE AFFAIR GONE BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GUY GUGLIOTTA, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Honor and fairness loomed large in the affair between then-San Antonio Mayor 
Henry Cisneros and Linda Medlar, almost from the moment in March, 1987, when it 
began after a New York fund-raising reception, a limousine trip around town and 
a carriage ride in snowy Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were married, Cisneros since 1969 to his high school sweetheart, Mary 
Alice Perez, and Medlar to San Antonio jeweler Stanley Medlar. 
</P>
<P>
 When the affair began, Cisneros had two teen-age daughters, and Mary Alice was 
pregnant with the couple's third child. Medlar had a young daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after the affair began, Mary Alice gave birth to a son, John 
Paul. The boy, named after the Pope, had a two-chambered heart and transposed 
great arteries, a potentially fatal congenital disability that would eventually 
require difficult surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry was devastated, not only because of his son . . . but also because we 
had to figure out how to encompass John Paul into our future plans," Medlar 
said. "He thought there was a way to do it . . . being a private person for a 
while, spending as much time as he could with John Paul, and he and Mary Alice 
coming to some sort of agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was at this point that the two stories of the affair begin to diverge. The 
"future plan," Medlar said, involved Cisneros divorcing Mary Alice and marrying 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cisneros was conflicted. Yes, he was in love with Medlar, and, yes, he and 
Mary Alice had had problems for years, but he also had his political career and 
now there was John Paul, arriving like a warning from God to mend his ways. 
(John Paul's heart was rebuilt at a Philadelphia hospital in mid 1993, and he 
is making "a miraculous recovery," his father said.) 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to Medlar, Cisneros began talking about the affair to San Antonio 
reporters, swearing them to secrecy and then describing the agonies he was 
enduring. These confessions bought the pair 19 months of public silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlar insists she simply went about her business, blithely unaware that the 
whole town was talking about her liaison. She gave no interviews and saw 
Cisneros when she could. 
</P>
<P>
 One who soon found out about the affair, Medlar said, was Mary Alice. In 
August, 1987, Cisneros quietly fired Medlar and terminated efforts to explore a 
possible gubernatorial candidacy. Medlar was fired, she suspects, because Mary 
Alice insisted. (Mary Alice declined to be interviewed for this story because 
of the Justice Department inquiry involving her husband.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then in September, 1987, Cisneros announced that he would not seek a fifth 
two-year term as mayor, citing his desire to spend more time with John Paul and 
a need to make more money than his speaking fees and his $4,500-per-year 
mayor's stipend provided. He didn't mention Medlar. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't have to. On Oct. 14 the San Antonio Express-News ran a story under 
the banner headline "Cisneros Confesses Deep Love for Medlar," provoking a 
citywide feeding frenzy as newspapers and broadcasters finally published what 
they had known for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros handled the scandal with aplomb, acknowledging the affair, refusing 
to blame reporters for invading his personal life, and asking for "time to work 
it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The confession was the stuff of tabloid dreams, but it also had a purgative 
effect, for once Cisneros told the story, the game, it seemed, was over. He had 
sinned, confessed and sacrificed his job -- done the honorable thing. When the 
FBI asked him five years later about payments to Medlar, he could say honestly, 
"It wasn't hush money -- there was nothing to hush." 
</P>
<P>
 But what about Medlar? The day the story broke, "I got a call from one of my 
best friends, who told me I was the most hated woman in Texas," she said. 
"Everybody thought I had gone to the press, which was just not true." 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio immediately tagged her as the "home breaker" who had cost the 
city's favorite son his career, she said. But, she added, she was the one who 
lost two fund-raising jobs within eight hours after the initial story appeared 
and the one whose spouse filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlar had no job -- hasn't found meaningful work since -- and simply waited 
for Cisneros' divorce and for her dreams to become reality. She said Cisneros 
lived with her for 11 months beginning in December, 1988, and insisted that she 
not contest her own divorce, because "if it was messy, it would bring Henry 
into it." 
</P>
<P>
 And why bother? "He said that, of course, we were going to be together, and I 
didn't need anything from Stan," Medlar said. So she got no alimony or child 
support, and she gave back everything, she said, including the Mercedes and the 
Rolex watch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said he lived in an apartment during the period, not with Medlar, and 
denies ever putting pressure on her over her divorce: "She made those decisions 
basically on her own." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he added, "there were serious misgivings on my part" about what he 
should do. Continuing the affair was going to "disrupt the lives of a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling "a profound sense of loss," he said, he told Medlar of his doubts 
around Thanksgiving, 1989. Soon after that, he traveled to Houston for a gall 
bladder operation, then left the hospital with Mary Alice and moved back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlar, stung and hurting, refused for weeks to see Cisneros, who, she said, 
was calling her constantly and had left Christmas presents on her doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, she finally agreed to see him and in a long tortured conversation, 
she and Cisneros worked out the payment plan. But it wasn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros continued to see Medlar, first in San Antonio, then after Medlar 
moved back to her home town of Lubbock. The affair did not end until 1991, when 
Mary Alice filed for divorce and named Medlar as a co-respondent. Cisneros 
stopped seeing Medlar, and the divorce filing was dropped.

FOES TAKE NEW TACK FOR OUSTER OF VIETNAMESE CHAMBER HEAD; POLITICS: SOME LITTLE 
SAIGON ACTIVISTS WHO OPPOSE CO PHAM'S STANCE ON TIES TO HANOI SAY THEY'LL START 
AN 'ALTERNATIVE' BUSINESS GROUP UNLESS HE STEPS DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A few activists in Little Saigon are spearheading a new tactic in an ongoing 
battle to oust Dr. Co Pham as president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce 
in Orange County, saying he does not represent the interests of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 An article of incorporation to create a second chamber of commerce was 
approved by the California secretary of state's office earlier this month. The 
brainchild of activist Ban Bui, the Free Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce will 
serve as an "alternative" for Little Saigon businesses who don't agree with 
Pham, Bui said. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, protesters in front of Pham's office have demanded that he step 
down as president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce because of his ongoing 
efforts to open business ties with the Communist government in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Bui said a second chamber will diminish Pham's clout as a business leader 
because "he won't have a following in the Vietnamese community." The Vietnamese 
Chamber of Commerce has nearly 200 members, about half of whom are 
non-Vietnamese. It started as a nonprofit organization in the late 1970s with a 
federal grant that was intended to help the Vietnamese community become 
self-sufficient, said Andrew Lai, a project coordinator for the Vietnamese 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Dieu Le, president of Nguoi Viet Daily News, said the creation of a second 
chamber of commerce might be "a bit rushed." He'd rather see both sides 
negotiate terms that don't result in a split, he said. But if a faction of the 
community isn't getting its needs served, then an alternative might be the way 
to go, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having another chamber is not necessarily a bad thing," Le said. "We have 
many newspapers serving a community, and that's not a bad thing. Sometimes, it 
can be a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The new chamber of commerce will operate like a business information 
warehouse, where residents can learn about a range of issues, from taxes to 
trade abuses. But it will also focus on community activities and, most 
important, will not have any ties with the Communist regime in Vietnam, said 
Tien Doan, attorney in charge of incorporating the nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Still in its infancy, the new chamber hasn't begun enrolling members yet. No 
meeting has been set, and organizers are still searching for a place to 
establish its headquarters, Doan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fully recognized by the state of California, but we haven't been 
activated yet," Doan said. "We're still holding out on any chance that (Pham) 
might resign" as head of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham, an obstetrician, did not return repeated phone calls to his office 
Wednesday. However, he said earlier this month that he doesn't intend to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham has said that he believes economic ties between the United States and 
Vietnam will benefit citizens of both countries. As president of the chamber, 
Pham organized trade mission to Vietnam earlier this month. He has received 
numerous death threats as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Since talk of the trade mission began, a handful of members has resigned from 
the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, said former board member Long Le. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resigned because the chamber was becoming too political, and I have no 
political ambitions," Le said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, who are vocal in their opposition of economic ties with Vietnam, say 
the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce failed to represent Little Saigon's business 
community. They assert that any economic stability in Vietnam will only prolong 
a government with a questionable human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are at least 1,000 businesses in Little Saigon," said Cau Tran, owner 
of Delta Pharmacy on Bolsa Avenue. "The Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce 
represents only a tiny portion of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many businessmen here don't want or need to do business in Vietnam. What they 
need is knowing where to go to file a tax license or get educated about 
management tactics. And right now, they don't even know to go to the chamber."

SENIOR CITIZENS DECRY POISONING OF RABBITS; WILDLIFE: LEISURE WORLD PROPERTY 
MANAGEMENT FIRM DEFENDS PRACTICE, SAYING THE CREATURES ARE DESTRUCTIVE TO 
LANDSCAPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 About 50 senior citizens protested Wednesday against a property management 
company's practice of poisoning wild rabbits at Leisure World, which company 
officials say is necessary to prevent the destruction of flowers and plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined by representatives of two Orange County animal rights groups, the 
protesters lined a sidewalk in front of the offices of Leisure World Real 
Estate and held large signs that condemned the method of killing the rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been disappearing slowly but surely," said Belle Price, a New York 
native who retired to Leisure World five years ago. "I moved here from Cement 
City, and when I saw my first bunny, I thought it was great. Something has to 
be done. We're all in this together." 
</P>
<P>
 California cottontail rabbits are being blamed by the landscaping company for 
costly damage to ornamental landscaping in the state's largest retirement 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents contend that the severity of the problem doesn't square 
with a scenario given by Professional Community Management Inc., the firm that 
provides landscape maintenance for Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents also fear that other wildlife, such as hawks, owls, possums and 
coyotes -- as well as dogs and cats -- could suffer from contact with 
poison-laced rabbit carcasses or feces. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said rodent poison has been used on the rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Weldy, a Lake Forest veterinarian, said that the poison, diphacinone, 
causes internal bleeding and takes a few days to kill a rabbit. If ingested by 
dogs or cats, such poison could be harmful or fatal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it is being applied in a selective manner," Weldy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Rathje, Professional Community Management Inc.'s landscape and pest 
control supervisor, said that the rabbits cause $25,000 to $50,000 worth of 
landscape damage annually in the 750-acre community. 
</P>
<P>
 Without any population control, the damage costs would be higher, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rathje said that as of Wednesday, 22 feeding stations containing barley 
treated with diphacinone were in flower beds or against buildings where 
residents had complained about rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 Rathje could not provide an estimate of the number of rabbits killed, but he 
said that poison has been used "on and off for as long as anyone can remember." 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of the baiting was in response to resident requests, Rathje said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eva Park, founder of Orange County People for Animals, said that the 
management company could legally poison wild rabbits but that the approach 
would ultimately damage the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a natural world. We can't expect to live in a sterilized bubble," 
Park said. "They can do anything they want unless there is enough outcry." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rathje said that natural predators cannot keep the rabbit population in 
check. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't work here because it's not a natural setting; it's a man-made 
setting," Rathje said. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters said that other solutions should be sought, such as altering some 
of the landscaping or screening certain plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Leisure World resident Nancy Zeiger said that about 300 residents so far have 
signed a petition in favor of leaving the rabbits alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never know the number of rabbits killed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeiger said that half a dozen rabbits used to hop around her street but that 
their number has fallen to two. 
</P>
<P>
 Babs Escareno, a member of the Canine Club of Leisure World, said that she has 
heard of instances in which dogs or cats died of mysterious causes, but none of 
the deaths was linked to rabbit poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, she is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone I know is concerned about this," Escareno said. "But (management 
company representatives) say, 'Oh, you're just a bunch of goofy animal 
activists,' so it's extremely discouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Price, who wore pink rabbit ears at the protest, said that she would be 
keeping a tight leash on her two Yorkshire terriers, one of which has appeared 
in advertisements in Gentleman's Quarterly magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are they going to do next?" Price said. "Kill birds?"

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROP. 187; KEMP DRAWS CRITICISM FOR VOICING OPPOSITION; 
APPEARING AT NIXON LIBRARY, THE FORMER CABINET SECRETARY DEFENDS POSITION THAT 
PUTS HIM IN DISAGREEMENT WITH WILSON, GOP LEADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Former Republican Cabinet secretary Jack F. Kemp faced an unenthusiastic and 
sometimes angry audience at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace on Wednesday 
as he defended his condemnation of Proposition 187, the immigration measure on 
the Nov. 8 state ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first public discussion of his opposition to Proposition 187, Kemp told 
the disagreeing audience that he could not, in good conscience, support a 
measure that would "turn teachers and nurses into agents of the INS." 
</P>
<P>
 Plunging into a controversial debate that clearly puts him at odds with the 
state Republican Party -- and, according to recent public opinion polls, a 
majority of the state's voters -- Kemp said the measure feeds an anti-immigrant 
movement that the GOP should oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so bothered in my conscience (about the initiative) that I could not, 
in good conscience, support it, even though I know it will probably pass," Kemp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vote for (Proposition 187). Go ahead and vote for it," Kemp told an Anaheim 
apartment owner who blamed the crime rate on illegal immigrants. "I don't blame 
you at all. . . . Send a signal (to Washington, D.C.). But don't ask me to 
defend something that's fundamentally flawed. . . . I am speaking from the 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The former housing and urban development secretary also told the audience not 
to "scapegoat the problems of California on immigrants because they are not the 
source of the problem. The source of the problem is the overtaxation, the 
overregulation, the stupid defense cuts from Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, who was invited to the Nixon Library to discuss 1996 presidential 
campaign issues, was grilled by the audience after it was reported that Kemp 
and William J. Bennett, another former Republican Cabinet secretary, had 
prepared a statement strongly opposing the immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In the policy statement, which was officially released Wednesday, Kemp and 
Bennett said that while they oppose illegal immigration and welfare benefits to 
illegal immigrants, they believe Proposition 187 is unconstitutional and may 
"contribute to a nativist, anti-immigrant climate." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they called for more effective border control, reform of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, and a crackdown on fraudulent 
immigration documents, while opposing national identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the policy statement coincided with Kemp's planned speech in 
Orange County -- the birthplace of Proposition 187 -- on the same day that 
former President George Bush attended a political fund-raiser for Rep. Robert 
K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Bush did not comment on the measure, but Dornan expressed his own reservations 
about the initiative and said of Kemp and Bennett: "I absolutely respect their 
opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, who supports Proposition 187, conceded that the initiative is "flawed" 
and may have an adverse effect on schoolchildren. If approved, the initiative 
would require school administrators to report children or the parents of 
children who are suspected of being illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you accomplish by putting kids out on the street where they can get 
into mischief?" Dornan asked. "I remember what the nuns taught me -- that idle 
hands are the devil's workshop." 
</P>
<P>
 But outside the restaurant where Bush and Dornan appeared, Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) issued a stinging rebuke of Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
 "His act of stupidity has knocked him right out of the presidential race," 
Rohrabacher told reporters. "If he disagreed with it, he should have kept his 
mouth shut. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, saying he believes that Proposition 187 "would smack of potential 
discrimination" against ethnic minorities, said during a news conference after 
his Nixon Library speech that he felt compelled to warn the Republican Party, 
"At the moment it has the best chance in our lifetime of being a majority 
party, we must never ever . . . turn our backs on people of color, people who 
want to be part of the American dream." 
</P>
<P>
 While in Orange County, Kemp was a featured guest at a fund-raiser for state 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, who has not taken a position on Proposition 187. Kemp 
said he asked Lungren if he still wanted him to attend the campaign event, 
given his statement on the initiative, and that Lungren had said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp has also campaigned for Gov. Pete Wilson and other GOP candidates on the 
statewide ballot, a point not lost on a man who stood up after Kemp's speech to 
challenge the former Cabinet member. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't you just be quiet?" the audience member asked, prompting audience 
laughter. "All you did was boost (Democratic gubernatorial candidate) Kathleen 
Brown and possibly wound your good friend Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kemp responded that "unity does not require uniformity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson is not going to lose the election because of Jack Kemp," he said, 
emphasizing his belief that Wilson will win. 
</P>
<P>
 he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was disappointed with Kemp's position. 
</P>
<P>
 As he waited outside the auditorium to get Kemp's autograph, Jim Powell, 42, 
of Lake Arrowhead said he was angered when he read Wednesday's newspaper 
headline stating Kemp's position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, when I actually heard him, I thought he had some good points," Powell 
said. "He changed my opinion, and I think I'm going to vote against (the 
initiative)."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PANEL TO CONSIDER MALL EXPANSION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport Beach Planning Commission will consider a proposal today to expand 
Fashion Island by 20%, which would make the shopping center more competitive 
with South Coast Plaza and increase the city's sales tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 New stores in the planned 310,000-square-foot addition are expected to do $75 
million a year in sales, bringing in $750,000 in sales tax revenue to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have been trying to lure Bloomingdale's as an anchor store for 
the expanded mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance planner Patricia Temple's report to the commission notes that 
expansion of the outdoor mall is not expected to significantly detract from the 
eight smaller commercial centers in the city -- Corona del Mar, Mariner's Mile, 
Balboa Island, Central Balboa, West Newport, Old Newport Boulevard, Cannery 
Village and McFadden Square -- which cater to small, specific local 
populations. Together, those areas generated $190 million in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fashion Island expansion is expected to draw 90% of its new business from 
other malls -- primarily South Coast Plaza/ Crystal Court, the Brea Mall and 
MainPlace/Santa Ana. An estimated $3 million would be shifted from other areas 
of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission approves the staff proposal, it will go to the City Council 
for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic in the Newport Center area is not expected to increase significantly 
after the expansion, except during peak shopping periods, such as the Christmas 
season. The commission must grapple with potential holiday parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned expansion would add at a minimum of 280,000 square feet to the 
mall. The developer, the Irvine Co., will add another 30,000 square feet if it 
completes plans to build low-income senior housing at its Lower Bayview Landing 
project. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; VEGETABLE GARDEN TO TAKE ROOT IN CITY LOT

 Don Smith used to be all wrapped up in quantum electronics. He earned a 
masters degree from UC Berkeley in the field that studies the production of 
light and its interaction with matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, one day, said Smith, a former electrical engineer, he looked up, took 
note of the blazing Southern California sun and decided gardening was the thing 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 So he made a proposal that council members couldn't refuse -- turn a portion 
of a vacant lot in back of his home into a blooming garden. Right now, the 
city-owned lot at Del Mar and Orange avenues is barren, save a few empty liquor 
bottles. But the soil, Smith said, has potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to grow carrots, cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, 
onions -- just about everything that will grow now that we're in the rainy 
season," said Smith, 45, who grew up on his grandfather's farm in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Smith pitched the idea to the City Council. He said it would be 
a pity to let the would-be fruitful land go to waste. The council then referred 
the matter to the Parks Commission, and this week Smith got the green light to 
start work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to keep it as simple as possible," said City Manager Allan L. 
Roeder. 
</P>
<P>
 And to Smith, there's nothing more simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to put a hose out back through that fence there and away we 
go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the garden is a success, the city might join in and expand the project to 
include the entire lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody living in the area wants to chip in, they can," Roeder said. "It 
would be nice to have a community garden there."TOM RAGAN

 Council Moves to Exempt Some Events From Public Drinking Ban 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has given conceptual approval to a policy that would allow 
exemptions to a city ban on public drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The exemptions would apply to special events and certain uses of city 
property, such as weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft of the policy addressing when alcoholic drinks could be sold will now 
go the city's Parks, Recreation and Equestrian Trails Commission for review and 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Tuesday voted 3 to 0 to proceed. Councilwoman Carolyn Nash and 
Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1982, public drinking has been prohibited under the city's municipal 
code. 
</P>
<P>
 But groups and organizers of special events have been granted city permission 
to sell and serve alcohol on occasion. City officials handled the requests on 
an individual basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon and Shanna Andrea Under the proposed policy, the city would impose a 
standard set of rules when granting exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants would have to receive an Alcoholic Beverage Control conditional 
license before the event. Applicants also would be limited to serving a 
customer no more than two drinks at a time. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; COUNCIL WEIGHS NEW COMMUNITY CENTER

<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday decided to investigate the possibility of building 
a second community center building in Crown Valley Community Park to provide 
more office space for recreation staff and more room for class registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the council had considered adding onto the existing Community 
Center building, which contains a ballroom, a kitchen, and men's and women's 
locker rooms for the adjacent swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But an architectural firm's study showed expansion wouldn't be feasible 
because of high construction costs, major landscape changes and the need to 
overhaul the entire building to meet today's more stringent codes for 
handicapped access and seismic safety.  
</P>
<P>
 The city is considering erecting a 3,000- to 4,000-square-foot building to 
replace the trailer that houses recreation staff offices. The new building 
would contain a conference room, offices, restrooms and a reception area with a 
counter for class registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members also expressed interest in replacing the 
5,100-square-foot Community Center building, where the city offers recreation 
classes and local groups host fund-raisers and parties, with a new building 
once the second building at the site of the trailer is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it has outlived its original usefulness," said Councilman Thomas W. 
Wilson about the 16-year-old, two-story building. "It's time to look at what 
can be done to accommodate the community in coming years. Why not do it now 
rather than five years from now, when people are still trying to shoehorn 
themselves in there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the first step in renovating the community center will be 
improving the park's tight parking situation.LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; SCHOOLS END NO-FAIL RULE FOR CHEERLEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District has closed the final chapter in the case of 
Melissa Fontes, the former Woodbridge High School cheerleader who sued the 
district four years ago after she was dropped from the pep squad for failing a 
chemistry class. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to an August state Supreme Court decision, the school board Tuesday 
ended its no-fail policy, which was found to be discriminatory by the court 
because it did not apply to athletes.The policy required cheerleaders to pass 
all courses, or be barred from the squad. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board approved the first reading of an extracurricular eligibility 
policy that for the first time creates uniform academic requirements for all 
high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes had argued that her dismissal was unfair, because athletes were not 
held to the same no-fail rule and cheerleaders were required to earn a higher 
grade point average. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court upheld an appellate court decision that the policy was 
discriminatory, but the justices withdrew the ruling as a precedent. The court 
decision applies only to the Irvine school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniform guidelines adopted by the school board Tuesday night also lower the 
2.5 grade-point average that was required of cheerleaders to the same 2.0 
average required of athletes. Attorneys for the school district had argued that 
cheerleaders should be held to higher standards because they served as goodwill 
ambassadors for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees condemned the court ruling Tuesday night for taking away their 
decision-making powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We either go to jail or we agree to what they said," said school board 
President Mike Regele. "I think that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 School board members will consider re-establishing the no-fail rule for all 
extracurricular activities at their next meeting on Nov. 15.RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; BROTHER, SISTER ARE STEP CLOSER TO A

 Two students in Fountain Valley High School's Homecoming Court are as close 
as, well, brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon and Shanna Andreason are brother and sister, seniors and finalists at 
being crowned king and queen at the high school's Friday night homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very, very unusual," said Evelyn Belgen, the community resource 
coordinator for the high school. "I've been with the high school 19 years, and 
while a brother-sister combination may have been nominated before, there's 
never been a brother and sister who were elected to the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Belgen said students nominated about 120 boys and 120 girls for the Homecoming 
Court this year. The first round of student voting narrowed the field to 10 
boys and girls, and a final round of voting picked the five boys and girls as 
finalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The king and queen will be crowned at the homecoming game against Marina High. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other finalists, Brandon and Shanna do not know who will be chosen. 
They said they are just pleased and honored to be selected for the court. Both 
they also said they're glad to be together for this milestone in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really close," said Shanna, 17. "Plus, we're in the same grade and have 
the same friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon, 18, said he was "real surprised" he was elected to the court but not 
surprised his sister was. "She's very nice," he said. Shanna quietly 
interjected: "You are too." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said both Brandon and Shanna are outstanding students. 
Brandon, an Eagle Scout, has been on the water polo, surf and swimming teams. 
Shanna, who is in student government, has been on the basketball, swimming and 
track teams. Both also have done extensive community volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not they become king and queen, the brother and sister are models 
for the high school, Vice Principal Mike Shimpock said. "We're very proud to 
have two fine students such as these." BILL BILLITER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PARKING STRUCTURE FEE TO BE INCREASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People who park in the city's downtown parking structure will pay $1 more 
beginning Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week approved an increase in fees to $3 on weekdays and 
$4 on weekends for the four-level Main Promenade Parking Structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Jim Silva and Ralph Bauer voted against the increases. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the council agreed to continue the 25-cent validation charge to 
merchants, but charge customers a reduced rate for parking with validation. In 
the past, parking was free with validation. In the future, the public will pay 
$1 for parking with one validation sticker; 50 cents with two; 25 cents with 
three and nothing with four validations, said Jim Engle, community services 
deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking fee increase is expected to raise $417,000 to help offset parking 
structure operation costs and pay off the construction bond. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993-94, $238,964 was raised from the 372,073 vehicles that parked in the 
structure. DEBRA CANO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Race Track has received permission from the City Council to 
install safety nets to stop errant golf balls from the Cypress Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 By unanimous vote, the council last week authorized the race track to set up 
30-foot-tall safety nets.The two dark-green nets will be at least 500 feet from 
Cerritos Avenue and not visible from nearby streets, according to the city's 
planning staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the council, Planning Director Chris Eynon said the installation 
would be a joint effort between the race track and the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the netting will not be visible from the adjacent streets and because 
it provides protection to the Los Alamitos Race Track use and its occupants, 
staff feels this request is justified and will not cause any negative impacts 
to the surrounding property owners," Eynon said.BILL BILLITER

 The City Council on Tuesday said it supports converting the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station to a commercial airport, adding the council's voice to others 
supporting the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am committed to something positive being done with El Toro," said 
Councilman Michael L. Maertzweiler, who is on the county's El Toro Reuse 
Planning Authority committee."I'm a firm believer that if we in Orange County 
do not put our best foot forward and step firmly into the 21st Century . . . we 
will all lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Carol Downey said she normally prefers that the council not make 
political endorsements, but voted support for Measure A because of the jobs it 
is expected to create. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this would affect us in a very positive way as far as jobs in this 
city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode agreed. He said a commercial airport at El Toro 
would create jobs to fill gaps left in the wake of cutbacks in the local 
aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Maria Moreno voted her support, but said the council should have 
done more to educate voters on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is really that important to us, I would like to have seen a public 
education program rather than just an endorsement," she said.

<P>
 County officials hope to open a new regional park in the Coto de Caza area 
within a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The 475-acre wilderness park includes hiking and equestrian trials that 
meander through the area's canyons and valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The park was designed to have a natural look and will include few recreation 
facilities, buildings, picnic tables and paved roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The site originally was named Wagon Wheel Canyon Wilderness Park. But last 
month, the Board of Supervisors voted to name the park after retiring 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who represents South County and worked to establish 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors recently approved funding for two rangers who will be stationed at 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coto de Caza Development Corp. has "adopted" the park and will pay for an 
entry sign, fencing and a parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 The park will open after an access route is completed. The park entrance is on 
Coto de Caza Road.SHELBY GRAD

 The Orange County district attorney's office confirmed Wednesday that it has 
placed prosecutor Michael J. Curls on administrative leave pending an internal 
investigation of a Tustin woman's accusation that he sexually assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old woman was a witness in a domestic violence case that Curls was 
assigned to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police also are investigating a complaint that Curls groped the 
woman, Lt. Robert Helton said. To avoid a conflict of interest, Helton said 
that the results of the investigation will be turned over to the state attorney 
general for a decision about whether criminal prosecution is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade said the woman came to him Friday with 
her accusation, and "we referred her to the Santa Ana Police Department because 
there were criminal allegations."  
</P>
<P>
 The woman and Curls could not be reached Wednesday and Helton and Wade 
declined to discuss any details of the allegations because of the ongoing 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade said Curls, a deputy district attorney, has worked for the district 
attorney's office for slightly more than a year and most recently was assigned 
to handle misdemeanor prosecutions in the central court in Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the nature of the charge and the ongoing criminal investigation by 
the Santa Ana Police Department, we thought it would be in everyone's best 
interest to place him on leave until we can investigate the matter," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 24 years and can't remember any allegation like this before," 
he said. LESLIE BERKMAN

<P>
 Train engineers may continue to sound their whistles in Yorba Linda, the City 
Council decided, rejecting a proposal to silence them. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty.Leonard A. Hampel warned the council that if the ordinance to outlaw 
train whistle-blowing were enacted, the city could expect lawsuits in the event 
of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an engineer doesn't blow the whistle because of this ordinance, and 
someone gets killed, we could be sued," Hampel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampel said the ordinance would conflict with a state Public Utilities 
Commission law requiring engineers to blow train whistles 1,300 feet from 
intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Schwing proposed the ordinance after residents complained to 
him about noise from the trains.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; APPLICANTS SOUGHT FOR SISTER CITY TRIPS

<P>
 It's a formative childhood experience for the eight junior high and high 
school students who are selected each year to travel to sister cities in Japan 
and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition is pretty stiff, but that shouldn't discourage people," said 
Doug Erber, president of the Sister City Assn. of Huntington Beach. "We're not 
looking for 'A' students; we're looking for students who are outgoing, friendly 
and have a sincere interest in learning about a new culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Four students will be selected to visit Anjo, Japan, and another four will 
stay in Waitakere, New Zealand. The deadline to apply for the 1995 student 
exchange program is Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every kid who has come back has had their eyes open that there are other 
places in the world other than Southern California," Erber said. "They come 
back with a new understanding and appreciation for the U.S. and our position in 
the world and are more open-minded toward learning about different cultures and 
accepting people and their backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Erber said the Sister City Assn. subsidizes part of the students' travel 
expenses. Students also hold fund-raisers to help pay for travel to the sister 
cities, where they spend two weeks in the homes of foreign students. 
</P>
<P>
 The local students travel to the sister cities in August. Students from New 
Zealand visit here in late April, while those from Japan arrive in early July. 
To participate, students must be between 13 and 17 years old and must live or 
go to school in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are available at Huntington Beach Central Library, 7111 Talbert 
Ave., or the the public information office at City Hall, 2000 Main St. A Sister 
City Assn. meeting will be held at 7 p.m. Oct. 25 at the Central Library, 
Meeting Room C. For more information, call (714) 846-7685.DEBRA CANO

SUSPECT GETS REARRESTED IN THE DEATH OF PEDESTRIAN; INVESTIGATION: POLICE SAY 
THEY NEED MORE TIME TO DETERMINE CHARGES IN THE ACCIDENT SUNDAY IN SILVERADO 
CANYON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old man suspected of striking and killing a pedestrian in Silverado 
Canyon was rearrested Wednesday moments before he was to be released from 
custody, giving authorities more time to prepare charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had been preparing to release Shane Young, 25, from the Orange 
County Jail as the California Highway Patrol continued its investigation into 
the accident that killed Jasmin Cook, 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before 5 p.m., Young left his cell dressed in the same blood-stained 
jeans he was wearing at the time of the collision. He was taken to a visitors 
area of the jail's Intake/Release Center, out of sight of the public, and his 
handcuffs were removed. 
</P>
<P>
 But before he could leave, CHP Officer William L. Grant stepped from behind a 
door, told him he was being rearrested, again on suspicion of vehicular 
manslaughter and felony drunk driving, and put the handcuffs back on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deputies didn't tell him anything," Grant said. He "had no idea. He is 
not a happy camper. The look on his face was worth a thousand dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 When Young asked why he was being rearrested, Grant said, "I basically told 
him it was a technical thing. He was in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 CHP authorities said they needed more time to investigate the crash before 
sending reports to the district attorney's office that would be used to decide 
what, if any, charges should be filed against Young in connection with the 
death of his close friend. State law requires that a suspect be released from 
custody if charges are not filed within two working days of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much work that needs to be done on the case," said CHP Officer R. 
Brame, an investigator in the case, which will include vehicle inspections and 
interviews with witnesses. "We couldn't get it done in 48 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 CHP spokeswoman Angel Johnson said authorities expect Young to be arraigned by 
Friday. If the charges are not ready by then, he must be released, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was first arrested Sunday night after police said he struck three people 
on narrow Silverado Canyon Road while racing another driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was definitely speeding down the canyon," Johnson said outside the jail. 
Results of blood and other tests may not be available for several weeks, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, 20, was killed as she walked on the edge of the winding road with two 
friends on bicycles. Her two companions were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The second driver, Clint Wamsley, 19, was also arrested on suspicion of 
manslaughter and felony driving under the influence but has been released from 
custody.

HOAG HOSPITAL'S PRESIDENT DECIDES TO REMAIN IN POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, Michael Stephens, said 
Wednesday that he has changed his mind about quitting his job and taking a post 
in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "After further evaluating numerous personal considerations, it became clear I 
should stay," Stephens, 52, said in a statement.He declined to be more specific 
when reached for comment later, other than to say it involved family and "my 
own personal feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Stephens said he would resign his post of 19 years to become 
president of Swedish Health Services in Seattle, which runs two hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Stephens said he had reached a point where he felt he either had 
to change jobs or stay at Hoag for the rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, Stephens said he is excited about implementing the 
hospital's master plan and expanding outpatient services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll get through the last hurdles," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish Health spokeswoman Sally Wright said, "It was a difficult decision for 
him. I think when you are looking to leave a community you have been entrenched 
in . . . it's difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of Hoag's board of directors, Albert Auer, said that no special 
efforts were made to persuade Stephens to stay, such as offering a pay hike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been my feeling that and theory that if someone wants to better 
themselves, they are entitled to do it," Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 With his decision to stay, "we were gainers in this situation," Auer said. 
Finding a successor to Stephens, someone who could steer the nonprofit 416-bed 
hospital through the changes gripping the health-care industry, would have been 
extremely difficult, he added.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CONGRESS; BUSH HEADLINES DORNAN FUND-RAISER IN IRVINE; 
THE FORMER PRESIDENT SEES A CHANCE FOR 'SIGNIFICANT CHANGE' IN CONGRESS WITH 
GOP TIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Predicting a year of "significant change" in the makeup of Congress, former 
President George Bush briefly hit the campaign trail again Wednesday to rally 
support for Rep. Robert K. Dornan at a fund-raiser in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush was the star attraction among a constellation of Orange County 
Republicans, including congressmen and state legislators who back the Garden 
Grove incumbent in his bid for a ninth term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled to be here with Bob Dornan," Bush told about 230 Dornan 
supporters at the Chanteclair Restaurant. "He's been a loyal friend, and if we 
had our differences, it didn't obscure the overall picture. I strongly support 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dornan's Democratic challenger, Mike Farber, said the Bush visit 
shows the Dornan campaign is in a "serious tailspin." 
</P>
<P>
 "After the mean and disrespectful remarks Dornan made about Bush after the 
1992 election, it's awfully generous of the former President to try and lend 
his respectability to a man whose personal conduct and professional 
incompetence has been an embarrassment to himself and Orange County," Farber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan suggested after Bush's defeat in 1992 that the President's endorsement 
hadn't helped him much. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan said Bush offered to appear at the fund-raiser Wednesday because he was 
in Los Angeles for a business meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you picture me saying I don't want a former U.S. President here?" Dornan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush urged supporters to vote to ensure Republican victories. Political 
observers note Republicans have a reasonable chance of capturing a majority in 
Congress for the first time since the Dwight Eisenhower Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this will be a year of significant change," Bush said. "I've sensed 
it all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush also accused the press of a "national rampage" against conservative 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics isn't as fun as it used to be," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Before Bush's remarks, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) 
taunted the short-lived Democratic strategy called "BeatBob Inc." aimed at 
ousting the eight-term congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we heard cries of 'Beat Bob,' ," Rohrabacher said. "We are grateful 
to have George Bush here today to say, 'Win, Bob, win.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan supporters seemed equally enthused by the Bush visit, and believed it 
would increase momentum before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will really help," said Tom Tracy, a businessman from Santa Ana. 
"But you can't get cocky because last time it turned into a very close race." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan also used the gathering to parade a blowup of a photo of the crowd at 
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 march on Washington that apparently 
includes him. Farber recently challenged Dornan's claim that he had 
participated in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt about it," said Dornan, pointing to the photo. "That's me."

LOCAL ELECTIONS / FULLERTON CITY COUNCIL; 3 NEWCOMERS ADVISE DELAYING TAX ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD and MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after voters elected them to the City Council, the three 
special-election winners said Wednesday that they oppose forcing any action on 
the city's controversial utility tax before the Nov. 8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan M. Flory and Conrad DeWitte, who were elected to one-month terms, said the 
council could not give full consideration to the complicated tax issue in the 
few weeks remaining before the general election, when their terms expire and 
they must compete against 13 other candidates for full four-year seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Godfrey, who won a two-year term Tuesday, agreed, predicting that city 
officials will not place the issue on the council agenda until after the 
winners of the November election are inaugurated. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do it all during a one-month period would just stir up the pot," said 
DeWitte, a 46-year-old businessman. "I'm not here for the theatrics. I want to 
do it intelligently. . . . It can hold off until after the election." 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitte and Godfrey, a 49-year-old attorney, have vowed to repeal the 2% 
utility tax. Flory, a 50-year-old attorney, said she supports the tax unless it 
can be repealed without causing cuts in city services. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's election -- which culminated a year of political bickering and 
confusion -- was forced by the June recall of three council members who 
approved the tax last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The special election, which drew 23.6% of the city's voters, cost Fullerton 
about $117,000. The city spent more than $100,000 on the recall election and 
more than $8,000 defending itself against a lawsuit filed by recall supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2% utility tax is applied to monthly telephone, gas, electric, water and 
cable television bills. The levy costs a Fullerton household an average of 
$4.40 a month and is expected to generate $4.6 million in revenue before 
expiring in September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The three special-election winners will be inaugurated at a special council 
meeting Tuesday. They will succeed Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members 
Molly McClanahan and Don Bankhead, who were ousted in the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Chris Norby and Julie Sa, who were not targeted by recall 
leaders, agreed that the tax probably would not come up immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as I opposed the tax, these things have to be done in a deliberate 
manner, and they have to be planned," Norby said. "The tax has to end in 
coordination with cutting expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas S. Babcock, chairman of the Fullerton Recalls Committee, said the 
levy should be repealed as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready to dump it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall leaders backed three candidates in Tuesday's election. Only one of 
them, DeWitte, was elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Flory said the election results show that "the Fullerton voter is reluctant to 
turn their government over to revolutionaries. They want a safe person sitting 
on the council." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Flory nor DeWitte had much time to celebrate their victories. With the 
general election 19 days away, both candidates said they will spend the next 
few weeks campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's victory was "a nice little interlude," Flory said. "The real 
election for me will be Nov. 8." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Flory and DeWitte, the other candidates in the November election are: 
Bankhead, 62; business people Jack Dean, 46, Robert E. McNutt, 50, Michael J. 
Mummert, 35, Gary E. Nouskajian, 43, Stuart Stitch, 25, James Tanaka, 37, 
Michael J. Wagner, 46, and Bahia Wilson, 44; librarian Edith J. O'Donnell, 65; 
real estate agent Leland C. Wilson, 24, and transportation administrator Carole 
E. Wink, 55. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Logemann's name will appear on the ballot, but he has dropped out of the 
race.

OFFICIALS DEFEND PEPSI QUALITY CONTROL; PRODUCTION: PLANT THAT ORIGINATED CAN 
IN WHICH RAT WAS ALLEGEDLY FOUND HAS PASSED INSPECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pepsi-Cola officials defended their quality control standards Wednesday and 
said the claim of a 22-year-old woman that she found a dead rat in a can of 
Diet Pepsi may be a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember, the remains of the animal were found after the can was 
opened," spokeswoman Anne Ward said from Pepsi headquarters in Somers, N.Y. 
"Nothing was found in a sealed can. The logical conclusion is that whatever was 
put there, was put there after the can was opened." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Maria Del Consuelo Lazaro, a visiting schoolteacher from Jalisco, 
Mexico, filed a lawsuit against Pepsi Cola Inc. and Albertson's grocery store 
chain. She alleged that while visiting family in Buena Park in July, she drank 
from a Diet Pepsi can she had bought at an Albertson's only to spit out some 
strange matter. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, she went to Anaheim General Hospital complaining of 
abdominal pains. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff at the hospital cut into the can and discovered a full-grown rat, said 
attorney Daniel Ramirez, who is representing Lazaro. The hospital sent the can 
and its contents to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which confirmed that 
the can contained a rat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said that his client is telling the truth, and that tampering wasn't 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would presuppose that someone inserted the rodent through the pop top," 
he said. "That's kind of illogical because it's a big rodent." 
</P>
<P>
 The Buena Park Pepsi-Cola bottling plant where the can originated has passed 
at least five inspections since July, 1993, officials of the Orange County 
Health Care Agency, state Department of Health Services and the FDA said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 County inspectors, who did three routine inspections between December, 1993, 
and May, 1994, reported they found no rodents or vermin, and issued no health 
violation notices after inspections. The county also received no consumer 
complaints, said Jim Huston, the agency's assistant director of environmental 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 State inspectors visited the plant in July, 1993, and found no problems, said 
Ozzie Schmidt, a state health services supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 After the July complaint, the FDA also inspected the plant and found no 
problems, said spokeswoman Rosario Quintanilla-Vior. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said the company is not overly concerned that the lawsuit will tarnish 
its image or hurt sales of the popular soft drink. 
</P>
<P>
 But some shoppers interviewed Wednesday at the Buena Park Albertson's, where 
the soda was purchased, said they believed Lazaro's story. Several said they 
probably will not buy another can or will urge friends to avoid Pepsi as a 
result. Others said they'll take their chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," said Marlene Rodriguez, 29, of Buena Vista as she glanced down 
the two six-packs of Diet Coke in her shopping cart. "Seems like I should pour 
out a whole can in a glass now to see what's in there or maybe buy only the 
clear bottles." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's next?" asked shopper Gorbachove Buyne. "A cow in a milk carton?"

<P>
 City officials may put the brakes on roller skaters and skateboarders who whiz 
through certain downtown landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Convention Center, Civic Center Plaza, Lincoln Park and The 
Promenade, a downtown walkway next to Pine Avenue, are among the sites where 
skating would be prohibited under an ordinance being prepared by city 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ban, expected to go before the City Council in about two weeks, 
would extend to bicycle riding at the park and Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard I. Backus, city traffic engineer, said minor damage caused by skaters 
at the newly remodeled convention center and concern for pedestrian safety 
prompted the proposed ban. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: COMPTON; GROUP WITH COUNCIL TIES GETS CITY CARS FOR $1 EACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The public service group 100 Strong Men of Compton proved it has strong ties 
to City Hall recently when the organization won City Council approval to buy 
three used city vehicles for $1 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented deal drew support from Mayor Omar Bradley, founder and 
president of the group, and Councilman Ronald J. Green, a member of the 
group.Councilwoman Jane D. Robbins also voted for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Yvonne Arceneaux abstained after saying she was concerned that 
other worthy civic groups were not given an opportunity to compete for the 
vehicles. Councilwoman Marcine Shaw, who earlier in the day voiced identical 
reservations, was not present for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said the city has allowed the organization to use city vehicles during 
cleanup efforts. "But the men need these other vehicles" for smaller, daily 
jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicles are a 1990 Ford paramedic's van worth $4,000, and a Chevrolet 
half-ton pickup and a Dodge passenger bus, each worth $500. All were bound for 
auction until members of the group asked to buy them for $1 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the deal said it is likely to generate similar requests. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how many vehicles might be available, City Manager Howard Caldwell 
shrugged and said, "I wasn't planning on giving away those. But they asked for 
them and the council agreed." 
</P>
<P>
 The 100 Strong Men group was established last year to clean up various areas 
of the city. So far, members have worked to clean up part of a drainage canal 
that runs through the city, repainted and landscaped an old Camp Fire site, and 
painted an elementary school, among other projects. EMILY ADAMS

CANDIDATES SQUABBLE OVER SIGNS; POLITICS: RACE BETWEEN THOMAS TOWNSEND AND 
KELVIN D. FILER FOR COMPTON COURT COMMISSION IS MARKED BY CONTROVERSY OVER 
CAMPAIGN POSTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each year at election time, candidates in Compton paper the city with campaign 
signs. Without fail, the brightly colored posters appear on fences, lawns, 
street corners and utility poles. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Municipal Court Commissioner Thomas Townsend planned to do the same 
this year as part of his campaign to become a judge. He spent $2,500 on signs 
and scattered 50 of them across the city. But Townsend's plan encountered 
unexpected trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Compton officials notified Townsend that some of the placards 
violated a municipal law that prohibits political signs at intersections, on 
fences and private property without an owner's permission. Townsend was told he 
would have to remove the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, who is running against fellow Commissioner Kelvin D. Filer for 
Municipal Court judge, claims officials have singled him out by enforcing a law 
they have ignored since it was written 16 years ago. Officials say they have 
enforced the ordinance in several previous elections and focused on Townsend 
this time because he is the only candidate using campaign signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend took the city to court, and this week the two sides struck a deal: 
Townsend agreed to drop a request for a temporary restraining order against the 
city, and officials agreed to allow Townsend's signs to remain while the city's 
attorneys review the law. The two sides reached their agreement after several 
behind-the-scenes meetings with Superior Court Judge Owen Lee Kwong. 
</P>
<P>
 But the brief legal ordeal has soured Townsend on politics and left city 
officials to ponder whether the law is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never run for office again," said Townsend, 52, a Carson resident who 
is making his first bid for elected office. "Who in their right mind would want 
to go through this?" 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Legrand H. Clegg said his office is reviewing the law because of 
concerns raised during the closed-door meetings that the ordinance's language 
may be too sweeping. He would not elaborate, other than to say he wants to 
ensure the measure does not infringe on First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we reviewed the issues raised by (Townsend's attorney), we agreed there 
may be some legitimate questions regarding the constitutionality of the 
ordinance," Clegg said. "We agreed not to enforce the ordinance until we 
reviewed it in its entirety." 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began late last month after Townsend ran a hard-hitting ad in a 
local newspaper against Filer, who served 12 years on the Compton school board. 
The ad said that under Filer's leadership as president of the board, the school 
district incurred massive debt, had the lowest academic scores in the state and 
suffered a state takeover. The ad questioned how much time Filer, a lawyer, 
devoted to his school board position because of a rigorous work schedule. 
Filer, who decided not to seek reelection when his board term expired last 
year, dismissed the criticisms as negative campaign material. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the advertisement was published Sept. 29, Townsend received a 
call from a city code enforcement officer notifying him that all of his signs 
would have to be removed, according to court documents. Townsend moved about 
five signs that he said appeared to violate the city's law, but he refused to 
take any down. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend contends that someone in Filer's camp contacted the city about his 
signs. Filer denies that he directed anyone to call the city. But he said he 
received several calls from community leaders angered by Townsend's ad and the 
harsh tone of his campaign. Some callers also were upset that Townsend had 
placed campaign signs on private property without asking permission, a 
violation of the city's law, Filer said. The callers told Filer they contacted 
the city on their own, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are really upset," said Filer, 38, who plans to put up about 500 signs 
this weekend in legal locations in Compton and other cities in the judicial 
district, which stretches from Carson to Paramount. "(Townsend's aggressive 
campaign) is totally inappropriate for a judicial race. I refuse to stoop to 
that level. I'm going to run a positive campaign, touting the reasons I believe 
I should be elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Filer said he used campaign signs in previous school board elections but that 
he always complied with the city's ordinance. Filer said he plans to spend 
$20,000 to $30,000 to pay for ads in local newspapers, mailers and commercials 
on local cable channels. Townsend, who plans to spend about $30,000 on his 
campaign, is relying on his magenta-yellow-green signs and newspaper ads to get 
his name out. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost amid the uproar over the signs has been any discussion of the candidates 
themselves. Both are Municipal Court commissioners who carry out many of the 
same duties as judges, such as conducting civil-law trials and preliminary 
hearings for felony cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, a lawyer for 25 years, has been a commissioner in Compton since 
April, 1991. He has served in the Los Angeles County public defender's office 
and in private practice, focusing partly on criminal defense work. Townsend 
also has served as president of the South-Central Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend bases part of his platform on his tough stand on violent crime. He 
pledges to set high bails for serious felony cases so that potentially violent 
defendants can be held in custody until trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Filer, a court commissioner in Compton since last December, has worked for the 
state public defender's office and in private practice for the last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Filer grew up in Compton and has served as president of the Compton Chamber of 
Commerce, in addition to his years on the Compton school board. He says that 
four terms as president of the often contentious school board helped him 
develop the even temperament necessary for judges.

BIGGER, BETTER -- AND OPEN

 It has already hosted a coin and stamp expo, a car show and a dry-cleaning 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Long Beach's expanded and beautified convention center, open for business 
for the past 2 1/2 months, officially opens today when a dozen dignitaries are 
scheduled to cut a ribbon at the main entrance on Pine Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The center now has three times as much exhibit space, 224,000 square feet, as 
it did two years ago when the $111-million project got under way. There are 36 
meeting rooms, three huge exhibit halls and parking space for 5,000 cars, to 
say nothing of the city's largest ballroom, the 20,456-square-foot Grand 
Ballroom overlooking the Long Beach shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the aesthetics of the place, more than the numbers, that impress, 
say those who have wandered through. The convention center features a 563-foot 
glass-and-steel atrium, psychedelic wave-patterned carpeting, and brass and 
frosted-glass touches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely gorgeous," says general manager David Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's beauty and central location are beginning to translate into 
business for recession-bitten Long Beach. Though bookings are slow for this 
year, officials say, next year looks a lot brighter, with 47 commitments on the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 " '95 is gangbusters," says Charlie Whitney, vice president for sales at the 
Long Beach Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really excited," says Linda Howell, president of the bureau. "We think 
it's going to make a real difference." EDMUND NEWTON

BUILDER FILES $2.5-MILLION CLAIM, SAYING SCHOOLS RENEGED ON LAND DEAL; 
DEVELOPMENT: WARMINGTON HOMES SAYS ABC BOARD BREACHED AN AGREEMENT ON BUILDING 
61 HOUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Costa Mesa builder has filed a $2.5-million claim accusing the ABC Unified 
school board of reneging on a deal to develop houses on 13 acres near Whitney 
High School in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim filed by Warmington Homes against the district accuses ABC officials 
of breaching an agreement on the building of 61 homes near the high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The builder took legal action after the school board earlier this month 
deadlocked 3 to 3 over a business plan that would have allowed the $18-million 
project to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Cecy Groom, Howard Kwon and Sally Morales Havice opposed the 
plan. Voting in favor were David Montgomery, Robert Hughlett and Dixie 
Primosch. Board member Jim Weisenberger was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's approval of the business plan and transfer of property 
from the district to the developer were the last major hurdles before 
construction. The school board last year approved an agreement to sell 13 acres 
to the developer for $7.7 million, and the Cerritos City Council tentatively 
approved the development this past summer.  
</P>
<P>
 But the project's future became clouded after last November's election, when a 
new board majority came to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom, the school board president, said she opposed the project because 
parents and students had raised safety concerns about a parking lot that have 
never been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are only listening to the community . . . and students," Groom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Warmington officials and their attorneys declined to discuss the claim, which 
is required before a lawsuit can be filed against a public agency. But board 
members who support the development say it would have brought in money to 
repair schools around the district. Warmington planned to give the district 
about $100,000 once the developer had taken over the property, a vacant lot 
next to the Whitney campus. The project's proponents contend the deadlock could 
spell economic doom for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 The board members who voted against the project "put us into a 
multimillion-dollar liability situation," board member Dixie Primosch said. 
"They violated the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal dispute could further cloud ABC's financial future, county school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Office of Education recently approved the district's budget for the 
1994-95 school year, lifted a freeze on a teachers' contract, and removed a 
fiscal adviser assigned by the county earlier this year to help draft the 
district's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a sternly worded letter to the district, officials warned that ABC's 
financial problems are not over. Mounting legal fees and an unfavorable court 
decision in the dispute with the developer could affect the district's 
financial health, one official wrote to the district.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH GATE; EFFORT TO REPLACE AZALEA FESTIVAL ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, agenda item No. 12 looked innocuous enough. 
</P>
<P>
 To better reflect South Gate after a decade of abrupt demographic change 
during which Latinos surged to 83% of the population, city staff recommended 
that the City Council approve a carnival date change from March, when the 
annual Azalea Festival is held, to May, and hold a Cinco de Mayo Festival in 
its place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, this date hasn't been a priority in this city," said Mayor 
Albert Robles at last week's meeting, referring to the celebration of the 
anniversary of May 5, 1862 -- the day when Mexican troops expelled the French 
from the city of Puebla. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was surprised, though, when the symbolic effort to replace azaleas 
with choruses of "Viva Mexico!" was shouted down by charges of petty politics 
and cultural favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because there's a Mexican majority in South Gate doesn't mean we have to 
celebrate a holiday that originates all the way in Puebla," said Victorio 
Gutierrez, a South Gate High School teacher who opposed the change. "We have a 
lot of other people in this city -- Salvadorans, Guatemalans and others -- who 
resent being considered Mexican and having to celebrate Mexican holidays." 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents pointed out that the city already celebrates Mexican 
Independence Day, Sept. 16, with a carnival, in addition to its annual 
celebration of July 4. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 1990 U.S. Census, the city has a total population of 86,284, 
71,740 of whom are Latino. Those of Mexican descent are the largest group in 
the Latino community, with 56,252. The city also has 4,754 of Salvadoran 
descent, 2,269 of Guatemalan descent and thousands of other residents descended 
from the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and 
other South American countries. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-year tradition in the city, the annual Azalea Festival honors women over 
the age of 60. The azalea is the city's official flower. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no problem celebrating Cinco de Mayo, we just want the Azalea 
Festival to remain a tradition in South Gate," said Mildred Ward, 75, this 
year's Azalea Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the deluge of complaints about the carnival change, the council 
decided to postpone its vote by one month in hopes of reaching a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's anyone in the city who wants to do away with a festival 
honoring these older women," said City Clerk Nina Banuelos. "We're probably 
just going to have to celebrate both." SIMON ROMERO

<P>
 The Norwalk-La Mirada Unified school board has approved a policy that allows 
officials to sue parents to collect costs of repairing and cleaning up school 
vandalism traced to students. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district has sent bills to parents for damage costs, but the effort 
has been relatively unsuccessful, officials said.Last year, the district paid 
$11,356 to clean up graffiti and other vandalism, but only a small amount was 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Supt. Ginger Shattuck said that under the new policy, the district 
could sue parents and guardians of students in small claims court. Officials 
want to recover not only the cost of repairs or replacement of damaged property 
but also court fees and rewards for information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe citizens are tired of paying tax dollars to repair the vandalism of 
children who have been irresponsible," said board President Rudy Bermudez, who 
proposed the policy. PSYCHE PASCUAL

THEATER REVIEWS; A LIGHT LOOK AT SUBJECT OF MORTALITY; 'JOINED AT THE HEAD' 
ALLOWS MOORPARK COLLEGE'S SMALL CAST TO EXPRESS A WIDE RANGE OF EMOTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If the central character of a literary work is a writer, you can assume the 
piece to be at least partially autobiographical -- most writers don't have 
enough imagination to recast themselves as people with real jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Katherine Butterfield's 1992 "Joined at the Head" is 
clearly based on a crucial experience in her own life. The play, running 
through this weekend at Moorpark College and directed by the theater 
department's Katherine Lewis, is frequently amusing, occasionally touching, and 
imaginatively staged. For those who can find Moorpark College's Forum Theater 
-- always a challenge for anyone not attending the college on a daily basis -- 
it's worth a look-see. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield's surrogate is Maggie (Wendy Berna), who is revisiting her home 
town of Boston while on a book-signing tour to promote her new novel based on 
"the foibles of the father-daughter thing." While there, she's surprised to 
hear from an old boyfriend (James Brough), and even more surprised when he 
suggests that she meet his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a lot in common," he suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 What he is referring to is their sense of humor, but it turns out that Jim 
Burroughs' wife (Sarah Jo Marks) is also named Maggie -- or, probably to make 
the actor understand who in the script he's talking to -- "Maggy." 
</P>
<P>
 Maggy, it turns out, has cancer, possibly terminal. She and Maggie become 
friends over dinner, and when Maggy moves to the hospital, Maggie is forced to 
confront her own mortality. Uncomfortable at the prospect, she . . . well, 
that's the story, but you can count on many Great Truths to be revealed along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie narrates, often speaking directly to the audience. Characters wander on 
and off stage as they become necessary to the story, and that's where much of 
the fun takes place -- Maggie's confrontations with a New-Agey sales clerk 
(Sevrin Mason), a series of fans at a book signing and an unctuous TV interview 
host (Joe Sanfelippo) would be highlights of any play. 
</P>
<P>
 All three principals are fine, shifting through a wide range of emotions as 
the story evolves, though Berna, as Maggie, gets the best lines and the most to 
work with. What? You thought the author would give them to somebody else?

COVER STORY; ALL ROADS IN HORN'S CAREER SEEMED TO LEAD TO CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past two years, the Long Beach-based 38th Congressional District has 
been represented by a flinty academician who carries himself with an air of 
self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 You could say that Steve Horn, 63, had been preparing for a seat in Congress 
for 30 years. A political science professor who has taught a seminar called 
"The Legislative Process" and the owner of a library of 7,000 books on 
Congress, he has been in and out of government service since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn ascribed his election in 1992 to sheer chance -- running in a newly drawn 
congressional district that proved favorable for a moderate Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a native of rural San Benito County in central California, where his 
father, a geologist, built a house with his own hands. "We didn't have 
electricity until I was 10," Horn said. "We got a telephone in 1949. . . . As 
President Eisenhower once said, I guess we were poor but we didn't know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn's earliest political hero was Hiram Johnson, the longtime leader of the 
Progressive Party in California and a reform-minded governor and U.S. senator 
who attacked the Southern Pacific Railroad's political power in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn, who holds a master's degree in public administration from Harvard and a 
doctorate in political science from Stanford, still carries in his wallet index 
cards with quotes from the fiery Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1960s, Horn worked for six years as a legislative assistant to 
Republican Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel of California, then became a senior fellow at 
the Brookings Institution in Washington and later a dean at American University 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, he was appointed president of Cal State Long Beach, a post he held 
for 17 1/2 years. His tenure was marked by some notable achievements, including 
the opening up of the campus to elderly and disabled students. But there was 
also a long-running feud with the school's Academic Senate, which represents 
the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my observation that he did not respect the faculty," says Ben 
Cunningham, a retired journalism professor and former chairman of the Academic 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The group censured Horn twice, in 1973 and 1981, for challenging faculty 
prerogatives such as tenure protections. Horn stepped down from the presidency 
in 1988 after a management review team formed by the Cal State Board of 
Trustees criticized his management skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn made his first bid for Congress in 1988, in a district that extended from 
the Palos Verdes Peninsula to Orange County. He lost in the GOP primary to Dana 
Rohrabacher, who then went on to win the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn is married to Nini Horn, a volunteer in his Washington office who has 
been active in the past in the Long Beach public schools. The couple have a 
son, Stephen Jr., who is managing his father's campaign, and a daughter, 
Marcia, who is a lawyer in Phoenix. Last spring, Horn was found to have 
prostate cancer. But after surgery in May there have been no signs of the 
disease's recurrence, he said. EDMUND NEWTON

COVER STORY; ADVANCED LESSON IN POLY SCI; 2 FORMER PROFESSORS ARE IN TIGHT RACE 
FOR 38TH CONGRESSIONAL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As hard-charging Republicans across the country talk optimistically about 
marching back to Washington with big gains in the House of Representatives -- 
possibly even a majority -- there's one Southeast-area contest where the GOP is 
in a struggle to hold onto one of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) faces a spirited challenge from Cypress College 
associate professor Peter Mathews, 42, a Democrat who is vying to become the 
first American of East Indian descent in Congress since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats say they smell an upset in the 38th Congressional District, which 
includes Long Beach, Signal Hill, Lakewood, Bellflower, Paramount, Downey and 
parts of San Pedro and Wilmington. Not only do registration figures favor the 
party in the district, but Mathews has raised enough money to run a strong 
campaign and has galvanized a corps of youthful volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Seasoned political observers, however, are skeptical. They note that Horn, in 
winning the seat two years ago, showed that his generally moderate views are 
attractive to many registered Democrats. And since taking office, he has 
developed a reputation for paying attention to local issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analyst Charles E. Cook Jr., the Washington-based editor of the Cook 
Political Report, says Mathews' ability to raise money means "he's a guy who's 
credible. But Cook adds: "It doesn't establish him as a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 He still rates Horn as the likely victor. "There's a phrase I keep finding 
myself plugging in here," Cook says of Mathews' chances. "In any other year. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Democratic campaign officials contend that Horn is one of only a 
handful of GOP congressmen who are vulnerable in what is widely being portrayed 
as a banner Republican year. 
</P>
<P>
 Said an official of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 
Washington: "We've got a savvy campaigner in a district that is becoming more 
multiethnic. This is definitely one we're keeping our eye on." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews says Horn's opposition to social spending places him out of touch with 
his district. "Can Horn really represent the middle class and working class 
people of the district, given his philosophy?" Mathews asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn, 63, a former president of Cal State Long Beach with longstanding ties to 
the district, remains quietly confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've kept every promise," Horn says, "and I've worked hard to help the 
country and the people of our district."  
</P>
<P>
 Horn's son and campaign manager, Stephen Horn Jr., concedes that Mathews is a 
strong challenger but contends he's no match for the incumbent. His father, 
Horn Jr. says, benefits from having views that are closer to those of district 
residents than are Mathews'. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people who logically should be with the Democrat are not," Horn Jr. 
says. "A lot of Democrats are either with (the elder Horn) or they're neutral." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the ballot are Libertarian Lester W. Mueller and Peace and Freedom 
candidate Richard K. Green, who together garnered only 355 votes of more than 
70,000 cast in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 For a year now, ever since Mathews declared his candidacy, his campaign 
operatives have been studying the numbers and Horn's record, and they like what 
they see. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Democrats have a distinct edge in registration in the district 
-- 51%, compared to the Republicans' 36%. Many of the Democrats are newly 
registered and liberal-leaning, Mathews contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Democrats add that registration efforts in the past year have 
concentrated on Long Beach, with its campuses and its ethnic voters, rather 
than on the more conservative cities to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 In the June primary, Mathews actually outpolled Horn by more than 7,000 votes, 
though the Democrat was running unopposed and the incumbent faced a challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Democrats say, Horn may have hurt himself by crossing 
party lines to vote for the Clinton Administration's crime bill, and by defying 
labor unions and Ross Perot supporters to back the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 His support of the crime bill could hurt him with members of his own party, 
Mathews supporters speculate (while conceding that it could bolster his 
Democratic support). 
</P>
<P>
 Horn's NAFTA vote, the Democrats say, has alienated the district's Perot 
voters -- most of whom supported Horn last time -- and has prompted especially 
enthusiastic labor support for Mathews, who has taken an anti-NAFTA stand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of this amounts to a trend-bucking race in this widely proclaimed GOP 
year, contends Mathews' campaign manager, Noah Mamet. "What we have is one of 
only eight or 10 (House) seats (across the nation) where a Democrat stands to 
beat a Republican incumbent," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But various political observers insist that such factors as the Democratic 
advantage in voter registration may be of little significance in a district 
where many Democrats are conservatives who have not hesitated to vote 
Republican in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lakewood and Downey, for example, many Democrats were strong supporters of 
Ronald Reagan. Democratic voters in those cities often have more of a 
traditional attachment to their party than a practical one, says Donald Waldie, 
Lakewood's public information officer. Increasingly, says Waldie, these 
Democrats are becoming "more conservative in practice if not Republican in 
registration." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Horn won election two years ago with strong Democratic support, 
outdrawing even the party's presidential candidate, Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Some prominent local Democrats, citing Horn's strong focus on local concerns 
the past two years, are sitting out the race. "I'm trying to stay out of it," 
said one well-known Long Beach Democrat. "I'm not super-impressed with Mathews. 
I think Horn has worked his ass off for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn was a visible leader in the successful effort to keep the Long Beach 
Naval Shipyard in operation as the federal base closing commission announced 
shutdowns elsewhere. He was also outspoken in fighting cutbacks in orders for 
McDonnell Douglas' C-17 military cargo jets, which are made at a Long Beach 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the NAFTA vote, despite the remarks by some disgruntled Perot 
supporters that "we'll remember in November," it appears to have been 
overshadowed by other issues. In fact, United We Stand America, the political 
watchdog group that grew out of Perot's 1992 presidential campaign, gives Horn 
a "B" rating on the basis of eight key congressional votes, according to a 
spokesman for the group in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Edwards, a Long Beach clinical psychologist who is the district 
coordinator for United We Stand America, said that although the group does not 
endorse candidates, many local members are supporting Horn because of his stand 
in favor of campaign finance reform and other issues that are high on the Perot 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a few members who will go for Mathews because of NAFTA," Edwards 
said. "I personally like many of the things that Horn has proposed." 
</P>
<P>
 The 38th Congressional District -- which cuts a broad swath between the Los 
Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers, from the Long Beach shoreline to the northern 
edge of Downey -- is predominantly middle class and more than 75% white. It has 
been deeply affected by California's lingering recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's major employer, McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Douglas Aircraft Co. 
in Long Beach, has laid off more than 30,000 workers since 1990. Meanwhile, the 
Long Beach Naval Station recently closed down, with the loss of about 1,000 
jobs and an estimated annual economic impact of $1 billion. A major 
preoccupation within the district is saving the Long Beach Naval Shipyard from 
a new round of Defense Department cuts next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Forums featuring the two candidates have been low-key affairs, with 
disagreements about health care and economic policy couched in academic terms. 
But there are hints that things could turn nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 At a debate last week at Cal State Long Beach's student union, Horn tweaked 
Mathews for the way the Democrat is financing his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn has adamantly refused contributions from political action committees, 
whereas Mathews has refused only corporate PAC money. Noting that Mathews has 
taken contributions from labor unions, Horn said: "He won't take corporate 
money, but he'll take anything else that's loose on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews struck back at Horn's record at the school, charging that there had 
been budget deficits during Horn's tenure as president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why was he forced to resign because of budgetary problems?" Mathews demanded. 
"Why was he censured twice by the Academic Senate?" 
</P>
<P>
 Horn was ready for what he termed "a little slur." He read a letter from the 
university's controller, declaring "there was no deficit" in 1988, when Horn 
was accused of mismanagement by a review team of the Cal State trustees and 
forced to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews also attacked Horn's endorsement last month of the so-called Contract 
With America, a 10-point list of issues that Republican congressional leaders 
said their party would push for if it gains control of the Senate and House. 
The issues included congressional term limits, welfare cuts and a stronger 
military, as well as support for a reduction in capital gains and corporate 
investment taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Such measures, Mathews contended, would benefit the rich while forcing cuts in 
programs that serve the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 On economic issues, Horn favors tax incentives to promote innovative 
manufacturing ideas and strict caps on federal spending. Mathews wants to close 
"corporate tax loopholes" and squeeze more taxes out of the affluent -- those 
who make $200,000 a year or more -- to pay for a middle-class tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the most recent figures from the Federal Election Commission, 
Horn had raised $335,165 to Mathews' $136,893 as of June 30. But Mathews' 
campaign, which has been successfully tapping a national network of East Indian 
professionals, now has more cash on hand -- $143,000 -- than any other 
Democratic congressional challenger in the state, according to Democratic 
campaign officials. 
</P>
<P>
 To his donors, Mathews emphasizes ethnic issues, criticizing Horn's vote for 
an amendment to block foreign aid to India because of human rights violations. 
"Indian Americans need someone in Congress who understands Indian issues," 
Mathews wrote in one appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 If he was elected, Mathews would be the first person of Indian heritage 
elected to Congress since Rep. Dalip Singh Saund (D-Imperial Valley), who 
served from 1957 to 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most political consultants aren't impressed with Mathews' chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are Democrats in the district, but very conservative Democrats," says 
local consultant Jeff Adler. "People register that way because maybe their 
parents and grandparents were Democrats, but they're just as happy voting for a 
Republican who's reflective of certain conservative basic values." 38th

COVER STORY; NEVER A LIBERAL, MATHEWS SAYS, BUT AN 'ANTI-POLITICIAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Political science professor Peter Mathews, 42, is considered a charismatic 
figure around the Cypress College campus, where he has taught since 1986. The 
Indian-born Democratic candidate has always talked in sweeping terms about the 
big issues and how he would address them if he were elected to office, former 
students say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never any doubt what his views were," says Steve Katz, a former 
student who now teaches seventh-graders in La Mirada. "He was very liberal. I 
felt he was very focused on his political career." 
</P>
<P>
 As a candidate for Congress in the 38th District, Mathews has sought to hone a 
more moderate image. He now supports, among other conservative positions, a 
national balanced budget amendment and the "three strikes" provision of federal 
and state crime bills. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also changed his mind on the death penalty, which he used to oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did some soul-searching and looked at the evidence," he says of his support 
for capital punishment in some cases. "There were these violent crimes, random 
violence, and I felt we had to send a message." 
</P>
<P>
 Such positions have raised eyebrows among local Democrats who viewed Mathews 
as a traditional liberal in his political philosophy. The problem, he says, is 
that he had been incorrectly pigeonholed. 
</P>
<P>
 He was never a liberal, Mathews says, but a "progressive Democrat" and an 
"anti-politician." 
</P>
<P>
 On the stump, Mathews has proved an affable hand-shaker. He passes out signed 
cards pledging that, if elected, he will work for welfare reform and 
middle-class tax cuts and support abortion rights and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, who has taken a leave of absence from Cypress to campaign, came to 
the United States as a 10-year-old. His father, clinical psychologist Paul 
Mathews, worked on rehabilitation programs in Wisconsin, Maryland and New York, 
before settling in Denton, Tex., near Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there, at the University of North Texas, that Mathews earned bachelor's 
degrees in psychology and political science and a master's degree in political 
science. He moved to Northern California in 1976 to teach political science at 
City College of San Francisco and Foothill College. 
</P>
<P>
 He got his first taste of electoral politics in the Bay Area, winning a seat 
on the North Fair Oaks Advisory Council, which advised the San Mateo Board of 
Supervisors on zoning and planning issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, who is single, has since tried unsuccessfully for a City Council seat 
in the Northern California community of Mountain View, for an Assembly seat in 
Orange County and, in the last congressional primary, for the Democratic 
nomination in the 38th District. He ran second in that race to then-Long Beach 
City Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, who in turn was defeated in the general 
election by Republican Steve Horn. EDMUND NEWTON

 The St. Paul High football team has played only one league game, but received 
a big boost for a shot at the Del Rey League title with a 10-2 victory over 
Loyola on Friday before a home crowd of 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Paul Coach Marijon Ancich called the victory a hard-fought team effort -- 
and a matter of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're one of the best teams in Western America," Ancich said about Loyola 
(4-1). "They are physically superior in every way. It was miraculous we came 
out on top." 
</P>
<P>
 The Swordsmen, who converted seven times on third or fourth down, marched 80 
yards in 18 plays after receiving the opening kickoff and scored the game's 
only touchdown on an 11-yard run by quarterback Gerry Ceballos. The drive was 
kept alive by a roughing the kicker penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 A recovery of a fumbled Loyola punt by Damon Tomeo set up St. Paul's other 
score, a 32-yard field goal by Andy Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved St. Paul a step closer to a possible showdown with Bishop 
Amat, the top-ranked team in the nation, for the league title in the 
regular-season finale Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancich, though, isn't looking much further than Friday night's home game 
against Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we are is survivors," Ancich said. "It's a combat zone week to week (in 
the Del Rey League). As a coach, all you can do is hope to win three games to 
finish third and make it to the playoffs." MAKING A SPLASH 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Wilson High water polo team defeated Corona del Mar, 11-6, in 
the championship of the Southern California Invitational Saturday at Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Wright, who had four goals in the final, and Pat Cochran of Wilson were 
selected the co-most valuable players of the two-day tournament. Goalkeeper 
Nick Hill had 21 saves and Matt Armato scored three goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson (12-2), the No. 1 team in the Southern Section Division I rankings, 
beat San Diego Coronado in the semifinals, 16-10, behind six goals by Wright 
and five by Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright and Cochran scored four goals each in the Bruins' 15-7 first-round 
victory over El Dorado on Friday. Armato had five goals in an 18-12 
quarterfinal win over Harvard-Westlake. COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach City College football team defeated Pasadena City College, 
53-24, to record its largest victory over the Lancers in the 46-game series, 
which began in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 Neo Aoga completed 19 of 40 passes for 318 yards for Long Beach (5-1), which 
improved to 2-0 in the Mission Conference North Division. Kevin McKenzie had an 
87-yard kickoff return and Richie Ashley returned a blocked punt 25 yards for a 
touchdown against host Pasadena (2-2-1, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie and Ashley, along with wide receiver Joe Johnson (seven catches for 
145 yards and two touchdowns), were named South Coast Conference players of the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach will play host to Palomar (3-2-0, 1-1) on Saturday night at 7.
