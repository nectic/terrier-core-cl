THE PRONOUNCEMENTS OF PAULINE; MOVIE LOVERS HAVEN'T NECESSARILY AGREED WITH 
CRITIC PAULINE KAEL -- BUT THE MORE HEATED THE DEBATE, THE MORE SHE FELT SHE

 'Get out of here with your cowboys boots," screamed the anonymous letter sent 
to Pauline Kael shortly after she became film critic for the New Yorker in 
1967. Recognizing it as the handiwork of one of that magazine's contributors 
"whose prose seemed to be rolled like an English lawn," Kael wasn't irritated 
-- just surprised. "I didn't have cowboy boots," she said, recalling the 
incident in a recent interview, "I've never had cowboy boots." 
</P>
<P>
 To anyone who has ever met this petite, personable woman, it's rather hard to 
imagine her as the Billy the Kid of belles-lettres. But once you start reading 
her reviews, the image of a pistol-packin' Pauline becomes rather irresistible. 
If she isn't rounding up a posse to fight off Oliver Stone and his band of 
pseudo-intellectual rustlers, then she's forming a citizens' committee to run 
Robert Altman for sheriff. In fact, just about every Western archetype fits 
Pauline Kael -- except schoolmarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Keeps," a massive anthology culled from 10 previously published 
collections of her writings (most of which are now out of print), gives ample 
evidence as to why, for the past 30 years, Pauline Kael has been such a 
singularly lively voice in a profession given to ad-copy puffery and dust-dry 
platitudes. Her up-close-and-first-personal style (she claims her goal is "the 
sound of spoken language") and offhand wit (describing French actress Miou-Miou 
as "the Brigitte Bardot the cat dragged in"), has made her the most readable of 
critics -- if not always the most lovable. You don't win friends and influence 
people by calling Fellini's "8 1/2" "a hack's notion of Freudian anxiety and 
wish-fulfillment," or declaring Dino De Laurentiis' 1977 remake of "King Kong" 
to be "a pop classic that can stand in our affections right next to the 
original version." But then, to put it in the rhetorical form she loves (and 
her severest critics despise), who ever read Pauline Kael expecting to agree 
with her? 
</P>
<P>
 "The hate mail piled up," she recalls in the book's introduction, speaking of 
the atmosphere surrounding the mid-point of her tenure at the New Yorker. 
"Then, curiously, some of the readers began to enjoy hating me. Maybe my 
conversational American tone brought them into a closer relationship than 
they'd been accustomed to; maybe what they had first experienced as a crude 
invasion from the pop world began to be something they looked forward to." Or 
maybe they simply came to realize that Kael wasn't just giving them her 
straight-from-the-gut unvarnished opinion, she was virtually demanding that 
they respond in kind: immerse themselves in film as fully and passionately as 
she did, and talk about what they saw once they'd surfaced. And that demand -- 
to use one of Kael's favorite phrases -- was turning them on. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Bonnie and Clyde" appeared in 1967, Kael wrote: "The audience is alive 
to it. Our experience as we watch it has some connection with the way we 
reacted to movies in childhood: how we came to love them and feel they were 
ours -- not an art that we learned over the years to appreciate but simply and 
immediately ours." Kael was smack on top of the zeitgeist , explaining why this 
comedy-drama about Depression-era bank robbers had become a rallying point for 
young educated audiences of the Vietnam generation. But for the better part of 
her career Kael, more often than not, found herself not at the center of 
things, but off to one side. 
</P>
<P>
 When her taste coincided with that of the masses, on blockbusters like "E.T.," 
"Tootsie" and "The Way We Were," Kael had no trouble getting anyone to listen 
to her. But she was only able to spur a few of her readers in the direction of 
what she aptly called "minority movies" such as "The Night of the Shooting 
Stars" and "Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000." Far more of them lined up 
for films Kael despised such as "A Clockwork Orange" and "Midnight Express." 
And there were precious few takers when she went out on a limb praising the 
likes of "Pennies From Heaven" and "Casualties of War." You can sense Kael's 
frustration with all of this in her position-paper-styled essays ("Trash Art 
and the Movies," "Fear of Movies," "Why Are Movies so Bad?"), where she scores 
both the industry and the audiences for their lack of adventurousness. But no 
critic, no matter how well-known or widely read, can influence the movie-making 
powers-that-be or buck the effect of their enormous marketing and promotional 
powers. And when a critic is as deliberately contentious as Kael, it's hard to 
credit how descriptive cliches such as "most powerful" and "most influential" 
have been attached to her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years Kael has come to be the elder statesperson for a group of 
younger critics -- Michael Sragow, Peter Rainer and David Ansen among them. One 
of the most hilarious spectacles in fourth estate chat circles is listening to 
the ominous tones her critics take when they talk about these "Kaelites" -- as 
if they were a band of Kali-worshiping thugs out of Gunga Din. Though some of 
them try their best, none of these acolytes has ever managed to write like 
Kael. Few of them even agree with most of her opinions. And none of them have 
any clout at the box office. Moreover, neither does she. 
</P>
<P>
 A Kael rave has never added so much as a penny to a project's coffers. So much 
for "power." As for "influence," in 1979, when Warren Beatty asked her to come 
to work for Paramount Pictures as a script adviser, the critic who expended 
more ink than any other about the way Hollywood should be run, lasted all of 
five months. Clearly Kael knew she was better off back home in Great 
Barrington, Mass., writing about the "beautiful pipe dream of a movie" Robert 
Altman had made in "McCabe and Mrs. Miller"; the awe-inspiring "vision of Hell" 
Jean-Luc Godard had conjured up in "Weekend"; the way Louis Malle makes sure 
that "everything doesn't hit you on the noggin" in "Atlantic City"; and "the 
enormous pleasure to see a movie that's really about something" she found in 
"My Beautiful Laundrette." 
</P>
<P>
 If Pauline Kael has any "power" or "influence" it is here; contributing to the 
literature attendant on works that will withstand the test of time, rather than 
the "bottom line." You'll find all these examples of Kael at her best in "For 
Keeps," along with her witty profile of Cary Grant ("The Man From Dream City"), 
her refreshingly unstuffy tributes to silent classics ("Intolerance," 
"Napoleon"), and her even more refreshing attacks on overstuffed "prestige 
pictures" ("Gandhi," "On Golden Pond"). But you will also find what can only be 
called Kael at her worst -- essays where critical principles are so pulled out 
of shape that they begin to dovetail into ethical violations. And it is because 
of such violations -- which have nothing to do with simple matters of opinion 
-- that Kael, for all her rhetorical authority, falls short as a critic. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a constant refrain running through "For Keeps"; a hymn of praise 
directed at films that "don't take themselves too seriously." There's nothing 
particularly alarming about this notion, when Kael is using it to promote the 
"vitality and distinctive flavor" of commercial Hollywood films; "the freshness 
and spirit that make (them) unlike those of any other country." Not 
unreasonably, she has often found them preferable to the art-house cinema 
favored by friends of her class; "academic and professional people," whose 
basic indifference to Hollywood has always annoyed her to no end. At one level 
her cavils have consisted of little more than taunting these shrinking violets 
for avoiding the likes of "Hud," "Convoy," "Eyes of Laura Mars" or the 1978 
remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" -- slickly made products 
unaccountably praised by Kael to the skies. But there is something else at work 
beneath the surface, this epater l'academie effrontery: an almost instinctive 
hatred of seriousness. "An actor's scowl, a small subversive gesture, a dirty 
remark that someone tosses off with a mock-innocent face, and the world makes a 
bit of sense," Kael remarks in one of her position-paper essays. It's seems 
like a perfectly reasonable observation, until you put it alongside others, 
such as her complaint about "Blade Runner": "The moviemakers haven't learned 
that wonderful, simple trick of bringing a character closer to the audience by 
giving him a joke or having him overreact to one." Surely a critic capable of 
appreciating rich, multifaceted, works such as "The Golden Coach," "The 
Leopard" and "Once Upon a Time in America" knows that quality is scarcely 
incumbent on cheap, crowd-pleasing gimmicks. Yet throughout "For Keeps," Kael 
keeps running to the shelter of films she calls "trash" -- as if doing penance 
for ever having had anything nice to say about Ingmar Bergman. This would just 
be a minor quirk if Kael hadn't lost her bearings when writing about a film 
that was both serious and full of "vitality and spirit": Orson Welles' "Citizen 
Kane." "Raising Kane," her two-part 1971 broadside against Welles set off a 
firestorm of controversy that hasn't subsided to this day. And the heart of 
that firestorm is Kael's peculiar notion of the value of films that "don't take 
themselves seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Welles' classic 1941 study of a the life and times of a newspaper tycoon 
closely modeled on William Randolph Hearst has been hailed by countless critics 
as both a great satire and a complex psychological study. To Kael it was "a 
comic strip about Hearst" and precious little more. Seizing on remarks made by 
the secretary of co-scriptwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz that Welles "wasn't 
around" when the first draft of the script was written, Kael went on to declare 
that Welles had affixed his name on the credits of a script he did not write. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I'd like to know what was all that stuff I was always typing for Mr. 
Welles!" shot back the director's secretary, Katherine Trosper (as quoted in 
Peter Bogdanovich's 1992 book, "This Is Orson Welles"). Why had Kael, so 
sympathetic to Welles in 1967 when "Falstaff" (a.k.a. "Chimes at Midnight") was 
released to hostile reviews, suddenly turned on him? It was simple, really. If 
"Kane" is to matter for her then it can only be a film that "doesn't take 
itself seriously" -- a joke. And Welles, the "boy genius," lauded by scholars 
for "Kane's" visual richness and dramatic complexity, can't be that joke's 
teller. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is nothing next to Kael's most outrageous statement: that in the 
famous newspaper office, Welles, shown eating a large meal, "was obviously 
caught by the camera crew, and which, to be a 'good sport' he had to use." 
Orson Welles, the most self-conscious filmmaker the world has ever known, 
"caught" by his camera crew, cin e ma verite- style? Does she really expect 
anybody to believe this? Yes. For in Kael's view, Welles, unable to write a 
joke, is ideally cast as the butt of one. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are times where such fudging won't work, and jokes can't help. 
One such case is"Shoah," Kael's review of which is conspicuously absent from 
"For Keeps" (though you can find it in her 1989 collection, "Hooked"). For the 
first time in her career she asked "for the forbearance of readers for a 
dissenting view of a film that is widely regarded as a masterpiece." There is 
no objective reason why Kael should feel ambivalent about casting a cold eye on 
Claude Lanzmann's documentary about the Nazi extermination camps, in which a 
relatively small amount of simple information is inflated into a numbingly 
repetitive nine hours. But it isn't length or boredom that troubled Kael. She 
is upset by a scene in "Shoah" in which Lanzmann interviews Polish peasants -- 
showing them to be every bit as anti-Semitic today as they were in the Nazi 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heart of (Lanzmann's) obsession appears to be to show you that the 
Gentiles will do it again to the Jews if they get the chance," wails Kael. 
"When you come out, you're likely to feel dazed, and confirmed in all your 
worst fears." Exactly. The anti-Semitism "Shoah" uncovers unnerved her to the 
core. But Kael, a writer who always prided herself on her ability to dig deeply 
into the meaning of her responses to films, found herself unable to go the 
extra mile and see what stood behind her revulsion to "Shoah." 
</P>
<P>
 For a critic whose misfires are as fascinating as her bull's-eyes, it's 
telling that Kael has chosen to reprint "Raising Kane" without any amendments 
or even acknowledgments of the controversy it engendered, while at the same 
time expunging her "Shoah" review from the permanent record. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes you've just got to take yourself seriously.

AN EVER-CHANGING PARTNERSHIP; A JOINT PORTRAIT OF FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR 
ROOSEVELT FOLLOWS THE COUPLE THROUGH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CRISES; NO ORDINARY 
TIME; FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR ROOSEVELT: THE HOME FRONT IN WORLD WAR II, BY DORIS 
KEARNS GOODWIN (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $30; 636 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Blanche Wiesen Cook, Blanche Wiesen Cook's Eleanor Roosevelt (Viking) won 
the 1992 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for biography. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "No Ordinary Time" is no ordinary book. Filled with new and exciting material, 
it is the first joint portrait of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt during the war 
years. Since it is still possible, even routine, to read about F.D.R.'s 
presidency as if Eleanor had nothing to do with the best of Franklin's 
decisions, it is welcome and refreshing to find their political partnership at 
the center of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 I have long suspected that F.D.R.'s most earnest biographers avoided the war 
years because those years revealed a leader they preferred not to study: one 
who refused to confront many issues that have come to define the 20th Century, 
from race relations and Hitler's atrocities to the dominance of what President 
Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex. Goodwin's decision to 
present E.R.'s moral activism, to explore the tensions it aroused and to follow 
the ever-changing Roosevelt partnership through significant public and private 
crises, transcends that problem. And she tells a compelling story. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something here for virtually everyone interested in public lives, 
history and the making of a political marriage. There is new material about 
F.D.R.'s friendships with the women in his life: Lucy Mercer Rutherford (the 
woman who almost broke up the Roosevelt marriage in 1918), Marguerite (Missy) 
LeHand (his secretary and companion for over 20 years) and Princess Martha of 
Norway. There are vivid details about America's mobilization for war: steel 
ingots, ship tonnage, even the decision not to ration girdles despite the 
rubber shortage (at first the government proposed exercise as an alternative, 
but women were then wedded to girdles). Above all, there were those fabulous 
rubber and aluminum drives. 
</P>
<P>
 F.D.R. understood, Goodwin tells us, that once Americans were aroused, the war 
would be won on the home front. He also knew how to reassure the country with 
his warm, calm, reassuring demeanor. Goodwin shows how F.D.R. inspired trust, 
confidence and hope throughout the Depression and war. 
</P>
<P>
 But as united as Americans were during World War II, there was no agreement 
about the nature of American democracy, or the purpose for which the arsenal of 
democracy was forged. Today, at century's end, the old divisions continue to 
haunt us. Virtually every disagreement between Eleanor and Franklin remains a 
vital and controversial aspect of our political life. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin's vigorously researched journey through World War II, its aftermath 
and antecedents, raises provocative questions: Since F.D.R. guided a faltering 
domestic economy into a mighty militarized economy to meet the challenges of 
World War II, where does that leave us today? Trapped by the ongoing racial and 
ethnic hatreds that forged the world's most violent century, what have we 
learned from the past? How do we write about women and men as partners in the 
family drama? 
</P>
<P>
 Filled with vivid vignettes and randy stories, Goodwin's book addresses these 
issues in terms of F.D.R. the political genius and E.R. his goad and political 
conscience. Although one senses that Goodwin actually agrees with E.R. on many 
issues -- including her opposition to big business's domination of the 
mobilization and her opposition to racial discrimination -- too often she 
presents Eleanor as merely a pestering thorn in the side of a brilliant 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to E.R., Goodwin has reified the Victorian scold: unattractive, 
unhappy, insecure. No wonder F.D.R. turned to other women: He was married to 
Eleanor. All the traditional myths so easily fortified: Marital troubles are 
the woman's fault. As for Franklin's infidelities: "The hidden springs of 
Eleanor's insecurity had disrupted her marriage from the very beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 It is as if the last decades of scholarship by and about women, from Virginia 
Woolf to Carolyn Heilbrun, have taught us nothing about writing a woman's life. 
</P>
<P>
 However moody and intense, E.R. was neither lonely nor unhappy. But the folks 
with whom she related and felt secure are given short shrift here. Her women 
allies and personal friends, when referred to at all, are demeaned: Sara Delano 
Roosevelt allegedly considering them "unkempt, unconventional, unnatural." Earl 
Miller, Eleanor's great friend, is not even granted a walk-on here although he 
spent most of the war years as a naval commander posted in Brooklyn and 
bivouacked in E.R.'s New York City apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The lively narrative leads the reader from subject to subject, confirming 
again: Eleanor would not leave Franklin alone. When least wanted, there she 
was, looking sour, with some problem to be fixed. When E.R. was insistent in 
her opposition to big business's domination of the burgeoning 
military-industrial complex, Goodwin observes: "Eleanor was constitutionally 
incapable of leaving the President alone." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not as if Eleanor worried about slipcovers, or cigarette burns ruining 
the rugs. She intruded with important realities: Jewish lives lost to Nazis; 
African American lives lost to lynchers; Japanese American citizens rounded up 
and sent to camps; migrant workers, all the neglected folk still unattended by 
the promise of the New Deal; housing, health care, education for all. Goodwin 
acknowledges E.R.'s contributions, and explains F.D.R.'s inactivity: "The 
President was far more cautious than his wife. While Eleanor thought in terms 
of what should be done, Franklin thought in terms of what could be done." 
</P>
<P>
 But if we accept Goodwin's account, and agree that F.D.R. was a great leader, 
how do we understand his inaction when it came to U.S. race relations and 
European refugees? Is American leadership enslaved by public opinion polls? 
Reflecting upon F.D.R.'s decision to run for a third term, Goodwin quotes a 
group of liberal journalists who noted: "The President could have had anything 
on God's earth he wanted if he had the guts to ask for it in the open. . . . 
The people trust him and the people want to follow him: nobody, no matter how 
whole-souled, can follow a man who will not lead, who will not stand up and be 
counted, who will not say openly what we all know he thinks privately." 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mandate of political leadership not translate to the most crying 
issues of state? Why, after all, did F.D.R. refuse to reach out and actually 
find sanctuary for Europe's refugees? What, for example, are we to understand 
from Goodwin's report of E.R.'s opposition to Breckenridge Long, the well-known 
Jew-hater who insisted that refugees could not be admitted because every ship 
"was honeycombed with spies"? 
</P>
<P>
 "Long had come to the unshakable conviction," Goodwin writes, "that the 
admission of refugees would endanger national security, since the Germans were 
using visitor visas to send spies and foreign agents abroad. Every single one 
of the now defeated countries, according to Long, had been honeycombed with 
spies and fifth-column activities. There was some truth to his claims." 
</P>
<P>
 Can Goodwin really mean that? She makes it even worse by her assertion that 
F.D.R. worked "behind the scenes to let more people in." Alas, all the evidence 
we have contradicts that notion. The fact is that F.D.R. kept promoting 
Breckenridge Long, who had one agenda: Keep the Jews out. On Sept. 1, 1939, the 
day Hitler invaded Poland, F.D.R. named Long assistant secretary of state for 
emergency war matters. On Jan. 23, 1940, F.D.R. promoted Long again: He now 
supervised 23 of 42 divisions of the State Department, including the visa 
section, legal division, and foreign service personnel board. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, E.R. protested. Goodwin acknowledges the tragedy: "Eleanor's 
failure to force her husband to admit more refugees remained, her son Jimmy 
later said, 'her deepest regret at the end of her life.' " But this was not 
"Eleanor's failure." It was F.D.R.'s failure. And so the war between the 
Roosevelts intensified. Every time E.R. brought up a moral issue, F.D.R. became 
impatient, irritated. She was "tenacious." But F.D.R. increasingly ignored her. 
</P>
<P>
 In Goodwin's familial drama, E.R. became evermore the ethical goad. Although 
Goodwin illuminates many gripping moments along the painful path toward civil 
rights, one wants more context. After all, E.R. was the first person close to 
power who made the connection: segregation and white supremacy here, fascism 
there. And she was an activist who embraced an already established biracial 
political movement very much underway during the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that E.R. as well as F.D.R. understood that politics is not an 
isolated individualist adventure. She worked with a different constituency. He 
worked with the Dixiecrats in power. She worked with radicals committed to 
ending that power. The 1940s civil rights movement was not limited to E.R. and 
the African American leaders she admired such as Mary McLeod Bethune and Walter 
White: It included those much maligned (and here omitted) white progressives 
who challenged the poll tax, segregation, white supremacy. They forged the 
Southern Conference on Human Welfare, and helped in fact create the New South: 
Lillian Smith, Virginia Foster Durr, Joseph Gelders, Lucy Randolph Mason, James 
Anderson Dombrowski, among many others. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the ongoing bitterness of America's quest for racial justice, one craves 
additional signposts from the author as we walk through these critical and 
enduring issues. After all, Goodwin is a Democrat, long identified with the 
best and the brightest. Not until the end of the book do we read that Goodwin 
considers E.R.'s commitment to justice, civil rights, dignity for all, not only 
influential, occasionally "decisive," but also "affirming." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of these pages, we discover F.D.R.'s abiding admiration for his 
wife. Not only did he know he needed her to win the heart of the nation, he 
considered her "the most extraordinarily interesting woman" he knew. This fact, 
however, acknowledges an even more complex partnership than the one discussed 
here.

RICHARD EDER: A PHILOSOPHY OF UNEASE; OR, HOW THE TRUTH CAN REVEAL ITSELF AT 
THE HARDWARE STORE; THE VILLAGE: A NOVEL, BY DAVID MAMET (LITTLE, BROWN: 
$21.95; 248 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Mamet uses the people and voices in "The Village" as if he were hanging 
stars in the sky; not to illumine themselves but to reveal the world by their 
faint light. As with the speakers in "Under Milk Wood" and "Our Town," and 
despite their savory individuality, it is a choral and not an individual effect 
that he aims at. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Llareggub and Grovers Corners, Mamet's unnamed northern New England 
village is an emblem of human life and community; at once universal and 
imprinted with the author's intimate spoor. Dylan Thomas' nutshell cosmos 
vibrated to Welsh jokes and inklings; Thornton Wilder's was American Gothic 
with a small smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Mamet's is a place of male exploits, comradeship and anguish, with women as 
wraiths. Iron David's epiphanies take place in a garage, a hardware store, 
hunting, fishing, cutting cordwood, sniffing out the weather, navigating gun 
fairs and in bitten-off rumination larded with sociable silences. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-dozen characters and story fragments percolate through "The Village." 
Among them are Dickie, a melancholy hardware-store proprietor whose failing 
business epitomizes the decline of local life; Lynn, an old hunter; Trooper, 
the peace officer; and Martin, who runs the local garage and is the 
unself-conscious upholder and celebrator of the spirit of the place. 
</P>
<P>
 A more self-conscious and less secure celebrator is Henry, who threads his way 
through the book, watching, wondering and speculating. He is the outsider who 
comes to settle and can't quite, the intellectual who wants to be an adept 
countryman, a spirit of air who works at becoming a spirit of earth, and might 
almost succeed except that he spins theories around everything he does. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry is approximately an alter ego for Mamet, a playwright and screenwriter 
who has published numerous sketches on many of the country themes and male 
mysteries that are fictionalized in "The Village." Henry splits wood and takes 
such aesthetic pleasure in it (it warms you three times, he says: when you chop 
it, when you burn it and when you regard it stacked in great reassuring cords) 
that a disconcerting abstraction envelops the fine concreteness of the writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Equipped with all the right gear and studied craft, he goes skiing in the 
woods, taking a Hemingway-like pride in his outdoors expertise. He gets lost, 
wet, near-frozen; a Hemingway who shoots himself in the foot. In something 
close to self-pity, he finally reaches the lit kitchen window through which he 
sees his wife -- a near-widow, did she but realize -- obliviously chatting on 
the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't let her realize; a large silence has come over them. Rather than talk 
to her, he prefers to chop wood, try to hang out with the men at the hardware 
store and warm himself with his own wool-gathered images. She waits in bed for 
him; he starts to tell her of an incident during the day, forgets what he is 
saying, goes to dream in the bathroom. The marriage is not so much shattering 
as evaporating. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry has his good moments as a kind of holy fool. There is a passage where he 
makes his way into an auction tent with a container of coffee, a doughnut and a 
prospectus; all three in peril as he teeters his chair on the hummocky ground. 
Installed, he feels safe, a real person: Nobody will disturb him or question 
the congruity of his being there. 
</P>
<P>
 A little insecurity goes a long way, though; especially in view of Henry's 
overcompensating efforts to be expert and at macho ease with guns, axes, 
fishing rods and the locals. More Catholic than the Pope, we may think, or 
perhaps: more hunnish than Attila. The ironies are fine but Mamet is not simply 
being ironic. He is, in fact, as uneasy as his characters; it is an unease that 
lies at the heart of his distinctive style. 
</P>
<P>
 Mamet's writing is infused with a poetry that manages to be simultaneously 
hard-boiled and delicate. The two extremes sound against each other with a 
striking but sometimes disconcerting hollow in the middle. He has three finely 
gliding wheels and lacks a fourth. Whoosh! we go, and sometimes: Bump! The bump 
is intentional but not always under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Too close to the author, perhaps, Henry's bumpiness -- woodsman to winsome and 
back -- can evoke mild carsickness. The book's best moments come when the 
author goes directly to some of the other villagers and tells their fragments 
of story. Mamet's gift for the awkward poetry of real speech shines as an old 
man recalls Charlie Taggart, who knew not only what the weather was going to do 
but how birds and deer and fish would respond to it: 
</P>
<P>
 "He would say, 'Goin' up Loach Dam for pickerel,' and we would go up there. 
B'fore a rain. Eh? Get there, nobody had took nothing out of the lake, all that 
morning. Clouds coming in, f'r the North. We go out. He ups, and I don't know, 
what the hell he puts on his line. Thwap . There's your fish. Bait. He was 
usin' some kind of paste . Baits up again. Thwap. 'N'other pickerel, so on. 
Weather front, closing in. . . . Reels his line in, shuts the tackle box, 
'that's it.' Nobody caught a fish, b'fore or after we was there. N'that's a 
small thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who runs the garage, has a bent for speculative lyricism that is 
distantly akin to Henry's. But the difference is very great. Martin belongs to 
the place; the phrase with which he acknowledges the beauty of a climb is as 
rooted in him as the generations of hunting wisdom that have him crouch 
motionless an entire day, for a deer to appear by a stream that he has studied. 
And when it does, he thinks: "Well all I have done is wait for you, but I have 
waited for you." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a moving portrait of the failing, slow-moving, meditative Dickie 
taking comfort from the well-stocked wood stove in the hardware store where a 
customer will come in for 79 cents of nails and charge it. He and his wife, he 
calculates, have been working for 81 cents an hour each; the bank will 
foreclose. 
</P>
<P>
 In many of the encounters in "The Village" -- three off-duty policemen 
drinking, a garage mechanic talking to a friend while his son does his homework 
-- it is the scene itself, rather than what is said, that counts. Also what is 
unsaid. It is the silences between men, the uncompleted sentence, the unspoken 
reply that constitute male understanding; in contrast to the verbal 
explicitness that marks understanding among women. Mamet's women are shadows, 
barely reflected in the men's talk. They talk of women as if telling ghost 
stories, as if exorcising a fear.

GUIDED BY A VISION; HOW BERT CORONA MET THE CHALLENGES OF LATINO LEADERSHIP; 
MEMORIES OF CHICANO HISTORY: THE LIFE AND NARRATIVE OF BERT CORONA, BY MARIO T. 
GARCIA (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS: $30; 360 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Sergio Munoz, Sergio Munoz is the editor of Nuestro Tiempo, the Spanish 
language weekly published by the Los Angeles Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Very early in his life, Bert Corona made a commitment that he would honor for 
more than six decades: to devote all his energy into organizing the 
Mexican-American community into labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
 This memoir, narrated to historian Mario Garcia, recounts the story of 
Corona's activism in the Mexican communities of California. Although it 
describes some of the movement's accomplishments and failures, it is ultimately 
Corona's history: a consciously self-centered account of his accomplishments 
and failures. 
</P>
<P>
 In his struggle for unionism, Corona was guided by a resolutely socialist 
vision. Identifying himself as an ordinary working-class Mexican, he began 
organizing his community with the conviction that class struggle is the motor 
of history and that the Mexican people will only be truly liberated when they 
understand the need to change the relationship of social forces. The "real 
forces" writes Corona, "are General Motors and the other big corporations. . . 
. The enemy (is) the corporate power. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, in his work as national director of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, a 
Latino immigrant rights group, Corona's socialist conviction remains in place. 
Corona, of course, did not lead a great Mexican revolution in the United 
States, nor was he able to change the path of history and turn the means of 
production over to the workers. He was, however, able to find his own niche in 
the history of the Chicano labor movement by defending the rights of 
undocumented workers at a time when nobody else, including great labor leaders 
like Cesar Chavez, would represent them. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona is actually very generous and respectful toward Chavez even as he 
details his disagreement with the Mexican icon. "I did have an important 
difference with Cesar" Corona writes. "This involved his, and the Union's 
position on the need to apprehend and deport undocumented Mexican immigrants 
who were being used as scabs by the growers. . . . The Hermandad believed that 
organizing undocumented farm workers was auxiliary to the union's efforts to 
organize the fields. We supported an open immigration policy, as far as Mexico 
was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona turned out to be right and Chavez wrong. The farm workers' union ran 
into a cul de sac precisely because its leaders failed to understand how to 
turn the tide. Instead of converting the undocumented to his union, Chavez and 
those close to him denounced them as scabs and fought them with a vengeance. He 
would pay the price for this myopia with an increasingly debilitated union 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Chavez was wrong and Corona was right on this one, that was not always 
the case. Chavez and Corona lived parallel lives that seldom crossed the same 
paths because their approach toward the community was substantially different. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona believed in the so-called "progressive" strategy to reach the community 
from a liberal, anticlerical position. Chavez knew that Mexicans are basically 
conservative, Catholic and nationalistic and drew his strategy along these 
lines. "The farm workers' struggle in the sixties," Corona wrote, "had a dual 
character, which Cesar artfully shaped. It was a labor battle, but it also had 
the dimensions of a mass community involvement . . . (Cesar) employed all the 
trappings of a Mexicano national involvement: the symbols of the Virgin of 
Guadalupe, the Mexican flag, Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa, the songs, the 
colors, the eagle -- all that became a movement." Chavez grew to become the 
Mexican national figure. Corona remained a regional leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona came to California from his native El Paso in the decade of the 1930s. 
In Los Angeles, he became acquainted with the Communist Party and although he 
denies ever joining it, he does praise its "unwavering dedication to 
ameliorating the terrible conditions under which poor people such as Mexicans 
were forced to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona defines himself as a socialist, influenced more by Upton Sinclair, 
Lincoln Steffens and Jack London than by Karl Marx or Friedrich Engels. Reading 
his testimonial, it becomes clear that his ideology is based more on the 
practice of hard core unionizing than on rigorous readings of Marx. 
</P>
<P>
 His career as a union organizer begins almost simultaneously in three 
organizations: the Longshoremen's Union, the Congress of Industrial 
Organizations and the Mexican American Movement. The first provides him with 
the practical training for organizing, the second gives him an ideological 
framework, while the third puts him directly in touch with America's 
Spanish-speaking communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '40s Corona was involved in the activities of the Congreso Nacional del 
Pueblo de Habla Espanola, defined by its founder, Luisa Moreno as a broad civil 
rights organization for all of the Spanish speaking people in the United 
States. It is during the first convention of El Congreso in 1939 that Corona 
formulated the ideas which, with many variations, were to direct his actions in 
the decades to come. "The congregation of so many Spanish-speaking people," he 
wrote, "stamped in my mind, and in the minds of many others, that we were a 
national minority and not just a regional one." 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1960s, Corona had become involved in national politics, working in the 
political campaigns of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Bobby Kennedy. While 
Corona was disenchanted with the lack of commitment toward Mexican-Americans 
shown by the first two, he believes that Bobby could have made a difference. 
Bobby's untimely death led Corona to seek other strategies, such as his 
involvement with the Mexican American Political Assn. (MAPA), "formed as a 
reaction to the unwillingness of the Democratic Party to support in any real 
sense the needs and interests of Mexicans and other Spanish-speaking people in 
California and the Southwest." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Corona's leadership, MAPA became, at least in California, the dominant 
Mexican-American political organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona's stance toward the Chicano Movement of the late '60s and its new and 
young radical leaders is remarkably harsh. But while his portrait of the times 
is partial and opinionated, it is also truly energetic, vital and moving, 
especially in its detailed description of the events surrounding the death of 
journalist Ruben Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of these pages, Corona shows that his vision of the Latino 
community remains unchanged. It is a vision that is perhaps too one-dimensional 
for today's complex world. We Hispanics are "characterized by the conditions of 
our existence," he writes. "Economically, we occupy lower levels than whites as 
a result of racism. . . . The only way to get out from under the difficulties 
created by racism, marginalization and injustice is through political means." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona's arguments would have been stronger had he added a few words about 
personal responsibility and individual motivation. At times, the community he 
portrays looks and sounds like a mere puppet, capable of neither 
self-initiative nor self-criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, who can argue about the importance of political empowerment to increase 
the clout of the Mexican-American community? And who can deny the evident 
instances of racism, marginalizing and injustice suffered by the Latino 
community? 
</P>
<P>
 The UC Press is to be commended for printing a memoir that fills in the gaps 
ideology, egoism, racism, convenience and hypocrisy have tried to hide from us 
all. Helping rid us of stereotypes about a people, it portrays their struggles 
and points out their weaknesses; it restores their dignity and locates their 
place in history.

 I am a graduate of Harvard Medical School who is currently a second-year 
resident in psychiatry at UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute, and I was 
frustrated and angered to read Joy Horowitz's article, "For the Sake of 
Science" (Sept. 11). I have worked closely with Dr. Michael Gitlin for the past 
six months, caring for adult inpatients at the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Horowitz's portrayal of Gitlin is at odds with my perceptions and those of 
nearly everyone who has worked with him. Far from being imperious, as Horowitz 
described him, he is a warm and caring physician and teacher and a most 
knowledgeable and competent psychiatrist. I have seen his superior ethical 
standards in practice on the inpatients wards daily. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it ironic that the rules that he upholds in order to protect patient 
confidentiality condemn him to keep silent about the case in question, rather 
than air important and relevant truths. I wonder if these rules are always in 
the best interests of patients. They certainly make objective discussion of the 
Enrique Lamadrid case impossible.

 As a sociologist and psychotherapist, and based on what I saw while a 
human-subjects protection committee reviewed some of the most advanced medical 
research in the United States, I feel safe in saying that issues of morality 
were not and could not be adequately dealt with by such a group. 
</P>
<P>
 First mandated by law in 1974, such committees were instituted primarily 
because issues of morality were being neglected in medical research. For that 
reason, the committees were to contain non-medical public representation. 
However, my research indicates that patient-protection groups have evolved 
various strategies to ensure group stability that have resulted in physician 
members dominating the committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Since moral issues tend to be raised by public representatives, who are in the 
minority, such matters get little attention. What results is the medical 
profession policing itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding informed consent, I have seen schizophrenics being given informed 
consent and know, from the inappropriateness of their responses, that they had 
no idea what was being said.

 As a graduate of the UCLA School of Nursing in the late '60s, I am not 
surprised by Horowitz's article. Part of my assignment had been to help doctors 
conduct their research. I saw many things that disturbed me greatly: 
</P>
<P>
 The oxygen tent of a dying child, lifted up time and time again so that groups 
of interns and medical and nursing students could get a better look. 
</P>
<P>
 The gaping wound of an elderly woman probed by an endless stream of 
"observers," even though it obviously was causing her pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake. The primary interest of a teaching and research institution 
like UCLA is teaching and research, not the welfare of the individual patient.

 First, psychiatry is attacked for putting horrible, brain-damaging drugs into 
people. Then, when researchers try to find out what characteristics might 
identify patients who can discontinue these drugs, or which warning signs might 
indicate that they need to resume taking them, psychiatry is attacked for that, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 And how about Dr. Richard Wyatt's idea that regression in schizophrenia, 
induced by medical noncompliance, results in irreversible loss of function? If 
he's correct, the patients'-rights movement is directly involved in getting 
thousands of patients out of hospitals and helping them to refuse medication. 
They eat out of trash cans, get covered with lice and drink Thunderbird 
instead. Kind of makes you proud to be an American, doesn't it, watching them 
die with their rights on?

COVER STORY: ACTING ON INSTINCT; REBA MCENTIRE DRAWS ON FEELINGS SHE HAD ABOUT 
A SONG THAT'S NOW THE BASIS OF HER CBS FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL McCALL, Michael McCall is a Nashville-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reba McEntire discerns one primary difference between her dual careers as a 
singer and an actress, and that's artistic control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have absolutely no control as an actress of how I end up on screen," she 
says. "When I make records, I sing and then I listen to it. If I don't like it, 
I can fix it right there. But when I'm acting, I have somebody, a complete 
stranger, telling me how to act. Then when they go and edit it, they might edit 
out the thing that drew my reaction. Then my reaction looks so overboard and 
blown out of proportion, and I cringe. That's the only thing I hate about 
movies, having absolutely no control." 
</P>
<P>
 Control is an important issue for McEntire. As she's grown into one of country 
music's highest-profile stars, McEntire has increasingly absorbed control of 
all aspects of her career. As co-founder of Starstruck Entertainment with 
second husband Narvel Blackstock, McEntire manages her own career, concert 
promotion, publicity, music publishing, record production, travel arrangements 
and fleet of small aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 (McEntire has chartered her own flights since one of two planes she'd hired to 
carry her band and crew crashed into Otay Mountain shortly after taking off 
from San Diego in March, 1991. Seven band members, her road manager and the 
pilot were killed. McEntire and the other band members were on another plane.) 
</P>
<P>
 She also owns Starstruck Farms, which raises thoroughbred horses, and recently 
formed Starstruck Construction so she could oversee the details of erecting a 
high-rise office complex in the middle of Nashville's music community. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the award-winning singer, who appears this week in the lead role 
of the CBS movie "Is There Life Out There?," sounds like an eager up-and-comer 
rather than a savvy business magnate when discussing her increasing presence in 
movies and on television. 
</P>
<P>
 The thin, animated redhead retains the Oklahoma twang she acquired during her 
upbringing amid rodeo contests and religious revivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a cluttered office of her current Starstruck headquarters -- the 
new office building won't be finished until later this year -- she excitedly 
recounts the success of her recent best-selling autobiography "Reba: My Story," 
and her current million-selling album with the literary tie-in title, "Read My 
Mind." (Both the book and album feature the same photograph on the cover.) But 
she displays her greatest exuberance when talking about her screen work. 
</P>
<P>
 McEntire made her film debut in 1990 as a gung-ho, weapon-wielding survivalist 
in the sci-fi spoof "Tremors." Despite recent feature roles in Rob Reiner's 
"North" and Penelope Spheeris' "The Little Rascals," as well as lead parts 
opposite Burt Reynolds in "The Man From Left Field" and opposite Kenny Rogers 
in "The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw," she admits to feeling insecure 
about her acting skills. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she says, "I feel better about my acting. I mind very well." When 
director David Jones suggested she perform a scene a certain way, "that's how I 
do it," she explains. "If I do it a couple times and I'm not comfortable with 
it, I go to him and talk about it. I might make a suggestion then, but if he 
says no, I don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, speaking from London where he's directing a Dennis Potter play for the 
BBC, admits that when he was first approached about doing the movie he thought 
working with a country singer could be a challenge. "But we hit it off very 
well, right from our first meeting," Jones says. "She was terrific to work 
with. She's extremely direct as a woman, and honest about her fears." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones compared McEntire's "instinctive way of working" to the two young actors 
who play her children. "She had the same kind of directness that they had," he 
says. "She didn't pre-plan very much. She wasn't 'method' oriented; she doesn't 
have that kind of training. She has more of an intuitive approach. I think she 
surprised herself a few times, to be honest." 
</P>
<P>
 One such time occurred in a scene where she gets slapped. "She was very upset, 
very tearful, in that scene," Jones says. Afterward, the director asked her if 
the slap was too hard, if it bothered her. "She said that it wasn't, that it 
was too violent," he recalls. "She said she'd forgotten how her elder sister 
used to beat her up. ... it all came back to her." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is There Life Out There?" is based on a hit song McEntire recorded in 1991. 
Written by Susan Longacre and Rick Giles, the song tells of a housewife and 
mother who married at age 20. Once her children are grown, she begins to ponder 
what to do with her future and how to experience life outside of the home. 
"When I first heard that song, I thought, 'My cousin Trisha Ann could really 
relate with this.' She got married right out of high school and has two 
wonderful boys. She kind of lived life through them. After the kids were gone 
-- the youngest graduated last year -- she had to start a whole new life." 
</P>
<P>
 A music video, written by Alice Randall and directed by Jack Cole, expanded 
the song's theme to feature a mother of two school-age children who, while 
working as a waitress in a diner, enrolls in college. The movie takes a deeper 
look at the struggles of a wife and working mother who tries to squeeze college 
studies into a tight schedule, and the tensions that creates at home. Keith 
Carradine stars as McEntire's husband, who starts out supportive but becomes 
troubled as the family routine grows strained and a handsome young tutor enters 
the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the video, we started getting letters from people about how that song 
had changed their life or motivated them," McEntire says. "A lot of the letters 
were from women, but we also got them from men who said the song encouraged 
their wives to go back to school. And there was one from a woman whose daughter 
had quit high school and had gone back because of the song. That takes such 
courage." 
</P>
<P>
 McEntire routinely meets with members of her fan club backstage following her 
concerts. After a recent Pittsburgh show, a woman in her late 30s stood up to 
tell McEntire that she had enrolled in college. "She told me she was scared to 
death," McEntire recalls. "I told her to hang in there, we're rooting for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Emmy-winning producer Marian Rees, who shares executive producer credit on "Is 
There Life Out there?" with McEntire and Blackstock, first raised the idea of 
creating a vehicle for McEntire during a meeting set up by the William Morris 
Agency. "I wasn't into it at first," McEntire says. "It's easier for me, with 
all the projects I got going, to say yes or no to a finished project than to 
have to create it. It's the same with songs. I'm not interested in sitting in a 
room and writing a song. I respect the songwriters with all my heart, 'cause 
they're the ones who have to do the work. I just go in and sing it and it's 
over. That's the way I wanted to do movies too." 
</P>
<P>
 Rees then asked the singer if she had a hit song that she thought could be 
developed into a movie. "I said, 'No,' " McEntire says with an abrupt laugh. 
"She told me, 'That's a shame. You have so many good songs. There's one that I 
really think would merit a movie.' " McEntire took the bait and asked which 
song. When Rees said, "Is There Life Out There?," McEntire looked at her 
husband, who smiled, raised his eyebrows and nodded his head. 
</P>
<P>
 McEntire's primary condition, other than approving the script, was that the 
production company hire as many female crew members as possible. "And we did," 
she says with a smile, "and they were all qualified too. They weren't just on 
the set because they were women. They were there because they're good at what 
they do. I wanted that because it's such a good woman's film. I think it helped 
make it a better movie too. It helped us make our statement. If we're going to 
do a film about a woman going back and fulfilling her dreams, then we should 
encourage and help others to do that too." 
</P>
<P>
 Providing opportunity to women is a role McEntire takes seriously in her 
myriad businesses also. At Starstruck Entertainment, the staff includes 16 
women, from vice presidents to support personnel. A woman manages McEntire's 
farm, and two women are employed by Starstruck Jets. On the road, McEntire's 
crew includes 12 more women, not only as singers and dancers, but also as 
technicians and stagehands. Several female songwriters are on the roster of her 
music publishing company. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interview, the atmosphere in the office is congenial, as staffers 
pop their heads into the boss' office to welcome her back from the road. Many 
linger a few moments to answer McEntire's questions about their personal lives, 
and laughter regularly echoes through the office and down the busy halls. "We 
work hard, and we have a lot of fun," McEntire says. "It's the greatest living 
I've ever made, I'll tell you that for sure. It sure beats working cattle all 
to thunder." 
</P>

 "Is There Life Out There?" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

HEALTH-CARE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a participant in one of California's and the nation's leading HMOs, I 
believe that David Ewing Duncan's article, "The Triumph of Harry and Louise" 
(Sept. 11) was misleading. HMOs represent the kind of reform that everyone 
seems to want: access to a wide choice of primary-care and specialty physicians 
and hospitals; additional benefits; lower overall costs, and a dedication by 
the plan and its physicians to emphasize health and well-being, not just 
illness -- all while reducing the paperwork found in traditional Medicare and 
group insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike those in some of Duncan's scenarios, most HMO members can vote with 
their feet -- discontinue their membership at a moment's notice -- but most 
choose to stay in the plans. In the case of our own "Secure Horizons," the 
retention rate is 95%. In our Health Insurance Purchasing Cooperative for small 
businesses, more than 80% of the 44,000 members have chosen HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors and hospitals have not been as powerless in all this as Duncan 
suggests. Physician groups in California are showing how doctors can reorganize 
their practices to become more efficient and effective. 
</P>
<P>
 California is setting the tone for reform. While other options should be 
available, it is in everyone's interest that the HMO -- the only proven 
solution to the health-care crisis -- be retained as a choice.

 Duncan replies: Dr. Taylor describes the HMO ideal, to cut costs and increase 
efficiency, but fails to mention that many HMOs achieve savings, and earn hefty 
profits, by skimming off the healthy and excluding the sick, and by dropping 
those who become ill. Despite his claims that HMOs offer a wide range of 
choice, the truth is that most are in the business of reducing costs by 
restricting provider options. And it should come as no surprise that most 
enrollees are satisfied with their HMOs since most are healthy and use their 
plans only for routine care.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Managed care is the area of medicine where medical professionals oversee 
patient care to ensure the most cost-effective use of medical resources 
consistent with quality patient care. Many health-care providers, such as small 
medical groups, are owned by the physicians who practice in them. They tend to 
police themselves, since malpractice suits against one eat up the profit for 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 The system needs to be fixed, but establishing a federal or state medical 
bureaucracy isn't the solution.

 I own a small business that provides full medical insurance to my 15 employees 
and their families. When costs recently forced me to switch to an HMO plan. I 
was assured that our current doctors and hospitals would be available. 
</P>
<P>
 It took me three months to see my primary-care physician for a referral to a 
specialist I'd been seeing for 10 years. The referred visit was twice denied by 
an insurance reviewer, even though the specialist was a participant in the 
plan. It took some heavy telephone shouting before the insurance manager issued 
permission for the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm now concerned about the value of our medical coverage in case I or any of 
my employees need serious and expensive medical attention. This is one business 
owner who is definitely in favor of a single-payer, state-supervised medical 
insurance plan.

 Doctors are no more or less avaricious than anyone else. It's just that they 
have more opportunity to act upon greed. Their exalted image and the 
ever-present threat of malpractice suits make it easy for them to rationalize 
excessive treatments and billings. Physicians rightly resent that some lay 
persons in the insurance industry question their decisions, but the doctors' 
abuses of unrestricted freedom made such review inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the criticism directed against HMOs is justified; there are legitimate 
complaints. But the HMO industry would not exist if fee-for-service medicine 
hadn't gotten out of hand.

 Maybe I should hire a director and an editor, buy some TV time, be filmed 
sitting at a kitchen table with a sympathetic friend and tell how not having 
health care resulted in the death of my father. How because he was too young 
for Medicare and made too much money for Medi-Cal, he couldn't get the 
angioplasty he needed and died of a heart attack at 59. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps I could sob a little as I tell how, 11 days after my father's death, 
the Veterans Administration sent a letter telling him in essence that, yes, he 
was sick enough; he could have an angioplasty.

<P>
 We need affordable health care.

MORE VARIETY TO COME

 Reba McEntire will return to television Nov. 25 as host of her own network 
special, this time on NBC. "Reba!," as the show is tentatively titled, will 
combine live concert footage shot in Omaha, Neb., with skits based on 
McEntire's life and caeer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a variety show, and that's something I've been wanting to do forever," 
says the singer. "It's basically our concert, with the choreography and the 
staging and the lighting and the costuming and all that. Plus we're doing some 
other things so I can do some acting and some comedy spoofs. It's going to be a 
lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Sall, who has directed several of McEntire's music videos, will also 
direct the special. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concerts are very theatrical," McEntire explains. "I've always wanted it 
to be a stage production, like a Broadway show. That's pretty much the way it 
is now. We don't just sing song after song; we tie them together with a prop or 
a costume change or some dialogue. We link everything together into one 
continuous. show." 
</P>
<P>
 When McEntire performs live, the backstage area reels with constant activity. 
Stage sets shift, props slide in and out, costumes fly -- the singer goes 
through at least eight costume changes a night and her singers and dancers 
undergo nearly as many. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets kinda tricky," McEntire says with a laugh. "I came out of a quick 
change the other day and ran right smack into someone. It's the hardest I've 
ever run into anybody during the show. We both just steadied ourselves and kept 
going." MICHAEL McCALL

 THE PHYSICS OF IMMORTALITY: Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the 
Dead by Frank J. Tipler (Doubleday: $24.95; 517 pp.) The main purpose of this 
book, writes the author on Page 261, "has been to show that modern physics 
requires the God principle."Except Tipler doesn't call it God, he calls it the 
Omega Principle, the "completion of all finite existence." And this is supposed 
to make you feel better because it fills the need we have to avoid death. 
"Science now tells us," writes Tipler in his characteristically arrogant way 
("In my previous publications on religion and physics, I have attempted to 
conceal this arrogance," he writes in the preface. "In this book, however, I 
have not bothered. . . .") " . . . how to go to Heaven." This is a noble cause, 
joining physics and religion in the popular mind, but some of his assumptions 
are unbearable: the idea that a "living being is any entity which codes 
information," the idea that "In the end, the Earth itself must be transferred 
from . . . ultimate reality into virtual reality," and the promise that in the 
afterlife, "the goods we enjoy today are magnified." Not to mention the idea of 
colonizing space with a Von Neumann probe, which places fertilized eggs created 
from the genes of a single cell in an artificial womb to recreate the human 
race. Call me old fashioned.

 THE FOLLOWING STORY by Cees Nooteboom, translated by Ina Rilke (Harcourt Brace 
& Company: $14.95; 115 pp.) Here is a disturbing fable about a man, nicknamed 
Socrates by his students and colleagues, with a single defining memory, a 
single event in which he came close to living as he ought to have lived; the 
catalyst, a woman."She had shown me a garden that had been closed to me. I was 
still shut out, but at least I had caught a glimpse of it. Glimpse is the wrong 
word. I had heard it. She had made a sound that did not belong to the world. . 
. . Where that sound came from it must be impossible to live." This woman is 
married to a man who doesn't love her. To get revenge, she gives Socrates a 
moment in his life that becomes the eye of the hurricane; he can never get out 
of it. "It was not my soul that would set out on a journey . . . it was my body 
that would embark on endless wanderings, never to be ousted from the universe." 
He tells the story again and again.

 The 1986 Pretty in Pink (KCOP Sunday at 6 p.m.), one of John Hughes' best 
teen-age stories, finds poor high school student Molly Ringwald asked out by 
rich Andrew McCarthy -- much to the dismay of her pal Jon Cryer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfgang Petersen's sleek, high-style 1991 suspense thriller Shattered (NBC 
Sunday at 9 p.m.) moves with terrific energy, visual panache and a dry wit. The 
film takes us into the perplexed mind of a partial amnesiac (Tom Berener). A 
near-fatal car crash has left him with no personal memories, but he can tell 
you the name of the San Francisco landmark building in which he works; this 
means that those close to him have the opportunity to re-create him to suit 
their own purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 In A Case of Deadly Force (KCAL Sunday at 10 p.m.), an outstanding 1986 TV 
movie based on an actual incident, Richard Crenna plays Boston attorney (and 
ex-cop) Lawrence O'Donnell Jr., who launched a relentless legal investigation 
into the shooting death of a hospital worker by police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Brooks stars in his risk-taking but uneven 1991 Life Stinks (KTA Monday at 
8 p.m.), a slapstick fable about a billionaire developer who bets he can 
survive a month among the homeless with neither money nor resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 Hurricane Smith (KCOP Tuesday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 6 p.m.) stars 
Carl Weathers as a Texas roughneck in an action-adventure set in the Australian 
underworld. 
</P>
<P>
 The 198 Amazing Stories: The Movie (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.) and its 1987 
sequel (KTLA Wednesday at 8 p.m.) are compilations of the Steven Spielberg 
half-hour anthology series launched in 1985. Kevin Costner and Christoher Lloyd 
are featured in the first; Danny DeVito and John Lithgow in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 In one warming stroke in 1976, Rocky (KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m.), written by and 
starring Sylvester Stallone, revived the tradition of the modestly budgeted, 
unpretentious movie that creates new stars (and myths) and commands the rousing 
affection of its audiences. How? By proclaiming the possibilities of love, hope 
and triumph in the lives of ordinary men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone is not seen to the same advantage in the 1987 Over the Top (KTLA 
Friday at 8 p.m.). which lives up to its title as Stallone's fight with his 
father-in-law for the custody and love of his son climaxes in a Las Vegas 
arm-wrestling contest. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET offers a '40s film noir double feature Saturday night: The Blue Dahlia 
(at 9 p.m.), a Raymond Chandler yarn with Alan Ladd as a returning vet 
suspected of murdering his unfaithful wife, and The Dark Past (at 11:20 p.m.), 
with William Holden as a crazed killer who takes psychologist Lee J. Cobb as a 
prisoner.

 M.F.K. FISHER, JULIA CHILD, AND ALICE WATERS: Celebrating the Pleasures of the 
Table by Joan Reardon (Harmony Books: $25; 320 pp.) One of the reasons that 
books about the great chefs are so appealing is that we suspect they are onto 
something essential and unwavering -- some last principle governing the basic 
enjoyment of life.These three women, all rooted in some ways (by birth or 
preference) to both California and France, enriched so many lives with their 
writing and cooking. Fisher and Child were very good friends; Waters knew 
Fisher better than Child. And they admired each other; Fisher said of Waters' 
restaurant in Berkeley (Chez Panisse) that it was "the best food that she had 
eaten in America . . . in a public place I mean." Child, raised in Pasadena, 
discovered her passion while traveling all over the world with her diplomat 
husband. Fisher discovered her passion in France with her first husband, 
although memories of peach pies and other foods in her home town of Whittier 
are certainly part of her culinary inspiration. Waters, originally from New 
Jersey, discovered her gift for food after being active in the Free Speech 
Movement in Berkeley, and working on Robert Scheer's 1966 congressional 
campaign. These are fierce women; fiercely independent, fiercely capable, 
fiercely loyal and generous. The meal from this particular book that I will 
someday try to copy took place at Fisher's house in Glen Ellen. Child and her 
husband were there. They had mounds of Dungeness crab, some sourdough bread, 
good butter and a light white wine. Most probably, it cannot be recaptured.

 THE PHILOSOPHY OF CHILDHOOD by Gareth B. Matthews (Harvard University Press: 
$18.95; 136 pp.) "A parent or teacher who doesn't hear the questions," writes 
Matthews, author of "Philosophy and the Young Child, " "or doesn't understand 
that they are more than, and different from, a mere request for information, 
misses a chance to do philosophy."This is the wake up call sounded by "The 
Philosophy of Childhood." And the reminder that "Children are people, fully 
worthy of both the moral and the intellectual respect due persons. They should 
be respected for what they are, as well as for what they can become." When 
children go to school "spontaneous excursions into philosophy" are less and 
less frequent, making it ever more important to recognize and encourage 
philosophical lines of inquiry at home. Matthews, in this somewhat scattered 
book (several different issues are raised under a very large and not all that 
clearly defined rubric), provides examples of philosophical questions and 
dilemmas that may appear on your child's brow.

 HUNTING THE WHOLE WAY HOME by Sydney Lea (New England University Press: 
$19.95; 197 pp.) It's hunting season right now in New England.People are a 
little distracted because there's so much to do to get ready for winter, and 
all the traditional harvest celebrations and rituals are tinged with 
melancholy.That's what Sydney Lea's writing is like; many voices in a single 
man, life moving in cycles or seasons, and melancholy from guilt and regret. 
Hunting provides a metaphor for life and a code of behavior. It's also a way to 
get the hell out of the house and away from the typewriter. In the story 
"Buzzards," a young boy goes hunting with his aging father and 40 years later 
takes his 5-year-old son hunting. Everything else is different. In "Mercy on 
Beeson's Partridge," the writer, angry to be temporarily lame, rages with his 
cane in the kitchen, reminding himself of a scene from his childhood, in which 
the rage of a bitter old woman is expressed in the "hatchety" gestures of her 
cane. This is pure New England, both because of the depth and richness of the 
predictable seasons and behavior of the animals Lea hunts, but also in its 
narrowness, in the utter absence of even one exotic detail. "In a poem I 
published some years back," Lea writes, "I refer to myself as 'the dull 
bourgeois I would have despised.' That's what I am, for better or worse. I 
believe -- shame! -- it's for the better." Aside from the rhetorical musing on 
whether one can be an outdoorsman and a writer, these are lovely, 
self-conscious stories.

 A HISTORY OF ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS by Christopher de Hamel. (Phaidon: 
$49.95) De Hamel is head of the Western Manuscripts department at Sotheby's in 
London.In this book he has provided a general introduction on the subject of 
book-making since the Dark Ages. It is divided into sections on the primary 
book buyers of each period: missionaries, emperors, monks, students, 
aristocrats, everybody (the fabulous 15th Century), priests and collectors. The 
illustrations are vivid and graphically inspiring. On this page: selections 
from the "Gospels of Otto III" (c. 998), a portrait of the monk Eadwine 
(mid-12th Century), a page from a bestiary (1187), a page from a book of hours

 WIND, SAND AND STARS by Antoine de Saint-Exupery, translated from the French 
by Lewis Galantiere (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $15.95; 227 pp.) Near death in 
the Libyan desert after his plane had gone down and he had long since used up 
the 19 hours estimated life expectancy of a man without water in that part of 
the world, St. Exupery thinks to himself: "Flying is a man's job and its 
worries are a man's worries. A pilot's business is with the wind, with the 
stars, with night, with sand, with the sea. . . . Truth for him is what lives 
in the stars." This adventure was during a 1935 Paris-Saigon flight, one of 
many recounted here from the years that St. Exupery was a mail pilot (the late 
1920s and '30s) flying through the Andes, across Africa and through the Saharan 
desert that he loved. "Only the unknown frightens men," he writes. "But once a 
man has faced the unknown, the terror becomes the known." It seems that the 
guiding principle of St. Exupery's life was the fight against indifference. 
What leaps from these pages is a love of life and a perspective on the earth 
and earthly things that may in fact have sprung from his chosen profession and 
a courage, moral, emotional, physical. In the end, he writes that it is not 
necessary to "get oneself killed in Madrid, or to fly mail planes, or to 
struggle wearily in the snows out of respect for the dignity of life."The 
struggle is to stay awake and find joy in a cup of coffee and hot milk ("that 
first burning and aromatic swallow . . . "). And St. Exupery, with his gorgeous 
writing, breathed life into the weather itself: "The blue sky glittered like a 
new-honed knife. I felt in advance the vague distaste that accompanies the 
prospect of physical exertion. The purity of the sky upset me. Give me a good 
black storm in which the enemy is plainly visible."

 The Memphis Belle (Discovery Channel, Sunday at 9 p.m.) is William Wyler's 
notable, rarely seen 1944 documentary about our bombing missions over Germany 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz Singer (TMC, Thursday at 7:30 a.m.), the 1927 film that ushered in 
sound, is actually mostly a silent movie, which ironically is why it's superior 
to its talkie remakes. Al Jolson stars as a man torn between his dream of 
becoming a popular singer and the dictates of his religion; the material is so 
outrageously sentimental it needs all the eloquence and detachment that only 
images can give it.

 Referring to Wanda Coleman's "Trouble in Paradise" (On the Town, Sept. 4): 
When I returned to Los Angeles after 14 years in Eugene, Ore., many Angelenos 
reacted with shock and horror that I chose to reverse the migratory trend. 
</P>
<P>
 I came back not because I was limited in the Pacific Northwest to a minimum of 
interesting employment opportunities, faced nine to 10 months a year of soggy, 
gray weather or had an overwhelming sense that I was living on the set of 
"Hootenanny."I came back because I was keenly aware that Eugene and other 
cities up North draw and keep many individuals who want to escape all forms of 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one can argue that the risks of violence, freeway disasters, clogged 
lungs and financial hardship are worth avoiding, I found much of the population 
of Eugene also escaping from the risk of intellectual growth, multiethnic 
exposure and cultural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're through with life's challenges, it's a good way to go.

ON THE TOWN: A CUT BELOW; DOES EXTENDING THE LONG BEACH FREEWAY MEAN YET 
ANOTHER CROP OF STERILE NEIGHBORHOODS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Jonathan Gold

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the oddest stretches of Los Angeles is that area just northwest of 
Downtown that is bisected by the Hollywood Freeway: handsome, peeling 
Victorians facing out onto concrete retaining walls; old churches divorced from 
their flocks; strange, remote cul de sacs almost energized by their sudden 
isolation from great chunks of neighborhood that no longer exist. The Hollywood 
Freeway was built half a century ago, but the community it passes through still 
seems severed, incomplete, in a way that those neighborhoods that grow up 
around freeways rarely do. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty much everybody likes freeways, it is safe to say; nobody but a fool 
wants a new one through their hometown. It is not an accident that the Beverly 
Hills Freeway never got past the planning stage. And though legislation 
mandating the completion of the last six-odd miles of the Long Beach Freeway, 
through South Pasadena and El Sereno, has just been approved by every relevant 
state body, there is no shortage of South Pasadenans ready to shackle 
themselves to the bulldozers, should they ever come. 
</P>
<P>
 I've taken a lot of walks lately along the path of the proposed freeway 
extension, down quiet streets shaded by trees grown together into dense green 
canopies, past neat, modest bungalows, and I try to imagine what the area might 
feel like split by eight lanes of superhighway. All along the route are little 
pockets of bulldozed land, half-acre oblongs of dead, brown grass scattered 
among the well-kept lawns. It's not improbable that the drowsy quality tying 
these neighborhoods together reflects their having lived under a 
half-century-long death sentence, that postmodern condominium developments have 
been kept away by the fear that, someday soon, the freeway might actually be 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena residents, by and large, are not the kind of people you'd 
expect to find allied with the Sierra Club -- a friend who toured open houses 
last weekend reported that four out of the five homes she visited had copies of 
William Bennett's "Book of Virtues" prominently displayed on their coffee 
tables -- and it is occasionally disconcerting to hear Mercedes-driving South 
Pasadenans suggest that the answer to the area's traffic problems lies in mass 
transit. It is the kind of small, solid Midwestern town you can imagine Elmer 
Gantry living in, or practically any character from a Booth Tarkington novel, 
except that South Pasadena is only 10 minutes from Downtown L.A. It is a pure 
Norman Rockwell stage set. The producers of "Back to the Future" filmed here 
when they wanted to evoke small-town America, and that fact is duly noted in 
nearly every Chamber of Commerce brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 I am distinctly a latecomer to this debate. There exist Alhambra officials who 
have been pushing the freeway since late in the Truman Administration, South 
Pasadena families who have been fighting it through three generations. It is 
impossible to be neutral: Either you mourn the loss of the cherried-out 
Craftsman bungalow your great-aunt used to live in, or you're an underemployed 
master electrician who wouldn't mind a few years of steady freeway work. One 
side sees a struggle between family-loving South Pasadena PTA members and 
greedy development dollars to the south, the other as between ordinary working 
people and wealthy suburbanites desperate to keep internal-combustion fumes off 
their petunias. And when you click on the news radio at the point when the 
helicopter person starts talking about a major chemical spill or an overturned 
truck full of cows, it's better than even money that the incident occurred on 
the truck-choked Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But freeways that were cut through living urban fabric transformed much of 
East L.A. into sterile overpass. The new Century Freeway took 30 years, cost a 
mint, evicted gadzillion families and shaves only five or 10 minutes off a trip 
to the airport from Downtown -- provided that the Harbor Freeway is flowing 
well, which it usually isn't. Does America's insuperable freedom include the 
liberty never to take a surface street?

 OLD FRIENDS by Tracy Kidder (Houghton Mifflin: $10.95; 352 pp.) and HAVING OUR 
SAY: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years by Sarah L. Delany & A. Elizabeth 
Delany with Amy Hill Hearth (Dell: $5.99; 299 pp., illustrated). Pulitzer 
Prize-winner Tracy Kidder uses his skills as a novelist to depict life and 
death in Linda Manor, a nursing home in New England."Old Friends" focuses on 
two reluctant roommates: Lou, a gentle, capable man of 92, hindered by failing 
vision, and younger, better educated Joe, who suffers from diabetes and the 
aftereffects of a stroke. An unexpected friendship blossoms as they share their 
infirmities, the love of their families and their frustrations with 
professional care-givers. Each learns from the other in a gently moving 
portrait of human resilience. In contrast to the autumnal melancholy that 
pervades "Old Friends," "Having Our Say" suggests a visit to a pair of feisty 
maiden aunts. Sarah ("Sweet Sadie") and A. Elizabeth ("Queen Bess") Delany were 
103 and 101 at the time of these interviews. Members of a prominent North 
Carolina African American family, both sisters were pioneers in their fields: 
Sadie in teaching, Bess in dentistry. Their memoirs have a warm straightforward 
charm. "Honey, when you get to be one hundred years old, you look back and see 
things very clearly," they declare and their vision encompasses the 
post-Reconstruction South, New York during the Harlem Renaissance and the Civil 
Rights Movement. The Delanys recognize the social and political barriers that 
prevented other African Americans from matching their achievements: Bess 
comments, "When Negroes are average, they fail, unless they are very, very 
lucky. Now, if you're average and white, honey, you can go far. Just look at 
Dan Quayle. If that boy was colored he'd be washing dishes somewhere."

PALM LATITUDES: THE TUBE; VIDEO PEN PALS

<P>
 It's sort of like video matchmaking, but the matches are not at all what you'd 
get from a dating service. See, Wendy Clarke believes that friends can be found 
in the most unlikely places using the magic of video.  
</P>
<P>
 Clarke, a video artist, had been teaching a workshop at the California 
Institution for Men in Chino and got the idea to engineer a series of video 
conversations between inmates and people on the outside. She interviewed 15 
inmates, then took the tapes to members of Santa Monica's Church in Ocean Park 
and Crenshaw-area business people, who taped their own responses. Clarke 
shuttled the tapes back and forth, resulting in video dialogues that Times 
critic Howard Rosenberg called 'stimulating' and seductively potent. The tapes 
were shown recently on KCET and became available last month at Vidiots, the 
eclectic video store in Santa Monica. They've also been purchased by sociology 
professors around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'One on One' let people, who otherwise never in a million years would have 
gotten to know each other, clear up all kinds of prejudice and preconceived 
notions," says Clarke, who holds a doctorate in psychology.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was sort of like writing in a journal and having someone read it," says 
Louise Dobbs, a member of the church, who videologued with inmate Ken, pictured 
in the illustration above. 'I was as real and honest as I could have been. I 
wanted to get to know Ken -- and I think I did -- but also be authentic.' She 
poured out her emotions, telling Ken about her 'extreme loneliness.' He assured 
her that her 'dark, overclouded look at things will pass.'  
</P>
<P>
 Clarke's next project, pending funding, will be video dialogues among 
homebound terminally ill people. This time, however, she'll also be using new 
videophone technologies. Meanwhile, she's continuing work on 'The Love Tapes,' 
which she began in 1979, in which hundreds of people philosophize on love for 
three minutes. It's a lifelong project that can safely be described as 
ambitious: 'I want to get everyone in the world on tape,' she says.  
</P>
<P>
 'Video has the potential for really deep healing,' says Clarke. 'It can bring 
people together in real time, and that can bring down isolation so people don't 
have to feel so alone.' Janet Kinosian

 Most drugs these days are the products of sterile tinkerings of lab assistants 
and scientists, but in a lab at UC San Diego, FDA officials are testing 
potential wonderdrug with a very different geneology. Provir, which purportedly 
attacks a number of respiratory viruses, is made using the secret recipe of an 
Ecuadoran medicine man. 
</P>
<P>
 That fact hasn't stopped investors, including Eli Lilly & Co., from putting up 
$52 million for research on this and a number of other Shaman Pharmaceutical 
drugs -- including a topical ointment for herpes and an oral medicine for 
infant influenza which are are in the second stage of FDA testing in San Diego 
, the formulas which were all bought from medicine men (or medicine women). 
</P>
<P>
 Shaman, which is based in South San Francisco and has investors and 
researchers throughout the state, is not peddling magic, says founder and 
president Lisa Conte. It's simply letting the medicine men whittle down the 
number of plants they have to screen. "Rather than going through 10,000 plants 
or other sources of chemical diversity to get a hit, we start with a much 
smaller number." 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, Shaman has tracked down wonder drugs by sending teams (a 
botanist to identify the plant, and a physician to identify the disease) to 
visit medicine men in rain forests around the world. To rule out religious or 
even placebo affects, they try to find medicines used for the same purpose in 
three other geographical areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Conte thinks the rain forest is cornucopia of pharmaceuticals. "The tropical 
areas of the world contain over 50% of the Earth's flora. Less than 1% have 
been investigated for medicinal purposes, and about 20- to 25% of the U.S. 
pharmaceuticals (including aspirin) are plant or plant-derived compounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Plus it's ecological. When the profits start rolling in, the company planned 
to put money back into the rain forest though their own Healing Forest 
Conservancy. Right now, however, Shaman is still spending. Michael Tennesen

 THE VIEW FROM WITHIN: Japanese American Art from the Internment Camps 
1942-1945 by Karen M. Higa (University of Washington Press: $24.95; 100 pp., 
illustrated). The catalogue of an exhibit held in the Wight Gallery at UCLA in 
1992 to mark the 50th anniversary of Executive Order 9066, "View" reveals the 
efforts of interned artists to depict life in the camps.Tokio Ueyama's "The 
Evacuee" (1942) looks like an ordinary portrait of a woman idly crocheting, but 
the way in which she sits, surrounded by souvenirs of her lost home, creates an 
unsettling tension. In a brief memoir of the years she spent interned at 
Poston, Ariz., playwright Wakako Yamauchi reflects, "Well, they say all life is 
terminal. But each of us wants to leave a stone that says, 'I have been here.' 
An artist suspends a moment of his inner life -- a fleeting moment of passion 
and longing in life and puts it on canvas for us."

 WITNESS: Endangered Species of North America by Susan Middleton & David 
Liittschwager (Chronicle Books: $29.95; 256 pp., paperback original). So many 
books on endangered species have appeared in recent years, they practically 
constitute a genre, but the virtuoso beauty of "Witness" stands out among them. 
Middleton and Liittschwager photographed single animals and plants, which 
imbues the pictures with the dignity of fine portraiture: Instead of an 
undifferentiated group of wolves or salmon, they show the reader an individual, 
underscoring its unique genetic heritage. "Witness" is an eloquent record of 
beautiful creatures that may soon exist only in photographs.

 OUR CANCER YEAR by Harvey Pekar & Joyce Brabner, art by Frank Stack (Four 
Walls Eight Windows: $17.95; 224 pp., paperback original). In this graphic 
novel, Harvey Pekar and his wife, Joyce Brabner, re-create the grim time they 
shared during Pekar's battle with lymphoma.While she worked with a student 
peace organization, he underwent surgery and chemotherapy, then faced a 
traumatic move and the computerization of his clerical Civil Service job. Pekar 
essentially created the comic verite genre in the U.S. with his "American 
Splendor" series, and "Year" is a gritty, if sometimes whiny, self-portrait. 
Although a regular contributor to "American Splendor," Stack fails to 
differentiate the characters or depict the action clearly: His scribbled 
artwork muddles the text it should elucidate.

 EARTHLY PLEASURES: Tales From a Biologist's Garden (198 pp., illustrated) and 
FIELD DAYS: Journal of an Itinerant Biologist by Roger B. Swain (217 pp.) 
(Lyons & Burford: $12.95 each). The host of "The Victory Garden" (PBS) combines 
scientific knowledge, historical research and an irrepressible love of nature 
in these engaging essays. He begins a discussion of the pleasures of maple 
sugaring, "Tree bark, like French, becomes much more relevant when you have an 
immediate need to understand it. . . . There is nothing more embarrassing than 
having someone else point out that you have tapped an elm." Swain takes the 
reader on a genial ramble over his small New Hampshire farm, explaining how to 
grow and preserve cabbage, the origins of mulberry trees and why New England 
soil produces a fresh crop of rocks every spring.

 LITTLEJOHN by Howard Owen (Vintage: $10; 230 pp.). The narrator of this 
quietly impressive debut novel, 82-year-old Littlejohn McCain, conceals his 
considerable intelligence and pain beneath the stoic mien of a simple dirt 
farmer.His divorced daughter notes wryly, "If last year had been a football 
game, God would have been called for unnecessary roughness." But Owen gradually 
reveals that the roughness has gone on for more than a single year. 
Littlejohn's life has been a hard one, marred by dyslexia, the death of his 
favorite brother and the cruelty of others, but also one that has been 
illuminated by love, albeit sporadically.

PALM LATITUDES: THE BIZ; PRESSING THE SUITS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though he had friends in the highest Hollywood places, Richard Jennings 
still wondered if studio executives would be receptive to seminars on 'Sexual 
Orientation in the Workplace,' sponsored by the group he heads, Hollywood 
Supports. 
</P>
<P>
 But he needn't have worried: With friends like MCA President Sid Sheinberg and 
QVC Chairman Barry Diller in his corner (they organized the anti-homophobia 
group, after all), the doors flew open.In less than a year, it has sponsored 
upward of 50 seminars at more than a dozen entertainment firms. 
</P>
<P>
 At the sessions, the group meets with company executives to discuss 
stereotypes in film and TV, policies on HIV-infected workers and ways to 
include gays in the social and business loop. 
</P>
<P>
 'When I'm talking to a group of 20 executives, the impact goes far beyond 
them,' says Jennings, who quit a job at a top L.A. law firm to head Hollywood 
Supports. 'It often affects on-screen portrayals which, in turn, shape 
perceptions throughout the world.' 
</P>
<P>
 A special focus is on how studios can help closeted gays feel comfortable 
about coming out. That, says Jennings, has bottom-line implications: 
'Secretiveness impacts work and the whole team spirit.' 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the seminars, Hollywood Supports has drawn up widely adopted 
model policies on discrimination and extending health insurance plans to 
same-sex partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheinberg says Jennings deserves 'straight A's' for his work. 'He's gotten a 
lot of people involved who might otherwise be reluctant, and has filled a 
tremendously important need.' Joseph Hanania

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: A CHILDREN'S HOW-TO; READ YOUR MOM'S MIND, NAUSEATE YOUR 
FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KRULL, Kathleen Krull's most recent book is Lives of the Writers: 
Comedies, Tragedies (and What the Neighbors Thought) (Harcourt Brace). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fortified by one of the catchiest titles of the year -- "How to Read Your 
Mother's Mind" -- James M. Deem takes a sensible but lively approach to this 
thoroughly juicy topic (Houghton Mifflin, hardcover, $15.95, ages 8 to 12). 
</P>
<P>
 With recent articles revealing that some prominent CEO's are known to consult 
psychics, and with TV psychics pulling in millions of calls a year from the 
rest of us, it's only natural that kids too would be attracted by the 
possibilities of ESP. Wouldn't it be pleasant to know what your parents were 
really thinking, to know why dreams sometimes seem to come true, to recognize 
the differences between quacks and real examples of clairvoyance? Deem provides 
myths and misconceptions, facts and scientific reports about how our brains 
work, intriguing true stories, discussion of careers (like criminology and 
healing) that make use of ESP, a glossary, an extensive bibliography and even a 
solicitation of readers' own experiences with telepathy. Witty illustrations by 
True Kelley contribute to making this a playful approach to high-interest food 
for thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Also of enormous current interest -- with courtroom dramas filling the TV 
screen and legal troubles assailing seemingly everyone -- is the law. 
Surprisingly, there's little on this captivating topic written for kids, and so 
a welcome new title is "IT'S THE LAW!: A Young Person's Guide to Our Legal 
System" (Volcano Press, 800 879-9636, paperback, $12.95, ages 10 and up). In 
lucid prose, author Annette Carrel tackles such complex but useful issues as 
why we need laws, who makes them and how, what happens when you break a law, 
what a trial is all about, children's rights and the importance of the United 
States Constitution. Most pertinent is a chapter on juvenile justice -- all 
about the most common crimes charged against juveniles and how they're treated. 
A must for civics classes and of interest to just about any kid. 
</P>
<P>
 For help in dealing with less earth-shattering but somehow no less serious 
problems, turn to the newly revised edition of "When You Go to Kindergarten" 
(Morrow, hardcover, $15.00, ages 4 to 6). Enthusiasm and confidence about going 
to school "for real" don't always occur naturally. Noted author James Howe 
(most famous for his Bunnicula books), aided by photos from Betsy Imershein, 
supplies the ultimate in reassurance for kids contemplating the prospect of 
kindergarten with mixed emotions, for kids already into their first school year 
who may be experiencing trauma -- and for parents who may be having trouble 
letting go. 
</P>
<P>
 One final recommendation, or rather a "beware": "Almanac of the Gross, 
Disgusting & Totally Repulsive: A Compendium of Fulsome Facts" by Eric Elfman, 
illustrations by Ginny Pruitt (Random House, paperback, $4.99, ages 8 to 12). 
This book is literally so revolting that I couldn't bear to look at it for more 
than a minute at a time. Kids should adore it. Remember Ratty, Mole and Toad? 
</P>
<P>
 Did you ever wonder what happened to the animals from "The Wind in the 
Willows"? Did Toad remain a sensible animal? Or what mischief might he be up to 
next? A sequel to Kenneth Grahame's classic children's story is being published 
this fall. Write us what you think happens. We'll publish the best of your 
sequel ideas when we review the book. Stories must be received by Oct. 21. Send

SHELF HELP; ART AND SCIENCE OF BOOK PRICING

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're looking for a bargain on Jackie Collins' latest bestseller, 
"Hollywood Kids," be sure to take your pocket calculator. Chances are you'll 
stumble on a bewildering array of prices, depending on where you shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The old neighborhood bookstore that's independently run might sell the steamy 
thriller at the suggested list price of $23.50 or offer you a modest 10% 
discount. In some malls and super-stores, "Hollywood Kids" will cost $19.98, or 
15% off the regular price. Other chains might offer a 20% to 40% discount, 
bringing the price down to $14.10. If you happen to shop in a Price Club or 
other warehouse outlet, the discount could rise as high as 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid this competition, customers might be forgiven for asking: What's the 
point of the $23.50 suggested list price? And how do publishers arrive at that 
figure to begin with? 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the book biz has offered a standard answer: The list price, 
publishers say, reflects costs that go into production of a book, such as 
paper, printing and binding (PP&B, in the trade). It also reflects more 
variable expenses, such as royalties paid to an author, office salaries and 
money for promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Most publishers hope to average at least a 10% net profit per book, but they 
also claim to have an acute sense for what the consumer will pay. And that's 
where publishing -- like movie-making -- becomes a profoundly inexact science. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of the time you back into it (the list price)," says Phyllis Grann, 
Chief Executive Officer for Putnam Books. "You have to be careful." Publishers 
rarely price a book until all the data are in, ranging from printing expenses 
and mailing to the size of an author's advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, average book prices rose 5.6%, according to industry statistics, 
and Grann predicts they'll grow even more when paper prices jump by the end of 
this year. Bestselling novels that now cost $23 could rise to $25, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although consumers will pay less, publishers still have financial goals to 
meet. As a result, they'll set list prices to get a decent return from 
bookstores, which typically purchase books at discounts of 40% or more. There's 
also a psychological factor: Publishers keep the list price in mind when 
considering what the public will pay, and the barriers they won't cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we published 'Truman' at $30, it was probably under-priced," says 
Carolyn Reidy, president and publisher of Simon & Schuster's trade book 
division. "But we wanted the book to be accessible . . . we wanted people to 
think it was affordable." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, you roll the dice and pray. 
</P>
<P>
 When Knopf published "The Civil War" as a companion book to the PBS series, it 
raised eyebrows with a $50 list price. The book shot to the top of the 
bestseller lists. Last month, Knopf published "Baseball," a companion to the 
latest Ken Burns epic. This time, the suggested list price is $60 -- but it 
doesn't seem to have hurt sales; the book debuted at on the Los Angeles Times 
bestseller list last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only a one-way fluctuation in book prices," jokes Putnam's Grann. 
"And that fluctuation is up." When you spend $23.50 on a book, where does the 
money go? Paper, printing and binding: $3.06 Publisher: $4.93 Bookseller: 
$11.28 Author: $2.00 Promotion: $1.88 Agent: .35 Sources: Association of 
American Publishers, Industry interviews

THE BEST 'DAYS' OF HER LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year has been especially kind to daytime newcomer Tanya Boyd. Besides 
landing the contract role of the devious Celeste on "Days of Our Lives," Boyd's 
personal life has taken an exciting new turn: The actress recently became 
engaged to jazz pianist and recording artist Bobby Lyle and is planning a 
December wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of good stuff has been happening for me," says Boyd with a smile. It's 
been a good year. I have to say as I grow spiritually more and more things are 
opening up for me. I just sit back and watch them happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always said I wanted to work in a wonderful environment where the people 
are loving, the atmosphere is happy, and I can learn, grow and give," says 
Boyd. "I've got that at 'Days.' It's one of the nicest situations to be in." 
</P>
<P>
 With her background firmly rooted in the theater -- the actress had been 
producing, directing and starring in plays with the Mojo Theater Ensemble for 
the past few years -- Boyd knew little about the daytime medium when she 
arrived last spring. Still, she was able to handle her short role as the 
housekeeper/henchwoman of Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) with great ease and 
style. At the end of her stint, Boyd was offered, and later accepted, a 
three-year contract with the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as I really started to settle into Celeste," she recalls, "just as the 
character started to take me over, the role was over. I knew (returning to 
'Days') would give me the chance to get into her more. It would bring her out 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 The role of the scheming Celeste has been a real kick for Boyd, who enjoys 
"conniving and being wicked. It's so much fun," she says with a smile. "And 
everybody loves the villain. When I'm out, people will come up to me and say, 
'You know, I hate you, but I love you.' I think Celeste is pretty popular with 
fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Before her daytime and theater work, Boyd got a taste of fan adoration while 
making her living as a singer. Over the years she has toured as a background 
vocalist, and worked at different jazz clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Singing is another passionate love of mine," says Boyd. "I worked with Lou 
Rawls for three years. I did Anita Baker's 'Rapture' tour, and I toured with 
Natalie Cole. From time to time I've sung with my fiance on his albums. He has 
his own band. His latest album called 'Rhythm Stories' was released by Atlantic 
Records in June." 
</P>
<P>
 To mention the fact that Boyd is multitalented makes the actress blush. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate the compliment, but my feeling is I don't do anything," says 
Boyd. "I just make myself open to that which is within each and every one of us 
to come through, and it does. When I direct a play, I never know what I'm going 
to do until I show up. I just let that power within come out, and it shows me 
everything I need to do. It is my guide through everything in my life. I don't 
have to manipulate anything to get anything. I just turn within, and it's all 
right there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Days of Our Lives" airs weekdays at noon on KNBC and KMIR and 2 p.m. on KNSD.

CRIMINAL PURSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sharyn McCrumb, whose grandfathers were circuit-riding preachers in 
Appalachia, has now written three books in what she calls her Ballad series, 
set in the hills and hollows of east Tennessee and infusing the present with 
the spirit of its people's long, hard, tradition of survival. "The Hangman's 
Beautiful Daughter" was splendid. SHE WALKS THESE HILLS (Scribner's: $21, 336 
pp.) is I think even better. 
</P>
<P>
 In a triumph of plot construction, several lines converge in a remarkably 
dramatic final confrontation. An old man doing life for murder and suffering 
from a syndrome that leaves him no memory of recent events (an hour ago, a day 
ago) escapes and becomes the object of a manhunt. A small town disc jockey 
takes up the old man's cause as an on-the-air lark. A dispatcher in the 
sheriff's office becomes a temporary deputy and sets out to find him 
single-handedly to advance her career. A college teacher who could get lost on 
a playground decides to retrace the trail of an 18th-Century woman who was 
carried off by the Shawnees, escaped and walked hundreds of miles back to her 
home, only to die young. She is the "She" of the title, and there are those who 
still believe they glimpse her ghostly figure among the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly woman, a kind of Scotch-Irish Greek chorus, has the Sight. When 
"the air was crisp and the light was right and the birds were still," she can 
see what was, even if it has been veiled by history, and can foresee what will 
be, even though she can't deflect the course of events. 
</P>
<P>
 The empirically minded reader is free to reject the mystical goings-on, but 
McCrumb's calmly eloquent prose leaves no doubt that these matters of the 
spirit are as real among the hollows as stills and brambles. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a richly detailed novel. There is, not least, a good deal of fascinating 
geology -- a trail of rocks that links Appalachia with Europe, the consequence 
of prehistoric tectonic shiftings. The chapter headings are verses from an 1885 
Tennessee Methodist hymnal, and they are movingly apt underscorings for a story 
in which the persistence of the past is so strong an element. 
</P>
<P>
 McCrumb, who can be very funny, and has been in earlier books ("Bimbos of the 
Death Sun" won an Edgar as best original paperback in 1988), is not all 
quaintness here. The new deputy's troubles with her philandering boyfriend, 
also a deputy, are acutely observed and earthily amusing. The plight of the 
lost academic is painfully real. And McCrumb does an affecting job of conveying 
the dazed mental states of the escapee, who is mostly a danger to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, mysteries present and past. Why did Katie Wyler, the 
walker of the title, die so suddenly on her return, and who murdered the 
escapee's ex-wife so brutally? 
</P>
<P>
 As happens with few books any time, the reader can't wait to see how it all 
comes out, but is at the same reluctant for the book to end. 
</P>
<P>
 James Sallis, the New Orleans translator-essayist-reviewer, has now completed 
his own trilogy of mystery-thrillers, begun with "Moth" and "The Long-legged 
Fly." BLACK HORNET (Carroll & Graf: $18.95; 150 pp.) is what is now called a 
"prequel," looking at Lew Griffin in 1968, early in his days as a private 
investigator with an edgy and usually defensive relationship with the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically the novel is a thriller; a rooftop sniper is reducing the 
population of New Orleans at a terrible rate and has to be brought down, as Lew 
ultimately helps to do. But defining the book as a thriller is as inexact as 
calling "Silence of the Lambs" a story about eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
 The trilogy is, thus far, a three-part examination of a black man with the 
gifts and soul of an intellectual, hanging on in a hostile environment in which 
he finds himself an anomaly, a kind of stateless, free-floating figure forced 
(the other choices are hopelessly self-destructive) to be true to his own 
solitary ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 The killer's scheme has a racist edge. It remains for Lew to discover just how 
complicated (and sorrowful) the racial motivations were. Sallis' theme is in 
some part memory, but it's hard to think of a protagonist other than Lew 
Griffin paraphrasing Jean Goytisolo's autobiography "Realms of Strife" on the 
impossibility of converting memory into words. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallis writes: "Our reconstructions of the past will always be a kind of 
betrayal. Put down your pen, Goytisolo says . . . for silence alone can keep 
intact our illusion of truth." Yes, the reader might say to Sallis, and no. 
</P>
<P>
 In LIFE ITSELF by Paco Ignacio Taibo II, translated by Beth Hensen, 
(Mysterious Press: $18.95; 210 pp.), a mystery writer named Jose Daniel Fierro, 
who is fond of paraphrasing American private eye writers, is prevailed upon to 
become chief of police of a (fictional) mining city north of Mexico City, where 
a left-wing party has ousted the administration of the country's long-ruling 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Taibo, a Mexican historian, has previously used crime fiction as a carrier for 
his raging disgust at the corruption in the government, including the police 
and the "yellow," government-controlled unions. To make the point even more 
emphatic, he killed off the protagonist of a previous series in "No Happy 
Ending," which certainly wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The new book qualifies as a bitter comedy. The city's one police car is an 
ancient, rust-consumed VW. The two previous chiefs of police have been 
assassinated. While a kind of free-lance radio station plays "We Shall 
Overcome" constantly, there is throughout a sense that these foolish idealists 
are on a very short leash indeed and that it's just a matter of time until the 
federales make their move. But Fierro's letters to his life back in Mexico City 
are unfailingly cheerful. "Send me the aspirin and the blue turtleneck sweater 
I've asked you for." 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, murders, conspiracies, attempted assassinations; and 
Fierro, far out of his depth, tries to cope. In the end, Fierro, quoting a 
MacDonald line about Lew Archer, could have been speaking of himself: "He was 
less a man of action than a man of interrogation, a conscience from which the 
significance of other lives emerged." But that can be said of Taibo himself, 
because rarely does crime fiction carry such a weight of indicting commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sculptress," by the English writer Minette Walters, was an engrossingly 
lurid tale that won this year's Edgar as best mystery (and was one of my 10 
best for 1993). Her new book, THE SCOLD'S BRIDLE (St. Martin's: $21.95; 336 
pp.) , is much more ambitious work, eerie in its own way and fascinating in the 
author's ability to generate bent characters and abrasive relationships that 
are by her skill made mesmerizing and even sympathetic rather than off-putting. 
</P>
<P>
 The device of the title was evidently an iron cage that fit over the head, 
held the tongue and prevented speech, a medieval punishment for nagging women. 
One such device, at least, had survived into modern times and was in place, 
garlanded with posies, on an elderly woman discovered nude and dead in her 
bathtub with her wrists slashed. 
</P>
<P>
 She has left her fortune to her doctor, Sarah Blakeney, whom she'd known only 
briefly, rather than to her estranged, druggy daughter or her thieving 
granddaughter. The doctor is briefly a suspect in the unlamented old woman's 
murder (it was, naturally). She becomes the novel's protagonist, abetted by an 
unorthodox policeman, a sort of lower-rank Miagret. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspense of the novel is the digging out the dead woman's horrendous 
family past. Like Ruth Rendell, whom Walters resembles in her fondness for the 
aberrant, expressed in singularly precise and elegant prose, Walters knows the 
cruel kinkiness that can lurk behind the most sedate of facades. The 
denouement, if well-motivated, comes a bit from left field, but the getting to 
it, and watching the delineation of the principals, is all the fun, and it is 
considerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder series, now a dozen long and containing such 
glories as "When the Sacred Ginmill Closes," is one of the sure things in crime 
fiction and A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN (Morrow: $20; 320 pp.) carries it forward 
with a fine flourish. Admittedly it leans heavily on Scudder's life- style to 
bolster a contrived premise (he is a recovering alcohol and an unfrocked cop 
now an unlicensed private eye, with two women in his life, one full-time, one 
part-time). But Scudder is so interesting, who cares? 
</P>
<P>
 There is a tradition of the last man club -- an institution popular after 
World War I -- in which the survivors meet to celebrate until only one is left 
to drink a ceremonial bottle of wine laid down at the first meeting. In this 
case there is no bottle of wine, only a promise that the last man will form a 
new club to carry on a line allegedly reaching back to Babylonia. But somebody 
has been knocking off the members at a clip exceeding the glummest actuarial 
predictions. One of the survivors asks Scudder to see what's what. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like a procedural investigation of a locked room mystery. Is one of the 
survivors doing the faked suicides, arranged accidents and seemingly random 
shootings? In between sessions of affectionate and enthusiastic sex, Scudder 
discovers the miscreant and sees to a fiendishly clever punishment, such as 
might delight readers of Evelyn Waugh. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a welcome visit with an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Historical mysteries are a growing sub-genre within crime fiction and Leonard 
Tourney's Joan and Matthew Stock series, set in Elizabethan times, is one of 
the surest-handed. FROBISHER'S SAVAGE (St. Martin's: $20.95; 304 pp.) takes off 
from the fact that the 16th-Century English explorer Martin Frobisher brought 
back to London an Eskimo captured on Greenland during Frobisher's unsuccessful 
search for a northwest passage to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Here the captive, named Adam Nemo by the Brits, ends as a servant at a country 
estate after many a demeaning, disorienting experience in London. His earlier 
life is becoming a fast-fading dream, his only friend is a mute boy on the next 
farm. Now the farm family, except for the boy, has been brutally murdered, and 
Adam and the boy are prime suspects, each being in his way an outcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourney's carefully plotted book is a parable on mob violence, the 
manipulation of opinion by planted gossip and the narrow margin by which truth 
may win over miscarriages of justice, if it does. As in earlier volumes, the 
real star of the piece is Joan rather than her earnest clothier husband. The 
ending is not without tragedy and there is an extremely eloquent passage on 
Adam, adrift again. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles author Rochelle Majer Krich has made Jewish life in the city her 
special province. "Till Death Us Do Part," a paperback original, was a 
fascinating mystery involving the difficulties of a wife obtaining a divorce 
under Jewish tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Her protagonist, detective Jessica Drake, introduced in "Fair Game" (a serial 
murdered plotting his crimes on a Monopoly board), is not Jewish, but the plot 
in ANGEL OF DEATH (Mysterious Press: $18.95; 384 pp.) centers on a parade 
through a Jewish section in mid-town by neo-Nazis and others who deny the 
existence of the Holocaust. Violence precedes the parade, a death occurs during 
it and more violence follows. 
</P>
<P>
 A Jewish lawyer who defends the First Amendment rights of the neo-Nazis is 
estranged from his own parents and decried by other Jews who feel he has 
betrayed his own heritage. He is killed by a car bomb and Drake must sort out 
the tangle of motivations, involving both Jews and anti-Semites, for the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an unusual choice of material for a crime novel but it creates a high 
seriousness that is also unusual in a crime novel. Krich, who teaches English 
at Yeshiva High School and manages to write while also raising six children, 
has made a swift advance from paperback originals to hardcovers and, this time, 
an author tour of several cities. It is deserved recognition, because she uses 
her well-plotted stories and roundly depicted characters to give a sympathetic, 
close-up portrait of what for many readers may be largely unfamiliar terrain.

STYLE: HOME DESIGN; METAMORPHOSIS; THE ARRESTING DEVELOPMENT OF FURNITURE AS WE 
KNOW IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Thornburg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Furnishings, like living things, take shape, evolve and sometimes wind up back 
where they started, albeit in striking new forms. The latest generation of 
furniture represents several design developments, some still in the formative 
stages but all certain to spawn eclectic interiors in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most significant trend is the rise of furnishings with multiple 
personalities. Instead of the often-non-functional art furniture of the 
extravagant '80s, practical pieces that perform more than one function 
characterize what French designer Philippe Starck has dubbed "the responsible 
time." A table that converts to seating, for example, satisfies the desire for 
something extra -- the mantra of the mid-'90s value-conscious shopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers are also borrowing from the past again, this time reviving 
zoomorphism in general and period styles in particular. But unlike solemn Roman 
thrones with lion's-paw feet, today's animal-inspired furniture exhibits a 
sci-fi edge with a sense of humor. And the current return to yesteryear's 
classics is noteworthy for the use of modern materials: stainless steel and 
spandex instead of gilt bronze and rice paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Other designers turn previously overlooked natural resources into artful and 
functional objects. Such "recycling" of twigs or coconut shells takes advantage 
of materials that would otherwise go to waste and enables consumers to feel as 
though they're doing the right thing by the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Upholstery options have expanded to include refreshing combinations. With 
mix-and-match clothing paving the way, sofas and chairs are showing up in 
everything from linen and pigskin to white canvas and blue velvet. In addition, 
the slipcover that both dresses and protects has become a smart accessory 
reminiscent of the Victorian antimacassar. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, colors, which often define their time -- remember the electric 
greens and acid pinks of the psychedelic '60s? -- are now influenced by Mother 
Nature's rich palette and bear names such as "Sun," "New Meadow" and 
"H-Blue-O." 
</P>
<P>
 Furniture, of course, will continue its fascinating metamorphosis, passing 
from one surprising form to another, adapting to the world around it. For a 
piece to survive, only one thing must remain constant. As New York designer 
Monique Savarese put it: "People still have to fall in love with it."

AT A CROSSWINDS; HEAVY SAUCES AND PREDICTABLE DISHES HAVE MISTRAL IN THE 
DOLDRUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We rush from the car through Mistral's doorway, leaving outside the hot gusts 
scooting bits of paper down the sidewalk, the Los Angeles equivalent of the 
mistral , the malevolent icy wind that torments the south of France. 
Immediately, the host of the 7-year-old San Fernando Valley restaurant rushes 
over to assure us our table will be ready in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiters in black vests and crisp white shirts clear the table, setting out 
heavy porcelain and serviceable wineglasses. A couple seated at the green 
banquette along the wall toast each other with Champagne. At the bar, a group 
waits for a table, the young women in spare black dresses sipping martinis. The 
high wood ceiling is burnished and the soft light from the shimmering 
chandeliers gives the room a romantic, old-fashioned feeling. We feel content, 
cared for, pleased to find this little bistro. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Richard Flanagan was cooking here, I had a meal as good as any I've had 
at a one-star restaurant in France," says one friend as we settle in at our 
table. "He was American, but he had a French heart." Well, it turns out that 
Flanagan, who built much of Mistral's reputation for good French cooking, has 
moved on. And the new chef is French -- which sounds encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we open our menus, only to find a collection of the kind of popular 
California-French/Italian dishes that restaurateurs are convinced spell 
sure-fire success. Caesar salad. Goat cheese salad. Pizzas. Angel hair pasta. 
Our hearts sink. We read on. Whitefish or chicken in Dijon mustard sauce -- now 
that sounds more like what we had in mind. A few dishes on the page of specials 
are promising. Still, we take some time to pick our way through the menu, 
holding onto the hope that well-crafted cooking will redeem the dreary-sounding 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The beet and walnut salad is fine, slices of cooked beets dressed abundantly 
in horseradish cream. It's a lot of salad; everything here is served up with a 
generous hand. There's a good aioli, the real thing, slick and greenish and 
sharp with pounded fresh garlic, served alongside a bowl of fish, shellfish and 
potatoes in a delicious briny broth. But a savory tartlet has such bland, heavy 
potato-and-onion filling, it becomes real work to eat more than a few bites. I 
like the warm piquant potato salad, but the marinated herrings draped on top 
are inedible -- old-tasting, with the texture of wet sawdust. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the meal, the staff are engaging and on their toes. When the wine 
buff at our table (aware of the dearth of interesting choices on the list) 
pulls out a bottle of good Burgundy, our waiter is immediately at his side. Not 
only is he there to open the wine, but he heads off any unforeseen 
embarrassment by thoughtfully noting the corkage fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The main courses arrive: Each plate looks as if it came off the assembly line 
with the same neatly aligned array of vegetables: green beans, whole baby 
carrots, a tomato half stuffed with diced zucchini, potato puree piped. If 
that's not indication enough of the kitchen's laziness, each of the meat dishes 
is napped with a suspiciously similar clear brown sauce that manages to 
obliterate any differences in the taste of the perfectly cooked lamb or veal 
chop. 
</P>
<P>
 It was telling of the restaurant's problems when a friend at the table 
described to her husband the crispy free-range chicken sitting in a thick Dijon 
mustard sauce. The otherwise polite and appreciative bon vivant, who eats out 
enthusiastically all over town, couldn't help commenting, "If I had cooked this 
chicken at home, you would have taken one bite, put down your fork and said, 
'Well, honey, why don't we go out to a restaurant after all.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this was not an isolated, unlucky meal. On another visit, an 
even heavier brown reduction was poured with abandon on the chicken Mistral, on 
the lovely pork loin and the veal chop. It's as if the chef is intent on making 
every other dish taste the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mistral's menu does include a few decent dishes: pissaladie re, the 
Provencal cousin of pizza, topped with caramelized onions, salty anchovy 
fillets and Nicoise olives; a German potato salad with rustic grilled chicken 
sausages; a tender, not very flavorful steak, topped with a knob of herb butter 
and accompanied by crisp pommes frites. Swordfish is beautifully grilled, but 
its orange-ginger sauce is a close relative of sweet-and-sour. There's also a 
classic creme brulee and a nice pear tart. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery is why, with Pinot Bistro just down the way (a restaurant that 
offers truly interesting French food), Mistral doesn't make at least an attempt 
to be more daring. Instead of holding to a true course, the kitchen shifts with 
the prevailing winds of trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistral, 13422 Ventura Blvd . , Sherman Oaks; (818) 981-6650. Closed Sunday 
and Saturday at lunch. Dinner for two, food only, $40 to $76. Corkage $10.

THEATER NOTES; THE OVATION PROCESS, EXPLAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Don Shirley, Don Shirley is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nominations for L.A.'s first peer-judged competitive theater awards will be un 
veiled Tuesday, as Theatre LA's Ovation Award enters a new chapter in its 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1989 as an award for lifetime achievement, the Ovation will now 
primarily honor specific achievements onstage during a single year. Although a 
single award for lifetime work also will be announced on Tuesday, most of the 
attention will be focused on the nominations for the 24 competitive awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Think Tonys, not Kennedy Center Honors. But in a painstaking effort to insure 
fairness, the rules about who may vote for which Ovations are actually much 
more complicated than they are at the Tonys, which rely on an honor system to 
make sure that people don't pass judgment on works they haven't seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every show locally is competing for Ovations. Contending shows must have 
been presented by a member of the sponsoring organization, Theatre LA, between 
Sept. 1, 1993, and Aug. 30, 1994. There are currently 119 members. But two of 
the area's most prominent companies don't belong -- South Coast Repertory never 
joined, and the Theatre Corp. of America (which presented shows at Pasadena 
Playhouse and the Alex Theatre during the past year) dropped out last spring 
because of its ongoing financial crisis. (Theatre LA membership costs .001% of 
total annual grosses. Minimum dues are $180, the maximum is $800.) Nor is 
Hollywood's well-known Cast Theatre a member. 
</P>
<P>
 Contending productions must have played at least 12 performances and operated 
with an Actors' Equity agreement. They must have been registered with Theatre 
LA (for a $20 fee per production), and at least eight of the 92 certified 
voters must have seen and graded them. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, only 65 companies registered even one show. But those 65 registered 
a total of 169 shows. Twelve shows were eliminated because fewer than eight 
voters scored them. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Theatre LA member was entitled to be represented by one voter, who was 
forbidden to grade shows from his or her own company. But only 92 voters began 
the process, including 12 at-large voters who were recruited in order to 
increase the size of the voting pool and the variety of professional 
credentials within it. Of the original 92, 10 didn't bother to grade a single 
show. However, the remaining 82 voters submitted 2,143 scorecards -- each 
active voter graded an average of 26 shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prolific voters went far beyond that average. As of Sept. 12, 
at-large voter Dick Dotterer and Heather McQuarrie of Shakespeare Festival/LA 
had graded 110 shows each. Aside from the 10 deadbeats, however, other voters 
were disqualified from participating in the final voting because they didn't 
send in scorecards from at least 25 shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters also were eliminated from the upcoming final round if fewer than 80% of 
the shows they graded were in sub-100-seat theaters. This is part of Theatre 
LA's effort to make sure the L.A. theater scene's many smaller fish aren't 
swallowed up by its few big fish. That's also the rationale behind splitting 
six award categories -- musical, play and four design honors -- into separate 
awards for achievement in small (sub-100-seat) and large theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the stringent rules, only 42 voters will participate in the final 
round. And it's likely that even fewer voters will determine the winners in the 
more obscure categories, because yet another requirement limits final-round 
voting in any category only to those voters who submitted score cards for all 
five nominees within that category. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the new Ovation procedures have been accompanied by a change in the 
trophy itself. Robert Graham's 17-pound faux -lamps, awarded to the previous 
lifetime achievement winners, have been replaced by a two-pound statuette 
designed by Christopher Komuro, art director of Center Theatre Group. The 
design was inspired by the logo for Theatre LA's 688-ARTS informational 
telephone service, according to the group's executive director William 
Freimuth, but the figure in the statue has been abstracted so that it's 
"androgynous, outside of time, outside of ethnicity," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The color is, in Freimuth's words, "Coke-bottle green," which places it 
securely outside of ethnicity. But one observer quickly noted that the statue's 
"androgynous" figure, accepting an ovation, appears to be dressed in a long 
gown -- and "how many men go around wearing long gowns?"

MUSIC & DANCE NEWS; HE CREATES BECAUSE HE MUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The state of the national economy regarding the arts, reduced opportunities 
for dancers and dancemakers and his recent knee surgery might have put 
choreographer Lar Lubovitch in a deep funk. In fact, all these things, he 
acknowledges, on the phone from New York, are on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But: "The knee is on the way to a complete recovery." End of subject. And the 
economy and its impact on artists are constants, to be coped with daily and 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worry about money, but its lack doesn't stop us from going on. We've 
always gone on. Art is something we do because we must." He says the last in an 
upbeat tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Eschewing pessimism, the 51-year-old Lubovitch notes he is having a busy year. 
A very busy year. 
</P>
<P>
 * His new ballet for a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Oklahoma!" is now 
touring England -- and due in London late this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * His 20-minute ballet for the failed Broadway musical, "The Red Shoes," did 
not die with the show, but is having a second life, and will be seen on the 
American Ballet Theatre program in San Diego in January. 
</P>
<P>
 * His long-term efforts as a creator of ice-dancing choreographies continue -- 
he first began working with the late John Currie in the 1970s -- his latest 
project being an hour-long realization of Gustav Holst's astrology-inspired 
suite, "The Planets." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not my project exclusively, but I have contributed a lot to it," he 
points out. Working in this medium, he uses "a different language than I use in 
stage dancing. Since I don't skate, it's a different challenge, too, but one 
which I find refreshing, and which replenishes me. "The Planets" will be seen 
on an Arts & Entertainment cable special in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the 25th anniversary of Lubovitch's dance company, the 
celebrations starting with a two-week New York City engagement at the Joyce 
Theater in November. Then it's back on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour repertory for this season -- the company is scheduled to dance at 
Pepperdine University in Malibu, March 3 and 4 -- includes four signature 
pieces from Lubovitch's three-decade oeuvre of 70 works, plus a recent Cole 
Porter suite titled, "So in Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Has the road changed in all these years? 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course. Everything has changed," Lubovitch says. "The rise of dance as an 
economic force has created new sets of priorities in the minds of artists. 
Before the National Endowment for the Arts existed, creative people made art 
for themselves and their audiences. Now, there is another dimension, what some 
call 'grantability,' which can make our art shallow and mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, real artists will always be true to themselves. But, sometimes 
that means going against current trends." 
</P>
<P>

 COMPOSERS' CORNER: Harrison Birtwistle's opera, "The Second Mrs. King," 
commissioned by Glyndebourne Festival Opera, and receiving its first 
performances this fall by the touring arm of that company, will be heard at 
Glyndebourne itself, next summer . . . Works by Los Angeles composer Miguel del 
Aguila are receiving premiere performances this fall. Two weeks ago, in New 
York City, the New Juilliard Ensemble introduced Aguila's "Conga-Line in Hell," 
a chamber version of the large-orchestra piece, "Conga," which received its 
premiere, by the Ventura County Symphony, Saturday in Oxnard Civic Auditorium. 
And Nov. 19, the Ojai Camerata sings Aguila's "Cuauhtemoc" Choral Suite, drawn 
on music from that opera, in Ojai . . . British composer Michael Nyman appears 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, Thursday, in tandem 
with his own amplified instrumental ensemble augmented by players of the 
Pacific Symphony . . . Music by Alma Mahler, Lili Boulanger, Tania Leon, Elinor 
Remick Warren, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and 13 other female composers -- plus 
Benjamin Britten -- makes up the 1994-95 season of the San Francisco Bay 
Area-based Women's Philharmonic. JoAnn Falletta conducts all four concerts.

 MAGAZINE WARS: Another periodical with a battle on its hands -- in fact, two 
battles -- is the hip-hop monthly the Source.Public Enemy has made its new 
video for the song "I Stand Accused" a vicious spoof of the magazine -- renamed 
"the Soft" in the video -- in retaliation for a negative review of PE's recent 
"Muse Sick N Hour Mess Age" album.  
</P>
<P>
 Like the Source, the magazine depicted in the video has a white publisher and 
editor, a circumstance that PE mocks as being out of touch with African 
American culture. A representative for PE confirmed that the video targets the 
Source, but would not comment further. Steve Hochman

 MORE AT THE SOURCE: Meanwhile, the writer of the negative Public Enemy review, 
James Bernard, is also at war with the Source staff and has been suspended by 
publisher David Mays. The action comes after Bernard, the magazine's executive 
editor and part owner, publicly accused Mays of having a financial stake in a 
rap group he insisted on featuring in the magazine.Bernard has also filed a 
document in a New York City court alleging that members of that group 
physically harassed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays says he has no connection besides friendship with the group, the Almighty 
RSO, and that he assigned a free-lance writer to do a story on the group after 
Bernard refused.  
</P>
<P>
 Bernard did not return phone calls from Pop Eye, but he recently faxed a 
letter carrying his charges to more than 500 people in the press and record 
industry  
</P>
<P>
 Mays, who praises Bernard for his contributions to the Source, says the matter 
is actually the culmination of "a longstanding dispute over the direction of 
the magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Mays, "I've had very serious problems with some of the things that have 
gone in the magazine," including the PE review. "Over the past year the Source 
has crossed the line between honest criticism and personal attacks." Steve

 POSSESSED: An Ottawa, Canada computer programmer has filed a lawsuit against 
singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan claiming that her song "Possession," about an 
obsessive fan, is based on letters he sent her over a two-year period. Uwe 
Vandrei is asking for $250,000 to compensate for "damages for breach of 
confidence and breach of moral rights" as well as acknowledgment from McLachlan 
of his role in the song, which is on McLachlan's latest album, "Fumbling 
Towards Ecstasy." 
</P>
<P>
 Vandrei's attorney did not return calls from Pop Eye, but Vandrei himself has 
posted a lengthy letter on the Internet computer service elaborating his claims 
and admitting that he is a "fervent" fan of the singer. But he argues that the 
feelings expressed in the letters to McLachlan were not meant for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry McBride, McLachlan's Vancouver-based manager and the president of 
Nettwerk Records, says that the charges are groundless. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy's trying to gain fame and access to Sarah," he says. "It's a pretty 
bad situation. He's an admitted fanatical fan trying to say this song's been 
written about him when it's not." Steve Hochman

 WATTAGE: The surviving members of Nirvana have made their first new recording 
together since the April suicide of Kurt Cobain, joining Pearl Jam's Eddie 
Vedder on a song for the debut solo album by former Firehose and Minutemen 
bassist Mike Watt. Drummer Dave Grohl, bassist Krist Novoselic, Watt and Vedder 
teamed on a song titled "Against the '70s." 
</P>
<P>
 The album, due in February or March on Columbia Records, is an 
alternative-rock all-star collection, with Watt's other guests including Porno 
for Pyros' Perry Farrell and Stephen Perkins, Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore, Lee 
Ranaldo and Steve Shelley, Beastie Boy Adam Horovitz, Soul Asylum's Dave 
Pirner, head Lemonhead Evan Dando and Henry Rollins. Steve Hochman

POP EYE: DEAL HAS SPIN IN A PHAIR-SIZED SNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Levine, from New York, and Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't hold your breath waiting to read about the new Liz Phair album in Spin 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Spin -- arguably the leading "alternative" music magazine -- is boycotting the 
singer-songwriter, arguably the most talked-about new "alternative" star. The 
magazine killed a highly positive review of her new album, "Whip-Smart," and a 
feature story on the artist also fell through. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because Phair chose to launch the album with a cover story in Rolling 
Stone, and agreed to Rolling Stone's stipulation that she not appear on any 
other magazine cover beforehand or while the issue is on the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Spin editor Craig Marks says that Phair reneged on a promise to do a Spin 
feature. Writer Charles Aaron had flown from New York to Chicago, Phair's 
hometown, to interview her before being told that Phair was going with Rolling 
Stone and declining Spin's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all thought the story was going to happen," Marks says. "She pulled out of 
a commitment she made to us. . . . Her treatment (of us) was such that I 
couldn't let her get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Phair's manager Will Botwin counters that Spin would not commit to putting 
Phair on the cover. So when Rolling Stone offered its cover slot, it was hard 
to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a total overreaction," says Botwin of Spin's boycott. "They 
didn't commit to the cover until after Rolling Stone. They would have you 
believe she's somehow walking away from the alternative market, but that has 
nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marks says that he doesn't expect to feature anything about Phair for the 
"foreseeable" future. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he have any second thoughts about ignoring one of the year's most 
high-profile releases? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he says. "There's many, many bands and artists to write about, so I 
don't think not having any one band or artist in a magazine will affect the 
readership."  
</P>
<P>
 Phair's manager Botwin hopes the matter will blow over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no hard feelings for Spin," he says. "And we'd still be happy to do 
their cover." Robert Levine, from New York, and Steve Hochman

SOUND & VISION: THE KINDEST CUT OF ALL IS NO CUT AT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Willman, Chris Willman's Sound & Vision appears regularly in Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody likes to complain about "MTV-style editing" taking over the movies, 
by which they mean to say that the filmmakers mean to dazzle you into jellied 
submission with as frantic a cutting style as possible. (For reference, see -- 
or don't -- "Natural Born Killers," the ultimate refractory-mind-set movie.) 
</P>
<P>
 But all of a sudden, it seems, "MTV cutting" means no cuts at all. As in, 
zilch. 
</P>
<P>
 Has Jim Jarmusch replaced Oliver Stone as the channel's spiritual godfather? 
Probably not, but there's a mini-trend here. 
</P>
<P>
 The most famous recent example of a genuinely edit-free clip was "Stay," whose 
concentration on a single take of Lisa Loeb alone was crucial in propelling her 
winsomeness to the top of the pops. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we may be in for a season when every director wants to forgo the cutting 
room altogether. Just out on MTV are two new stabs at the same: Lucas' hip-hop 
breakthrough "Lucas With the Lid Off" and the Gin Blossoms' also-ran "Allison 
Road." 
</P>
<P>
 We'll forgo the temptation to make this edition of Sound & Vision -- in which 
music videos are reviewed and rated from 0 to 100 -- one single, uninterrupted, 
run-on sentence as homage. Lucky you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas, "Lucas With the Lid Off." In an impressively fast-moving, uninterrupted 
Steadicam shot, director Michel Gondry follows the Copenhagen-born oddball 
Lucas in and out of 15 adjacent sets, some situated at brain-puzzling right 
angles. Small-scale models, rear-projection footage and live rappers seen on 
monitors add to the mad jumble. 
</P>
<P>
 The music incorporates a playful ragtime flavor as well as reggae, so it's no 
surprise that part of what pops out of Lucas' brain in these interconnected 
scenes is Jazz Age-era silent comedy scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 Gondry's single-shot gimmick wouldn't count for much if Lucas' tune -- an 
innocent celebration of mind expansion -- weren't such grand, goofy fun on its 
own merits. This is a MTV "Buzz Bin" entry that really does leave you with a 
good buzz every time. 83 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones, "Love Is Strong." A literally -- though probably not quite 
figuratively -- towering achievement. Through some superior digital effects, 
the Stones grow to skyscraper height and lumber -- along with some likewise 
50-foot women -- through the streets of Manhattan, reconvening over Central 
Park's treetops. 
</P>
<P>
 The naysayer might say this merely confirms the Stones' dated bloatedness, 
making them look like Macy's Parade balloons. But, in fact, gigantism is one of 
the greatest of all youthful male fantasies, and this taller-than-thou walk 
through the park is nothing if not the most supreme, outsize extension of rock 
juvenilia. Here, to walk tall is not to grow up 't'all. 79 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Green Day, "Basket Case." The Ramones got here first -- not just with the 
jackhammer power-pop Green Day has so effectively appropriated, but also with 
the "Psychotherapy" clip, which had that band under sedation long before it 
occurred to these young-'uns to set up shop in a mental ward. But, derivation 
aside, this is a trio that just clicks . So does the video, not least of all 
because all rock drummers should want to play opening rolls and fills as 
spot-on as Tre does from a wheelchair. (Now if only they'd run into Laura 
Leighton in a straitjacket, this would've been a classic.) 70 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ice Cube With George Clinton, "Bop Gun." There's something weird and funny 
about the way Cube always plays the ascetic, even in this celebratory a video. 
Invited by Clinton to a bash, Cube scowls, "I don't know, man, your 
get-togethers are kinda wild ," as if an actual good time were the worst thing 
he could think of. Of course Cube shows but -- rather than indulge in partying 
-- grimaces and shakes his head, eager no doubt to get back to the bitter 
business of social commentary. The Benedictine Monks would be proud. 69 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Gin Blossoms, "Allison Road." The Blossoms' clip is a lot like Lucas' -- 
one traveling Steadicam shot through an underfurnished house, past an array of 
TV sets showing band performance footage. Unfortunately, the gimmick doesn't 
pay off in any interesting way, and you end up wondering more about who's 
moving into or out of the house than what the band's up to on those little 
13-inch screens. 50 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boyz II Men, "I'll Make Love to You." Cartoon-romantic subservience to the n 
th power: "Your wish is my command / I submit to your demands / I'll make love 
to you, when you want me to / And I will not let go till you tell me to." Is it 
too late to get these boyz II a sweat lodge or something? 
</P>
<P>
 The video has a young woman whose wealth matches her sweetness hiring the 
group to install a security system at her manse. As she absently luxuriates in 
a bubble bath, the lonely millionairess gazes longingly at the lads' business 
card, and . . . why, isn't that them out there serenading on the lawn right 
now? Why isn't the alarm going off? What kind of security is this? 41 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Changing Faces, "Stroke You Up." In the ad nauseam chorus, this new female duo 
asks again and again: "I've got a question: Do you mind if I stroke you up? Do 
you mind if I stroke you down?" Geez, any university co-ed these days knows the 
importance of verbal contracts as foreplay to intimate relations, but this R&B 
ballad sounds less like a come-on than a lengthy pre-coital consent form. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will mistake the video's setting for a dorm room, though. The two 
remarkably stiff-looking ingenues appear on TV monitors in a dimly lit, 
Doberman-filled mansion. Watching them is the song's producer-writer, R. Kelly, 
a Svengali in silhouette, gripping a wooden cane and responding in a filtered 
voice, as if through the intercom, "I don't miiiind . I don't miiiind ." 
</P>
<P>
 Do you mind if we go play with the Dobies out by the pool while you kids have 
your threesome? Really, we ask it again, do . . . you . . . mind ? 3

 "Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard"

<P>

 * * 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the bottle let me down . 
</P>
<P>
 Those words from a Haggard honky-tonk classic open this 13-song tribute to one 
of the most gifted singer-songwriters in country music since Hank Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, most of this tribute album lets him down. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the collection (which benefits Second Harvest Food Bank 
Network) was to have current country stars -- Clint Black, Alan Jackson, Pam 
Tillis, Brooks & Dunn and others -- record Haggard tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Few come even close to living up to Haggard's vocal standards. They either try 
to copy Haggard's style (an embarrassment) or assert their own style (wasted 
time except for Vince Gill's "The Farmer's Daughter"). Predictably, the 
strongest tracks are by the artists whose talent is closest to Haggard's 
greatness -- Willie Nelson ("Today I Started Loving You Again) and Emmylou 
Harris ("Mama's Hungry Eyes"). 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of the songs alone, however, lifts the package above most 
contemporary country albums. One hopes it will turn a new generation of country 
fans on to Haggard, whose own records fall on the wrong side of the generation 
gap to get much airplay on country stations. When he sings these songs, we're 
talking five stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

 Though Danzig the entity swaggers boldly, swathed in a dark mystique, it is 
the stark musical vision of Glenn Danzig the man that lures you into the gloom. 
His group's new album finds the foreboding foursome in top form, executing its 
leader's directives with burly grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going Down to Die" smolders at the crossroads where the raw emotion of blues 
meets the steely stylization of Goth rock. In "Domination," Danzig's vocals 
flex and coil in a reverberating box of sound. "Little Whip" canters along with 
a touch of Western twang. "I Don't Mind the Pain" mingles the twang with a 
Middle Eastern lilt and sinister, seductive groove. 
</P>
<P>
 Underpinning all the hardness is a soft, albeit creepy, romanticism that 
emerges in the occasional calms. New albums are rated on a scale of one star 
(poor) to four stars (excellent).

CRITIC'S PICK: 'RUNNING MATES'

<TEXT>
<P>
 In this light, blithe '92 made-for-cable romantic comedy, a presidential 
candidate's fiancee becomes the source of scandal just as he's entering the 
home stretch of an effective campaign. With Diane Keaton as the fiancee and Ed 
Harris as the senator who would appear to have the White House within his 
grasp, the film sparkles like a Tracy-Hepburn picture. Director Michael 
Lindsay-Hogg and writer A.L. Appling deftly show, through the conflicting ideas 
of how a First Lady should behave, the larger issue of the evolving role of 
women in American society (HBO Monday at 2 p.m., Friday at 11 a.m.). Kevin 
Thomas

 DO IT YOURSELF: Rhino Records is acknowledged as one of the best, if not the 
best, packager of compilations.So it's hard to figure why Rhino executives 
would want your help. But they do. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its "Sweet 16" anniversary, Rhino is holding a contest in 
conjunction with Tower Records for the best concept for a compilation album. 
The winner -- to be selected on the basis of creativity, commercial viability 
and feasibility (i.e. the licensing availability of material) -- will get 
compiler-producer credit and fees for the album. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm expecting the entries to be an equal mix of serious and humorous 
approaches," says Rhino vice president Gary Stewart. "But we'll consider 
anything that's viable." Steve Hochman

 DINNER WITH LINDA: Paul McCartney has sold more than 100 million records as 
part of the Beatles, Wings and as a solo artist. Now his wife, Linda, has also 
sold that amount . . . of frozen vegetarian dinners.Yes, her line of meatless 
meals (recently introduced in the United States) is now the biggest-selling of 
its kind in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, the company that markets them decided we'd need some physical 
comparisons to understand how many dinners that really is. Figuring on three 
veggie sausages per dinner, a press release tells us, those 100 million dinners 
would, laid end to end, stretch from London to Australia and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Still can't see it? OK -- stacked on top of each other they would be as high 
as 431 Mt. Everests. Not good enough? Trucks carrying 100 million meals would 
stretch 12 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wonder how many McDonald's you could build from them?

CRITIC'S PICK: 'RUBY IN PARADISE'

<TEXT>
<P>
 Victor Nunez's 1993 release, one of last year's best, is an intimate, low-key 
film as endearing and staunch as its heroine.A warm, perceptive depiction of 
everyday life, "Ruby" illuminates the inner being of a seemingly ordinary young 
woman in the process of creating a life for herself. It reveals the courage it 
can take to strike out on one's own and to take charge of one's own destiny. It 
marks the screen debut of radiant Ashley Judd (pictured), and features Dorothy 
Lyman as her first employer, Bentley Mitchum as Lyman's memorably nasty son and 
Todd Field as a pivotal man in Judd's life (Cinemax Friday at 8 p.m.). Kevin

 Director Penelope Spheeris brings equal amounts of sophistication and 
affection to her smart, fresh spin on the 1962-1971 TV series, while honoring 
the cornball humor of the original. Hillbilly billionaire Jed Clampett (Jim 
Varney, far left) heads for the hills of Beverly with the hopes of making a 
lady out of his tomboy daughter Elly May (Erika Eleniak, center, with Cloris 
Leachman as Granny and Diedrich Bader as Jethro.) Threatening to run off with 
the entire film is Lily Tomlin as an uptight but randy Miss Hathaway (HBO

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; THE TRAVELS OF YOUNG SEAN PATRICK FLANERY CONTINUE ON 
CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Sean Patrick Flanery ever decided to give up acting, he could probably open 
up his own travel agency. The star of "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" 
visited 50 countries in three years, spending as much as a month in some of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the show, which began on ABC in March, 1992, hasn't aired since the 
spring of 1993, production of the ambitious, costly series from George Lucas 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been basically working on the show nonstop," says the 28-year-old 
Flanery from his Hollywood Hills home, where he returned last month after 
shooting four "Young Indiana Jones" movies for the Family Channel, each 
budgeted at $3 million. The first, "Young Indiana Jones and the Hollywood 
Follies," airs this week. 
</P>
<P>
 He readily acknowledges that the series never quite found an audience at the 
network level. "There are a lot of different reasons I don't think it worked," 
he explains. "It seemed like every week it was on at a different day and time. 
Also, every story's so different from the other. It wasn't very fluid from week 
to week. One week Indy is with Albert Schweitzer in the Congo and then it's a 
love story in London. Then he was meeting Tolstoy in Russia. Each and every 
story was so brilliant in its own way, but you didn't have the sameness from 
week to week." Audiences know, he adds, "when they tune in to 'Roseanne,' they 
know they're going to see the living room and just about every character 
they'll see. It's repetitive, but nurturing." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the show's commercial failure, it developed enough core fans and 
critical plaudits for the Family Channel to order four two-hour movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a quality show," Flanery says. "It combines history with comedy and 
drama and action." 
</P>
<P>
 "Each episode was like working on a movie," Flanery recalls of the George 
Lucas Ltd. productions. "If it says, 'Thailand, 1919,' we filmed it in 
Thailand. If it said 'Africa, 1917,' we shot it in Africa. Each country 
depicted was shot in the actual country." Other locations the show ventured to: 
China, Austria, France, India, Czechoslovakia and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, "The Hollywood Follies" finds Indy meeting Erich Von Stroheim and 
Irving Thalberg. Three of the four new "Indy" movies cover World War I and the 
fourth is set circa 1910, with Indy as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The titles of the upcoming movies are "Young Indiana Jones and the Treasures 
of the Peacock's Eye," "Young Indiana Jones and the Attack of the Hawkmen" and 
"Young Indiana Jones and Travels With Father." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanery wouldn't mind working on a feature with some of the directors Lucas 
brought in to direct: Nicolas Roeg ("Don't Look Now"), Bille August ("Pelle the 
Conqueror") and Terry Jones ("Monty Python's Life of Brian"). 
</P>
<P>
 The winter of 1993 offered Flanery his longest break on the show. In two 
months he managed to squeeze in two films, the as-yet-unreleased feature 
"Spirit," with Diane Ladd, and the already-aired Lifetime movie "Guinevere," 
shot in Lithuania, which co-starred Sheryl Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanery, a Louisiana native and business grad, decided to be an actor in 
college. "After graduation, I went to Los Angeles," he says matter-of-factly. 
After a year of being a waiter at the Canoga Park TGIF restaurant, he got his 
first TV movie, which led to three national commercials and eventually "Young 
Indiana Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kept me really busy," he says in grand understatement. "I did have some 
holidays off, though. Except last Christmas, I spent my three-week break 
shooting 'Frank and Jesse,' with Rob Lowe and Bill Paxton." Flanery co-stars as 
reporter Zachary Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, finally, Flanery seems content to slow things down and hang out at 
home, which he says has been "a very expensive storage space." "Basically, I 
want to stay home for a bit and watch the biscuits rise." 
</P>
<P>
 "Young Indiana Jones and the Hollywood Follies" premieres Saturday at 8 p.m. 
on the Family Channel.

Q & A: DAVID GRUBIN AND CURTIS ROOSEVELT; THE NEWEST DEAL ON FDR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States who led the 
country through the Depression and World War II, lived such a complex life that 
historians are still analyzing it. 
</P>
<P>
 PBS' documentary series "American Experience" kicks off its new season with 
"FDR," a 4 1/2-hour profile of the chief executive who changed the concept of 
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary, produced by Emmy Award-winner David Grubin ("LBJ"), offers 
new insights into Roosevelt's character, including the fact that, although he 
was born to wealth, his overprotective mother, Sara, controlled the family 
money. The film also details the emotional and physical hardship Roosevelt 
endured in hiding his disability after being stricken with polio at age 39. 
</P>
<P>
 'FDR" explores the major role his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, had on her 
husband's life and how their marriage was altered after Eleanor learned about 
FDR's affair with her secretary, Lucy Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides using footage and stills, "FDR" features interviews with family 
members, friends and first-hand witnesses, including Curtis Roosevelt, FDR's 
grandson who lived at the White House with his sister and mother Anna; niece 
Eleanor Roosevelt; granddaughter Eleanor Seagraves; FDR biographers Geoffrey 
Ward and Doris Kearns Goodwin, and White House butler Alonzo Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Staff Writer Susan King recently sat down with Grubin and Curtis 
Roosevelt, now 64, to discuss the legacy of FDR and the documentary 'FDR." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Roosevelt, what did you think of the documentary? 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Roosevelt: I've been extremely critical of literally everything that 
has been on screen. I was more than a little questioning what this effort would 
be. If I can be objective in this situation, I think it's quite extraordinary, 
the balance this documentary has achieved, not missing anything. I guess 
there's another aspect to it -- it's got the right tone, a realistic tone. I 
guess what made me feel best is, this is the man that I knew. 
</P>
<P>
 David Grubin: What you're trying to do is bring the man alive. You're always 
afraid, especially with so many achievements as President, that the man will 
get lost in the presidency. Our aim was to try to understand the kind of man 
this was and what qualities he brought to the presidency, what made him one of 
our great Presidents, what qualities of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 He really seemed to love being the President. 
</P>
<P>
 CR: FDR loved politics. He loved the game of it. 
</P>
<P>
 When we moved into the White House, I didn't have a feeling I was moving into 
some place into which we didn't belong. That I could feel at home in the White 
House immediately, it's a direct reflection of FDR's feelings that he had moved 
into the place to which he felt he was rightfully entitled. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think Roosevelt is this century's greatest President? 
</P>
<P>
 DG:: I think he will be the great President of our century, certainly he was 
President longer than any man will ever be, and he met the two great challenges 
of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 CR: If you look at just the cold statistics, our country never got out of the 
Depression until the war. Yet, the difference in the attitude toward life, the 
sense of hope, even if you were still without a job -- that is what FDR gave 
(the country). Sometimes when people talk to me, particularly academicians, in 
facing the stark facts of what the New Deal did and didn't do, in many 
instances it didn't achieve its objective. But it gave people a sense of life 
and hope which they didn't have before. 
</P>
<P>
 It's amazing to see the great lengths Roosevelt went through to create the 
illusion he could use his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 CR: There are a number of elements of the 'crippledness' of my grandfather, I 
learned from the film. As a child we never questioned it. He was always in a 
wheelchair, and that very awkward moment from wheelchair into chair, to chair 
into wheelchair ... it had to be done right or he'd have been on the floor. We 
were not shooed out, but guests would come in after FDR was seated at the table 
and guests would leave before he was shifted into his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did you find that remarkable footage of Roosevelt "walking"? 
</P>
<P>
 DG: No professional photographer would take a picture of Roosevelt walking or 
attempting to move in that way. That was taken by an amateur in 1933. FDR was 
at Vassar at some kind of event. This is the only piece of film that exists 
where you can really see what it took for him to move around without crutches, 
because he felt crutches would inspire pity. So he developed this illusion of 
walking, which you can see how effective it was when you look at the footage at 
his inauguration. He appeared to be walking because he's completely covered and 
from that angle, no one knows he's pressing on his son's arm and thrusting his 
body forward and not using his legs at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Could you talk about Roosevelt's relationship with his mother, Sara? I think 
audiences will be surprised to learn that she really controlled the purse 
strings. 
</P>
<P>
 CR: When FDR's father died, in his will, my grandfather was left a small 
endowment. The rest of the estate went to my great-grandmother who held that 
estate until she died in 1941, three years before her son died. She was very 
generous with FDR whenever he needed (money), but on the other hand, he did 
have to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 But that relationship was very special. It was really a loving relationship in 
spite of the fact she irritated the hell out of him because she was quite 
opinionated. 
</P>
<P>
 "American Experience: FDR" airs Tuesday at 8 p.m. on KVCR and 9 p.m. on KCET 
and KPBS and concludes Wednesday at 8 p.m. on KVCR and KPBS and 9 p.m. on KCET.

ON VIEW; DOMESTIC CHAOS; CBS AIRS FILM THAT WAS IN THE WORKS LONG BEFORE 
SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On June 17, Susan Dey was in Vancouver on the set of her latest TV movie, 
"Beyond Betrayal." The CBS thriller tells the story of an abused wife on the 
run after escaping from the clutches of her brutal husband (Richard Dean 
Anderson) two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day, production was interrupted when the film's executive producer, 
Daniel H. Blatt ("Men Don't Tell"), arrived and informed everyone that O.J. 
Simpson was a fugitive and fleeing police in a white Ford Bronco. It was the 
first time Dey became aware of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson, whose 
marriage to O.J. Simpson was marked by reports of spousal abuse, and Ronald 
Goldman. "To me, it was surrealistic," Dey recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 And now CBS has scheduled "Beyond Betrayal" to air Tuesday, as interest in the 
high-profile Simpson murder case continues to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working on this for years and years," explains Blatt. "This was not 
a reaction to what was going on. It took a long time to get the script (by 
Shelley Evans) right." 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Beyond Betrayal" is about spousal abuse, the domestic violence is 
implied. "The picture deals with a subject matter that is obviously more in the 
public's eye, without being exploitative in any way whatsoever," Blatt says. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Beyond Betrayal," which is directed by Carl Schenkel ("Silhouette"), Dey 
plays Joanna Matthews, a former teacher who has relocated to Seattle and works 
as a waitress under the name of Emma Doyle. Skittish and frequented by 
nightmares of her life with her violent husband Bradley (Anderson), Joanna 
nevertheless feels free for the first time since her marriage. While working, 
she meets a gentle toy maker Sam (Dennis Boutsikaris) whose estranged wife has 
a drug problem. The two slowly fall in love. But unbeknown to Joanna, Bradley, 
who is a policeman, has finally tracked her down. When Bradley murders Sam's 
wife and Sam is thrown in jail for the crime, Joanna must decide if she should 
continue running. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real arc to her character," Blatt says of Dey's Joanna. "She is 
someone who is on the run and afraid and frightened. She (finally) realizes she 
has a sense of her own basic entitlement." 
</P>
<P>
 Dey was intrigued by the "thriller aspect" of the piece and has high praise 
for director Schenkel's taut, visual direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at TV and the need for a change," Dey explains. "Thank God, 
they're moving away from hideous films about making violent acts somewhat 
heroic or interesting. I was really excited about this. This is a thriller and 
yet it also has great meaning behind it and a great heart in it as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The role of the vicious Bradley is a 180-degree turn from Anderson's good-guy 
persona in the title role of "MacGyver" for seven seasons on ABC. "Part of the 
reason I was cast was because I did project a Mr. Nice Guy image," he says. "It 
became important to me to do the role because he wasn't Mr. Nice Guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People asked me if I felt that I was running the risk of being typecast 
staying with 'MacGyver' for so long," Anderson acknowledges. "I guess I never 
felt that way. But I guess the proving of it was going out and doing a variety 
of roles, each of which got progressively darker. In a way, this is the most 
threatening because of his station as a policeman who is physically, 
domestically and psychologically abusive. I think the combination pretty much 
makes him the ugliest." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson talked about the role with friends who are police officers. "They 
tell stories of the tensions and the pressure and the anxiety and stress that 
come with their particular jobs. I don't think the physical and mental abusive 
behavior is necessarily a direct result of the job. We don't tie that into the 
script." 
</P>
<P>
 Dey had a difficult time playing a victim. "I couldn't stand it," she says. 
"She was a victim allowing herself to be in hiding, coming from a small town 
that didn't have the kind of help available in larger towns. Joanna's story is 
more classic in terms of abused women who go underground, go into hiding. She 
couldn't get the system to help her because she came from a small town, and in 
that small town her husband, as a law enforcer, is a hero. The force did 
protect him. She had no choice but to go underground." 
</P>
<P>
 While doing research for her part, Dey met a woman who went underground 
several years before and, like Joanna, her husband was a police officer. "She 
had one of her children with her and the other was still with the father," Dey 
relates. "She validated everything that was in the script." 
</P>
<P>
 These women, Dey says, are not able to use their Social Security cards to get 
the type of job they need to support themselves. "The thing that upset me the 
most is that she said, 'I am about to leave this particular area very soon. The 
moment I start to feel comfortable I know it is time to leave.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dey also worked hard with the costume designer to get a certain look for 
Joanna. "The reality is that (Joanna has) no money. So when we started putting 
together these clothes, there was always something wrong when we tried to put a 
look together. We came down to three outfits, I think, that she just used over 
and over again. I was really pleased when I saw the movie. It's so nondescript. 
It is like there is no personality in those clothes. It is a person who is 
nothing. As much as she's alive, she is nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond Betrayal" airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

 The Family Channel recently added the sagebrush saga "The High Chaparral" to 
its popular Saturday-afternoon Western block, which includes "Bonanza," "The 
Young Riders" and "Gunsmoke." 
</P>
<P>
 "The High Chaparral" premiered Sept. 19, 1967, on NBC. In the late 1960s, 
Westerns were on the wane, and "High Chaparral" was one of the last sagebrush 
series of that decade. High Chaparral was the name of the ranch owned and 
operated by the fictitious Cannon family, who lived in the Arizona territory, 
circa 1870. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran character actor Leif Erickson, who was once briefly married to 
troubled 1930s movie star Frances Farmer, played Cannon patriarch Big John 
Cannon, a stubborn, powerful man whose aim was to establish a cattle empire in 
the territory occupied primarily by Native Americans. Cameron Mitchell played 
John's wild brother Buck, who loved the ladies, loved to drink and loved to 
shoot 'em up. 
</P>
<P>
 Blond, blue-eyed Mark Slade, who was somewhat of a teen heartthrob, was John's 
son, Billy Blue, whose mother was killed by an Apache arrow in the first 
episode. Linda Cristal played John's second wife, Victoria, the daughter of the 
wealthy cattle baron Don Sebastian Montoya (Frank Silvera). Victoria's dashing 
brother Manolito (Henry Darrow) accompanied her to the ranch and stayed on as a 
permanent member. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Collier also was featured as the foreman Sam; Ted Markland, Roberto 
Contreras and Robert Hoy were the ranch hands Reno, Pedro and Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite good performances and story lines dealing with racial issues, "High 
Chaparral" did not crack the top 25 shows during its four-season run on NBC. 
Several cast changes occurred during its last season: Billy Blue rode off into 
the sunset, and when Silvera died, so did his character. Rudy Ramos joined the 
cast as Wind, a young man of white and Native American heritage, who became 
part of the Cannon household. The series, though, was gone with the wind on 
Sept. 10, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "The High Chaparral" airs Saturdays at noon on the Family Channel.

PRIVATE LIVES; COMPUTER GAME REVIEW; FOR SALE: THE 'MONA LISA'; MILLENNIUM 
AUCTION LETS YOU BID ON SOME OF THE WORLD'S TREASURED ARTWORKS AND CURIOS, 
INCLUDING NIXON'S 18 MISSING MINUTES.

 Here we are again in the future with a CD-ROM game that features exotic 
opponents, high-tech gadgets and brutal battles. 
</P>
<P>
 But for once, the setting is neither outer space nor a post-nuclear landscape. 
This futuristic actioner takes place in one of the most vicious of real-life 
settings -- an art auction house. 
</P>
<P>
 Millennium Auction is the first in a planned series of CD-ROM games by the 
Eidolon company in New York targeting an adult audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The game takes place in the year 2011 at a high-stakes auction of some of the 
world's most treasured artworks and curios, including the "Mona Lisa," the 
"Pieta," the missing 18 minutes of Richard Nixon's White House audiotape, "The 
Scream," Mann's Chinese Theatre (the last movie theater in the country) and a 
robotic sex partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-screen players come from a variety of backgrounds and situations, 
including an African American opera diva, a Saudi Arabian developer and a 
German art critic. These exotic-looking bidders seemingly share only one 
attribute in common: None cares about the aesthetics or historical value of the 
items on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole objective of Millennium Auction is to acquire works that will 
increase in value and can be sold during the course of the game at a 
substantial profit. The winner, declared at the end of a 12-item auction sale, 
is the player with the most cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Millennium Auction might be billed as futuristic, but it seems nostalgic for 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My buddy Aaron and I play a round to try out the game. We are first directed 
to pick who we would like to be from a list of seven bidders. Aaron chooses to 
take on the persona of Chanteena, the opera singer. I become Takeshi Mori, 
described as a "Japanese cyberpunk entrepreneur." 
</P>
<P>
 The computer picks two additional players (an auction round requires a total 
of four) -- "arrogant American financier" Randall Smith and German art critic 
Dieter Haas, who would be very much at home on "Sprockets." 
</P>
<P>
 Let the back-stabbing begin. 
</P>
<P>
 We are welcomed by the animated hostess, Nuria, a creepy and completely dour 
"bidder liaison" who speaks of the "unholy marriage of art and money." We enter 
the gallery, where the bidders are depicted as standing among the artworks, 
engaged in pre-auction conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 By clicking on them with the mouse, we overhear snippets of gossip. It seems 
some of the pieces up for auction are of questionable authenticity and others 
are in danger of falling in value. More information is gained from clicking on 
a newscast and from clicking into the maintenance office where Zeke, the kindly 
janitor, has access to some inside skinny. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's off to the bidding room for the action part of the game. All bidders 
start with an $8.5-million stake to make bids. Objects come onto the block and 
a lively on-screen auctioneer kicks off the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron and I hit designated keys on the keyboard when we want to make a bid. 
The computer controls the bidding of Randall and Dieter. The idea is to try to 
get objects you want at a reasonable price while bidding up other objects in 
hopes of depleting your opponents' funds. 
</P>
<P>
 You are never quite sure when the computer-controlled bidders will quit, 
suddenly leaving you stuck with paying for an item you don't want. 
</P>
<P>
 As the game progresses, news events can bolster or deplete the value of the 
objects in your possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Millennium Auction is an attempt to capture the interest of the same adult 
gamers who enjoy the challenge of Monopoly or Pictionary -- games of skill and 
chance that can be played in groups. Millennium Auction is not as engaging as 
those two games -- its game-play is not as straightforward and parts are 
frustratingly repetitive and slow. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, Millennium Auction has wonderful visuals and occasional bits 
of humor far more sophisticated than the CD-ROM norm. It's an admirable, nicely 
stylized first try at what could be an interesting genre for CD-ROM games. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, the two computer bidders came out ahead of both Aaron/Chanteena 
and me/Takeshi. I came in last but am now the proud owner of Hokusai's "View of 
Mr. Fuji" woodcut and the last surviving swordfish on Earth.

PRIVATE LIVES; HOME VIDEO; NO BLARNEY -- WELLES' 'GHOST STORY' EXISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Donald Liebenson, Donald Liebenson writes about home video. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Orson Welles' Ghost Story" is a haunting example of how home video has be 
come the legacy format for rediscovered cinematic treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 This 30-minute program from MPI Home Video is the restored version of "Return 
to Glennascaul," a lyrical "story that is told in Dublin," retitled for video 
to capitalize on Welles' participation. It was nominated for a 1953 Academy 
Award for best short subject and disappeared from view after scant 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a filmed introduction by director -- and Welles biographer -- 
Peter Bogdanovich, this little-known project apparently was a debt of 
friendship to the short's creators, Hilton Edwards and Michael MacLiammoir, 
founders of Dublin's Gate Theater, where Welles made his professional stage 
debut at 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Welles narrates and appears as himself in sequences that frame the story. He 
introduces himself as "your obedient servant" and proceeds to recount a ghost 
story he was told when he picked up a stranded motorist one night. 
</P>
<P>
 MPI acquired the rights to "Return to Glennascaul" from Richard Gordon, best 
known as the producer of the horror cult classic "Fiend Without a Face" and the 
Boris Karloff thrillers "Corridors of Blood" and "The Haunted Strangler." In a 
telephone interview, Gordon said that he found the film by chance through a 
friend who was a distributor in Dublin, Ireland. Together with London's British 
Film Institute, he restored the film and has shown it at film festivals around 
the world and in the "odd theatrical booking." 
</P>
<P>
 But if there is a market for a virtually forgotten four-decade-old short 
subject, it is on videocassette, said Nasar Zegar, MPI's director of operations 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the medium that makes sense for this type of programming," Zegar says. 
"We can reach a widespread audience without relying on television or theatrical 
distribution." 
</P>
<P>
 The release of "Orson Welles' Ghost Story" follows the highly touted 
restorations of Welles' "Othello" and the long-lost unfinished documentary 
"It's All True," both of which are available on videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
 "Return to Glennascaul" is notable because it is a completed work, said 
director Henry Jaglom, one of Welles' closest friends. "I'm just glad that 
people will be seeing a little bit more of him and his wonderful, inspired 
mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orson Welles' Ghost Story" is available at video stores or by calling (800) 
323-0442.

<P>
 Regarding "The Joy of Sax," by Don Heckman (Sept. 25): 
</P>
<P>
 Will someone please say it -- no legend-struck Times journalist will. Hugh 
Hefner is little more than a talented hedonist wishing to go down in history as 
a sexual libertarian. And even with the aid of the L.A. Times, it's hard to 
swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner would like us to see that "the movies and Playboy represent, to much of 
the rest of the world, the best of the American dream." Please. So what that 
Playboy boasts a female CEO and supports jazz. No amount of editorial 
"philosophy" can outstrip the message conveyed by the proposed standard of the 
Playboy centerfold. 
</P>
<P>
 As we look back on this century, Mr. Hefner, Playboy will be just one of many 
examples of the visual byproducts of a male-run society looking after its 
collective libido. And to some degree, the adolescent girl with the low 
self-esteem and eating disorder and the lonely male who keeps it within reach 
on his night stand are indebted. 
</P>

<P>
 Please, please, please ! No more articles about Hugh Hefner! Like most 
halfway-intelligent people, after sowing his wild oats, Hefner got older and 
wiser and settled for the contentment of hearth and home. Millions of people do 
that as a normal sequence of growth. What else is new? 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner is just lucky he didn't contract AIDS, but his flagrant Playboy 
"philosophy," which fueled the era of sexual "liberation," no doubt accounted 
for others who did. I hope we've heard the last of him. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I feel sick that you would put Hugh Hefner on your cover. Nothing he has done 
deserves the respect or attention. He has built his life on a lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Since when has sleeping with "more than a thousand" women become a badge of 
honor? I'd never look at a guy who made that claim; he wouldn't deserve someone 
as good as me. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole Playboy philosophy is damaging to relationships. How can you write 
about this man and his wasted life as if he deserves anybody's respect? I like 
jazz, but I'll never go to an event sponsored by Playboy. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 We were told more about Hefner's childhood fantasies, his bed bouncing and the 
history of Playboy magazine than we were of his commitment to and passion for 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 How about some words from Hefner on the once-great Playboy Jazz Festival 
evolving into beach-ball toss to the sound of beer and wine bottles rolling 
down the concrete steps? Among Hefner's fantastic array of toys he must possess 
a great record collection. What you have in your library is what you really 
like. What are his favorites? What records is he still looking for? 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner must have made some musician friends (when Stan Getz and Dizzy 
Gillespie play in your living room?). The article should have been overflowing 
with anecdotes. How does Hefner see the future of jazz? Does he have any 
fantasies of supporting the local performing and recording scene?  
</P>
<P>
 We are dutifully informed that Hef slept with "more than a thousand women." I 
get the impression that "lady jazz" was just another of them.

REALITY INTRUDES AS MODERN-DAY PIONEERS PURSUE FRONTIER SPIRIT; ALASKA: FOR 
DECADES, ANY AMERICAN COULD CLAIM UNRESERVED FEDERAL LAND HERE, BUT NO MORE.

 No one seemed to be home -- just a German shepherd whose wild barking inside 
the log cabin suggested it was time for the visitor to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a boy stepped out from behind a tree, his eyes wide at the sight of a 
stranger. He dashed off without a word, leading the way to a pile of rocks in 
the woods. Near the rocks was a hole and, down in the hole, sweating and 
jabbing with a shovel, was the boy's father. 
</P>
<P>
 Digging a well? the visitor asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a grave," the man said quietly. "For my wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years have passed since Pete and Rosemary Oliva came to Cascade Creek 
with the dream of building a cabin in the Alaska wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 By the luck of the draw or the will of God -- Pete and Rosemary always 
believed it to be the latter -- they slipped into one of the last spots in 
America open to homesteading, where a person could get free government land 
just by living on it. 
</P>
<P>
 A wonderful dream. But the rugged reality of frontier living, and sometimes 
dying, reveals why most people keep it a dream. As anyone at Cascade Creek will 
tell you, there's no such thing as free land. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete and Rosemary Oliva moved to Alaska in December, 1983, a natural step in a 
migration that had already taken them from the Florida Keys to the Maine woods. 
</P>
<P>
 They were well-suited for life on The Last Frontier. Pete, then 34, was a 
rugged bear of a man with a wide-ranging resume: pilot, fisherman, diver, 
welder. Rosemary, then 37, was an adventure-seeker whose crippled leg, the 
result of childhood polio, could not keep her from climbing mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 They envisioned moving straight into a cabin in the woods. Instead, they did 
as many Alaska newcomers do, living in an apartment in Anchorage, where 41% of 
Alaska's 600,000 residents are crammed into an area smaller than Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Breathing got easier when they moved to Sterling, a small town on the Kenai 
Peninsula, where Pete welded for oil companies. But they still weren't happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may as well have been in New Jersey," Oliva recalled. "I didn't come to 
Alaska to weld on oil rigs. That's not part of the dream." 
</P>
<P>
 They were not the only frustrated dreamers. For decades, any American seeking 
the pioneer life could stake an Alaska homestead on unreserved federal land 
under the Homestead Act of 1862. But that law was repealed in 1976, and no 
federal land has been opened for homesteading in Alaska since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The state began its own homestead program in 1984, open only to Alaska 
residents. But much of the land offered was very lonely -- beyond roads and so 
expensive to reach by boat or plane that few could afford the "free" land. 
</P>
<P>
 An exception was the 1985 offering near Cascade Creek, right along the Glenn 
Highway and just 100 miles northeast of Anchorage. Spruce and aspen blanketed a 
gentle south-facing slope by the Matanuska River. The craggy peaks and 
glaciered valleys of the Chugach Mountains loomed to the south; the Talkeetna 
Mountains rose to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 Alaskans applied to stake 40 acres of this wild paradise for 
their own. Only 15 permits were issued. A lottery chose the winners, and among 
them were Pete and Rosemary Oliva. 
</P>
<P>
 They thanked the Lord and got to work. 
</P>
<P>
 First came bushwhacking to find a level home site, then staking boundaries and 
brushing them clear. The next spring, they moved onto their land, living in a 
little trailer they hauled in on a rough trail from the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Building a home took until August, 1987, when they threw on a roof and moved 
in: two adults, a 2-year-old boy named Daniel and a big dog named Rocky, all 
snug in an 18-by-24-foot cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 They settled into the rhythms of homestead life. Chopping wood. Hauling water. 
Bathing in a plastic tub on the floor. Pete hunted for moose, and Rosemary 
cooked it on the cabin's tiny stove. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer days were spent in hurried preparation for winter's burrowing-in, when 
snow piles three feet deep and the sun disappears for two months behind the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 If these were hardships, the Olivas didn't complain. A self-sufficient life 
close to nature was why they had come. The hard part was making ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliva said he worked as a pilot in Palmer, 50 miles down the road, until the 
company went out of business. He found work welding, but injured his arm and 
had to stop. Now, he carves wooden whale sculptures at home. The pieces sell 
for $275 in art galleries. It takes so long to make even one, that the work 
yields less than the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash is always short. "When you go out and buy a magazine, you feel like 
you're going overboard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of economic opportunity dooms many Alaska homesteaders. Farming is such 
a marginal enterprise that it's not even required on most homesteads here. All 
that's needed to gain title to the land, or prove up, is to build a cabin and 
live in it for 25 months within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that can be difficult. Of the more than 1,600 Alaskans awarded 
homestead permits since 1984, only 12% have proved up, the state Division of 
Land said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cascade Creek, three people forfeited after failing to build houses. Three 
more built dwellings but didn't meet the residency requirement; they were 
allowed to buy their land at market value. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine homesteaders proved up, but only four now live there year-round -- Oliva 
and three neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Hans Stricker, 31, who complains loudly in English about overbearing 
government and speaks softly in German to the gray jays that snatch bread from 
his outstretched hand. He works six days a week as a cook at the Long Rifle 
Lodge, 10 miles up the road. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Doug Maxwell, 46, whose slow gait suggests laziness until you see his 
homestead, the most polished of any at Cascade Creek, with a cabin, sauna, 
greenhouse and huge garden. His secret to homesteading: "You find a woman with 
a good job in town." 
</P>
<P>
 And there is Loren Thomas, 45, with a bushy beard and a wry sense of humor 
about his plywood cabin, a work forever in progress. "You've got to enjoy the 
process," he said, gazing at the floor he'd just torn up to fix a bothersome 
bulge, "because you might never see the end product." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliva knows this. His latest project is a welding shop, squeezed in amid a 
hundred other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're constantly fighting," Oliva said. "Gotta get the wood in for winter. 
Gotta get the moose. Gotta get the shop and roof done before snow falls. It 
takes its toll after a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially now. For years, Oliva's source of strength was Rosemary. He 
considered her the real pioneer, with an indomitable spirit and a smile that 
could light up a cabin in the dead of winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woodsmen often say they can't find a woman who would want to live like this," 
Oliva said. "Rosemary was a great woodswoman." 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1992, she found a lump in her breast. They drove 350 miles to 
Fairbanks for a mastectomy, but the operation was too late. The cancer had 
already spread. She battled her illness for months, growing weaker as the pain 
increased. It would have been easier in town, but there was no talk about 
moving. Rosemary wanted to stay on the homestead. 
</P>
<P>
 They wheeled a hospital chair into the cabin, and Pete tried to keep her 
comfortable. Independence Day, 1993, was the last time Rosemary walked off the 
porch without help. She died, cradled in her husband's arms, last Oct. 3. She 
was 47. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground was frozen, so they buried her in town. This summer, Oliva spent a 
month chipping a grave out of solid rock, then he brought Rosemary home. 
</P>
<P>
 These still are shaky days for him, but Oliva finds solace in simple things: 
the deep silence of the Alaska night, a moose loping by, even the grim 
privilege of being able to bury his wife in the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 He feels lucky to be a pioneer in a world with so few places left for 
pioneers. The state stopped offering land for homesteading in 1991, and 
officials don't know when or if the practice will start again. 
</P>
<P>
 There is satisfaction, too, in watching a boy grow up in the woods. Daniel, 
now 9, has intense blue eyes and his mother's strong will. Oliva home-schools 
him, and the lessons go beyond books. Daniel climbs trees like a squirrel and 
handles a .22-caliber rifle better than most adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Here a boy is free to explore nature, free just to be. 
</P>
<P>
 So is a man. And that, Oliva said, is the greatest compensation for a 
homesteader's toil. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a freedom to live the way you want here," he said. "Some mornings I 
wake up and think I could have something more secure. But the reality is I'd 
get bored after a while. I don't think there's anything out there to match the 
abundant life we have here."

NUCLEAR WORKERS WIN; THEIR HEALTH STILL LOSES; FERNALD, OHIO: A JUDGE IS TO 
HOLD FAIRNESS HEARING TUESDAY ON A PROPOSED $20-MILLION SETTLEMENT FOR FORMER 
EMPLOYEES OF A URANIUM-PROCESSING PLANT. BUT THE SETTLEMENT COMES TOO LATE FOR 
SOME.

 David Chalk worked in secrecy for decades, helping the government process 
uranium for nuclear weapons during the Cold War. That conflict is over, but he 
feels he's still paying the price -- with his health. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalk believes the bone cancer that ravaged his left upper arm and required 30 
cobalt treatments is tied to radiation exposure, although he has never been 
able to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at 64, a decade after heart trouble forced him to retire, he may be 
compensated by the government -- not for physical injury, but for emotional 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
 To him, there's little to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ain't going to bring your health back," he says, his raspy voice 
trailing off in frustration. "Even if you got a million dollars, it won't do 
that. And mine is shot." 
</P>
<P>
 For some there is rancor, for others relief as another chapter comes to a 
close in the nation's troubled nuclear history. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 4 1/2-year legal struggle, a federal judge in Cincinnati will hold a 
hearing Tuesday on a proposed settlement for workers of the Feed Materials 
Production Center at Fernald. 
</P>
<P>
 This tentative $20-million agreement is believed the first time the government 
has agreed to pay a group of former workers at a nuclear weapons plant for 
emotional distress, including fears of increased risk of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although admitting no wrongdoing, the government also will pick up the 
tab for medical monitoring, or annual physicals, for those people as long as 
they live: An initial $5 million of the total will be set aside to cover them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has finally come to the conclusion that there has to be 
resolution," said Stanley Chesley, a prominent Cincinnati attorney who 
represented the Fernald employees in the class-action suit. "It's time to get 
straight with the American worker." 
</P>
<P>
 But former workers at the Ohio plant, which closed in 1989, are divided about 
how much they really won. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a psychological victory for me that we got something. We did count," 
said Martha Adams, one of seven people representing thousands of workers in the 
suit, which was settled this summer in the middle of trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's fair," said James Johnson, another of the seven named plaintiffs. 
"As citizens, we don't need to bankrupt the government." 
</P>
<P>
 But others who are sick or alarmed by studies suggesting former plant workers 
had higher cancer rates and shorter life spans are disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look back at my life at Fernald and it just makes you want to break down 
and cry, knowing what you've been exposed to all those years," lamented Floyd 
Grubb, who said he was diagnosed with bone cancer in 1986. "The government got 
what they wanted during the Cold War. Now, they've turned their backs on us." 
</P>
<P>
 And Jim Dorton, another of the seven representatives, says the case increased 
his anxiety because he saw his medical records and learned more about the 
medical fate of co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What have I gained? Nothing," he declared. "This fight has caused me much 
grief. . . . It's not worth the little bit of money that's going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 A judge still must approve the settlement after Tuesday's fairness hearing, in 
which 16 opponents, including one worker who gathered about 170 signatures, are 
set to speak. A final decision will come later. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers' attorneys insist the case was not about huge awards but about 
changing policy, which was accomplished: The agreement removes major obstacles 
in collecting worker compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the financial conclusion is ironic: Defense lawyers stand to collect 
more than those workers who contend their lives have been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 After legal and other fees are deducted, the Fernald group probably will divvy 
up $8 million to $9 million -- compared with more than $15 million the Energy 
Department acknowledges it spent on lawyers hired by the contractor to fight 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's the winner here?" Dorton said. "We have sued ourselves and you and our 
fellow countrymen." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Energy Department says it has spent $70 million on legal fees to 
defend nuclear plant contractors over the last five years, an issue that 
prompted a recent Capitol Hill hearing and agency reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In this suit, National Lead of Ohio Inc., which managed the plant until 1985, 
and its parent company, National Lead Industries Inc., were accused of 
knowingly exposing workers and subcontractors to excessive, even deadly, levels 
of radiation -- then concealing the health risks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second big Fernald case. In 1989, the Energy Department reached a 
$78-million settlement with area residents, who claimed emotional distress as 
well as lower property values. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati and now called the Fernald 
Environmental Management Project, processed uranium for nuclear weapons from 
1953 until 1987. A 20-year cleanup is under way, estimated to cost billions. 
</P>
<P>
 In settling, defense attorney David Bernick said one goal was to stem further 
legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a certain point, the litigation has got to come to a close," he said. 
"There was a desire, in a sense, to do right by the community." 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't say . . . we admit culpability or any increased risk to any 
radiation-related disease or injury resulting from the operation of the plant," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Bernick said he understands workers' health anxieties, "I don't 
think those concerns are founded in the science." 
</P>
<P>
 Although money was a factor, so was time. Nearly a third of Fernald workers 
are dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Most survivors are in their 60s or 70s and "have health problems and need 
medical monitoring now," said Louise Roselle, another attorney for the workers. 
"They can't wait four or five years for the legal process to review this." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 30% of 6,400 Fernald employees, widows and subcontractors probably 
will seek compensation, Roselle said. Their share will depend, in part, on 
their length of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Since this case was not about physical injury, key health questions remain 
unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Each side had their experts and numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Roselle contends that in a population the size of Fernald workers, there 
should be one case of leukemia; instead, there were 16. 
</P>
<P>
 One study found Fernald workers died at a median age of 58, five years younger 
than the U.S. median at the time, and had significantly higher rates of lung, 
blood, gastrointestinal and lymph cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Those findings upset Dorton, who at 57 said he finds himself racing through 
household projects. "I feel like I'm rushed," he said. "I'm going to run out of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 But other research contradicted those findings, and Bernick was prepared to 
present testimony showing no increased incidence of radiation-related illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are suffering don't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty hard to prove where you got cancer, but there's no doubt in my 
mind," said Chalk, who recalls how his respirator would fall off when he used a 
jackhammer to dig out sludge from furnaces. "It was like breathing coal dust. I 
was 21. You didn't know what danger you were really in." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say they've been betrayed by a government that cloaked itself in 
national security and secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime the government says, 'No, nothing can hurt you,' who do you 
believe?," said Hillery Webb, whose heart problems and rheumatism forced him on 
disability in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they just gave us insurance and said, 'Hey, we're willing to pay your 
hospital bills, we're willing to take care of you if you're sick,' but they're 
not willing to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roselle noted that workers still can file private suits. And, she said, they 
have won major concessions with a change in workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-expert panel will be appointed to examine claims; if it says a 
worker's illness is related to radiation exposure, neither the government nor 
the contractor can challenge it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, every claim was challenged, Roselle said, with workers and widows 
facing high-powered lawyers and teams of experts in hearings that frequently 
dragged on for 10 years. Less than a handful prevailed. Even then, there was 
little to show. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert Kelly, a 27-year Fernald veteran, waged a seven-year battle to win 
total permanent disability after exposure to radium, thorium and uranium. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ridiculed him . . . and treated him like a dog. It was just terrible," 
said his widow, Corrilla. "He fought for so long for so little. . . . It took 
the life out of that man." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Herbert Kelly died of cancer at age 65. His case was still on appeal. 
Now, his widow will not have to start over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see more monetary gain, and I know he would have," she said. 
"But I'm tickled to death no one will have to go what he went through." 
</P>
<P>
 Roselle said this settlement goes as far as the law permits in righting 
wrongs. But she concedes it is no panacea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we undo history? No," she said. "In the best of all possible worlds, 
you'd like to make these men 35 years old and healthy again, but you know I 
can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are going up against the United States government, there aren't big 
victories," she said. "You don't take huge jumps. You take steps. This is a 
step."

CASPIAN CAVIAR INDUSTRY STRUGGLES TO SURVIVE IN POST-SOVIET ERA; CAUCASUS: 
POLLUTION, WATER LEVELS AND MISMANAGEMENT REDUCE THE STURGEON HARVEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Almost with a sigh, the rusting, World War II-era trawler slides up and docks 
against the crumbling cement quay of the fish-processing plant on the Kura 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 "God willing, this one will be good," says Ilyas Panaliyev, director of the 
plant, which was once known throughout the Soviet Union for its fine caviar. 
</P>
<P>
 But Panaliyev's tenuous smile dissolves into a frown as he speaks to the 
trawler's captain. Instead of a hold bulging with beluga and sturgeon, there 
are merely a couple of carp flopping around in a wooden box, gulping for 
oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 As the director of the largest caviar-processing plant in the newly 
independent nation of Azerbaijan, Panaliyev should be enjoying the perks that 
come with his position. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plant is on the verge of collapse, and the dream of huge profits from 
caviar sales on the world market has turned into a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the entire Caspian, in fact, a combination of rising water levels and 
pollution from numerous sources has all but destroyed the caviar industry. This 
year's sturgeon catch will be less than 1% of what it was 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Panaliyev shares with many managers of post-Soviet industrial plants a long, 
complex list of problems: lack of spare parts, lack of reinvestment capital, 
lack of motivation and productivity among underpaid workers and lack of 
experience in the international market. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main issue for him is the lack of fish in the Kura River, Azerbaijan's 
traditional harvest area for both sturgeon and Caspian salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the inexplicable rise of Caspian waters, the silt carried by the 
Kura is forming a mud delta at the river's mouth, making it difficult for 
larger fish to migrate upstream to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit is the beluga sturgeon, whose eggs are the most prized of all. The 
beluga catch now represents only 1% of Azerbaijani caviar production. Locally, 
the fish may be nearing extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, we caught a beluga that weighed 500 kilos (1,100 pounds)," 
says a worker at Neftechala. "The fish was so big I had my picture taken with 
my legs dangling down the sides like I was riding a horse. It produced 100 
kilos (220 pounds) in eggs." 
</P>
<P>
 But those days are gone. The salty Caspian, the world's largest lake and main 
source of caviar, has risen about 17 feet over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising Caspian waters have devastated Neftechala's caviar industry and slowly 
inundated homes and businesses. A showpiece sturgeon and salmon research 
institute and hatchery on the banks of the Kura hasn't released a single minnow 
into the river for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pesticides used in upstream cotton fields are accumulating at an alarming rate 
at the river mouth. Nearby oil wells soon may be swamped, adding more 
pollutants to the fish-hatching beds. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of Azerbaijan's petroleum industry is just as sad as that of caviar. 
Once a leading oil-producing region of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan and the 
Caspian were thought to have been pumped almost dry. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Azerbaijan's independence in 1991, Western oil companies declared 
the country to be a potential Kuwait if authorities could only exploit the vast 
wealth in a reasonable manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy years of slapdash Soviet petroleum technology have left behind an 
ecological mess. Onshore, forests of rusting rigs continue to churn oil into 
leaky pipes running through densely populated neighborhoods, giving the 
drinking water a mild gasoline taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Leakage from offshore rigs has created dead zones in the fragile seabed. At 
the surreal, offshore oil "city" of Nefti Tashlar -- "oily rocks" -- a huge 
network of pipes, wells, storage tanks and eight-story barracks built on stilts 
seems ready to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Entire sections of pipe have disappeared, leaving wide, greasy, blue and 
yellow wakes down-water from abandoned rigs. The air is fouled by the blow-off 
of huge amounts of natural gas, both planned and unplanned. 
</P>
<P>
 All this intensifies Panaliyev's worries about the slumping sturgeon harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could solve this with a dredger in a day," he said. 'The problem is we 
don't have a dredger, and the government won't allocate any resources to rent 
one from the Russians, and we cannot get the money until we have dredged the 
river so there will be fish eggs to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Neftechala produced nearly 7 tons of sturgeon roe in 1992 and 8 tons in 1993. 
This year's target is only 4 tons, but it's doubtful the target will be met -- 
both because of the lack of fish in the Kura and because the expensive roe is 
finding its own way to market. 
</P>
<P>
 One place where the missing caviar is appearing is the sleazy black-market 
center known as Kubinka in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, where home-cured 
caviar sells for about $55 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Although twice last year's price, this is a far cry from the $1,100 to $1,300 
commanded by beluga eggs. The caviar sold in the back alleys of Kubinka may 
leave much to be desired, but the price is right. 
</P>
<P>
 At Neftechala, a patrol boat equipped with spotlights scours the night waters 
of the Kura River for sturgeon-poachers and checks weigh stations for the legal 
catch. All is quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, awaiting dinner in the vessel's cabin, crew members spin tales of life 
on the river, 200-pound masses of beluga eggs and platterfuls of mouth-watering 
sturgeon meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The cook serves them carp.

BUS RIDER ACCUSES N.Y. LINE OF SEX BIAS; RELIGION: SIMA RABINOVICZ HAS BEEN 
CALLED "THE JEWISH ROSA PARKS" FOR REFUSING TO GIVE UP HER SEAT FOR ORTHODOX 
MEN WHO WANTED TO PRAY APART FROM WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some have called her "the Jewish Rosa Parks" -- a bus rider who refused, on 
principle, to give up her seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sima Rabinovicz wouldn't move to accommodate Orthodox Jewish passengers who 
wanted to pray apart from the women on the public bus they were riding from 
their suburban communities to their jobs in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 She said one man told her if she didn't move "they'd stone me till I bleed. 
There were like 20 of them, and I'm by myself. I was scared -- upset and 
scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabinovicz is demanding an end to segregation on the bus, and the director of 
the New York Civil Liberties Union is representing her in talks with lawyers 
for Monsey Trails, the bus company run by ultra-Orthodox Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I talked to somebody, they told me, 'Shut up, woman,' " she said. "The 
treatment of women always bothered me . . . like you were second-class." 
</P>
<P>
 Monsey Trails is government-subsidized, and anyone can ride the bus. But the 
passengers are almost exclusively Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jews who 
live in suburban enclaves formed in the 1950s by people who wanted to get away 
from the wanton ways of the city while keeping their jobs. Most work in 
Manhattan's diamond and garment districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabinovicz, who is Jewish but not Orthodox, chafed at the centuries-old 
religious dictate observed by her fellow riders that men pray separately from 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 The men had hung a curtain, provided by the bus company, from the ceiling, 
down the center aisle. Men sat on one side, women on the other. But the men's 
group was so large on Dec. 8, 1993, that they needed part of the women's side 
too. As sunset approached, the men needed to begin evening prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The group wanted Rabinovicz to move forward, where the rest of the women were 
seated. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone barked, " 'Move it!' -- like I should obey," Rabinovicz said. "I just 
ignored them." The 10 or 15 other women, she said, cowered silently in the 
front. The bus stopped. Rabinovicz said the driver ordered her to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Only if the cops come.' He called the base and they said to move," 
she said. She still refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Men "got off and literally prayed in the street," said the bus firm's lawyer, 
Kevin Hasson. "They were not just sent to the back of the bus, but kicked off 
the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 The driver took her home. But then, said Rabinovicz, he "told me I shouldn't 
take the bus any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Siegel, Rabinovicz's lawyer, said he does not object to prayer on a 
bus, but to segregation abetted by a public carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have conflicting principles that are significant and serious: religious 
freedom and practices, and sex discrimination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasson said the bus line doesn't discriminate by providing such things as the 
curtain, and it doesn't care where passengers sit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever owned the bus company, if 99% of passengers wanted the simple 
availability of a curtain, any good businessman would provide it to them," 
Hasson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasson denied that the driver got involved in the disagreement, saying he 
stopped the bus merely because he was concerned about passenger safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabinovicz, 47, emigrated from Lithuania in 1972 with her husband and son, now 
24. Their daughter, 12, was born in America. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Soviet Union, her family risked jail to bake matzo, unleavened bread 
used at Passover, she said. "In school, they called me names because we were 
Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers waiting recently at a Monsey Trails bus stop in Manhattan had 
little sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not nice of the lady," said Ben Zion-Meiar, a Hasidic Jew. "It's only 
for the time they pray. They are just asking her for a favor." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's totally wrong. There's no discrimination," said Aaron Kraus, also 
Hasidic. "She wants a fight."

HAITI'S PARLIAMENT OKS AMNESTY, PAVING THE WAY FOR ARISTIDE'S RETURN; 
CARIBBEAN: THE 9-TO-1 VOTE BY THE SENATE TURNS UP THE PRESSURE ON CEDRAS TO 
STEP DOWN. THE DECISION IS A FACE-SAVING DEVICE FOR LEADERS OF THE JUNTA. 
</P>

<P>
 The Haitian Senate hastily approved an expansion of the nation's amnesty law 
Friday, increasing pressure on army chief Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras to resign and 
paving the way for the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deal with the United States, Cedras had pledged to leave if Parliament 
approved a general amnesty or by Oct. 15, whichever came first. A copy of the 
provision was sent by fax to Aristide for his signature, and it will become law 
when it is published here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure allows the ousted president to pardon the generals who overthrew 
him not only for political misdeeds but for other crimes. The lower chamber of 
Parliament overwhelmingly approved the amendment to an existing amnesty law on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior U.S. officials said they were examining whether the measure meets the 
requirements of the Sept. 18 U.S.-Haitian agreement that was to culminate with 
Cedras' resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 It also wasn't known if Cedras considered the bill the general amnesty he had 
sought. But a source close to Cedras, speaking on condition of anonymity, did 
not believe the Parliament had approved a general amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian senators said they hoped their vote would give Cedras one less excuse 
for holding onto power. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States had strongly supported an amnesty for military leaders 
despite concern that Aristide might not proclaim it. His supporters have called 
for "justice" for political and human rights crimes by the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this bill does . . . is throw the ball back to President Aristide," U.S. 
Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaying increasing defiance of the military, about 5,000 pro-democracy 
Haitians marched Friday to army headquarters to demand that Cedras leave. The 
rally was the first at the headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down with Cedras! We hate Cedras!" they jeered, increasing the pressure on 
Cedras to not only step down from power, but to leave Haiti. Cedras has said he 
won't leave the country, as Aristide demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras was not inside the white-and-yellow building. But some of his top 
commanders watched from a second-floor balcony, including Brig. Gen. Philippe 
Biamby, who like Cedras must leave power by the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators stuffed a pair of blue jeans with foam rubber and spanked it 
with branches -- a surrogate for Cedras and the once-dreaded police chief Lt. 
Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, who fled to the Dominican Republic on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration coincided with the visit of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe 
Talbott to discuss the transition from military to civilian government. 
</P>
<P>
 After less than an hour of discussion, the Senate voted 9 to 1 to give 
Aristide the authority to grant an amnesty. Approval quickly followed on two 
minor amendments related to amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are voting to get out the confusion, not because of the pressure from the 
(American) troops here," said Sen. Clark Parent, an Aristide supporter who came 
out of hiding from the military to cast his vote. American soldiers guarded the 
seaside Legislative Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Senators emphasized that the agreement would not stop individuals from suing 
their tormentors in court for human rights violations committed since the 
military seized power three years ago. Thousands of people have been killed 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope (Cedras and Biamby) will do their part" by leaving, said Senate 
President Firmin Jean-Louis. "I hope the gesture will come in the upcoming days 
or the upcoming hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Claude Roy, a conservative politician and friend of Cedras, criticized 
the measure. He said it "offers guidelines for Aristide only if Aristide does 
indeed keep his word and grant an amnesty." 
</P>
<P>
 There were further signs, meanwhile, of the opposition wobbling to its feet 
after three years of military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-Aristide National Congress for Democratic Movements met Friday, 
holding its most open meeting in three years, said Eddy Jean Claude, a member 
of the party's directorate. "But we still have fear," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramilitary violence continued in Cite Soleil, a pro-Aristide stronghold and 
one of the capital's worst slums, but the U.S. military said American troops 
were not deployed there. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people gathered early Friday around the hacked body of a bus driver, 
reportedly killed by pro-military attaches the night before. Such killings are 
common in Cite Soleil. 
</P>
<P>
 A cousin of the victim, identified only as Emmanuel, said he had seen half a 
dozen men chasing Emmanuel the night before and recognized one as a member of 
the paramilitary Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti, or FRAPH. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and relatives said American military patrols could have prevented 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans don't come through here," said one woman. "Why don't they 
come?" 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Army spokesman Col. Barry Willey said the U.S. force was aware that Cite 
Soleil "is a politically sensitive area, but we have a lot of areas that we 
could potentially patrol and that we are patrolling."

PARK SERVICE BATTLES OVER SPOILS OF WAR; ARTIFACTS: AT ANTIETAM NATIONAL 
BATTLEFIELD, RELIC HUNTERS DIG UP BUTTONS, BUCKLES AND CANTEENS. THE GOVERNMENT 
WANTS TO STOP THE PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The site of the U.S. military's bloodiest battle is a battleground once more, 
this time over relic hunters digging up Civil War soldiers' buttons, belt 
buckles and canteens. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Moore, superintendent of the Antietam National Battlefield, wants to 
persuade landowners to restrict the use of metal detectors on the privately 
owned land within the battlefield's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you take something out of the ground, you are taking away my kids' 
history," she said. "They are removing something that could help us have a more 
accurate picture of what occurred here. It's a national treasure, and it should 
be preserved as such." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that if the National Park Service ever decides to excavate a site, 
the dig will meet archeological standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Civil War buffs and landowners, however, argue the artifacts will rot in 
the ground if not unearthed and preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 17, 1862, Battle of Antietam left more than 23,100 soldiers dead, 
wounded or missing. The boundaries of the 3,245-acre site include 1,400 acres 
of private land. 
</P>
<P>
 The grounds hold unmarked graves and items such as ammunition, canteens and 
buttons that are commanding rising prices at auctions and museums. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore has no control over much of the private land. Relic hunters must get 
permission from landowners, about a dozen in all, and some don't allow digging 
on their property. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service will soon begin contacting landowners to renegotiate 
the terms under which the land was incorporated into the park so that metal 
detectors are banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Clem of Hagerstown, who has been relic hunting at Antietam and 
surrounding areas since he was a teen-ager, said the problem isn't as bad as 
some believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "What little bit they would take, I can't see where the park service is hurt," 
Clem said. The battleground is "pretty well picked. I don't think it's any 
great problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stephen R. Potter, an archeologist for the park service, said the depths 
of Antietam still have much to offer in the way of relics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, Civil War buffs unearthed a grave of Confederates just 60 paces 
away from federally owned land at Antietam, he said. "The whole thing was 
ripped out of the ground," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Lynn Culler's family allowed relic hunters on their 140-acre farm 
where much of the heavy fighting occurred. The family sold the land in 1989 to 
the Conservation Fund, and it was later donated to the park service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them were just collectors and they kept the stuff for their private 
collection, but there are sales and they trade things," Culler said. "It's 
going to deteriorate to nothing if they leave it in the ground."

U.S. ACCUSED OF STEALING BODY PARTS; URANIUM: WIDOW CONTENDS ENERGY DEPARTMENT 
WORKERS TOOK THE EVIDENCE THAT HER HUSBAND DIED OF URANIUM POISONING -- BONES, 
LIVER, KIDNEY AND SPLEEN TISSUE. GOVERNMENT DENIES WRONGDOING BUT ADMITS TAKING 
THE ITEMS.

 They came the day after Larry Hicks' heart stopped, and when they left they 
took bones and liver, kidney and spleen tissue. It was, says his widow, a 
"clandestine and ghoulish operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks had worked at the Fernald uranium-processing plant for a dozen years; 
these "ghouls" were agents of the federal government. Diane Hicks is furious at 
the treatment her husband's body received. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a human being. We're talking about the father of my 
children," she said. "It's just horrible. The public should know what they're 
capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Energy says hundreds of current employees at 
nuclear-technology sites nationwide willingly agreed to donate their organs and 
tissue through a volunteer program. 
</P>
<P>
 The tissue samples and records stored at the U.S. Transuranium and Uranium 
Registries in Richland, Wash., are used to update radiation exposure standards 
and determine whether former employees or contract workers died as a result of 
radiation exposure, Energy Department spokesman Ken Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Diane Hicks and others say that the Energy Department arranged with 
coroners to quickly take away internal body organs of dead workers in order to 
destroy evidence and protect against lawsuits alleging the victims were killed 
by workplace exposure to radioactive substances. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Roselle, a lawyer for Hicks' widow, says there is no indication that 
Hicks or his family signed any consent form authorizing donation of the organs 
or of any body tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks, 33, worked at the Fernald plant near Cincinnati as an inspector. On May 
8, 1985, an equipment failure dumped enriched uranium on him, Diane Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve days later, she said, her husband awoke feeling weak and ill. He sought 
treatment, but died of heart failure that day. The doctor who treated him told 
the coroner that the death was consistent with heavy metal poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Hicks said the tissues were taken from her husband's body without her 
knowledge or consent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took whole organs, everything but the heart," she said. "Since they 
didn't talk to me and I didn't know they were doing this, for whose benefit 
were they doing the test?" 
</P>
<P>
 She sued, but in 1986 a federal judge ruled that under Ohio law, the Hamilton 
County coroner had properly taken control of Larry Hicks' body and had legally 
ordered an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel also ruled then that National Lead of 
Ohio Inc., the Energy Department's contract operator at Fernald, and the 
Hanford Environmental Health Foundation, also a DOE contractor, were protected 
by the same state law in offering assistance to the coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1992, the Hanford foundation operated the transuranium registry for the 
Energy Department. The registry, in operation since 1968 and home to tissues or 
records of nearly 700 current or former DOE contractor employees, has been 
operated since then by Washington State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her husband's death, Diane Hicks has worked to support her two children, 
ages 15 and 13. She has fought unsuccessfully in court against National Lead, 
funded by the Energy Department, to collect workers' compensation payments for 
her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
 National Lead argued that Hicks' death was not employment-related. Diane 
Hicks' lawyers argued that the government had taken away key evidence by 
removing internal parts from Larry Hicks. Diane Hicks lost her workers' 
compensation bid, but has appealed to a state appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've fought me tooth and nail, every step of the way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics have decried the Energy Department's "body snatchers." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a conspiracy between the government and its contractors to, in the 
most unethical and evil way, steal workers' organs without their knowledge or 
consent, to successfully destroy the evidence so that the workers and their 
families would be unable to file workers' compensation claims against the 
Department of Energy or its contractors," said Dr. David Egilman, a former 
Cincinnati occupational physician and epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Carpenter, a Seattle lawyer with the Government Accountability Project, a 
group that represents government whistle-blowers and investigates their 
allegations, also questioned the DOE program. Carpenter said that not all 
participants volunteered to donate organs to the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't doing it for purposes of legitimate scientific research," 
Carpenter said. "They were lying to their workers." 
</P>
<P>
 But Morgan, the Energy Department spokesman, insisted the purpose was 
scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the autopsies were done by local coroners," Morgan said. "Sometimes 
tissue was collected and then it was sent to DOE contract labs. . . . All of 
that data was sent to the Transuranium Registry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DOE didn't do anything here other than ask for some tissue samples and 
the data," Morgan said.

SCUTTLED WAR RELIC A WATERY TOURIST SITE; LAKE GEORGE: BRITISH FEARED A FRENCH 
RAID AS WINTER OF 1758 SET IN, SO THE 'PROVINCIALS' LOADED VESSELS WITH ROCKS 
AND SANK THEM, USING THE FORMING ICE AS A SHIELD. IN THE SPRING, SOME WERE 
RETRIEVED, BUT NOT THE LAND TORTOISE. DIVERS CAN SEE A SLICE OF HISTORY.

 It had snowed the night before, and a stiff October wind blew across the lake 
as the soldiers struggled to sink the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 The French threatened to raid their Lake George encampments, so the British 
wanted all their new boats on the lake's bottom before the winter of 1758 
closed in. That would seal them beneath the ice, safe from a French attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Provincials" allied with the British loaded the boat with rocks and scuttled 
it once, only to watch it pop up like a cork. So down it went a second time; 
this time, it would not be seen again for more than two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship, called the Land Tortoise, is finally being called into duty 236 
years after its inaugural launch -- as a tourist attraction. New York state is 
allowing certified divers to view the unique French and Indian War ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers say the ship, 105 feet underwater near the southern end of Lake 
George, is a remarkably well preserved artifact from a time when the British 
and the French fought for control of the New World with cannons and muskets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like it was put in a refrigerator. It's 95% clean," said Joseph 
Zarzynski, executive director of Bateaux Below, a nonprofit group formed to 
protect Adirondack shipwrecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarzynski was part of the boat crew that in 1990 discovered the Land Tortoise 
after sonar picked up a ghostly image on the lake bottom. Many other, smaller 
transport ships -- called by the French bateaux -- were sunk at the same time 
and had been found on the lake bottom. But the Land Tortoise was a unique find. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-two feet long and 18 feet wide, the Land Tortoise was a floating fort, 
outfitted to accommodate seven cannons and sides that jutted out diagonally to 
the water to repel musket fire. Flat-bottomed with an oak hull, the class of 
boat was aptly called "radeau," the French word for raft. In the water, it 
resembled a giant tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragtag provincials built the Land Tortoise and maybe more than 200 other boats 
as part of their edgy alliance with the British. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are talking about a vessel largely constructed by farmers who were 
carpenters. It was supposed to be simple to make," said Chuck Vandrei, the 
archeologist for the state Department of Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The British, in turn, hoped to sail the fleet up Lake George to aid in an 
assault on Carillon, France's stronghold to the north on Lake Champlain. The 
two lakes were crucial links in the water route between New York City and 
Montreal and thus important to control of the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Land Tortoise was sunk Oct. 22, 1758 -- two days after its first launch -- 
with the thought that it could be resurrected after a winter in cold storage. 
The troops, with no fort, would have had a hard time defending their boats 
against a French onslaught, Vandrei said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scuttling had a few hitches, according to a journal entry by 
Massachusetts shipwright William Sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sunk her once; But one side rise again, so that we were forced to work the 
chief of the night, Before we could keep her down," Sweat wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 When British Gen. Jeffery Amherst completed in 1759 his successful siege of 
Carillon (soon after renamed Ft. Ticonderoga), he brought up a schooner from 
the lake bottom and some bateaux, but left the Land Tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarzynski thinks the soldiers who sank the Land Tortoise in those October 
winds might have inadvertently sunk it too deep to be easily recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The boats would have had to be hauled back up with ropes. But before that 
backbreaking work, a soldier would literally have had to hold his breath in 
water 45 degrees or colder while dragging rocks from the submerged vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 No such obstacles exist these days for divers visiting the site. A buoy 
bobbing within sight of Lake George Village marks the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the boat's wood is so fragile that even bubbles from a diver's tank or 
water roiled by a kicking fin could damage the wood, Zarzynski explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat, lacking the oars, masts and cannon it was outfitted with, is still 
intact and upright. Schools of sculpin fish live in its crannies. 
</P>
<P>
 For added control, all divers must sign in with the state Department of 
Environmental Conservation at an island campsite. Divers who wish to view the 
other Lake George shipwrecks, which have been open since last year, do not need 
to sign in. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say the caution is justified because the Land Tortoise is a 
one-of-a-kind find. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, there is an irreplaceable library down there of historical 
documentation of what is an important period of our history," said Langdon 
Marsh, the state environmental commissioner.

TALK SHOW CALLERS: IT'S RIGHT TO SHOOT FIRST; JUSTICE: ANONYMOUS LETTER WRITER 
SAYS HE SHOT A WOULD-BE ROBBER AND LEFT HIM FOR DEAD. THOSE CALLING IN SAY THE 
MIDDLE-AGED MAN SHOULD NEITHER CONFESS TO POLICE NOR REGRET WHAT HE DID.

 He shot a man young enough to be his son and left him for dead in a heap on 
the sidewalk, a bullet in his head. Then he paused to calm his pounding heart, 
walked a block or so to his car and drove home. 
</P>
<P>
 He scanned the newspapers for anything about the shooting, but never saw any 
mention of it. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the story the man told in an anonymous letter he wrote to a radio 
talk show host. He told of how the young man had a gun, his companion had a 
knife, and they were going to rob him. 
</P>
<P>
 The story made the telephone lines at the radio station light up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should be congratulated," one caller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did the right thing," said another. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have shot them both," several said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 23 callers to the "Susan Bray Show" on WWDB last week, 21 said the 
middle-aged man should by no means confess to police or regret what he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very vitriolic," Bray said. "They were fed up with crime, fed up 
with the legal system. They thought it was skewed toward the rights of the 
perpetrators. . . . They were fed up with not being able to go places, with 
being frightened." 
</P>
<P>
 No one, not even the two callers who advised the man to confess, said they 
thought he was the criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 The man gave no details on when and where the shooting took place. Police said 
they do not have enough information to say whether it even happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have some cases that fit, but we won't want to speculate as to which 
one this might be," said homicide Capt. John Apeldorn. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his letter, the man was pushing 50, self-employed, and had an 
appointment in the neighborhood at night to give an estimate on some kind of 
job. He had a license to carry a gun because he'd been robbed before. 
</P>
<P>
 He crossed the street when he saw the two young men. They crossed too. Only 
when they verbally threatened him did he react, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't call police because he feared he'd be the one punished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want to spend half my retirement savings and get ripped apart in 
court" by a lawyer for the shooting victim, he wrote. "I never felt any remorse 
about taking his life." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real scary sign of the times, that people are so fearful they leave 
behind fundamental good sense," said Temple University professor John Goldkamp, 
who teaches criminal justice. "They believe the law isn't going to help them 
and they have to do it on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldkamp said: "There's no acceptable rationale I can think of, if it was 
legitimate, to walk away from someone shot in the head and not call police. You 
are allowed to defend yourself. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Apeldorn also found the man's fear groundless. "If he did what he had to do, 
he shouldn't be afraid to hide anything," Apeldorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apeldorn questioned whether Bray's listeners were representative of the public 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Bray said several of the callers were police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said the system is rotten. He could be judged as a murderer, and it 
would ruin him financially," Bray said. "The point was made over and over that 
he was fortunate to be alive. They not only might take his money but might kill 
him because he can identify them." 
</P>
<P>
 The only other topic that ever generated as much vitriol, said Bray -- a 
13-year veteran of Philadelphia radio -- was unkindness to animals.

 Ten-year-old Lindsey Glock twisted the telephone cord around a small finger

 "What's the lesson?" Spelsberg asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kill your brother?" said Allison Cutlip, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, tell him to write it down," Spelsberg replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation, etiquette for children is making a comeback, thank you, in 
classes like Spelsberg's. 
</P>
<P>
 Manners, courtesy and thoughtfulness are simple and basic lessons all too 
often ignored at school and forgotten at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of sad you have to call in a specialist, but I recognize it's 
necessary because people are not teaching these things," said Judith Martin, 
whose Miss Manners column appears in 250 newspapers three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like any other language. If you learn it early, it's much easier." 
</P>
<P>
 When Spelsberg, 42, an advertising manager, watched her 9-year-old son spit a 
piece of meat out of his mouth onto the floor, she said, "It was just like a 
light bulb." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that etiquette is a lost art," she said, "but maybe people just 
don't put the emphasis on it. It was just something we sort of forgot about." 
</P>
<P>
 Spelsberg put together a course from various etiquette books and began 
offering private classes last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first flyers went out around nearby Weston, she has had an 
overwhelming response from parents eager to get their kids' elbows off the 
table and their thank-you notes written. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something (from which) we can't calculate the benefits we derive," said 
Tina Levelle of Morgantown, whose two children are enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very important part of their upbringing that they don't get 
from their peers anymore. I think we've lost that in some of the youth today. 
</P>
<P>
 "More importantly, I wanted them to think their mother was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Glock of Morgantown enrolled Lindsey and sisters Ashley, 11, and Tori, 
8, to fine-tune their social skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hearing a lot more 'please' and 'thank-yous' at the dinner table. Their 
manners are better," Glock said. "It makes a difference when someone other than 
Mom and Dad says this is what you do in a social situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin says manners began to take a turn for the worse in the 1960s, when many 
parents took a hands-off approach to teaching etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
 Those children are now rearing families, where both parents work and dinners 
are often shared with the television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the people who are flooding my mailbox, saying, 'My parents lied to 
me. (Proper etiquette) does matter,' " Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be equivalent to pushing a child on the soccer field and telling 
him, 'There are no rules; just kick the ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tish Spaulding, who has been teaching etiquette to businessmen and 
businesswomen since 1991, began offering classes similar to Spelsberg's two 
years ago in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see the need for it at the adult level, you realize a lot of this 
starts when they're kids," Spaulding said. "I could see we needed to back way 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lack of manners is going to walk them right into limits, and no one's ever 
going to tell them what's wrong except their family, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, whose books include "Miss Manners' Guide to Rearing Perfect Children," 
says courses have become popular over the last decade but too often focus on 
"snobby etiquette." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than learning how to eat at home with Mom and Dad, they learn how to 
eat in elegant restaurants and ride in limousines, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many kids know how to ride on a public bus?" Martin said. "They're 
teaching snobbery, and snobbery is bad manners, and I find it appalling." 
</P>
<P>
 Spaulding agrees. Her classes range from proper introductions to going to 
movies and concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just about respect for the other person and putting them at ease," she 
said. "It also gives you a set of rules to get you through some difficult 
situations in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you radiate that confidence and have the ability to put people at ease, 
it instills trust in you, and that carries all the way into business."

MOTHER FAILS TO BURY DEAD SON, SAYS SHE COULDN'T BEAR TO PART FROM HIM

<P>
 A grieving mother who couldn't bear to bury her 8-year-old son left him 
decomposing in his bedroom for nearly three months after he died, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains of Jerome Durant Jr. were discovered Wednesday in his bed with a 
wheelchair beside it.The boy suffered from cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Joann Jones, 31, apparently left the corpse behind after she moved 
from her townhouse with her two young daughters last month, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just couldn't bear leaving the child and didn't want to go through with 
the burial and the funeral," said police spokesman Sgt. Stephen Doarnberger. 
"She couldn't bear to part with him, so she kept him in the home." 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy completed Thursday could not determine the cause of death, 
Doarnberger said. There were no signs of abuse, and no charges have been filed 
against the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and friends said it was no secret the boy died in July, but they 
assumed he had been buried.

HIGH PRICES FOR BEAR GALLBLADDERS ENCOURAGE POACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN CRAWFORD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Black bear gallbladders are so popular in Asian medicine that poachers are 
starting to threaten the species in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40,000 bears are legally hunted each year in the United States and 
Canada, but it's estimated an equal number are poached, said John Doggert, 
chief of the law enforcement for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finding carcasses with the gall bladder sliced out," said Judith Ball, 
general curator for Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal protection advocates say measures must be taken now or the numbers of 
bears will become as depleted in North America as they are in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity to address a problem before it becomes a crisis," said 
Ginette Hemley of the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to do just that, the Wildlife Fund and Seattle's Woodland Park 
Zoo sponsored a three-day conference at the University of Washington in 
September. It attracted about 100 fish and wildlife officials, species 
protection groups and government representatives from Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference discussed the need for uniform bear-hunting laws in North 
America as well as efforts under way to persuade Asians to use synthetic bear 
bile. 
</P>
<P>
 Although black bears are not in danger of extinction in most states, their 
body parts garner astronomical prices on the international black market. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. hunter can sell a bear gallbladder for $20 to $120, with the retail 
price ranging from $75 to $600. Paws fetch $25 to $60 each, while a carcass or 
hide can range from $200 to $1,500, according to the World Wildlife Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In Taiwan, however, gallbladders were selling in 1991 for $800 to $3,000. A 
cup of bear paw soup fetches up to $1,500 in some Taiwanese restaurants, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian pharmacies stock bear bile salts as a cure for various intestinal, 
liver, fever and cardiac-related illnesses. Western science has recently begun 
to recognize the health benefits of the bear bile, effective as an 
antispasmodic, poison antidote and anti-coughing agent, as well as a treatment 
for gallstones and high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 A synthetic alternative has been developed, but demand for the real thing 
remains high, Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 The black bear is listed as endangered in Louisiana, and numbers are dwindling 
in Florida, according to the U.S. organization Defenders of Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming allow the 
sale of bear parts. But the international trade of bear parts is illegal 
without a permit, said Wim de Kok of the the World Society for the Protection 
of Animals, an association of humane societies in 17 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife-advocacy groups believe Asia's demand for bear bile is to blame for 
the depletion of most of Asia's bear population. They fear the North American 
bear could be next. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the World Wildlife Fund and the World Society for the Protection 
of Animals say they are launching campaigns throughout Asia to persuade people 
not to use bear bile. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be difficult to alter such a deep-rooted tradition, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey of 50 traditional Chinese doctors in Korea, 92% said that bear 
bile is an essential part of their medical practice and that they would pay 
between $1,000 and $18,000 for a bear gallbladder, said Judy Mills, the World 
Wildlife Fund's acting director in East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if they would recommend substitutes to bear bile, 73% said they 
would consider other animals, 18% said herbs and 2% said synthetic substances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The culture prefers wild bear to captive bear and captive bear to synthesized 
bear," Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 10,000 black bears are kept on farms in China with drains stuck 
into their gall bladders, to "milk" the bile, De Kok said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The continued captivity of bears on farms throughout China only serves to 
fuel the demand for these products, and forces thousands of bears to endure 
miserable lives of suffering," said De Kok. "It is going to take a concerted 
worldwide effort to stop this brutal trade."

MALE NURSE ACCUSED OF RAPING 4 PATIENTS WHO WERE STILL UNDER

 A male nurse faces charges of raping four female patients while they were 
under anesthesia at a hospital and more than 20 other women told investigators 
they, too, may have been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Alan Young was arrested last week when another nurse at Citrus Memorial 
Hospital reported seeing him having sexual intercourse with an unconscious 
15-year-old girl in the recovery room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every complaint is being investigated," said Police Chief Bill Vitt. "We are 
checking each victim's story in order to put them at ease." 
</P>
<P>
 Four rape charges have been filed so far against Young, 45, who has been a 
registered nurse since 1990.

TEAM DOCTORS FIND IT'S NOT EASY TO JUST SAY NO TO PLAYERS; SPORTS: IF THEY BAR 
AN ATHLETE ON MEDICAL GROUNDS, THEY CAN BE SUED. BUT IF THEY ALLOW THE ATHLETE 
TO PARTICIPATE AND AN INJURY RESULTS, THEY CAN BE SUED.

 Teams and physicians face a legal dilemma when someone who has a potentially 
disabling physical problem still wants to play. 
</P>
<P>
 If the person is denied the chance to play on a team in a federally funded 
organization such as a public school, the athlete could file suit, according to 
an article in a medical journal, The Physician and Sportsmedicine. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if the player is allowed on the team and gets hurt, the 
player also could sue, the article said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the quandary are federal laws and court interpretations of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 bars excluding otherwise qualified individuals 
from participating in federally funded programs, said the report, written by 
two doctors and a lawyer. Athletes with medical problems or disabilities also 
can use the Americans with Disabilities Act in suing to make the team, the 
article's authors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another expert supports this. "If an athlete has a chronic injury defined as a 
disability, he has full right to participate at his own risk," said Dr. Mark R. 
Hutchinson, a team physician, director of sports medicine services and 
assistant professor of orthopedics at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The only conditions under which an athlete can be barred from play occur when 
his physical problems would place other athletes at risk of injury or illness, 
Hutchinson said. When the athlete's own problems do not affect others, things 
get murky, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the question becomes that the athlete is solely at increased risk of 
injuring himself, even if the risk is death, we enter the 'gray zone' of ethics 
and the courtroom," Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of those court actions have varied, but judges have held that 
Congress wanted people to be able to take risks, if they choose -- even if 
doctors think the choice is unwise, the journal report said. 
</P>
<P>
 One line of defense is a system of screening based on standards for 
participation. Courts have held that, if a player or the player's parent signs 
an informed consent form that spells out the risks involved in playing, then 
responsibility for those risks can shift away from the team, the article said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical system, a doctor screens the potential player and recommend 
whether the athlete is fit for the game. The athletic administrator, who sets 
the qualification standards, then decides if the player has met them. 
</P>
<P>
 The informed consent system has to look at "all predictable risks to each 
individual -- not just to athletes with medical problems or disabilities," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it must point out how problems resulting from injury to a disabled or ill 
player would exceed the team's ability to handle them, the review article said. 
And it must note the potential consequences of ignoring medical advice. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean a signed consent form solves the problem. The team must show 
that the athlete or his or her parent has read and understands the form. And 
even that may not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with an informed consent, the athlete retains the right to suit," 
Hutchinson said. "Unfortunately, I believe that there are no crisp and clean 
rules to this issue until the courts define the terms better." 
</P>
<P>
 The journal article suggests using forms with blanks that the would-be 
participants, or their guardians or parents, must fill in. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possible technique: a videotape record of the meeting in which the 
problems mentioned in the informed consent were discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 The review was written by two California doctors, Robert L. Kronisch of Santa 
Cruz and Frank M. Flowers Jr. of Riverside, and a specialist in sports-injury 
law, Richard T. Ball of Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff.

COUGAR SIGHTINGS ON THE EAST COAST SUGGEST A COMEBACK IS IN THE WORKS; 
VIRGINIA: BOTANIST SAYS HE KNOWS THAT THE ANIMAL HE SAW IN SHENANDOAH NATIONAL 
PARK HAS 'THE SAME AIR ABOUT IT AS THE LOCH NESS MONSTER.' NONETHELESS, HE HAS 
FAITH.

<P>
 Randy Winstead lives in the land of the real. He's a botanist, with a 
scientist's respect for facts. He's a husband and father, 39 years old, who 
holds two steady hands on the wheel when he drives. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows that the animal he saw in Shenandoah National Park not long ago has 
"the same air about it as the Loch Ness monster." But he is certain it was a 
beast that officially does not exist here: a cougar. 
</P>
<P>
 On the East Coast, cougars supposedly were exterminated a century ago by 
farmers and bounty hunters, except for a few in Florida. Reported sightings of 
the secretive cats never died, though -- and recently have been surging. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia wildlife officials don't dispute that 
some people have seen the sleek, tawny creatures that purr like a tabby, weigh 
200 pounds or more full-grown and can kill prey several times their size. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's view, however, is that these animals probably are Western 
cougars once kept as pets and that they won't last in the wild. But cougar 
support groups insist the cats are remnants of a native Eastern population that 
never disappeared. Eastern and Western cougars, variously called mountain 
lions, panthers, pumas, catamounts or painters, look like identical twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Winstead, the botanist at Shenandoah, had his vision May 13, while driving 
north on Skyline Drive in the southern section of the Blue Ridge park. One 
hundred yards ahead, in the late afternoon light, an animal walked along the 
right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobcat? Fox? Coyote? Wild dog? He flashed through the possibilities as the 
creature turned and bolted toward him, then swerved sideways into a storm 
drain. Winstead said he got a good view of its profile from 30 or 40 yards: 
</P>
<P>
 Long body, not squarish like a bobcat. Too graceful to be a dog. A thick tail 
that nearly scraped the ground. The color of a grown deer. In fact, it looked 
just like the cougars raised by someone he knew when he was growing up in 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a mountain lion coming right at me," he recalls realizing, "which is 
not something many people get to say." 
</P>
<P>
 The animal vanished quickly, and it left no tracks. Some colleagues laughed 
when Winstead made his report, but not all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe the animals are out there," said Jim Atkinson, Shenandoah's 
wildlife biologist. "I believe they are seeing mountain lions in this park." 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson knows of at least a dozen sightings in his two years at the park, 
some more believable than others. There have been at least four sightings in 
Shenandoah park this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia officials say they get a call a week about a cougar sighting, some 
from trained observers such as scientists and hunters. Maryland officials say 
they follow up on a half-dozen credible calls a year in the western mountains. 
West Virginia wildlife biologists also hear regular reports, some from the 
Canaan Valley vacation area. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same farther up the East Coast and into Canada. Sometimes there are 
grainy photographs, scat samples or plaster casts of tracks. Private groups 
have sprung up to support the existence of the cougars by tracking sightings. 
</P>
<P>
 Even famed animal-watcher Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, in her new book "The 
Tribe of Tiger," said she saw one in her own field in New Hampshire two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Shenandoah's log books record sightings dating back several decades: 
</P>
<P>
 * "About the size of a Labrador retriever." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Long tail -- not a bobcat." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sounded like a crying baby. Frightened it away with a flashlight." 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife officials doubt there is a population out there big enough to breed 
and, thus, re-establish itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really confounds me is the fact that we have not had animals turn up in 
road kills, or traps, or treed by houndsmen -- in essence having an animal in 
hand," said John Organ, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist who tracks 
endangered species from Maine to Virginia. "Until then, we have to be somewhat 
skeptical." 
</P>
<P>
 Cougars once lived ocean to ocean, from southern Canada to the tip of South 
America; no mammal had a wider range in the Western Hemisphere. In the United 
States they now thrive only in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they seemingly expand their range, tragic confrontations with humans 
become more common. In April a cougar killed a jogger in Northern California. A 
rabid cougar bit off a man's thumb in Northern California earlier in the 
summer, before his wife killed it with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one reason why wildlife officials have mixed feelings about the 
cougar's possible resurgence; another is the possibility of cattle kills. 
Still, they say, a cougar tribe would be an ideal solution to the East Coast's 
overflowing deer population.

PRAIRIE A HOME WHERE BUFFALO ROAM UNDER WATCHFUL EYES OF SCIENCE; KANSAS: THE 
NATURE CONSERVANCY, A NONPROFIT GROUP, OWNS THE KONZA PRESERVE, WHICH IS 
MANAGED BY KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY. SITE HAS BECOME A TOURIST ATTRACTION, WHICH 
HAS CREATED PROBLEMS.

 When Jim Reichman learned there would be a buffalo roundup on the Konza 
Prairie, he expected to mount a horse and herd the shaggy behemoths across the 
rolling grasslands. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "How they do it is to put food in the back of a pickup truck and honk the 
horn," said Reichman, one year into his job as director of the Konza Prairie 
Research Natural Area. "I thought, 'That's not very romantic.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The 8,616-acre Konza Prairie isn't just a place for sentimental reveries about 
courageous settlers and Indian buffalo hunts. Never mind the towering bluestem, 
fields of waving prairie flowers and vistas of the green, flat-topped Flint 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Konza actually is a laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 When a pregnant buffalo died near a grove of hardwoods in October, 1992, 
coyotes weren't the only ones to pick over the bones. An assortment of 
academics have pored over the site. 
</P>
<P>
 One researcher discovered how certain insect larvae made marks in the bones, 
marks that archeologists had been interpreting as signs that such bones had 
been used for tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Konza lies in Riley and Geary counties in northeast Kansas, north of 
Interstate 70 and west of Kansas 177. 
</P>
<P>
 It is dominated by native tallgrass prairie, which once extended from Illinois 
north and west to the Dakotas and south to Texas. Most of the prairie was 
converted to farmland, but most of the Flint Hills remained unfarmed because of 
their steep slopes and rocky soil. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit, private group, owns the land, which is 
managed by Kansas State University's Division of Biology. Its annual operating 
budget of about $180,000 comes from the university, the Kansas Agricultural 
Experiment Station, the state and user fees. 
</P>
<P>
 About $6 million in grants support current research. 
</P>
<P>
 The prairie teems with life. About half of all flowering plants in the Flint 
Hills region -- about 525 species -- are present on the Konza, as are 100 
species of non-flowering plants. There are also 19 species of fish, nine 
species of amphibians, 25 species of reptiles, 209 species of birds, and 34 
species of mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Konza has become a tourist attraction as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichman says thousands come to the prairie yearly to take one of three 
self-guided hikes ranging from 2.8 to 6.1 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the primary purpose is research, not tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the facilities," Reichman lamented as he stood on a breezy 
hilltop overlooking a herd of grazing bison. "Right now we're simply swamped 
with people coming out here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're becoming victims of our own success." 
</P>
<P>
 The Konza is the largest tallgrass prairie designated for research instead of 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are places that are bigger, or have more bison," Reichman said. "But we 
have 20 years of data. Nobody's going to scoop us on that. The value of this is 
only going to go up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nature Conservancy's ownership of such a research facility is rare, said 
Alan Pollom, the group's state director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are interested in preservation as our primary purpose," Pollom said. "At 
the same time, we have an ever-increasing respect for the value of this basic 
research that allows us to understand how the living world around us works." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Nature Conservancy could never acquire enough good examples of 
ecosystems to preserve them on a large scale, it values research that will help 
those who do own land to take better care of it, Pollom said. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls the Konza "the preeminent prairie ecology research center in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, several federal agencies, including the Interior and Energy 
departments, use the prairie for research. The U.S. Geological Survey uses 
water in King's Creek, which originates on the Konza, as a benchmark for water 
purity. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration picked the Konza as a 
site for an experiment involving satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the research relates to the effects of fires and to the 215 bison that 
roam 2,500 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists conduct other experiments as well. Reichman is studying the effects 
of underground pocket gophers on vegetation above ground. One student is 
studying how buffalo scatter the plant seeds they pick up in their beards. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the prairie, devices measure water flows. Plywood blinds let 
researchers spy on mating prairie chickens. Instruments measure rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Konza is in the midst of a three-phase development. The first phase, 
creating a master plan, is nearly done. The National Science Foundation paid 
for the plan and is contributing about $500,000 for the second phase, which 
involves renovating a historic limestone house and barn, buying new fire 
equipment and revamping the bison-handling facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The third phase deals with public access as well as research. More than $2.4 
million will be needed to upgrade the nature trail and build an environmental 
education park, as well as build a new lab and living quarters for visiting 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those visitors, who come from around the world, now bed down in the old stone 
house. It was designed as a cowboy bunkhouse.

PEROT TO MOUNT RADIO SOAPBOX IN 86 MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Live, from Dallas, it's Ross Perot. And for President Clinton, that likely 
means trouble. Just ask George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Days after urging his supporters to vote Republican in November, Perot today 
begins a weekly radio talk show to be broadcast in 86 markets nationwide, 
offering the controversial Texas businessman a prominent soapbox for the final 
month of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Perot's history and his recent rhetoric is any guide, Clinton is due 
for some verbal shellacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "You lie during the campaign, you don't keep your word," Perot said in a 
recent telephone conversation when asked about Clinton. But Perot was quick to 
add, "I hate just the nonstop personal attacks in politics." 
</P>
<P>
 For Republicans, Perot's salvos at Clinton are welcome news. After all, Perot 
got 19% of the vote in the 1992 presidential election. And although his 
standing with most Americans has fallen since that campaign, three-fourths of 
Perot voters still view him favorably, and presumably could be swayed by his 
advice to "give the Republicans an opportunity in the leadership role." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a remarkable statement, since less than a month ago Perot said 
congressional Republicans had failed to put forward constructive policy 
proposals. Also, his endorsement came at a time when Republicans on Capitol 
Hill were blocking two of his organization's top priorities, campaign reform 
and restrictions on lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all their glee, most Republicans are wary of embracing Perot or 
cheering him on too much -- because they expect to be back on his enemies' list 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "His form of populism is anti-Washington, anti-government, basically against 
anything that is big and powerful and anybody who is in charge," said Ed Goeas, 
a Republican pollster. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Bush was in charge -- and in Perot's sights. Now it's Clinton's turn.

BEAGLES, DALMATIAN POINT WAY IN ALZHEIMER'S STUDY; MEDICINE: UC DAVIS 
RESEARCHERS EXAMINE DOGS FOR CLUES TO THE PROGRESSIVE BRAIN DISORDER THAT 
AFFECTS 4 MILLION AMERICANS. SADIE THE DALMATIAN HAD ALL THE SIGNS -- 
CONFUSION, MEMORY LOSS, INAPPROPRIATE OUTBURSTS, EVEN PROTEIN DEPOSITS IN HER 
BRAIN. UNIVERSITY ALSO MAINTAINS KENNEL OF CANINES AND TESTS THEIR MEMORIES AS 
THEY AGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY SHULINS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For much of her life, Sadie had it all: good health, a fine home, a family 
that adored her. But with old age came senility, robbing her, bit by bit, of 
her personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Once known for her hearty appetite, she picked at her food, sometimes 
wandering off in the middle of a meal. She began getting lost in the only home 
she'd ever known. A lifelong extrovert, she sat for hours staring at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Test after test came back normal. But the signs were all there: memory loss, 
confusion, inappropriate outbursts. The doctors were quite certain. They'd seen 
it before. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Sadie been human, she might have lived out her days in a nursing home, or 
been cared for at home by round-the-clock nurses or aides. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sadie was a dog, a 17-year-old Dalmatian, so her life ended quickly and 
mercifully with a lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
 Her story, however, goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sadie's family donated her body to the University of California at Davis, 
where researchers examined her aged brain and found something remarkable. 
Buried within the tissue were protein deposits identical to those found in the 
brains of human Alzheimer's patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that impairs memory, 
thinking and behavior in 4 million Americans. No cause or cure has been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have long known that aging primates -- monkeys, bears, dogs -- can 
develop the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are the hallmarks 
of Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 What they don't know is whether these neurological signs are the animal 
equivalent of Alzheimer's or simply the more general signature of an aging 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer may rest in a locked kennel at UC Davis, where 40 aging beagles 
pass their days playing with toys and with each other. Their primary job: to 
grow old. 
</P>
<P>
 As they age, protein deposits form in their brains that are remarkably similar 
in size, structure and location to those found in humans with Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
 Periodically, the beagles go swimming in a huge above-ground pool. The surface 
is covered with colored beads. Hidden beneath the beads is a submerged platform 
the dogs have been previously shown. 
</P>
<P>
 The time it takes them to find the platform gives clues as to their memory 
ability. The tests are repeated months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael J. Russell, head of the Canine Aging Project and an assistant 
professor of anesthesiology and otolaryngology, says the results so far have 
been intriguing. "In the first test, the old dogs learned faster, but their 
memory was shot. When we retested 19 dogs a year later, the young dogs did 
better. The old dogs forgot where the island was." 
</P>
<P>
 That's significant because inability to recall new events is a primary symptom 
of Alzheimer's in humans. "People with Alzheimer's will sit and tell you what 
happened 20 years ago. But one reason the illness is so upsetting is that it's 
very common for a relative to come in and a patient to say, 'You're not my 
daughter.' The patient is remembering a much younger child." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Canine Aging Project, funded by the National Institutes of Health, started 
a year and a half ago. Russell had just put his own mother in a nursing home. 
At the time, she was thought to have Alzheimer's disease, although doctors have 
since attributed her dementia to a series of small strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 For animals as well as for humans, Alzheimer's can't be definitively diagnosed 
without an autopsy. So far, of the dogs in Russell's study, only those with 
painful or terminal illnesses have been put to sleep. The rest live out their 
natural life spans, typically about 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As they die, the dogs' brains are examined for plaques. The findings are then 
checked against the animals' performance in the water maze, for evidence of a 
connection between neurological signs of disease and memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only eight dogs have died. But researchers have examined archived 
tissue from more than 150 others that died at university clinics or that were 
used in previous life-span studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Several patterns have emerged. Whether a dog develops amyloid plaques depends 
on which litter it came from, suggesting some prenatal influence. "We also 
think there's a relationship between breed and heredity," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the dogs has developed plaques prior to age 10. That's also the age 
when other serious illnesses start to appear, according to clinical records of 
more than a thousand dogs kept by university veterinarian Dr. Russell White. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something happens at age 10 that correlates with other disease processes," 
Russell said. "There is a mechanism that allows these events to occur, some 
threshold or trigger event. I don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The length of a dog's life may also play a role. Big dogs, such as Great Danes 
and Saint Bernards, have shorter life spans than small dogs, such as poodles 
and beagles. They also are far less likely to develop plaques. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such differences, "it's clearly an animal that develops an age-related 
pathology that resembles Alzheimer's," said Jim Geddes, an assistant professor 
of anatomy and neurobiology at the University of Kentucky's Sanders Brown 
Center on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to shedding new light on Alzheimer's disease in humans, Russell 
hopes his study will lead to new treatments that will extend the lives of dogs, 
particularly service dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for an animal model for Alzheimer's has been under way since 
shortly after the disease was first described in 1907. Without one, "you've got 
to make some big jumps from the test tube to the human being," said Peter 
Davies, a researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good animal model would be enormously valuable. For those of us involved in 
attempts to devise new strategies for treating Alzheimer's, one of the great 
hurdles has been that there's no animal on which to test new compounds we think 
might be effective." 
</P>
<P>
 The search has taken on new urgency in light of an aging population. 
Alzheimer's disease can affect people in their 40s and 50s, but most of its 
victims are older. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that the incidence of Alzheimer's, just 3% at age 65, soars 
to 45% at age 85. The number of Americans 85 and over is the fastest-growing 
segment of the population, expected to more than double over the next 25 years. 
There are now 3.4 million people in this age group. The U.S. Census Bureau 
projects that by 2020, there will be nearly 7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been successful at making people live longer," Russell said. "As baby 
boomers approach old age, there will be a huge social and economic drain. The 
numbers will equal the incidence of AIDS in some African villages." 
</P>
<P>
 The average nursing home stay for a patient with Alzheimer's is five to seven 
years, Russell said. The average annual cost per patient: $213,732, according 
to one recent study. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most common cause of death for people with Alzheimer's is pneumonia," 
Russell said. "They die as a result of being bedridden and immobile. You can 
lose almost all of the cortical layer of your brain and survive. But people 
can't stay bedridden for long." 
</P>
<P>
 While no one knows what causes Alzheimer's, some scientists believe the 
disease begins when beta-amyloid, a protein sometimes found in healthy brains, 
inexplicably begins to accumulate into deposits or plaques. The plaques then 
convert to a toxic -- "neuritic" -- form that ultimately destroys brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scientists believe amyloid is a byproduct of another disease process 
that has yet to be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers are using genetic engineering and other techniques to try to 
develop a rat with Alzheimer's. But even if they succeed, without knowing what 
causes the disease, they may have no way of knowing whether they've re-created 
the illness or merely mimicked its symptoms, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, 40 lab rats cost just a couple hundred dollars to 
maintain, compared to $98,000 for 40 dogs. There's also huge savings in the 
amount of experimental compounds needed for testing on rats as opposed to dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 But rats live just three years, which may not be long enough to develop 
plaques. "For certain treatments dealing with aging, you need a species with a 
midlife span," Russell said. "Dogs get many conditions that are slow 
developing, like arthritis and heart disease. Here we've got a species that 
lives long enough to be examinable." 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs are also readily available. The American Humane Assn. estimates that 6.3 
million dogs were euthanized in 1992. "The question is," Russell said, "are we 
going to use that tissue or continue to burn it or bury it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs also live with people and share the same conditions, which could provide 
additional clues with regard to environmental factors implicated in 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs raised in rural Poland were found to have fewer senile plaques than those 
raised in more polluted industrial and urban areas. Russell says the strictly 
controlled conditions under which his dogs have been raised could explain why 
they have fewer senile plaques than dogs previously studied. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of amyloid in dogs dates back to 1912, but nobody paid much 
attention. Russell blames the difficulty of acquiring enough old dogs, along 
with the fact that not all breeds develop plaques. "And, socially, we're all a 
little uncomfortable -- myself included -- that it happens to be dogs. If it 
were sheep or pigs, it would be different." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The UC beagles are the legacy of a now-defunct U.S. Department of Energy study 
that measured the effects of radiation on dogs. These animals were descendants 
of the control group, the group not exposed to radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Visitors welcome," reads the sign posted outside their kennel. The barking 
begins the minute Russell turns his key in the lock. 
</P>
<P>
 They have lived their whole lives on this campus, as have seven or eight 
generations of beagles before them. Everything reasonable is done to prolong 
their lives. They're examined four times a year and fed a special diet 
developed by university scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Equal attention is paid to their mental health. Though their contact with 
humans is limited, the dogs have ready access to each other. They're given toys 
to play with and bones to chew. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are not pets. Pick one up and it looks at you curiously, enjoying the 
attention but unsure what to make of it. Pet it and its tail will not wag. It 
will not lick your face, only sniff at you gently. 
</P>
<P>
 These are lab animals with a job to do, albeit one that comes naturally. And 
although researchers have yet to sacrifice any of these animals, they are 
resigned to doing so should they deem it necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight against Alzheimer's disease "is a war," Russell said. "You send 
soldiers to war, and some of them die."

HE INADVERTENTLY EASED OSKAR SCHINDLER'S PATH TO SAFETY; DEATH CAMPS: 
DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER FINDS THAT THE FATE OF A RETIRED PRINTER'S OWN FAMILY IS 
LIKELY TO MAKE A LOT OF AMERICANS UNEASY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He's a retired printer living in Arizona who unwittingly ensured Oskar 
Schindler's passage to safety in the uncertain days after the fall of the Third 
Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 He also recently became a key figure in an unsettling documentary about 
American attitudes toward Jews in the days of Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Klein, now 74, had a quirky encounter with Schindler at the end of World 
War II that probably saved Schindler from confinement in a detention camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler, the man made legendary by Steven Spielberg's film "Schindler's 
List," was a German industrialist who saved more than 1,000 Polish Jews from 
the death camps by bribing officials to let them work in his factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Documentary filmmaker Martin Ostrow also has told a story about the Holocaust. 
But his indictment is not of Nazi Germany, but of the U.S. government and, by 
extension, American society. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is about Kurt Klein, and, through him, about countless others who were 
prevented from saving Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago Ostrow began researching a historical film on the Jewish 
experience in America before and during World War II for PBS's "American 
Experience" series. He wondered if Adolf Hitler's persecution of Jews was a 
subject of conversation in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 He was surprised to find that Americans seemed barely aware of the atrocities 
that began in the 1930s and culminated in the death camps during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned the story was very different than what I thought was the truth," he 
said. "I found people didn't know very much until after the war." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrow ended up making a very different film than he'd planned, one that 
explored why Americans knew so little about the Holocaust while it was 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 What he found through research and interviews with historians might be 
unsettling to some Americans. Kurt Klein had firsthand knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein left his hometown outside Heidelberg, Germany, in 1937 at age 17 to 
escape the growing specter of Nazism. Following in the footsteps of his sister, 
he settled in Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother came the next year. Their parents planned to follow later. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after arriving in Buffalo, Klein and his siblings tried to get their 
parents safe passage to America. But he ran into bureaucratic roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
 He corresponded with his parents, who were first in Germany, later in France. 
They described Kristallnacht, the "night of the broken glass" on Nov. 9, 1938, 
when Nazi storm troopers and Hitler Youth destroyed Jewish properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never intended they would come immediately," Klein said from his home in 
this Phoenix suburb. "But Kristallnacht changed all that. A tremendous panic 
set in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody then wanted to leave, and by and large, many countries didn't want 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of trying to get to the United States, Klein's parents were 
deported to France, where they lived under control of the collaborationist 
Vichy government. 
</P>
<P>
 Now his parents needed myriad visas to get out: French exit, Spanish and 
Portuguese transits, American entrance. They couldn't secure the U.S. entrance 
visas. There was talk of quota regulations, additional requirements and other 
impediments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought (the U.S. authorities) were putting up a tremendous amount of red 
tape," Klein said. "Even when you completed all the requirements, nothing 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmaker Ostrow concluded that U.S. government indifference and actual 
preventive measures ensured that possibly hundreds of thousands of Jews who 
might have been saved died at the hands of the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 His investigation led to the documentary, "America and the Holocaust: Deceit 
and Indifference," which aired in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrow says that although most Americans were in the dark about the extent of 
the atrocities in Europe, that wasn't the case with certain people in the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people whose business it was to know, did know," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although immigration quotas often were cited as the reason for denying entry 
to Jews, historian David Wyman states in the documentary that the United States 
never came close to filling its quota for immigrants from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary cites a memo from Assistant Secretary of State Breckenridge 
Long recommending that U.S. diplomats in Europe "postpone and postpone and 
postpone" granting visas to Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 1930s came to a close, Klein had entered his third frustrating year of 
trying to bring his parents to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we complied with all the requirements, they dreamed up new ones," 
he said. "We had testimonies saying that my parents were not politically 
active. After producing them we were told we had to get testimonies about the 
people who gave the testimony to show that they were not politically active 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he even went to Washington to plead with the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1942, he got a letter from his parents saying they had almost 
obtained the coveted American visa, but were told to come back to the consul in 
another week. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was dated Dec. 6, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor sealed the wartime fate of 
America and, with it, that of Klein's parents. He received his last letter from 
them in June, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Klein found records in Paris that said they had been deported 
"in the direction of Auschwitz" in August, 1942. They became two of the 6 
million Jewish victims of Nazi death camps. 
</P>
<P>
 By November, 1942, Klein was a U.S. soldier. He ended up a 1st lieutenant in 
the Army's 5th Infantry Division, an interrogator, thanks to his fluency in 
English and German. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 6, 1945, he first encountered survivors of the Nazi camps. In a 
Czechoslovak factory were 120 women who had been on a forced march all winter. 
Their guards had just abandoned them. At one time they numbered 4,000. Among 
them was Klein's future wife. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later Klein came face to face with a second group of refugees, 
including Oskar Schindler. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Klein's job to determine where Germans and other refugees were to be 
sent. Schindler, as director of a Nazi labor camp, should have gone to an 
American detention center. He even could have been tried as a war profiteer for 
running a labor camp, although he actually saved the lives of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schindler was being smuggled away from danger by some of the Jews whose 
lives he had saved. They were trying to get him out of Czechoslovakia, away 
from Germans, Russians and even Americans.

IRVINE PARK'S LAKE NEEDS SOME HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was a kid growing up in Long Beach during the '30s one of my greatest 
pleasures was when our family picnicked at Irvine Park. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember the sycamores, the lake, the rowboats.

<P>
 Today, tooling top down in my classic convertible, I again visited that 
(Irvine Regional) park of so many wonderful memories. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 I found it much as I remembered -- being enjoyed by many people. I commend 
those administering it for keeping it as it was -- except for the lake and the 
rowboats! 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? Where are those wonderful two-person rowboats? 
</P>
<P>
 No one was using the lake. There's a somewhat run-down facility with horrible 
huge-wheeled something-or-others ("paddle boats"), one haphazardly "docked" 
boathouse where rowboats should have been, and a lake filled with foul green 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Please, bring back what used to be. Get rid of "fun zone" gimmicks, clean up 
the lake. (I bet the Irvine Co. would supply the materials that a small group 
of retirees could use to build and maintain the rowboats). 
</P>
<P>
 Make it a really fine celebration when the park celebrates its 100th in 1997.

POLICE SWEEP USHERS IN A HARDER TASK; DEPRESSED AREA AROUND 3RD STREET CAN USE 
AGENCIES' HELP TO REBUILD, KEEP IT SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cynicism and despair in the neighborhood around 3rd Street in Santa Ana 
will prove formidable foes to efforts to keep the area free of gangs after last 
month's extraordinary police sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, investigators monitored drug-dealing and other crimes in and 
around 3rd Street. Prosecutors took the unprecedented step of impaneling a 
special grand jury, which delivered indictments, and police arrested more than 
100 people, a number of them members of a gang that police said was one of the 
worst in the county. Responding now to concern that several suspects may have 
been wrongly charged, prosecutors are right to review the indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Times reporter and photographer who lived in an apartment in the 
neighborhood for a week after the arrests found a chilling portrait of 
residents so afraid of gangs and guns that they did not venture outside after 
dark. Even in daylight they were afraid to go out. Things improved after the 
police sweep, but residents expected the situation to worsen before long. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to improve the neighborhood is to keep it under tight police 
surveillance, but it will take more than just police action. The residents 
themselves must work for change. One hopeful sign is the groups of women who 
for months have accompanied their children to and from school. The county has 
funded that parents' patrol, and police have trained its members in safety 
techniques. It is a good example of government agencies helping residents to 
help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mothers candidly acknowledged they did not want the gangs to interpret 
their unity as a challenge; they emphasize the sole purpose was to get their 
children to and from the schoolhouse door. Yet, the mothers' group is a 
building block that can be used in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 More help is required. Area churches can offer not just spiritual help but 
meeting places for residents to discuss problems and solutions. Landlords need 
to be prompted by the city to help their tenants be safe, with good lighting, 
locks that work, graffiti removed and, if necessary, security guards. Parents 
should be the first line of attack, emphasizing education and homework, urging 
children not to look on gang members as role models. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this will be difficult. The area has been gang territory for years, 
and the buildings that are run-down deteriorated over time, not overnight. But 
residents should show the city they want to live in peace, in good homes, and 
the city and other agencies should help them do it.

AGENCIES MUST CLEAR AIR OVER TOLL ROADS; PLAN TO CONVERT NEWPORT COAST DRIVE 
STIRS FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The question of toll collection along Newport Coast Drive when the San Joaquin 
Hills Transportation Corridor comes on line continues to trouble many commuters 
and residents who believed that the road was going to be free. With litigation 
and mistrust in the air, and with some very visible construction now going on 
for commuters to see, the Transportation Corridor Agencies need to make a 
clearer statement of intention to resolve this matter satisfactorily. 
</P>
<P>
 There still are concerns about traffic congestion along Coast Highway. There 
is even some alarm that motorists will flood Irvine seeking alternative free 
routes to the San Diego Freeway. At the heart of the matter is lingering 
confusion over the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Corridor Agencies said the public never was misled over 
whether there would be tolls along Newport Coast Drive. An opinion rendered 
some time ago by the state attorney general seemed to uphold the decision to 
collect tolls. Toll opponents, however, are right that the intention to collect 
tolls on this section of the road, while perhaps there in the fine print, was 
never fully or satisfactorily aired. Moreover, the spirit of the enabling 
legislation for tollways appears to have been given an interpretation that is 
very generous to the agency's position on collecting tolls.  
</P>
<P>
 That has to do with what constitutes an alternative free route. The 
legislative intent was not to replace existing free routes, but to have them 
stand as alternatives while viable free routes remained. The agency's 
contention that Coast Highway and the San Diego Freeway remain as the parallel 
free routes for motorists who don't want to pay a toll on Newport Coast Drive 
is a bit of a stretch. True, these routes will be available, but they hardly 
are convenient options for the people who now benefit from Newport Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some relief may be in the works as an environmental review has been undertaken 
of the extension of Culver Drive in Irvine at a point well past the Turtle Rock 
and UCI communities to hook up with Newport Coast Drive. Irvine's hope for this 
extension has been independent of talk about a bypass route. It is part of the 
city's efforts to conform with the county's master plan for roads. But the 
implication of that route is not lost on those searching for a politically 
viable bypass. If properly configured, drivers wanting to avoid tolls might 
exit Newport Coast Drive and take the new extension of Culver, only to make 
their way eventually to MacArthur Drive when the agency completes the extension 
of Ford Road. Irvine has been negotiating with the county to front the cost of 
the Culver extension. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the issue of the tolls remains hopelessly mired in politics, with 
campaigns well underway for the state Assembly, and looming ahead for the 
vacated Senate seat of Marian Bergeson. Last month, a group of residents sued 
the agency to block the conversion of the Newport Coast Drive section into a 
tollway.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency may be so accustomed to an adversarial position with opponents on 
environmental grounds that it may not fully recognize an opportunity to ease 
the concerns of regular commuters. A reasonable bypass -- that is, one that 
does not detour the public all over creation -- ought to provide an acceptable 
solution for most who don't want to pay. The Transportation Corridor Agencies 
need to make it clear that they are firmly committed to such a resolution and, 
as confusing as all these routes are, to do what they can to clarify the 
options for those not wanting to pay a toll on Newport Coast Drive.

SABADO SEEKS TO PROTECT CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to thank (The) Times for (its recent) focus on neighborhood rebuilding 
needs in the wake of Operation/Roundup in the 3rd Street area. 
</P>
<P>
 I need to clarify that Project SABADO (Santa Ana Broad-based Alcohol and Drug 
Organization) was not involved in Operation Roundup; we have worked in the last 
six months to build a group, now called Carver Concerned Parents, who are 
dedicated and active parents working to restore safety for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Carver Concerned Parents have initiated many projects to improve safety for 
schoolchildren, including a "parent patrol" for safe passage to and from school 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
 SABADO agrees with city leadership that we can't just "lock them up and throw 
away the key," but that we need to invest in building neighborhoods so we do 
not breed crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times article reports that both Councilmen (Miguel A.) Pulido Jr. and 
(Ted) Moreno are asking for resources to rebuild a healthy neighborhood. We 
salute such positive thinking and recognition of needs for recreation 
facilities, neighborhood cleanup and renovation and gang-prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth employment, both training and jobs, are also critical needs. Let's put 
jobs, not guns, into the hands of our young people.

CHARTER DISTRICTS WOULD LET SCHOOLS BE FREE TO TEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joy Anthony's recent column ("Charter Schools Can Provide the Answers to Hard 
Problems," Sept. 23) is off base. Part of the message behind both the headline 
and the column regarding the apparent unpopularity of charter schools is traced 
to school boards and the difficulty of "winning school board approval." 
</P>
<P>
 While there is significant debate among educators regarding the viability of 
the charter schools, many educational leaders are in favor of the charter 
school concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools do not exist in isolation. They are a part of larger communities. 
Elementary schools feed into middle schools. Middle school students matriculate 
into high school. A school is not an island unto itself and, therefore may well 
be hesitant to completely secede from a relationship with a school district. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Legislature really wanted to promote true decentralization of schools 
and education, the subject of charter school districts should appear on the 
agenda. Charter school districts would allow whole school communities to be 
freed of the over-regulation of a 6,000-page Education Code and pursue 
powerful, systemwide educational improvements instead of tinkering with one 
isolated charter school at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know why the state of California hamstrings school districts with an 
Education Code full of complex minutiae, some of which appears to be designed 
to discourage or impede innovation and improved instruction. California passed 
legislation to permit school districts to apply for waivers to the education 
code for programs which improve teaching and learning. This raises the logical 
question: Is the Education Code so bureaucratic that waivers must be approved 
before meaningful reform can take place? What really needs to take place is 
systematic reform, starting with the Education Code itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than bemoan the reality of so few schools entering into the charter 
school arena, let's do it right. Lift the burden of over-regulation on all 
schools and districts in California and allow us to become charter districts so 
that communities of schools serving the same children could exercise the same 
right to develop and implement creative and innovative solutions without having 
to turn to the voluminous and outdated Education Code every time a major 
decision had to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Give us charter school districts and set us free.

SUNDAY LIBRARY CLOSING WAS NECESSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Sample Ballot and Voter Information pamphlet, Conrad DeWitte claims 
that closing the Fullerton Public Library on Sundays resulted in a 40% loss of 
the service hours available to students and working people. Prior to the Sunday 
closing, the library was open 63 hours per week.Now, after Sunday closing, it 
is open 59 hours per week -- a reduction of four hours. Students and working 
people, of course, are not able to use the library during school and working 
hours, but the late afternoons, evenings and Saturday are still available. A 
four-hour reduction in hours open does not begin to approach a 40% loss of 
hours available. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to close Sundays was made prior to the time Mr. DeWitte joined 
the library board of trustees. It was done with great reluctance, and only 
after a survey of library patrons showed clearly a preference for Sunday 
closing over any other day or combination of partial closings on more than one 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that Mr. DeWitte's zeal to open the library on Sundays is 
misplaced. To do so, with our reduced budget, would further restrict our 
ability to purchase books and provide the services now available.

LISTEN TO EXPERTS ON BEST USES OF LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the debate over whether hunting in the Coal Canyon Preserve is allowed or 
not ("Plan Promotes Hunting in Coal Canyon," Sept. 30), I find it interesting 
to note the qualifications of the two opposing parties. On one hand are trained 
biologists and plant ecologists who say that hunting is compatible with the 
overall conservation policies of the preserve. On the other hand we have 
representatives of various environmental organizations, with no technical 
training in either biology or ecosystem management, who make such statements as 
" . . . there is no justification for encouraging or allowing hunting." 
</P>
<P>
 People with no expertise in biology should leave the decisions to the 
professionals. Environmentalists are wrong to make this a political issue 
instead of a scientific one. Our wildlife does not deserve to be a political 
pawn in the conservation game. It would be a shame if we allow anti-hunting 
sentiments to interfere with sound biological decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some will say that hunting and non-consumptive uses of our wild land, such as 
hiking and bird watching, are not compatible. Such feelings ignore that hunters 
and non-hunters peacefully coexist in our nation's national forests, wilderness 
areas, and wildlife refuges. 
</P>
<P>
 Responsible hunters do not damage an ecosystem; they merely interact with it, 
just as do responsible hikers and bird watchers. For anyone to argue otherwise 
is a slap in the face to the one group -- sportsmen -- that has done more for 
wildlife conservation in this country than any other. 
</P>
<P>
 It is both counterproductive and illogical for the environmental movement to 
continue its attacks on hunting. Such attacks only serve to further polarize 
hunting and non-hunting conservationists. Such a polarization diverts the 
attention of the environmental community from the true threat to wilderness 
areas such as Coal Canyon: the developers who see homes, businesses, and 
profits where we see wild land. Instead of quarreling among one another, 
environmentalists and hunters should stand together.

GATES WOULD KEEP MANY FROM PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times recently reported an action of the Laguna Niguel Planning Commission 
endorsing a proposal to construct guarded gates in the El Niguel Heights 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The broader issues have not been adequately aired: Is it good public policy 
for the Laguna Niguel City Council to concede to a small fraction of the city's 
residents near-exclusive access to some of the most attractive public assets in 
the city? 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise adopted by the Laguna Niguel Planning Commission concerning 
park access appears to overlook the fact that many persons will never discover 
the existence of the park because of its location within a gated community. 
Others who know of it will be intimidated by the need to reach it by passing 
through guarded gates.  
</P>
<P>
 These are compelling reasons for the Laguna Niguel City Council to reject the 
proposed concession of public property to a small minority of the city's 
residents.

PUBLIC RATES QUICKER RESPONSE ON SPILLS; IN RECENT LAGUNA BEACH INCIDENT, IT 
SHOULD BE NOTED THE CLOCK RUNS WEEKENDS, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials in Laguna Beach understandably have been angered over repeated 
sewage spills in the Aliso Creek area at the south end of town, and that has 
led to the formation of a task force to address the problem. Whatever the 
outcome of that effort, here's hoping it improves on what happened last weekend 
when a three-quarter-mile stretch of beach from Aster Street at the south end 
of Heisler Park north to Fairview Street was closed by the Orange County Health 
Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill first was noticed on a Thursday morning by a resident, and when the 
liquid still was gushing from the drain late Friday night, Robert Mosier, 
president of the Laguna Beach Taxpayers Assn., called police. When it was not 
stopped Saturday, he called the Laguna Beach County Water District. A water 
district worker did respond Saturday , but there apparently was some 
miscommunication between officials over what to do, and the result was that 
there was no follow-up to see whether the storm drain was still gushing. A 
county official said the health agency was not alerted until Monday morning, 
and it was not until that day that contaminated water signs were posted in 
nearby coves. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, the spill had stopped. City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said most 
appeared to have been ground water that leaked into the joints of the storm 
drain. There was some, but not much, sewage. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a relief that there was light sewage, but this was not known for some 
time, and sewage spills require a quick response. The residents who first 
noticed the problem did their part by informing officials that they saw 
something worthy of their attention. But the clock doesn't stop over the 
weekend, and the spill resulted in the closure for some time of the strip of 
beach. Officials are right to be concerned about the risk, but one of the 
messages they need to communicate is the importance of quicker response.

WILDLIFE LOSES TO EARTHMOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was with a heavy heart that I read Karen Watson's letter (Sept. 25). I have 
to agree with her that the deer she wrote about acted in frustration and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 If the "human" developers and Transportation Corridor Agency personnel have 
their way, in a few years Orange County will be completely paved over. 
</P>
<P>
 I moved to Aliso Viejo four years ago because I was charmed by the rolling 
hills and open spaces, where I could see coyotes, rabbits and skunks when I 
walked my dog. Now all I see are carcasses of coyotes, rabbits and skunks, and 
the omnipresent earthmoving machines. I ache with the destruction of all that 
I'd loved before. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never been a quitter, but trying to change the course of events in Orange 
County is an exercise in futility. I moved here from the Bay Area, where rapid 
transit, recycling and water conservation have been a way of life for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 I talked to dozens of people in Aliso Viejo to find out why another freeway, 
obsolete today and more obsolete when it is finished in three years, is being 
built when a rapid transit system makes so much more sense.  
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, I will probably leave Orange County, as will so many educated and 
caring people that I know, because we can't get City Hall to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to believe that we can know that we are poisoning our county, have 
the means to halt the deterioration and yet do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope Donald Bren and all his fellow developers enjoy the morass this county 
will become when all of us who want to see a patch of earth and a blue sky have 
gone.

COVINA'S MISTAKES WON'T BE REPEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fullerton Recalls Committee strongly objects to (Carroll) Gewin's letter 
("Fullerton Should Heed Covina's Fate," Oct. 2 ). In Covina, the Covina Recalls 
Committee did not have a platform for reform, as the Fullerton Recalls 
Committee does.Covina's recall proponents never proposed alternatives to the 
utility tax; in contrast, the platform of the Fullerton Recalls Committee does. 
</P>
<P>
 In Covina, four of the five people elected to the council are public employees 
or spouses of public employees. That council has not contracted out or 
privatized anything since it was elected. This is called the "trough feeder 
syndrome": government employees elected to public office will act to protect 
other government employees' jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Fullerton Recalls Committee would not consider anyone for 
endorsement who was a government employee or who was married to a government 
employee. The FRC platform specifically mandates contracting out of non-safety 
services where this will save money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Recalls Committee learned from the mistakes of the Covina recall 
and has ensured that these were not repeated.

 * I am offended by Gewin's assertion that I, Jack Dean and Conrad DeWitte are 
irresponsible. Gewin's claims were based on a memo published by Gary Chalupsky, 
Fullerton Redevelopment Agency director. If Gewin wishes to point to financial 
irresponsibility, he should decry Chalupsky's Aug. 29 memo that claimed that 
redevelopment helps the city's general fund. In a memo dated Oct. 3, Chalupsky 
admitted that the "accounting logic behind the . . . schedule" in his Aug. 29 
memo is flawed. Essentially, he admitted to "double counting" certain 
reimbursements by the agency to the city.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON EDUCATION; UCI POLICY FOR FUTURE SHOULD NOT 
HINGE ON RESEARCH DOLLARS; ALLOWING IT TO HAPPEN COULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL 
EFFECT ON THE NATURE OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AT THE UNIVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARNOLD BINDER, Arnold Binder started teaching at UCI in 1966 and in 1971 
founded the social ecology program that later became the School of Social 
Ecology. During the past two years, he has served as faculty representative on 
the UC Board of Regents and during the past year has been chairman of the 
statewide Academic Senate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Sept. 16, Chancellor Laurel Wilkening spoke her thoughts about the future 
of UC Irvine, both in a campus weekly newspaper and at a meeting with newspaper 
editors and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The thoughts closely mirrored the recommendations of a final reviewing 
committee, the Academic Planning Council (APC), rather than those of two 
planning task forces that started the process of determining strategies to keep 
UCI moving forward "within a long time environment of limited resources." The 
predominant theme was to move UCI up to rank among the top 50 research 
universities, where ranking is determined by the size of research expenditures 
and the amount of grant funds generated (two measures that are closely related 
and influential in such domains as the number of Ph.D.s produced.) 
</P>
<P>
 The actions by the task forces, APC and the chancellor were motivated 
primarily by the severe budget crunch faced by the University of California 
these past four years. In particular, there has been a $341-million cut in 
state funding between the 1990-91 and 1993-94 academic years; the resulting 
damage is intensified by the effects of inflation. The impact on UCI is 
estimated to be about $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing difficulties faced by the UC range from the impossibility of 
continuing to operate in the customary manner to the more subtle expressions of 
dissatisfaction by students, parents and legislators to one of the methods used 
in adjusting to the shortfall, namely more than doubling fees while reducing 
services to students. 
</P>
<P>
 I will focus on three major difficulties in evaluating the extent to which 
Chancellor Wilkening's plans are likely to produce alleviation. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there is the direct debilitating effect of the money shortage on campus 
operations, an effect that can be dealt with by decreasing expenditures or 
increasing income substantially. Will the plans do either? 
</P>
<P>
 The only immediate cost saver of apparent substance is the option to 
discontinue the comparative culture program, although Wilkening does suggest 
closing the physical education department and others with less than seven 
faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceasing comparative culture will save a trivial amount of money. It is not a 
very large program, but, more important, it is not the UC's policy to terminate 
tenured faculty members for other than code of conduct violations, and so 
salaries and benefits will continue for most comparative culture faculty 
members, with different titles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are implications in Wilkening's suggestions that significant relief from 
the fiscal stresses will come from improvement in grant and contract funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Research grants and contracts do fund research projects, including the support 
of graduate students, but money for general use must come from the additional 
charges referred to as overhead costs. But if, say, the federal government is 
charged overhead fees for grants by a UC campus, nearly half of those dollars 
are returned to it (the state alone takes 44 cents on the dollar). 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the UC was shaken resoundingly on notification earlier this year by 
a key federal agency that overhead allowances would be significantly reduced by 
an accounting rule change, and also by threats from the federal bureaucracy 
generally that such allowances will not be permitted to increase even if more 
grants are generated. In short, the returns from grants cannot do much, and 
will unquestionably do less to compensate for the mammoth general fund losses. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that is not the full picture. The amount of money available in 
support of research has not been growing in recent years, and may very well 
shrink in coming ones, while the competition for the funds is getting fiercer. 
And preparing grant proposals is extraordinarily costly, especially in the 
required time commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the UC is facing difficulty in offering courses in the manner and 
quality that students deserve and citizens expect. It is largely due to the 
fact that almost 2,000 faculty members have accepted the "golden handshakes" 
offered the past three years to reduce operating costs, while over the same 
period the number of undergraduates has remained virtually constant. 
</P>
<P>
 The process has led to an increase in the student-faculty ratio, from 17.6 to 
1 to 18.7 to 1. An answer to the resulting problem, as amplified by the 
hoped-for increased time of faculty working on well-funded research projects at 
UCI rather than course offerings, lies, according to Wilkening, in the 
"expanded use of part-time faculty, full-time lecturers, TAs, information 
technology, the community colleges, and University Extension." 
</P>
<P>
 Put that side by side with the frequently expressed position that research 
universities like the UCs are great for undergraduates because they are taught 
by leading researchers (it is even claimed, "If you want to find a faculty 
member who can be a superb teacher, show me a researcher") and it is easy to be 
less than convinced of the validity of this approach as a solution to the 
teaching predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major difficulty is the low morale of faculty and staff members 
stemming from the bashing, financial and otherwise, of UC these past several 
years. Will Wilkening's plans help boost morale? 
</P>
<P>
 For faculty members in the hard sciences, engineering and medicine who have 
commitments to, and significant successes in or hopes for, external fund 
raising, one might expect morale boosting, but for people outside that orbit, I 
have my doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult for me to imagine professors in the humanities, fine arts and 
most social sciences becoming more content in the atmosphere sketched by 
Wilkening. One dissonant note worth mentioning: To the extent that internal 
resources, which are controlled by the chancellor, are devoted to those "soft" 
fields, with few exceptions, the move to the "top 50" is threatened or 
retarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening's emphasis on the importance of seeking external research is 
relevant here: "We must attune ourselves to them (the funding agencies and 
their agendas). Doing so will be our route to the top ranks of research 
universities." Consider that the research emphases of major research 
universities influence, or even determine, the nature of their academic 
programs. More advanced courses are often selected for offering by the research 
directions of faculty members, and students work with those faculty members on 
their research projects. Those relationships flow naturally from the 
definitions differentiating a research university from a liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
 To what degree, one must ask, should the educational directions of a 
university be influenced by the dictates of funding sources? It is one matter 
when isolated investigators follow research paths on the basis of money, and 
quite another when it is stated as university policy by the person who has 
final responsibility for the internal allocations of resources.

HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM IS COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for your recent editorial "Santa Ana Grapples With Homelessness" 
(Sept. 25). 
</P>
<P>
 Homelessness has been adopted as an issue for emphasis by the League of Women 
Voters of Central Orange County Area and we appreciate your comments and the 
publicity you are giving to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A study completed last year by our league pointed up the need for affordable 
housing, including single room occupancies, emergency rental assistance and 
expanded facilities for transitional and emergency shelter beds, as well as 
life skills and job training. 
</P>
<P>
 A major conclusion of the study was that "cities and citizens must unite to 
persuade the federal, state and local governments to be partners in ending 
homelessness -- by establishing and supporting programs that promote 
rehabilitation and self-sufficiency for the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 The grant from Santa Ana to the Homeless Issues Task Force for a countywide 
approach is definitely a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Our study revealed that there are homeless in virtually every part of the 
county, from beach cities to hillside communities. 
</P>
<P>
 You're right: homelessness is a regional problem that demands a regional 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Only by using the resources and problem-solving skills of the entire county 
can we provide shelter for every county resident.

FINALLY, A FORUM ON BOLSA CHICA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hooray for the good guys! It was nice to see the Koll project for Bolsa Chica 
finally get the credit it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 I am talking about the first public hearing before the Planning Commission on 
Bolsa Chica that was held (Sept. .28) at Huntington Beach City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 There were both supporters and opponents of the plan, but this was the first 
time I really felt our voices were heard. 
</P>
<P>
 I run a small business in Huntington Beach, and I want what is best for our 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't support this project if I thought it was just about building houses 
-- because it is not. It is about restoring the wetlands and about creating 
more jobs. This project will make Huntington Beach a more beautiful and more 
productive place. I'm all for it.

USC HAS PLENTY IN RESERVE OTTON AND WINS, 27-19; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: HE REPLACES 
INJURED JOHNSON AND PASSES FOR 208 YARDS AGAINST OREGON STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Life and death with the Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the card USC's football team was dealt Saturday, and it responded with 
some big defensive plays and some solid offensive work by two backups, 
quarterback Brad Otton and tailback Rodney Sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, before a near-capacity 33,892 at Parker Stadium, was a 27-19 
comeback victory for the Trojans, one that puts them at 2-1 in the Pacific 10 
(3-2 overall) going into next Saturday's game against Stanford.  
</P>
<P>
 And five games into the season, USC has finally found a big-play receiver to 
complement tailbacks Shawn Walters and Sermons -- wide receiver Keyshawn 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a junior, had six catches for 139 yards and his 50-yard play in the 
third quarter set up what proved to be the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Johnson's second 100-yard game. 
</P>
<P>
 USC needed a solid game from Otton, a sophomore transfer from Weber State who 
filled in for senior Rob Johnson, who sat out his first start in 29 games 
because of a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's victory, its 21st in a row over Oregon State (0-3, 1-4), was expensive. 
Junior guard Clay Hattabaugh suffered a season-ending knee injury and 
cornerback John Herpin suffered a shoulder injury in the second quarter and 
didn't return to the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to set an NCAA record for starting freshmen and 
sophomores," Trojan Coach John Robinson said. As many as 19 first-year players 
have played in USC games.  
</P>
<P>
 It might not have been pretty, but Robinson said he would take it.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were stunned last week (a 22-7 loss to Oregon), and we had to come back 
today and play our best kind of hard, physical football," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He praised the play of Otton and Sermons and indicated he expected Johnson to 
play next week at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State's last chance was on the game's last series. The Beavers got the 
ball for the last time on John Stonehouse's punt and started a drive at their 
31 with 1:41 to go.  
</P>
<P>
 J.J. Young brought the crowd to its feet with a 21-yard run on a pitch play 
with 31 seconds left, but the drive ended at USC's 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton, in his first major college start, completed 13 of 21 passes for 208 
yards and two touchdowns. He was sacked only once, on USC's last series. Rob 
Johnson had had 22 sacks in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otton was very efficient," Robinson said, "and we haven't been efficient. . . 
. We've taken a lot of a sacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Sermons, the widely recruited freshman from Bishop Amat, gained 74 yards in 23 
carries without so much as a bobble. Starter Shawn Walters, who Robinson said 
woke up ill Saturday, had 16 carries for 68 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 Off to its usual rocky defensive start, USC gave up scores to Oregon State on 
the Beavers' first two series, and trailed by 13-2, getting on the board first 
with a seldom-seen defensive conversion play. 
</P>
<P>
 USC made the score 13-13 and went ahead, 20-13, on a second-quarter, 31-yard 
screen pass from Otton to Sermons. The play came seconds after Hattabaugh -- 
who will undergo surgery Monday -- was rolled off the field on a cart.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who had blamed himself for abandoning his running offense after the 
Oregon defeat, showed on USC's last scoring drive the running game was again 
fully operational. 
</P>
<P>
 A 50-yard pass play from Otton to Keyshawn Johnson set up USC at the Oregon 
State three late in the third period. From there, Robinson ordered all running 
plays. It took Sermons four carries, but he finally scored and USC had a 27-13 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior linebacker Eric Herrin, who had been off to a slow start after being a 
training camp sensation, recovered two fumbles and was a game-long force for 
the Trojans.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Herrin who executed a hard tackle on quarterback Rahim Muhammad midway 
through the fourth quarter at USC's five-yard-line, forcing a fumble recovered 
by Trojan Quincy Harrison.  
</P>
<P>
 After that, Oregon State never seriously threatened again.  
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State took a first-quarter lead on its first series, on a two-yard run 
by Starling Latu. That was set up by a 64-yard Don Shanklin-to-Cameron Reynolds 
pass play to USC's two on Oregon State's third play. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversion play resulted in one of the rarest of all football plays, a 
defensive conversion.  
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that a blocked conversion kick was a dead ball, but a rule 
change in 1988 makes it a live ball. On the Beavers' conversion, the Trojans' 
Marcus Bonds blocked Randy Lund's kick, aided somewhat by a poor placement by 
holder Chris Cross. USC's Micah Phillips picked the ball up and ran it back the 
length of the field.  
</P>
<P>
 The rule change provides that if a defensive team gains possession during a 
conversion, it can score two points by returning the ball the length of the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Unrattled, Oregon State bounced back on its next series and scored again on a 
34-yard run by Young, who smashed through Herpin along the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Herpin suffered a shoulder injury on the play and didn't return. Young cruised 
the rest of the way untouched and Oregon State had a 13-2 lead with most of the 
first period left.  
</P>
<P>
 Cole Ford's 23-yard field goal late in the first reduced the Beaver lead to 
13-5 before USC came back to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters and Sermons, running for the most part behind linemen Norberto Garrido 
and Kris Pollack, carried most of the load, but Otton went to Grace for a 
12-yard gain early in the drive. The touchdown came on a one-yard pass to Tyler 
Cashman. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closing first-half drive that ate up 4:02, Otton and Sermons finished it 
with the screen play to give USC its 20-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaver Coach Jerry Pettibone played three quarterbacks Saturday, and lost two. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanklin started, came out because of an injured foot and was replaced by 
freshman Tim Alexander, who suffered a broken collarbone late in the game. 
Muhammad, of Fairfax High, finished up.

FOR MARIO, IT'S 'ARRIVEDERCI' TODAY TO INDY CAR RACING; ANDRETTI: THE 
54-YEAR-OLD DRIVER WILL COMPETE IN THE 407TH AND FINAL EVENT OF HIS CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HARRIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mario Andretti never asked for any special favors. The competitive dynamo who 
won races in each of four decades always gave no quarter and asked none, even 
when racing against his own sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I knew they were out there," Andretti said. "But, when we were on the 
track, they were just another car I had to beat. And it was a thrill if I beat 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if the 54-year-old Andretti could ask some of the younger drivers, 
including sons Michael and Jeff, for a favor now, he knows what it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd ask them to trade me 10 years," said the diminutive racer with the lined, 
handsome face. 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti will complete his season-long "Arrivederci, Mario" Tour today in the 
Bank of America 300 at Laguna Seca Raceway, where he will race in his 407th and 
last Indy-car event. 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti, who moved to the United States from Italy as a 15-year-old, made his 
way into the sport on the dirt tracks of the Northeast and Midwest with an 
obvious flair for speed and excitement. He quickly graduated to the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a winner in his first love, Formula One, earning 12 victories and the 
1978 World Championship while splitting his time between Europe and America. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Indy-car circuit, the masterful driver won four championships and 52 
races -- second only to A.J. Foyt's 67. Those wins include the 1969 
Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most versatile driver of all time, Andretti also won the 1967 
Daytona 500 and a number of sport car endurance events and has been named 
Driver of the Year in three different decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting about 10 years ago, the question began popping up: 'When are you 
retiring?"' Andretti said. "Many of my contemporaries were retiring and it was 
a natural question. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wasn't ready. When I reached 50, I kept thinking, 'I don't feel any 
different.' But I've got to be realistic. Before 50, I thought in five-year 
increments. After that, it became year-to-year, and time gets us all, 
eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti won at Phoenix early in 1993, ending a five-year winless streak, but 
he wasn't fooled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I could probably be effective for another year or so, but I don't 
want to get to the point where I'm not quick enough to justify being involved," 
he said. "So, I knew it was time." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his family will be on hand for his last Indy-car race, including 
eldest son Michael, who will be racing against him this one last time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be the same without him out there," said Michael, who won a 
championship as his father's teammate in 1991. "But he has made his peace with 
the situation. I'm happy for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Andretti is scheduled to lead his competitors around the winding 
2.215-mile road course on the parade lap and, after the checkered flag falls on 
his final Indy-car run, he is scheduled to ride around the track in a pace car 
painted "Mario Andretti red" for a final salute to his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been three top-five finishes, including a third-place in the 
season-opener, this year. But there also have been too many times he did not 
finish to suit the still-motivated Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Satisfaction comes from being a factor, being competitive," he said. "That's 
what I want: satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope we can have a good day," Andretti said of Sunday's race. "For 
sure, it would be great to make the podium (with a top-three finish). Believe 
me, I would love to be running at the finish. I want to be on the track for the 
checkered flag." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, this may not be his last ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said this will be my last time in an Indy-car, but I still feel like I 
have some unfinished business elsewhere," he said with a grin. "I've never won 
LeMans, and I'd really like to have that in my resume before I'm through. I've 
been talking with some people about a factory ride next year, maybe for a 
couple of sports car endurance races." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, his future is somewhat uncertain, although Andretti admits owning 
an Indy-car team could be somewhere on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that takes time to do, and I haven't wanted any distractions this year. 
It's been very important for me this year to stay focused on the job at hand, 
which is driving the car. We'll probably take next year to organize whatever it 
is we'll be doing after that."

MIAMI STRUTS BACK INTO THE LIMELIGHT; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: UNDERDOG HURRICANES 
REGAIN TOP-DOG STATUS WITH DOMINATING 34-20 ROUT OF FLORIDA STATE IN ERICKSON'S 
'BIGGEST VICTORY.'

 He left the field drenched in Gatorade, his gray bangs wet against his 
forehead, his arms flailing with joy, his smile seemingly there to stay. If you 
didn't know any better, you would have thought Miami Coach Dennis Erickson had 
just chugged a case of Jolt . . . or the more likely scenario: just beaten 
Florida State. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the score was, 34-20, but with feeling. Erickson burst into the 
Hurricane locker room Saturday night, waited until the door was closed and then 
started hugging anybody within squeezing distance. In the privacy of those 
walls he also told his team that it was the biggest victory of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest win? Doesn't Erickson have two national championship rings? They 
don't give those away, do they? 
</P>
<P>
 But this was different. Miami entered the game against Florida State as 
underdogs -- and in the Orange Bowl, no less, the same place where the 
Hurricanes had won an NCAA-record 58 consecutive games before Washington 
shocked them two weeks ago. Miami couldn't believe the slight and said so. 
</P>
<P>
 It got worse. The Hurricanes' quarterback, Frank Costa, was everybody's 
favorite scapegoat. Even one of his former teammates took a shot at him. 
</P>
<P>
 There was talk of unrest, of lowered expectations. A national championship was 
out of the question, the critics said. Suddenly a Big East Conference title 
sounded good and if that fell through, maybe a nice trip to say, the Peach 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it was football blasphemy for a program accustomed to swaggers and 
pregame quotes so inflammatory that fire extinguishers usually are required for 
listening. Insulted, that's what the Hurricanes were. Determined too. 
</P>
<P>
 So it became a night to make amends and better yet, a night to mend a 
Hurricane record, a ranking and a reputation. By the time Miami (4-1) was 
finished with the Seminoles (4-1), there was no doubting the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to tell everyone," said Hurricane wide receiver Chris T. Jones, 
"that the Hurricanes are back !" 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State didn't need a reminder. This is the 13th time in Coach Bobby 
Bowden's 19 seasons at Florida State that Miami has beaten the Seminoles, the 
ninth time they've ended a Seminole undefeated season, the fifth consecutive 
time it has won in the dreaded Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 It gets worse. The Hurricanes have cost Bowden four national championships and 
now as many as three other ones. So flustered was Bowden after the latest 
defeat, that he couldn't even do simple arithmetic in the postgame interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can sum it up in four words," he said of the loss. "They outexecuted us." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami did more than that. It dominated, and in the process, became whole 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricanes rushed for 185 yards against a defense that had allowed an 
average of 77. They recorded five sacks against Florida State's bewildered 
quarterbacks. They forced four interceptions and five turnovers in all. And 
more times than not, they turned Florida State's many mistakes into points. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Seminole quarterback Danny Kanell, who threw three of the 
interceptions, was gone by the third quarter. Near the end of the fourth 
period, Kanell's replacement, Jon Stark, was also seated on the bench, replaced 
by Thad Busby. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it mattered. By then the Hurricanes were in vintage woofing mode -- 
dancing on the sideline, mugging for any camera pointed their way, conducting 
bench interviews, gesturing happily toward the 77,010 fans who filled the 
creaky old stadium. Across the way, the Seminoles stared at the scoreboard in 
disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a perfect win, a perfect showing, a perfect game, a perfect scenario 
and a perfect way to show we're the best team in the country," Miami linebacker 
Rohan Marley said. "I keep telling people that, but they don't listen." 
</P>
<P>
 They will now, though the best-team-in-the-country-claim might be a little 
hard for nearby Florida, or Penn State or Colorado or Nebraska to stomach at 
the moment. After all, Miami still has that one loss at home and they still 
need considerable help from others if they hope to have a national championship 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the moment anything seems possible to the Hurricanes. They shut down 
mighty Florida State -- outgaining them 363 yards to 219 -- and then they shut 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the quit in their eyes," said safety Malcolm Pearson. "They stopped 
talking. They kept their heads down. They didn't finish their pass routes." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a reason for that. Miami's offensive line, which outweighed Florida 
State's defensive line by almost 50 pounds per player, was a force all night. 
Fullback James Stewart had 95 yards and two touchdowns in 16 carries, while 
backup Danyell Ferguson added another 81 yards in nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the rushing attack and later, a 16-yard touchdown interception 
return by cornerback Carlos Jones, Florida State was essentially out of the 
game by late in the third quarter, down 31-17. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there were the exploits of the beleaguered one, Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 For Costa, Saturday evening's game was a chance to right a wrong, to prove 
that while maybe he wasn't the best quarterback ever to play for Miami, he 
certainly wasn't the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 He had some convincing to do. Former teammate Mark Caesar blasted Costa in the 
local papers, saying that the fifth-year senior would have a hard time starting 
for some of the county's high school teams. And maybe it was an accident, but 
Florida State's media guide features a photo from last year's victory over the 
Hurricanes . . . with Costa looking bewildered after a Miami turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa called the treatment a slap in the face, which is nothing compared to 
what happened to him after last season's 28-10 loss to the Seminoles, when he 
completed just 21 of 47 passes for 193 yards, one touchdown and one 
interception. Erickson benched him and kept him there until earlier this fall, 
when Costa won the job until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
 With the pressure more intense than ever this week, with Miami's fragile 
national championship hopes at stake, with Gino Torretta, the Heisman Trophy 
winner watching from the sidelines, Costa tried to make a stand. He wasn't 
perfect, but he didn't have to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling it the biggest game of his life, Costa completed his first pass. And 
his second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth. He led the Hurricanes to an 80-yard 
touchdown drive, with Stewart scoring on a two-yard run with 7:11 left in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa would finish with 18 completions on 32 attempts for 177 yards, no 
touchdowns and two interceptions. Statistics to remember, they weren't -- but 
the victory was. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best feeling I've ever had in my life," he said. "So much was 
said about me, about our team. I don't think anybody thought we could beat 
Florida State. But we whipped their tails."

USC HAS PLENTY IN RESERVE AS OTTON FUELS 27-19 VICTORY; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: HE 
REPLACES INJURED JOHNSON AND PASSES FOR 208 YARDS AGAINST OREGON STATE. 
</P>

 Brad Otton, starting in place of injured Rob Johnson, passed for 208 yards and 
two touchdowns Saturday as USC regrouped from last week's upset loss to Oregon 
and beat Oregon State, 27-19. 
</P>
<P>
 Keyshawn Johnson caught six passes for 139 yards for the Trojans (3-2, 2-1 
Pac-10), who fell behind by 13-2 in the first quarter, then scored on four 
consecutive possessions en route to their 21st consecutive victory over the 
Beavers (1-4, 0-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman quarterback Tim Alexander, who chose Oregon State over Nebraska last 
spring, replaced injured starter Don Shanklin and rallied the Beavers, rushing 
for 117 yards in 17 carries. But he suffered an injured left shoulder on a 
31-yard run to the USC 14 with 7:15 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Alexander's replacement, Rahim Muhammad, fumbled and USC's 
Quincy Harrison recovered at the Trojans' seven, the only one of seven Oregon 
State fumbles the Beavers didn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State got the ball once more, but Muhammad was sacked at the USC 44 as 
time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson suffered a sprained right ankle in last week's 22-7 loss to Oregon, 
and watched from the sidelines as Otton, a 6-foot-6 sophomore transfer from 
Weber State, completed 13 of 21 passes without an interception. USC 
quarterbacks were sacked nine times last week, but only once by Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers, who haven't beaten the Trojans since 1967, scored the first two 
times they had the ball. Shanklin's 64-yard pass play to Cameron Reynolds set 
up the first touchdown, with Shanklin fumbling into the end zone and teammate 
Sterling Latu recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 But the conversion kick was blocked and USC's Micah Phillips picked up the 
ball and ran 70 yards for the two-pointer.

CAL SLAPS UCLA WITH A LOW FIVE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: EVERYTHING GOES WRONG FOR 
BRUINS IN 26-7 LOSS, EVEN AFTER BEAR QUARTERBACK BARR SUFFERS A BROKEN 
COLLARBONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 It's a case of buzzard luck: nothing dead and nothing dying. 
</P>
<P>
 You sack the opposing quarterback, knocking him from the game, and his 
replacement beats you. You replace your quarterback and the sub throws two 
interceptions. Then his replacement throws one. 
</P>
<P>
 You run a reverse on a punt return. It loses five yards. 
</P>
<P>
 You run a flanker reverse that loses one yard, and you're penalized for 
holding. The player you held made the tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 When California's fans started the "five more years" chant with 4:39 to play 
in a 26-7 victory over UCLA on Saturday, it merely added insult to injury. No 
Bruin senior has beaten Cal. No Bear senior has lost to UCLA. Cal has never 
before beaten UCLA five times in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Five more years? How about four weeks? That's how long since UCLA (2-4, 0-3 in 
the Pacific 10) has won a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very disheartening to see us play as poorly as we did," UCLA Coach Terry 
Donahue said. "Our team right now just doesn't make any plays on offense or 
defense. It's very frustrating for the coach and players because nothing ever 
happens that's exciting or emotional in terms of getting your team excited." 
</P>
<P>
 It showed in things such as the pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal quarterback Dave Barr had all day to go to tight end Tony Gonzalez, who 
was open and waving in the end zone, ready to score his first college touchdown 
and the Bears' first of the day for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 When Barr had time, he shredded the Bruin defense. When he didn't, he was 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA sacked him twice for 14 yards. The second hit, by Donnie Edwards in the 
second quarter, broke Barr's left collarbone. He will be sidelined four to six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Kerry McGonigal, his replacement for three years and a favorite whipping 
boy of critics who say Cal (3-2, 2-0) won't win without Barr. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate to say it, because you don't like to see people hurt, but I kind of 
thought that it was a break for us," Bruin linebacker Rod Smalley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. McGonigal completed both of his passes on his first series, a 60-yard 
scoring drive that ended with a 20-yard pass to Iheanyi Uwaezuoke for a 19-7 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the game became a holding action, Cal playing stout defense and 
UCLA, well, holding. The Bruins, who had been penalized fewer times than any 
other Pac-10 team, had nine for 96 yards. They were assessed 15 yards for a 
personal foul on the opening kickoff, another 15 for a personal foul after 
Daron Washington's 26-yard touchdown run and 10 yards for holding Cal's Jerod 
Cherry while trying to protect Jim McElroy on a flanker reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherry made the tackle for a loss of a yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just accumulated a lot of penalties," Donahue said. "I can't account for 
it. It's very upsetting. . . . We just made a lot of bad decisions in terms of 
blocking in the back, in terms of holding." 
</P>
<P>
 McGonigal was undaunted by the previous criticism. His job was not to win the 
game for Cal, but to keep from losing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "At halftime, they told us to take care of the football," he said. "No stupid 
penalties. Manage the running game. Make good decisions in the passing game. No 
mistakes. We knew at halftime if UCLA doesn't score 11 (actually 12 more) 
points, they don't win this game. They didn't score any." 
</P>
<P>
 It was worse than that. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Bears were sorting out their quarterback situation, UCLA was having 
its own problems at the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal's first touchdown had come after Artis Houston intercepted a pass from 
Wayne Cook and returned it 52 yards to the Bruin 11. Cook overthrew Kevin 
Jordan, who had turned the wrong direction on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins made the score 7-7 on Washington's 26-yard run. Cal got a 38-yard 
field goal from Ryan Longwell on the play after Barr was injured, then two more 
points two plays later when Bear defensive back Ricky Spears came in on Cook, 
unimpeded by a blocker. Cook fumbled and various recovery efforts by both teams 
pushed it into the end zone, where UCLA guard Chad Sauter fell on it for the 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that series of plays there before the end of the first half was huge 
in determining the outcome of the game," Donahue said. "When you're a team like 
we are right now, that's struggling so badly, when a series of bad things like 
that happens to you, you tend to not have the same response that a team on a 
roll does." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's first possession of the third quarter gave an indication that 
everything was falling apart. The Bruins called time out on the fifth play 
because a player failed to go on the field when his formation was called, then 
called another timeout two plays later when a play was called from the sideline 
that couldn't be run with the players who were on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 When things got no better, Donahue pulled Cook, replacing him with Ryan Fien 
with 30 seconds to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're not making plays, the focal point becomes the quarterback," 
Donahue said. "I wanted to see if a change would help us. Obviously, it didn't 
have much impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just kind of groping for answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there was impact. On Fien's first pass -- which opened the final 
quarter -- he threw toward Bryan Adams, and Cherry deflected the ball toward 
Andre Rhodes. He took the interception 25 yards for the game's final points. 
</P>
<P>
 Fien's second interception was underthrown and caught at the Cal five by Kevin 
Devine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to make a big play," Fien said. "Whether it's (getting a chance 
to start) or not, I just missed a good opportunity. That would have been a 
great boost for myself, knowing I could go in there and get something going. 
I'd made good strides for the past couple of weeks, but I ran into a brick 
wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Fien has replaced Cook in each of the last four games, though the 
first was against Nebraska after the game was decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The game out of hand, Fien was replaced by Rob Walker, who started games in 
each of the last two seasons but who is No. 3 on the depth chart. Walker 
completed his first two passes, then threw an interception to Kevin Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no quarterback controversy, Donahue said. Cook is the starter for 
next week's game against Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Makes sense to Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problems on this team aren't just the quarterback," he said. "Our 
confidence is shook. It's embarrassing, and I think everybody feels that way. 
It's embarrassing to be out there and screw up the way we're screwing up."

BASEBALL '94: 10 REASONS WHY IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A TOTAL WASTE; ACHIEVEMENTS: 
RAUL MONDESI APPEARS SURE TO FOLLOW ERIC KARROS (1992) AND MIKE PIAZZA (1993) 
AS THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE DODGER TO WIN THE N.L. ROOKIE OF THE YEAR AWARD.

<P>
 The 1994 baseball season will be remembered years from now for its premature 
end, but was it a complete waste of a season ticket? Not exactly. Here are 10 
reasons why it meant at least something: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Davey Johnson. It seemed like just yesterday that he was begging baseball 
to take him back. Now he's recycled into the hot-commodity circuit. Johnson had 
the Cincinnati Reds atop the National League Central, ahead of the widely 
favored Houston Astros, despite Jose Rijo's struggles and a steady stream of 
controversy from day one (or was it day two?). Johnson, who had to take over 
the previous season for popular Tony Perez, cleared up doubt about whether he 
can still manage. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Raul Mondesi. After hitting .306 and leading the majors in outfield 
assists, he is sure to follow Eric Karros (1992) and Mike Piazza (1993) as the 
third consecutive Dodger to win the N.L. Rookie of the Year award. Only twice 
before has a club held such a grip on the baseball writers' award: Oakland from 
1986 through '88 (Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire and Walt Weiss) and Los Angeles 
from 1979 through '82 (Rick Sutcliffe, Steve Howe, Fernando Valenzuela and 
Steve Sax). 
</P>
<P>
 3. Cal Ripken. He moved 112 games closer to Lou Gehrig. We've all thought for 
years about 1995, unable to picture the Baltimore Orioles shortstop getting 
there without going down and out on at least one double-play pivot. If there's 
a '95 season, Ripken is all that matters. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Leonard Coleman. The new N.L. president came in and kicked butt. His stiff 
penalties seemed to have an effect in a season that began with wanton brawling. 
The brawls won't stop there, but it's good to know that there is at least some 
deterrent for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Pedro Martinez. Although Coleman had to set him straight, the Montreal 
Expos pitcher found out what he needed to work on in the offseason. Missing a 
batter here and there will help. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Ron Gant, Donovan Osborne and Mark Clark. Gant and Osborne knew they would 
miss the season because of injuries, so they didn't lose as much playing time 
as they figured. Clark righted that Mark Whiten trade with St. Louis by going 
11-3 and making the All-Star roster, only to be disabled for the second half 
because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Will Clark and Rafael Palmeiro. After all that talk, both first basemen 
proved that they deserved their free-agent contracts. Clark led the Texas 
Rangers with a .329 average and 80 RBIs in 110 games, although he slumped 
toward the end. Palmeiro led Orioles regulars with a .319 average, 23 homers 
and 76 RBIs in 111 games. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Darryl Strawberry. He had just enough time to find another employer, and he 
did just well enough to warrant another contract for '95. 
</P>
<P>
 9. The baseball. Costa Rican manufacturers must be laughing, because it was 
proved again that juiced-ball talk is a lot of hot air. Carlos Delgado and runs 
in general tapered off after that wicked start, and by strike time only Sparky 
Anderson thought the ball was juiced. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Kenny Rogers. No one can take away his perfect game.

BOSTON COLLEGE UPSETS NOTRE DAME; NONCONFERENCE: BUT UNLIKE LAST SEASON'S 
NARROW VICTORY OVER THE IRISH, THIS TIME THE EAGLES DOMINATE FROM THE SECOND 
QUARTER ON. 
</P>

<P>
 Only 17 seconds remained in Saturday's Boston College-Notre Dame game at 
Alumni Stadium. But with the Eagles about to clinch a 30-11 victory, that was 
too long to wait to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Too long for those old enough to have thirsted for revenge for 50 years, 
remembering Notre Dame's last visit to this city, a 64-0 victory over Dartmouth 
at Fenway Park in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Too long for those mad enough to have thirsted for respectability after last 
year's Boston College victory over Notre Dame was labeled a fluke by some. 
</P>
<P>
 Too long for those loyal enough to have thirsted for victory in a game 
described by everybody from program vendors to area newspapers as The Holy War 
or the Catholic Super Bowl, matching the last two Catholic universities in this 
country still playing Division 1-A football. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their reason, the Boston College faithful in a sellout crowd of 
44,500 could wait no longer. They stormed the field, grabbing the goal posts, 
hugging their heroes and generally creating a scene reminiscent of some of the 
great victories downtown in Boston Garden by the Celtics or the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 For Boston College Coach Den Henning, it was as big as a Super Bowl victory. 
Henning was an assistant coach on two Super Bowl-winning Washington Redskin 
teams, but as he stood in that multitude on the field Saturday, he realized 
this was at least equally important to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's because I'm the head coach," he told reporters after order had been 
restored and the final 17 seconds played out, "because we were underdogs and 
because we beat one of the mythological giants of college football." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't merely that a 1-2 Big East team beat a 4-1, eighth-ranked national 
powerhouse, albeit one without four key offensive players. It was the way the 
Eagles won. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't a team squeaking by in the last second as was the case last 
season, when Boston College won, 41-39, on David Gordon's 41-yard field goal. 
This was a team that dominated from the second quarter on. This was a team that 
beat the Fighting Irish where they rarely lose -- on the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't all. Henning ran a reverse. He ran a pass play off a reverse. And, 
in the most crucial play of the game, he called for a fake field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to that point, Notre Dame was leading by 3-0 on Stefan Schroffner's 27-yard 
field goal. At the start of the second quarter, Boston College drove to the 
Irish 16-yard line, where the Eagles faced a fourth and six. On came Gordon for 
an apparent 33-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Henning went with a play he named "Leprechaun." Boston College holder 
Matt Hasselbeck took the snap, took a deep breath, stood up and there, before 
his eyes, was a hole on the left side of the line that looked as big as Boston 
Commons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasselbeck ran for eight yards. And, with new life, the Eagles ran into the 
end zone on the next play, David Green accounting for the eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We studied some film and thought that we had something," Henning said. "It 
was not going to be run if they didn't give us the look that we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 But they did and Boston College never looked back, scoring 24 consecutive 
points to take command. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles were led by: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Running back Justice Smith, who got an unexpected workload when Green 
reinjured an ankle in the second half, and responded with 147 yards and two 
touchdowns on 27 carries, scoring from seven and six yards. Smith came into the 
game with a season total of 115 yards rushing on 20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Safety Terence Wiggins, who intercepted the first two passes of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Defensive end Mike Mamula, who had two of the Eagles' four sacks and 
applied constant pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback Mark Hartsell, who didn't have a big day statistically, 
completing 11 of 19 for only 83 yards and no touchdowns. But Hartsell, coming 
back from a hand injury, kept the Irish defense off-balance by rushing eight 
times for 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a miserable day for Notre Dame quarterback Ron Powlus, who tried to 
shake off the effects of a groin injury, but managed to complete only five of 
21 passes for 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to make an excuse," Powlus said. "They just beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish were without fullback Ray Zellars and tailback Lee Becton and 
offensive linemen Mike Doughty and Ryan Leahy. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz: "This was the most physical that we've been 
manhandled in a long, long time. This was not Notre Dame. This is not the way 
it's going to be. At the end of the game, I made a commitment to the coaches, 
players and Notre Dame. We are going to turn it around and we're going to get 
back on top earlier than people think." Lou's Low Points

COMMENTARY; NOW . . . INTRODUCING THE NEW YORK BENGALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For three straight games, the New York Jets have been one of the worst teams 
in football. 
</P>
<P>
 They have not tackled anybody or covered anybody on defense, been any more 
precise than a Pop Warner team on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that Johnny Mitchell is the only bungler lately is a riot. Half the 
team has played the same way. Pete Carroll and his offensive coordinator and 
his defensive coordinator have occasionally coached like the rookies they are. 
</P>
<P>
 For three Sundays in a row, the Jets have been the New York Bengals. They have 
been no better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth year of Dick Steinberg's regime, they are not a contender to win 
the Super Bowl or even play in the Super Bowl. The way they are going, they are 
going to be out of the Super Bowl tournament again. The Jets have 11 games left 
and they are going to need to win at least seven to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 They got behind the Browns last Sunday and gave the same patsy performance as 
in the last game of last season, against the Oilers. They looked as lifeless on 
the first Sunday of October as they usually do by the first Sunday of January. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Jets started 2-4 and still had enough in them to make a stand 
in the Giants game, and begin a five-game winning streak that seemed to put 
them in the playoffs. Then the Colts beat them, 9-6, at Giants Stadium, and the 
Jets never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets went down and stayed down. Today, there is another Jets-Colts game at 
Giants Stadium. If the Colts smack the Jets around the way the Dolphins and 
Bears and Browns have, then this will be another season when the Jets can't get 
over .500, which means five seasons in a row of that under Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets' record with Steinberg as boss went to 28-42 after the loss to the 
Browns. It is a winning percentage of .400. They lost four of their last five 
games last season. In the first five this season, they have suddenly lost three 
in a row and looked scared to death every time one started to get away from 
them. Carroll talked Sunday about how the mood of his team seems to fluctuate 
wildly from wins to losses, referring to a "condition caused by being 
unaccustomed to success." 
</P>
<P>
 If Carroll does get this group into the playoffs after all the past failures 
-- and I hope he does -- he will have come back after these three losses to do 
one of the best coaching jobs in football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get in a hole, you gotta learn how to dig yourself out of it," 
linebacker Mo Lewis was saying in the locker room Sunday. "Just because you're 
down seven points in the first quarter doesn't mean you've lost the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Bills, the Jets looked like a team ready to be one of the best in 
the AFC. Last Sunday, it wasn't just half of them looking like bunglers, it was 
all of them as they got into that 0-27 hole against the Browns. It has taken 
them only a month to take this kind of fall. Ronnie Lott was asked how it has 
happened this fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ride's easy when you're not doing the things you're supposed to do," Lott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked him about the leadership he and Boomer Esiason were supposed to 
bring to the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing you get tired of," Lott said, "is people talking about how we're 
supposed to provide a magic formula to win games . . . You have to go out and 
just try to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Lott has put in 14 years and been a Hall of Famer at both cornerback and 
safety, and been called one of the great defensive players of all time. He 
really thought he could finish his career with one more Super Bowl, this time 
as a Jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Lott knows as much about the Super Bowl as any defensive player could ever 
know. It seemed like one of Steinberg's smartest plays, bringing him in at the 
same time he brought Esiason in to run the offense, even though the best days 
of both were clearly gone. 
</P>
<P>
 There was supposed to be enough time left for both of them to make one more 
big game. It seems almost impossible now. Steinberg did not stop with them. He 
kept bringing in players whose best days were gone. He has never drafted a 
great player. He passed up Junior Seau and Cortez Kennedy to go for Blair 
Thomas, and the Jets have paid the price for that ever since. Now the Jets must 
beat the Colts or blow another season. This all happens to Lott much too late 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your frustration goes up because you know you're not going to get too many 
chances," Lott said. He was one of the few Jets in the locker room last Sunday, 
and so a huge crowd of media people had backed him into a corner near his 
locker. He wore a black sweat shirt and a dark, bewildered expression about his 
football team. "For me, this might be my last chance," Ronnie Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another year, maybe Lott could have picked a team up by himself, been the 
combination of leader and star and champion he was with the 49ers. That is too 
much to ask of him now, especially in his current surroundings. It is too much 
to ask of Boomer Esiason. He's still charming and tough, but he is also 
scatter-armed at the age of 33. Carroll said this week that Boomer is the 
player who must lead the Jets out of trouble, but you have to wonder if the 
quarterback has enough left to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Boomer had been in the game (Sunday)," Carroll said, "I would have looked 
him in the eye and told him to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 For one Sunday, Esiason and Lott and the rest of them put it all together 
against the Bills. "We know what the upside is," Carroll said. But the Jets so 
rarely find it. How many times over the last two years have they looked like a 
complete team? There was the Miami game last season in the middle of the 
five-game winning streak. There was the win over the Giants when last season 
was on the line. And there was the Bills game a month ago. The Jets beat the 
Broncos after that, but the Broncos are 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still finding it," Pete Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets lead the league in trying to find themselves, but never in wins, or 
star players, at least players who have been stars in this decade. It seems 
sometimes the Jets have been trying to find themselves for 20 years. Over the 
last 20 games, under Coslet and Carroll, the Jets have looked like a 
championship team, a team to make their fans believe in them, about once a 
month. Over the last three games, the beginning of Carroll has looked an awful 
lot like the end of Coslet. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said he fired Coslet because he wouldn't hire an offensive 
coordinator. If the Jets don't turn things around soon, if they keep playing 
like the New York Bengals, who takes the fall this time?

DAVIS AND DEFENSE LEAD COUGARS, 21-7; PACIFIC 10: INJURIES, 10 SACKS HAMPER 
DUCKS, WHO ARE HELD TO 27 RUSHING YARDS IN 41 CARRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Coach Mike Price could only ponder the irony of quarterback Chad Davis winning 
a game with his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chad Davis transfers from Oklahoma because he doesn't like the option, and so 
he runs the option for a touchdown," Price said Saturday after No. 22 
Washington State wore down Oregon, 21-7, to remain unbeaten in Pacific 10 play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars sacked Duck quarterbacks 10 times and kept the pressure on in the 
first half so Davis and his teammates could win it in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon was hampered by injuries to its starting quarterback and a standout 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 After a defensive battle in the first half, Davis came back in the second to 
run 27 yards for a touchdown and hit Eric Moore on a three-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We scored two touchdowns and we put together a real nice drive" in the fourth 
quarter, Price said. "We did try to force the ball deep a little more than we 
have, but we got back to what the defense gave us in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State, 4-1 overall and 2-0 in the Pac-10, held Oregon (3-3, 1-1) to 
70 yards passing and allowed only 27 yards rushing in 41 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State gained 279 yards, including 165 from Davis, who completed 13 
of 29 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their defense is very good," Oregon Coach Rich Brooks said. "It got a 
real assist with our injuries in the offensive line and injuries to our best 
receiver (Cristin McLemore) . . . and the quarterback who had taken all the 
snaps." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon senior quarterback Danny O'Neil, the starter until sidelined for two 
games by an infection on his passing hand, was pressed into action when his 
replacement, Tony Graziani, sprained his left ankle in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis put the Cougars ahead for good at the end of the third quarter, running 
27 yards for a score after converting a third-and-17 situation.

KAUFMAN'S 254 YARDS RESCUE WASHINGTON; NONCONFERENCE: IN SURPRISINGLY CLOSE 
GAME, HUSKIES DEFEAT SAN JOSE STATE, 34-20. 
</P>

<P>
 In an otherwise unimpressive showing for Washington, Napoleon Kaufman rushed 
for a career-high 254 yards and three touchdowns in 27 carries to lead the 
12th-ranked Huskies to a 34-20 victory over San Jose State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most yards rushing in a game by a Washington running back since 
Hugh McElhenny ran for 296 yards against Washington State in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington (4-1), a 42-point favorite, needed Kaufman's performance to beat 
the Spartans (1-5). 
</P>
<P>
 "He just took the game and won it for us," Washington Coach Jim Lambright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman scored on a 91-yard run on the Huskies' first offensive play of the 
day with 49 seconds gone. He put the surprisingly close game out of reach with 
a 76-yard touchdown run with 6:07 left. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose State, shut out by California, 55-0, last week, battled the Huskies 
to a 14-14 halftime standoff and closed to within 27-20 on Joe Nedney's 36-yard 
field goal with 7:01 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman recorded his third 200-yard rushing game of the year and fourth of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 His previous best rushing day was 227 yards against UCLA last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning their fourth in a row after a season-opening loss to USC, the 
Huskies needed almost three quarters to finally go ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the season, San Jose State gave up 54 points to Baylor and 51 to 
Stanford. Napoleon Kaufman's Rushing Statistics 05,14,06,05,05,04 Opponent Car.

FEEL-GOOD VICTORY FOR TEXAS; NONCONFERENCE: BACKUP QUARTERBACK JAMES BROWN IS 
STAR OF LONGHORNS' 17-10 TRIUMPH OVER OKLAHOMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redshirt freshman quarterback James Brown, starting his first college game 
because of an injury to Shea Morenz, ran for a touchdown and passed for one and 
343-pound noseguard Stonie Clark made a vital fourth-down tackle near the goal 
line in the final minute to preserve No. 15 Texas' 17-10 victory over No. 16 
Oklahoma on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark tackled Oklahoma's James Allen on a reverse at the one with less than a 
minute to play to preserve the victory for Texas (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "You can either be the hero or the goat," Allen said. "I guess I'm the goat 
because I didn't score." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark made the stop after linebacker Robert Reed slowed Allen down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reed did a great job staying at home," Clark said. "He was able to turn the 
guy back inside and that's when I got a hit on him. It's the biggest play I've 
made in my career." 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs, whose team fell to 3-2, said, "Brown was the key to 
the game for Texas. He made some big plays and kept their offense moving. We 
couldn't get the ball away from Texas in the third quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Coach John Mackovic, explaining that the Longhorns couldn't risk further 
injury to Morenz's bad knee, said, "James showed exceptional poise. He allowed 
us to do the things we needed to do on offense. We used our regular offense and 
didn't hold anything back." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said, "I just tried to stay calm. I made one bad mistake when I threw an 
interception, but for the most part I did all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown completed 17 of 22 passes for 148 yards and ran nine times for 51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma worked the ball from its own 20 to the Texas three, where Allen 
failed to elude Clark, who had missed practice this week because of the death 
of a friend. The Sooners started the desperation drive after Phil Dawson, who 
had earlier hit a 22-yard field goal, missed from 48 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown ran for one touchdown and hit freshman tight end Ryan Fitzgerald with a 
two-yard pass for another as Texas overcame a 7-0 halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant Westbrook's interception of Allen's pass positioned Texas for Brown's 
touchdown pass to Fitzgerald, putting Texas ahead, 17-7, with 13:05 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Morenz, who passed for 270 yards and three touchdowns against Colorado in a 
34-31 loss last week, was held out of action because of strained ligaments in 
his left knee.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; ILLINOIS DOMINATES AT OHIO STATE, AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Illinois players left Ohio Stadium with a 24-10 victory over 
17th-ranked Ohio State Saturday, they yelled, "This is our home." 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth consecutive time, it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Jasper Strong caught a 49-yard touchdown pass from Johnny Johnson on the last 
play of the third quarter to give Illinois the lead for good in winning for the 
fourth time in a row at Ohio Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since Illinois won its sixth in a row at Columbus in 1929 has a team won 
more than three consecutive games on Ohio State's home field. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State Coach John Cooper, whose job security might be a little shakier 
because of the loss, said Illinois deserved to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "They completely dominated us in the fourth quarter, converting third down 
after third down after third down," Cooper said. "We knew going in they had a 
good defensive team. They're as good as advertised." 
</P>
<P>
 During a conference call earlier in the week, Illinois linebacker Dana Howard 
guaranteed a victory. He did his part Saturday with 14 tackles, including two 
sacks, and also intercepted a pass deep in Illinois' territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They voted me captain and last Monday I said what I thought they wanted me to 
say," Howard said. "The team backed me up today. It's a team game and a team 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois, 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the Big Ten, came into the game leading the 
nation in total defense, allowing just 180 yards and eight points a game. Ohio 
State (4-2, 1-1) piled up 363 yards, but quarterback Bob Hoying threw three 
interceptions and the Illini came up with the big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 24 Wisconsin 46, Northwestern 14 -- Terrell Fletcher carried 26 times for 
a career-high 186 yards and scored three touchdowns as the Badgers rallied 
behind their relentless rushing attack to defeat the Wildcats (1-3-1, 0-2) at 
Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Badgers (3-2, 2-1) trailed, 14-10, at halftime but Fletcher took over. 
Teammate Brent Moss, who gained 145 yards in 19 carries for his 16th 
consecutive game of more than 100 yards, had to leave the game late in the 
third quarter because of a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Brent went down I had to make some things happen," Fletcher said. "I 
felt I could always do it and then I got the chance in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher had 133 of his 186 yards in the second half, with 80 coming after 
Moss was sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh time in their careers and third time this season that Moss 
and Fletcher had rushed for 100 yards in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
 When Moss went down, Fletcher was there to comfort him. "Brent and I are good 
friends," he said. "He was screaming. We thought it was his knee and we felt 
better because it was just his ankle." 
</P>
<P>
 Moss said he's not sure if he can play next Saturday against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue 49, Minnesota 37 -- Mike Alstott rushed for a career-high 183 yards and 
scored four touchdowns, and Burt Thornton had nine receptions for 166 yards to 
lead the Boilermakers at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue came from behind three times before breaking a 35-35 deadlock on a 
48-yard run by Alstott, who also scored on runs of 38, 11 and two yards. With 
the victory, Purdue (4-1, 2-0) matches its best start since 1984 and avenged 
last season's 59-56 loss to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota (2-4, 0-3) was led by Chris Dawkins, who had a career-high 234 yards 
in 31 carries, including scoring runs of 47 and seven yards, as the two teams 
produced 1,165 yards.

MICHIGAN'S VICTORY FIT FOR A FORMER PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the kind of game an old lineman like Gerald R. Ford could love. And it 
was payback time for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 38th President looking on Saturday, Michigan used the relentless 
running of Tyrone Wheatley and Tshimanga Biakabutuka to grind out a 40-20 
victory over Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 7 Wolverines, 4-1 overall and 2-0 in the Big Ten, retired Ford's No. 
48 jersey during halftime ceremonies. He was a Michigan center 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offensive linemen didn't like to hear about the great Michigan State 
linemen all the time," Michigan Coach Gary Moeller said. "They like to be 
recognized as well. I think they're starting to come together, and I like that. 
But we have to keep improving in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan, which overcame an early 6-3 deficit, scored on seven consecutive 
possessions against the Spartans (2-3, 1-1). The Wolverines finished with 349 
rushing yards while holding the Spartans to only 17 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I didn't think we could do that," Moeller said. "On defense, we knew that 
had to be our focus. The strength of that offense is the ability to run the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the 26th consecutive time the winner of the ground war has won the 
game between the interstate rivals. The Spartans had a 131-33 edge last year in 
a 17-7 upset at East Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a good team and they brought it to us," Michigan State Coach George 
Perles said.

NO. 2 NEBRASKA USES NO. 3 QUARTERBACK; BIG EIGHT: TURMAN COMES IN AFTER 
BERRINGER IS SIDELINED. PHILLIPS HAS BIG GAME IN 32-3 VICTORY.

 Nebraska's No. 1 runner made a big winner out of Nebraska's No. 3 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Lawrence Phillips ran for 221 yards in 33 carries and scored three 
times to lead the Cornhuskers to a 32-3 victory over Oklahoma State on Saturday 
in the Big Eight opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, from Baldwin Park High, came through in the second half when 
Nebraska (6-0) turned to third-string quarterback Matt Turman. 
</P>
<P>
 Brook Berringer, pressed into the starting job last week when Tommie Frazier 
was hospitalized with a second blood clot, sat out the second half when an 
X-ray revealed further damage to the lung that was partially collapsed last 
week against Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little shock at halftime to get a call from student health to say 
Brook couldn't play," Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said. "We're going to go by 
what the doctors say. That's what we always do around here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matt Turman went in and did well under the circumstances. I thought the 
offensive line picked up the pace and did a good job. He wasn't excited. He 
went out there and performed." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska officials said Berringer, who was wearing a flak jacket, wasn't in 
pain but was held out as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 Turman, a sophomore walk-on, drove Nebraska to two touchdowns in its first 
three possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I played pretty well. We scored three touchdowns the second half," 
Turman said. "I think I showed them I'm a pretty tough guy and I can lead the 
team to victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State Coach Pat Jones said, "With No. 11 (Turman) in there, it became 
an inside run drill. They just lined up and whipped us." Lawrence Phillips'

SMITH LEADS INDIANA, IOWA'S TROUBLES MOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alex Smith rushed for 232 yards and a touchdown against Iowa's last-place 
rushing defense to lead Indiana to a 27-20 victory in a Big Ten game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa, 2-4 overall and 0-3 in the Big Ten, lost its fourth consecutive game as 
well as quarterback Ryan Driscoll, who suffered a broken right collarbone 12 
seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosiers (5-1, 2-1) overcame three first-half interceptions off John Paci, 
who entered the game with no interceptions in 70 throws, and beat Iowa for the 
second consecutive year but for only the third time in the last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the Big 10's No. 2 rusher, was held to a combined 87 yards the past two 
weeks but took advantage of an Iowa defense that allows an average of 218 yards 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawkeyes, who gave up 322 yards to the Hoosiers, surrendered 182 yards 
rushing to Tyrone Wheatley in last week's 29-14 loss to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was a workhorse, with 43 carries, the most by an opponent at Kinnick 
Stadium. He had 13 carries during a 20-play, 75-yard drive that chewed up 11:16 
of the third quarter and ended with Paci's one-yard touchdown plunge that gave 
Indiana a 21-7 edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana was successful on five third-down conversions during the drive and 
fooled the Hawkeyes on fourth and two from the Iowa 27. Holder Chad Scott took 
the snap on a fake field goal and gained five yards to keep the march alive.

FINALLY, COLORADO GETS A ROUTINE WIN; BIG EIGHT: BUFFALOES SCORE 21 POINTS IN 
FIRST QUARTER AND COAST PAST MISSOURI, 38-23. 
</P>

<P>
 For a change, Colorado didn't need last-play heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-ranked Buffaloes followed dramatic, last-play victories over 
Michigan and Texas with a by-the-numbers 38-23 victory over Missouri on 
Saturday that extended their winning streak to nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we were sharp on either side of the ball," Coach Bill McCartney 
said. "Our guys had an emotional run." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Colorado defeated Texas, 34-31, on a 24-yard field goal by Neil 
Voskeritchian, and the previous week the Buffaloes defeated Michigan, 27-26, on 
a 64-yard Hail Mary pass from Kordell Stewart to Michael Westbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Colorado (5-0) scored 21 points in the first quarter and then 
coasted in winning its sixth consecutive Big Eight opener and completing a 
three-for-three road swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri Coach Larry Smith said, "It wasn't a victory, but it was the best 
four quarters of football we played this year. A loss is nothing to be proud 
of, but we can be happy about the way we played." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart passed for 228 yards and two touchdowns and Rashaan Salaam ran for 166 
yards in 28 carries and two touchdowns, even though both sat out most of the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart completed his first seven passes and was 16 of 21 with two touchdowns. 
Salaam, the nation's leading rusher, had an effective follow-up to his 317-yard 
performance against Texas. Salaam scored twice on one-yard runs and also had 
carries of 46, 32 and 17 yards and a pass reception for 41. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't just be up for the big games, we've also got to get up for the 
little games," Salaam said. Rashaan Salaam's Rushing Statistics

BARKER GOES OUT, TIDE HANGS ON TO WIN, 14-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jay Barker, who threw for a career-high 396 yards the previous week in a 
comeback victory over Georgia, injured his right shoulder early in the second 
half against Southern Mississippi, and the Crimson Tide offense vanished 
without its senior quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Alabama, Barker left with his team ahead and the 11th-ranked 
Tide held on for a 14-6 nonconference victory -- even though Southern Miss had 
a commanding 371-194 advantage in total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 With Brian Burgdorf at the controls, Alabama (6-0) managed only two first 
downs, and one of those came on a roughing-the-passer penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hadn't played Brian enough," Coach Gene Stallings said. "Brian is a good 
quarterback. He won the most valuable player in the Gator Bowl" last season 
when Barker was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "But practicing and playing are two different things. You go in cold, it makes 
a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgdorf completed only two of seven passes for 11 yards. He was blitzed 
constantly and sacked twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker was nine of 14 for 116 yards when he was hit hard on his throwing 
shoulder after getting off a pass on the fifth play of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it wasn't as bad as the Ole Miss game," said Barker, referring to a 
shoulder injury that kept him out of two games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker said he hopes to be ready next Saturday when Alabama plays at 
Tennessee.

 Terry Dean threw his 18th touchdown pass of the season and Anthone Lott scored 
on an 88-yard interception return as No. 1 Florida tuned up for next week's 
showdown against No. 9 Auburn with a 42-18 victory over Louisiana State on 
Saturday in a Southeastern Conference game at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Taylor rushed for 136 yards and scored on runs of 16 and two yards for 
Florida, 5-0 overall and 4-0 in the SEC. The Gators also got three field goals 
from Judd Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU (1-4, 1-3) had limited success offensively before becoming the first team 
to score on the Gators in the second half when Jermaine Sharp ran two yards for 
a third quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean completed 20 of 38 passes for 217 yards. He threw a five-yard touchdown 
pass to Jack Jackson, who had 10 receptions for 99 yards, and also scored on a 
five-yard quarterback bootleg for a 29-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 East Carolina 56, South Carolina 42 -- Marcus Crandell threw for 344 yards and 
four touchdowns, three to Mitchell Galloway, and the Pirates (3-2) held off the 
Gamecocks (4-2) in a nonconference game at Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 East Carolina led, 27-0, in the second quarter, but was ahead by only a 
touchdown when tailback Junior Smith scored on a 54-yard reverse with 1:37 left 
to put the game away. Smith finished with 192 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina's Steve Taneyhill completed 40 of 59 for 451 yards, all school 
records, as the Gamecocks got within seven points three times during the fourth 
quarter. East Carolina responded with a score each time, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandell finished 19 of 28 with three interceptions. Three of his scoring 
throws came during a four-touchdown barrage in less than five minutes of the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback E. McDaniel returned a tipped pass 46 yards for a touchdown to make 
it 42-28 and Crandell hit Galloway on a 64-yard pass play touchdown to give the 
Pirates a 49-35 lead with 4:20 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee 38, Arkansas 21 -- James (Little Man) Stewart and Mose Phillips each 
scored twice and the Volunteers took advantage of six Razorback fumbles for a 
SEC victory at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee (3-3, 2-2) got touchdown passes of 23 and 27 yards from Peyton 
Manning, one each to Stewart and Phillips, and linebacker Tyrone Hines returned 
a fumble for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vols converted three Arkansas fumbles into two touchdowns and a field 
goal, but gave three of them back with turnovers of their own -- two in the 
Arkansas end zone and one at the Razorbacks' four yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas (2-4, 1-3) got 128 yards from Oscar Malone and a big performance from 
reserve quarterback Robert Reed, who completed seven of 11 passes for 159 yards 
and an 82-yard touchdown to Carl Johnson, the third-longest scoring pass in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia 40, Clemson 14 -- Eric Zeier passed for 328 yards and two touchdowns 
to break the SEC career total offense record, then sat out the final quarter 
after the Bulldogs (4-2) built a 23-0 halftime lead in a nonconference game at 
Athens, Ga. Georgia was never seriously challenged by Clemson (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
 The rivals were meeting for the final time in Sanford Stadium under a contract 
that ends with next season's game at Clemson. The Tigers fell to 2-19 in 
Georgia's stadium. Georgia is dropping the Tigers from the schedule because of 
the SEC's mandatory eight-game league schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier completed 24 of 40 passes and added 14 yards rushing to end the day with 
9,325 career yards. Florida's Shane Matthews held the old SEC record of 9,241 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt 34, Cincinnati 24 -- Ronnie Gordon scored two of his three 
touchdowns in the final 3:09 to rally the Commodores in a nonconference game at 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati (0-4-1) stunned the Commodores with Paul Blackwood's 23-yard 
touchdown run for a 24-20 lead with 5:54 to play. But Gordon led Vanderbilt 
(2-3) out of a three-game losing streak by working the option perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon went 42 yards on an option to set up his two-yard touchdown run with 
3:09 to play. After Jay Stallworth sacked Eric Vibberts and forced a fumble, 
Gordon scored on a six-yard run to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt's Eric Lewis rushed for 134 yards in 20 carries.

 Louisville linebacker Alan Campos, a junior from Miami, set up a touchdown 
with his first fumble recovery in the fourth quarter, then ran 20 yards with 
his second as Louisville upset 18th-ranked North Carolina State, 35-14, 
Saturday in a nonconference game at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos' recoveries killed any chance of a comeback after North Carolina State 
(4-1) fell behind, 21-14.Campos also led Louisville with eight tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Fitzgerald fumbled after catching Geoff Bender's pass at the North 
Carolina State 20, and Campos returned it to the six. Three plays later, 
Anthony Shelman scored from the two to give Louisville (3-2) a 28-14 advantage

 Corey Pullig threw three touchdown passes as No. 10 Texas A&M, best known for 
its menacing ground game, defeated Houston, 38-7, in a Southwest Conference 
game Saturday at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came in to prove that they could throw the football," Houston Coach Kim 
Helton said. "They wanted to work on their passing game and they were 
successful. Some of their receivers made more plays than I'd have wanted them 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies (5-0, 2-0) put aside their running game and went ahead, 17-0, on 
Pullig's touchdown passes of 36 yards to Ryan Mathews and five yards to Chris 
Sanders and a 37-yard field goal by Kyle Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M won its 24th consecutive SWC game, the longest conference streak in 
the nation. The Aggies also have the longest home streak in the nation at 23 
victories in a row. The Aggies' defense, ranked seventh nationally, didn't 
allow Houston (0-5, 0-1) across midfield until midway in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor 44, Southern Methodist 10 -- Brandell Jackson and Clifton Rubin led an 
overpowering rushing attack and Scotty Lewis led a stingy defense for the Bears 
at Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor (5-1, 2-0) didn't do anything flashy, mostly running off tackle as the 
Bears rushed for 331 yards to defeat SMU (1-5, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, a senior defensive end, finished with eight tackles, including seven 
unassisted stops, and 14 yards in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice 24, Texas Tech 21 -- Josh LaRocca threw two touchdown passes to Ed 
Howard, the latter an 11-yarder that completed a 10-point fourth quarter 
comeback and rallied the Owls (2-2, 1-0) over the Red Raiders (2-4, 1-2) at 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Tech capitalized on four Rice turnovers to take a 21-14 lead in the fourth 
quarter before Rice battled back in the final 5:34. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Stanley returned an interception 23 yards to the Tech 25 to set up a 
22-yard field goal by Matt Huelsman, then Tech fumbled the ensuing kickoff with 
Rice's Mike Jones recovering at the 15, setting up the winning touchdown pass 
to Howard.

BAKER'S KICK LIFTS ARIZONA STATE, 36-35; PACIFIC 10: STANFORD LOSES ON 38-YARD 
FIELD GOAL WITH SIX SECONDS LEFT DESPITE STENSTROM'S RECORD-SURPASSING GAME.

 Jon Baker kicked a 38-yard field goal with six seconds left to lift Arizona 
State past Stanford, 36-35, on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, 1-3-1, 0-2 in the Pacific 10, used a 98-yard drive and an 
interception to score 13 points in the fourth quarter to get a 35-27 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arizona State (2-3, 2-1) drove 80 yards in eight plays to cut the lead to 
35-33 on Ryan Wood's 1-yard run with 9:27 left. The Sun Devils then held Steve 
Stenstrom, who became the Pac-10 career passing leader, to one first down on 
the next series. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State got the ball on its 22 with 5:20 left and Jake Plummer 
engineered a 16-play march to Baker's kick, with the Devils converting three 
times on fourth down. Chris Hopkins got two yards on a fourth and two, Plummer 
dived for the marker on fourth and 12 then connected with Clyde McCoy on a 
16-yard pass on fourth and 11 with 1:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
 After a false start penalty, Plummer hit Keith Poole with a 25-yard completion 
to put the ball on the Cardinal 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Plummer completed 23 of 39 passes for 274 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom, who passed Erik Wilhelm on the Pac-10's career passing yards list, 
was 28 of 36 for 313 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought the Cardinal from a 20-8 halftime deficit to a 35-27 lead with 
12:27 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's Adam Salina got the first of his three touchdowns on a three-yard 
run with 13:21 left in the third period, but Arizona State came back later in 
the quarter when freshman Zack Romero got his first career reception, a 
nine-yard touchdown pass from Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom completed 10 passes in a row at one stretch, leading Stanford on 
scoring drives of 80 and 98 yards for a 28-27 lead 36 seconds into the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils got on the board first with Baker's 29-yard field goal with 
eight minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State later drove to the Cardinal 17 but Terry Battle fumbled and 
Kwame Ellis recovered at the Stanford 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal then drove to the Arizona State 48 when Kendall Rhyne forced 
Stenstrom to fumble. Harlen Rashada picked up the ball and ran 37 yards for the 
first touchdown of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford struck back when Damon Dunn returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards 
for the first Cardinal kickoff return touchdown in six years. It tied a 
44-year-old school record. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker added a 41-yard field goal with 6:08 left in the half. But the Sun 
Devils then put together a 65-yard drive, capped by Plummer's 11-yard pass to 
Hopkins for the touchdown.

COLORADO STATE STUNS NO. 6 ARIZONA, 21-16; NONCONFERENCE: MORAN'S 77-YARD 
FUMBLE-RETURN TOUCHDOWN HELPS RAMS IMPROVE TO 6-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sean Moran's 77-yard fumble return highlighted a standout defensive effort 
that carried No. 23 Colorado State to a 21-16 victory over No. 6 Arizona on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthoney Hill passed for 251 yards and threw two touchdown passes to tight end 
Jason Shull as Colorado State (6-0) beat the Wildcats (4-1), who got 224 
rushing yards from Ontiwaun Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Moran's fumble return, longest in Colorado State history, and two fourth-down 
stops were keys for the Rams, who never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
 With Colorado State leading, 14-6, in the third quarter, Arizona drove to the 
Rams' 11. Quarterback Dan White was hit on a blitz by linebacker Garrett Sand 
and fumbled to Moran, who raced to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' previous longest fumble return for a touchdown was 55 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's Steve McLaughlin kicked a 42-yard field goal, his third of the game, 
to make it 21-9. Then Arizona drove 68 yards, with Carter contributing a 
20-yard run, and White found Richard Dice on a six-yard touchdown pass with 
7:02 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rams were forced to punt, Arizona had another chance, but White's 
pass was intercepted by Greg Myers with 2:26 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats got the ball again with 48 seconds left but couldn't move past 
midfield. White threw four incompletions. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State added to a 7-6 halftime lead by scoring on its opening drive of 
the third quarter. Hill lobbed a 37-yard touchdown pass to Shull over Arizona's 
drawn-in secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill ended an 81-yard first quarter drive with a 10-yard pass to Shull. 
</P>
<P>
 With Carter carrying the load, Arizona moved the ball against the Rams, 
rushing 54 times for 240 yards. But except for Dice's late touchdown, the 
Wildcats had to settle for McLaughlin's field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter carried 36 times and caught eight passes for another 56 yards, but he 
couldn't pick up a crucial fourth and two at the Rams' 32 with 10:09 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona also had been forced to turn the ball over on downs at midfield late 
in the first quarter when White's dive failed to get him a needed yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State rang up 164 yards in the first quarter, 150 on Hill's passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona dominated in the second quarter but got only McLaughlin's 47- and 
44-yard field goals. The Wildcats were unable to convert a fumble recovery and 
interception before halftime.

 The United States team of Tom Kite, Curtis Strange and Fred Couples scored a 
3-0 victory over New Zealand on Saturday at St. Andrews, Scotland, to lift the 
Americans into the Dunhill Cup semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending champion Americans flirted with elimination and got much-needed 
help from an unknown Japanese golfer, Yoshinori Mizumaki, who shot an 
eight-under-par 64 to prevent the Irish from edging the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 Had it lost one match Saturday, the U.S. would have finished tied for the 
Group One lead with Ireland. The Irish team would then have advanced because of 
its 2-1 victory over the Americans in head-to-head play Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team will face England, which won all nine of its matches in the 
first three rounds, in one semifinal. South Africa will play surprising Canada 
in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty scary," said Kite, whose 69 beat Grant Waite by two. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange also finished with a 69 for a one-shot victory. Couples, who had blown 
an early three-stroke lead, beat Greg Turner by two with an even-par 72. 
Zimbabwe, led by PGA and British Open titlist Nick Price, beat Sweden, 2-1, 
tying Canada and making the Canadians' 2-1 victory in their head-to-head 
meeting on Friday the deciding factor. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa advanced by beating host nation Scotland, 2-1. England swept 
Australia, 3-0. 
</P>

<P>
 Craig Stadler and Rick Fehr, who has gone eight years since his only victory 
on the PGA Tour, shared the Disney Classic lead after the third round at Lake 
Buena Vista, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadler finished the day with a five-under 67 and a three-round 201 total. 
Fehr birdied three of his final four holes to shoot a four-under 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen players were within five shots of the leaders. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Gary Player played bogey-free golf in shooting a four-under-par 68 to share 
the lead with three others after the second round of the $600,000 Transamerica 
Senior Golf Championship at Napa, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Player, Butch Baird, Tommy Aycock and Jay Sigel are at eight-under 136. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tiger Woods regained his swing after getting a tip from a golf writer, and his 
five-under-par 67 boosted the U.S. team back into the lead of the World Amateur 
Team Championships at La Boulie, France. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. squad finished the third round with a 16-under 629 total, one better 
than a combined team from Great Britain and Ireland and four better than 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks to a tip from a golf writer that my hip turn was too big, my swing 
came good today," said Woods, who had eight birdies. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Doyle, a veteran of amateur play for the U.S., shot a 69 and was at 
eight under for three rounds. Todd Demsey shot 71 and John Harris a 72.

SANTA ANITA; SERENA'S SONG ADDS WEST COAST TO LUKASES' WINNING PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four weeks before Breeders' Cup day at Churchill Downs, Wayne Lukas is sitting 
pretty in the 2-year-old division after the rejuvenated barn had a successful 
Saturday in New York and California. 
</P>
<P>
 Timber Country verified his trainer's confidence in the Champagne, but it is 
the Juvenile Fillies where the trainer looks to have a stranglehold. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours after heavily favored Flanders' 21-length victory in the Frizette, 
Serena's Song surprised 1-2 choice Call Now in the $200,000 Oak Leaf Stakes at 
Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 After looking like a worn-out filly in two starts at Del Mar, including a 9 
3/4-length defeat by Call Now in the Debutante, Serena's Song responded to the 
five weeks between races and the new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly able to get in front of the favorite early, the daughter of Rahy 
simply improved her position and went on to win by nearly three lengths in 1:41 
4/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 In providing Corey Nakatani with his fourth victory of the day, Serena's Song, 
the 7-2 second choice, gave Lukas his seventh Oak Leaf victory, but first since 
One Of A Klein in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I had ridden her, but I had been working her in the 
mornings and she had been working unbelievably since she got back from Del 
Mar," Nakatani said. "I think they might have changed the bridle on her, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas' son, Jeff, saddled Serena's Song in his father's absence and he said 
the extra distance also helped.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had a different racetrack and there was more distance involved," Jeff 
Lukas said. "The filly performed very well. She went about her business and the 
next step will be the Breeders' Cup. We're looking forward to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Call Now, who won the Debutante by 4 1/2 lengths, finished 4 1/2 lengths ahead 
of 18-1 shot Mama Mucci in losing for the second time in four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really tried hard," jockey Alex Solis said. "The other filly just had 
more experience than mine. I haven't lost any faith in her. Actually, my faith 
in her got stronger with this race. I wondered how she would relax going long, 
and she relaxed very well. I'm sorry we lost, but it's not the Breeders' Cup 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sandpit, a multiple-stakes winner in Brazil making his third start in this 
country, is the 2-1 morning-line favorite against six rivals in the $300,000 
Oak Tree Invitational, the first of two stakes races on today's card. 
</P>
<P>
 Second behind Tertian in his American debut, Sandpit won by five in the Live 
The Dream Handicap at Del Mar, but he will be facing tougher opponents in the 1 
1/2-mile Invitational, which was won last year by eventual horse of the year 
Kotashaan. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Flotilla, the beaten favorite in the Del Mar Handicap, is the 5-2 second 
choice. Gary Stevens will again ride for trainer Jenine Sahadi. Approach The 
Bench, beaten by a nose in the Del Mar Handicap and winner of the Eddie Read 
before that, Cafe Milano, Run Softly, Navire and Regency round out the field. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Tree will offer the $200,000 Norfolk Stakes for the 25th time today and 
the field might be the weakest in the history of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race won by the likes of Flying Paster, Stalwart, Roving Boy, Snow Chief, 
Grand Canyon, Best Pal and Betrando over the years, Desert Mirage, a maiden, is 
the 3-1 second choice on the morning line in the field of nine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Richard Mulhall-trained entry of Supremo, second in the Del Mar Futurity, 
and Strong Ally, another maiden, is the 4-5 favorite in the 1 1/16-mile race, 
which was downgraded to a Grade II race last year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to ride Alex The Great and Slick Twist in two of the Breeders' Cup 
Preview races Saturday at Belmont Park, jockey Pat Valenzuela took off both 
mounts because of food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who also took off his mounts Friday at Santa Anita, called Belmont 
Park steward John Joyce from a local hotel and said he was "very ill" and would 
be unable to ride. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-day carryover in the Pick Six, there was one winning ticket 
Saturday at Oak Tree and it was worth $503,343.80 to an unidentified bettor. 
There were no winning favorites in races 4-9 and the biggest surprise was 
provided by Bolger's Lead, who paid $34 under Laffit Pincay Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pick Six payoff was not the largest in Oak Tree history, however. A single 
winning ticket was worth $609,010 on Oct. 13, 1990.

 Colonial Affair took the lead in the early stretch and won the Jockey Club 
Gold Cup by two lengths over favored Devil His Due on Breeders' Cup Preview Day 
at Belmont Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland-based Tabasco Cat, the Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner, finished 
fourth behind Flag Down. Go For Gin, the Kentucky Derby winner, vied for the 
early lead but finished last for his fifth consecutive loss. He and Tabasco Cat 
were the only 3-year-olds in the nine-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonial Affair, who won the Belmont Stakes last year, had finished third, 6 
1/2 lengths behind Holy Bull, in the 1 1/8-mile Woodward at Belmont on Sept. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holy Bull is the best horse I've seen this year in the States," said Jose 
Santos, Colonial Affair's jockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonial Affair's victory in the 1 1/4-mile Gold Cup was the second stakes 
victory of the day for Santos. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Day, Tabasco Cat's rider, won three stakes, including the stakes for 
2-year-old males and juvenile fillies, on Wayne Lukas-trained horses. The filly 
Flanders scored a 21-length victory over three rivals in the 1 1/16-mile 
Frizette and Timber Country won the 1 1/16-mile Moet Champagne for juvenile 
males by a half-length over Sierra Diablo. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Shug McGaughey, who won five of six stakes on Breeders' Cup Preview 
Day last year, won the 1 1/8-mile Beldame for fillies and mares with the 
3-year-old Heavenly Prize, ridden by Day. But Lure was nipped at the wire by 
Nijinsky's Gold in the one-mile Kelso Handicap on the grass. Nijinsky's Gold 
was Santos' other winner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1 1/2-mile Turf Classic, France-based Tikkanen, ridden by Cash 
Asmussen, overtook Vaudeville and won his U.S. debut by a neck.

 Colonial Affair covered 1 1/4 miles in 2:02 in winning the $750,000 Gold Cup 
and paid $12.80, $5.60 and $3.60. Devil His Due returned $2.80 and $2.20 and 
Flag Down paid $4.60.

 Flanders, who paid $2.60, won in 1:43 4/5, a fifth of second faster than

 Heavenly Prize remained a major contender for 3-year-old honors by winning the

 Chrysalis House, an 11-1 shot, beat Southland-based Unfinished Symph by a head 
to win the $150,000 Hawthorne Derby at Hawthorne in Cicero, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Mark Guidry, Chrysalis House covered the 1 1/8 miles in 1:51 4/5 
over a yielding turf course. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss marked the third consecutive second-place finish for favored 
Unfinished Symph, who moved prematurely to the lead, drew clear in the stretch, 
then was caught at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfinished Symph, the Will Rogers and Cinema Handicap winner, had lost the La 
Jolla Handicap by a nose, then was beaten by a half-length by Ocean Crest in 
the Del Mar Derby.

PRINTING BOOK'S CARRY-ON TIP WAS IRRESPONSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Ideas for the Busy Traveler" (Sept. 29), which provided tips to business 
travelers as recommended by Christopher McGinnis in his book "202 Tips Even the 
Best Business Travelers May Not Know," included a small item about how airline 
passengers can sneak carry-on baggage aboard a flight and avoid restrictions 
which the airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration have developed. The 
inclusion of that item was irresponsible on several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 First, on a philosophical level, I find it amazing that The Times would repeat 
advice that tells its readers how to "break the rules." Would you undertake a 
similar effort to advise readers how to avoid having to pay for newspapers by 
pooling their change and taking five Sunday newspapers from the corner stand 
when only paying for one copy? 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the suggestion directly contradicts security measures that airlines 
undertake to protect the safety of airline passengers. Passengers are advised 
not to accept the luggage of strangers, and in fact, international passengers 
are specifically asked if they are carrying on the luggage of another 
passenger, or if any other person helped in the packing of checked luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 While we may never know the factual details, there is some speculation that 
the tragic crash of Pan Am Flight 103 was the result of a passenger carrying on 
an item for another passenger that might have contained the bomb that brought 
down the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not The Times got this information from another source, I believe 
you have an obligation to provide responsible information to your readers and 
the traveling public. Mr. McGinnis has backed away from this recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case there is still any confusion, passengers should never agree to 
carry on or check luggage of strangers.

ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES, REFORM LOWERED RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article on the reduction in workers' compensation premiums article 
("State to Slash Base Rate for Workers' Comp by a Record 16%," Sept. 21) gives 
readers the impression that the Department of Insurance, by ordering a 
reduction, is the force behind workers' comp reform. Actually, the insurance 
commissioner simply was reacting to market pressures triggered by reform and 
anti-fraud initiatives enacted by Gov. Wilson and the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the governor signed anti-fraud legislation that provided tougher 
penalties and dedicated funding for the insurance commissioner and local 
prosecutors to investigate workers' comp fraud. Partly as a result, the loss 
ratio, or percentage of premium paid out in benefits, plummeted from 83% in 
1991 to 51% in 1993. A low loss ratio indicates that rates are too high and 
compels the insurance commissioner to adjust the minimum rate downward. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the governor and the Legislature enacted systematic reforms to 
further reduce costs. For instance, the impossible-to-enforce "10% stress" 
standard was scrapped and post-termination claims were severely restricted. 
Since reform, stress claims filed in Los Angeles have dropped 47%. The reforms 
also capped vocational rehabilitation expenses and dramatically reduced 
medical-legal costs. As a result of the medical-legal changes, Rockwell 
International experienced a 65% reduction in year-to-year quarterly 
medical-legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, these anti-fraud activities and reforms created the market forces 
lowering rates. In January, the system of open competition will lower rates 
further for most employers.  
</P>
<P>
 While the insurance commissioner says he reduced rates to set the stage for 
competition, The Times should have noted that the insurance commissioner 
vehemently opposed repealing the minimum-rate law which he now denounces. He 
preferred the current system of minimum rates and guaranteed profits for 
insurers.

PIECE ON ENVIRONMENTAL INDUSTRY MISLED READERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was with a great sense of disappointment and frustration that I and many 
other members of the California environmental industry read the article "Green 
Tape: Environmental Technology's Reality Falls Short of Hype" (Sept. 20). The 
article left readers with the misimpression that the California environmental 
technology industry is not a healthy component of our state's economy and that 
the state government is not doing anything to assist the industry.Nothing could 
be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 California's environmental industry is made up of over 10,000 companies that 
employ approximately 180,000 Californians and generate close to $20 billion in 
annual revenues. The industry is the acknowledged worldwide leader in providing 
state-of-the-art environmental solutions in domestic and foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a severe recession that has affected all sectors of California's 
economy, the environmental industry continues to be a vibrant and positive 
contributor to job creation and export development for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an industry with a varied range of experiences, but one that continues 
to grow and mature, and that represents a critical component of California's 
new economy.

INSURANCE MERGER CREATES CURIOUS UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While many 20th Century Insurance Co. employees and customers may be breathing 
a sigh of relief over the entrance of a white knight in the form of American 
International Insurance Group ("$26-Million Rescue Deal Would Revive 20th 
Century," Sept. 28), the fact is that such a marriage is at least curious. It 
does not appear to be one where, in the long range, the sum will be either 
equal to or greater than its parts. 
</P>
<P>
 AIG is a multinational commercial insurance giant that writes insurance 
through independent agents and brokers, to whom they pay significant 
commissions. Twentieth, on the other hand, is a direct marketer, relying mainly 
on advertising, mail and telephone solicitation and word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth's long-term profit picture would be greatly affected if they were 
paying commission annually on every policy. Profits aside, the most synergistic 
and symbiotic relationship for two carriers so positioned would be to share 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that there has never been any large-scale success where direct 
writing and independent agents were utilized. The independent agent will do a 
type of field underwriting that would best be described as akin to what the 
marketing department should be doing. In addition, a good commercial risk does 
not make for a good personal auto risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term, I do not see this as a successful combination. What 20th needs is 
to combine with a direct writer, with marketing structure of a similar nature.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: A PLACE OF SOLACE FROM THE HORROR OF RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She sat on the end of the riser, facing 500 people under an immense white 
garden party tent on the lawn of a fabulous canyon estate. She had a glamorous 
look about her -- she wore a short creamy suit with clunky boots, and her short 
hair was crimped and oiled and combed straight back off a face that was 
luminous -- angelic even.  
</P>
<P>
 She had that Beverly Hills aura: gorgeous, privileged, pampered. A stranger, 
you would guess, to suffering of any magnitude greater than a broken nail. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's the thing about rape. The scars are rarely obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 We had gathered under the tent last week to celebrate the 20th anniversary of 
the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center, and to honor all the women brave enough 
to break their silence in an effort to make a difference. Gail Abarbanel, the 
social worker who founded the center at Santa Monica Hospital and serves as its 
executive director, sat with the young woman and four others who had come to 
testify to the help and healing they and their families received from the 
center, a pioneer in the field of rape treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Calmly, devoid of emotion, Abarbanel told their stories. This is what happened 
to the young woman, who asked not to be named: 
</P>
<P>
 (She) came to America when she was 7. Her father was a movie producer who had 
brought the family here from Italy. They attended the best schools and lived in 
increasingly beautiful homes. But (her) father was difficult. He collected guns 
and used them to intimidate the children and their mother. When she was 12, her 
father decided her nanny wasn't needed anymore. He began to enter her room at 
night and that was the end of her childhood. By age 13, he was regularly raping 
her at least three times a week. The audience -- including Tipper Gore, Abigail 
Van Buren, Quincy Jones, Sherry Lansing, Norman Lear, Marsha Mason and Susan 
Dey, to name but a few -- seemed to be holding its breath, holding back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 (Her) life became a mixture of shame and fear. . . . Her father told her they 
had been lovers in a previous life and that he was preparing her so that when 
she had a boyfriend or husband she would know what to do. But there were no 
boyfriends. (She) was never allowed to date. She was allowed no activities 
outside the home. She had become her father's captive. As (she) neared the end 
of high school, she began to dream of escape. She knew that if she did not 
leave the house now, she would be there forever. She packed her bags and told 
her father she was moving out. He called her a slut and a bitch. And he looked 
at her and said, "Take that whore of a sister with you." When she summoned the 
courage to tell, she found solace at Stuart House, a small, beautifully 
appointed building near the hospital that was a dream of Abarbanel and Aileen 
Adams, the treatment center's legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart House, which opened in 1988, provides free legal, medical and social 
services under one roof for sexually abused children. The young woman did not 
have to tell her story untold times on separate visits to police, prosecutors, 
social workers and therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart House professionals filled the courtroom in 1991 when her father, 
Alexander DeBenedetti, pleaded guilty to two counts of raping a minor and was 
sentenced to 14 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "For that support," said the young woman, now 24, "I love them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There have been many other improvements in the field of rape treatment and 
prosecution since Abarbanel persuaded hospital officials that they needed to 
give special care to rape victims: 
</P>
<P>
 In California (and most other states), the sexual histories of victims are no 
longer allowed in testimony, judges are no longer required to instruct juries 
that rape charges are "easily made and hard to defend against, so weigh the 
words of this woman with caution," victims must no longer prove they tried to 
fight off their attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the center produced a film on campus rape that is shown nationwide, 
and Abarbanel and Adams have authored a handbook about campus sexual assault 
that has been described by some college administrators as their bible. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of difference two decades makes. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changes, women are still made to feel they have brought rape upon 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, at the sentencing of a rapist in Santa Monica Superior Court, as the 
judge tried to explain why he was sentencing the man to less than the maximum 
term allowed under the law, he lectured the victim, a 26-year-old 
administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 She had dated her assailant for a few weeks before he came to her apartment 
one night, tied her up, whipped her with belts, held a knife to her breast, 
photographed her and raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of using the opportunity to lecture Antonio Esauma Pinlaisquigi, 
convicted by a jury of rape and false imprisonment, the judge devoted most of 
his remarks to the victim, who was briefly addicted to cocaine at the time of 
the attack but who had been sober for more than two years at the time of the 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying (the victim) is deserving of censure," said the judge. "If 
anything, hopefully this episode in her life will allow her to evolve to a 
higher plane than she was at before she met Mr. Pinlaisquigi. Maybe this will 
be the old axiom about you hit bottom before you start up. I hope so. She was 
going nowhere when she met him. And the problem is, if it wasn't him, it would 
have been somebody else that would take advantage of a person who was in the 
emotional/psychological trauma that she was in." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone needs to evolve to a higher plane. 
</P>
<P>
 And it sure ain't the victim.

 "The bigger the personality, the simpler the photo." 
</P>
<P>
 Photographer Albert Watson practices his aesthetic philosophy on big stars -- 
and small, odd objects.In "Cyclops" (Bullfinch Press), a new collection of more 
than 200 images, an aged abandoned package is metamorphosed into a precious 
artifact, while on the facing page, a tuxedoed Alfred Hitchcock grasps the 
ribbon-bedecked neck of a dead goose. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the first famous person I ever photographed," says the Scottish-born 
Watson of the shot -- from a Christmas issue of Harper's Bazaar. Hitchcock was 
charming and funny, Watson recalls, even suggesting ideas for the photo, which 
would accompany the director's recipe for holiday goose. "I thought if all 
famous people are this fun, great." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 20 years, Watson (whose blindness in one eye prompted the title) 
had a chance to find out, racking up a client list that includes Mick Jagger, 
Jack Nicholson and Britain's Royal Family. Yet some of Watson's least 
recognizable photos are the most compelling. Like the portraits of Louisiana 
Death Row convicts serving time in a maximum-security prison or a goofy shot of 
a dog -- creepily out of focus, standing on a beach like a frozen alien. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a snapshot," Watson says with a laugh. And about as close as he gets to 
home snaps. "My family complains I take too long." 
</P>
<P>
 A one-man show of photographs by Albert Watson runs through Oct. 15 at

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: BURLESQUE, 1990S-STYLE; AT GRAND VILLE, BOTH 
WOMEN AND MEN LINE UP TO SEE THE STRIP SHOWS, RIGHT BEHIND THE CELEBRITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK EHRMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you need any convincing the burlesque show audience has gone "uptown," not 
to mention co-ed, check out Grand Ville nightclub and revue on Thursday nights 
in West Hollywood -- if you can, that is.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had to beg to get in," groused one recent guest, whose group was not of 
the beautiful people variety awarded easy entry, nor of guest-list status, 
which most of the in crowd seems to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs's A-list clientele is a celebrity-heavy mix including Stephen Dorff, 
Sean Penn, Stephen Baldwin and Daphne Zuniga. And other familiar faces from 
film and TV have either dropped by to see the show or have become Grand Ville 
regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally indicative of the new look in burlesque are the groups of women who 
flock here every Thursday night. Those privileged, cool or lucky enough to be 
allowed in get to enjoy the midnight show -- a series of strip vignettes 
lasting about 45 minutes, in which women, and occasionally men, strip down to 
G-strings while the young, good-looking crowd showers them with dollar bills.  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look like a topless joint except for the stage, with the pole and 
everything," says promoter Rick Calamaro, whose previous nightclub experience 
was running On the Roxx for 2 1/2 years -- spanning its notorious Heidi Fleiss 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightclub," he says of Grand Ville. "We call it a burlesque show, but 
it's a 1990s burlesque show." What that means is, you don't see any men in 
trench coats trying to slink in unnoticed. Rather, at about 11 p.m. a crush of 
trendily clad bodies of both male and female varieties pile up around the 
velvet rope, as eager would-be scene-sters vie for the attention of doormen. 
Inside, when the show's not on, there's dancing, while in the back room a jazz 
or rock band usually performs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It boiled down to, if it was going to work, it would have to appeal to the 
women," says Calamaro, whose knowledge of the fairer sex may have been 
conditioned by the fact that he spent some of his formative years living at the 
Playboy mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted it to be a nightclub with a show. I knew that if the girls were 
going to come back, they were going to have to enjoy the show." To that end, 
Calamaro and co-promoters Josh Richman and Kiva (who doubles as one of the 
dancers) allow the strippers to bring in their own concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just let the girls go," he says. "Girls come up to me and say, 'I want to 
do something here.' I'll say, 'Do you need me to put something together for 
you?' If they do, I do it. And if not, I say, 'Go ahead, get your girlfriends.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the packed house every week, the formula seems to be successful. "I 
like to look at women stripping and it's more sexy and fun in a place where 
there are a lot of women around," says Valerie, an actress and Grand Ville 
regular, who believes a lot of women fantasize about this sort of thing.

 The art world has been taking a few unorthodox steps to bring its message to 
the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could have failed to notice Hiro Yamagata's movie premiere-style billboard 
on Hollywood Boulevard promoting his new automotive installation, "Earthly 
Paradise," at the Barnsdall Park Municipal Art Gallery? 
</P>
<P>
 More appreciative of the sensibility of the men and women in the street -- who 
may find Yamagata's customized vintage Mercedes-Benzes a little out of their 
price and status range -- is artist Anthony Ausgang's upcoming "ATM Show" at 
the Onyx-Sequel Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not a show of arty automatic tellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then why the title? Because every piece is priced to move at a Quick Cash $40. 
Art ownership is just a PIN number away. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A Capitol Idea: Speaking of ATMs, the Social Climes staff found a stack of 
cards on a local Versateller with this eye-catching headline, "Need More Money 
in Your Account?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, who doesn't?  
</P>
<P>
 "Earn a substantial income," the text went on, "working 10 to 15 hours a week. 
Full-time money part-time!" 
</P>
<P>
 We called the number, fully expecting to be invited to join some fly-by-night 
boiler room operation or multilevel marketing scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we were connected to the International Division of Capitol Records, 
where names of applicants for part-time work were being taken. 
</P>
<P>
 We guess good help really is hard to find.

THE MANY VIEWS OF 'TRADITIONAL VALUES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, Robin Abcarian has honed in on the very core of an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In her column "Whose Values Are These, Anyway?" (Sept. 21), she peels away the 
rhetoric to show the real issue -- that the agenda of the radical right is the 
denial of "traditional values." 
</P>
<P>
 The desire for a legally recognized monogamous partnership is indeed a 
"traditional value." The rights of longtime loving partners, straight or gay, 
to make health care and survivorship decisions are "traditional values." 
</P>
<P>
 The rights of free speech and assembly are "traditional values." 
</P>
<P>
 With a stroke of his pen, Pete Wilson has made Lou Sheldon the de facto 
governor of California, the so-called religious right its legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 We can only hope he is relieved of the burdens of the governor's office in 
November so he can come out of his personal closet and join Sheldon, Pat 
Robertson and Jesse Helms in their unholy cabal to destroy the true 
"traditional values" of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights, documents for 
which they show utter contempt. 
</P>

 Let me make sure I understand this. According to Robin Abcarian, if militant 
gay protesters break inside a church service, then they are just "making their 
points of view known. They are fighting for the civil rights they richly 
deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 But if anti-abortion protesters are making their points known outside an 
abortion clinic and fighting for the rights the unborn so richly deserve, then 
they get slapped with RICO as though they were the mob. 
</P>
<P>
 To Abcarian's knowledge, the gay community has never threatened anyone in the 
clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Abcarian is living on Mars. I've seen death threats written by gay 
activists to well-known clergy. I've heard threatening phone calls made. I've 
seen signs screaming hate with religious epithets in gay-pride parades. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs that never make the evening news and are unprintable in a family 
newspaper like The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to even question an action of the gay community is viewed as politically 
incorrect and homophobic.

<P>
 Robin Abcarian appears to be easily amused. She smiles to read of an 
organization called Traditional Values Coalition and questions the value of the 
"good old days." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Abcarian appears to be too young to have lived in this period, maybe it 
would be helpful to point out some of the things that existed, or didn't exist, 
in those days. 
</P>
<P>
 No one maintains that life was perfect 30 or 40 years ago or that there were 
no deaths from illegal abortions.  
</P>
<P>
 But: It wasn't necessary to screen students for guns before they entered 
schools, SAT scores were 20% to 30% higher, teen-age pregnancies were rare 
compared to today. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this beginning to sound like things were better?

NO MORE LOVE IN A NICOTINE AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: "Smoker's Fantasies Light Up His World" (Sept. 15): A former 
three-pack-a-day smoker, I can identify with Garry Abrams' longtime love affair 
with cigarettes. But after 17 years of freedom from smoking, I can also give 
him the other side of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 I no longer need "an excuse to take a break for the computer." I give myself 
permission to get up, stretch and walk outdoors for a few deep breaths of fresh 
air, which relaxes me and clears my head in less time than it used to take to 
smoke a cigarette.  
</P>
<P>
 Like Abrams, I found my romance with cigarettes fading as the years went by, 
and that's the biggest step toward quitting, as he'll find out. Hopefully 
before his daughter starts thinking a cigarette will help when she's hungry . . 
. or full . . . or sad . . . or happy . . . or relaxed . . . or nervous . . . 
or . . .

 Garry Abrams' article on the joys and benefits of smoking would be funny if it 
weren't so pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 He declaims the mental-process benefits from smoking in a way that suggests 
even nonsmokers could benefit from a little nicotine when, in fact, the only 
reason he can't think clearly without cigarettes is because he's addicted to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the smoker having to "accept a lot" from nonsmokers, what a load of 
horse manure. If complaining about having a measurable amount of nicotine in my 
system despite my never having smoked makes me sanctimonious, I wear the label 
proudly.

IGNORE THE SNOOZE BAR ON BIOLOGICAL CLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Identifying with Denise Hamilton ("When Your Biological Clock Is on 'Snooze,' 
" Sept. 21), I would suggest that if the clock is on snooze, let well enough 
alone and don't let anyone make you feel guilty (for choosing not to have 
children). 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I were a young couple working diligently at our jobs.We chose a 
lifestyle that would allow us our much-deserved vacations and weekends off and 
the freedom to travel and to take part in the myriad of activities that life 
has to offer in Southern California and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to imply that we lived only for ourselves. We entertained often, 
creating pleasant times for our friends and relatives. We also endeavored to be 
neighborly and helpful to others and to contribute to worthy causes. 
</P>
<P>
 This has proved the right lifestyle for us, and after 40 years of marriage we 
do not regret our choice. Considering the serious overpopulation of the Earth, 
we don't feel we did our species a disservice.

WESTSIDE WATCH: INNER PEACE COULD CONQUER URBAN WARS, GURU SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget capital punishment, the "three-strikes" law and midnight basketball. 
The folks at the Maharishi Vedic School in Pacific Palisades have a holistic 
weapon in the fight against crime: transcendental meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Thursday, followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi urged 
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and other leaders to fund a permanent 
transcendental meditation group of young and unemployed people to help reduce 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maharishi school officials delivered results of a $6-million study done in 
1993 that concluded that violent crime in Washington dropped 18% during a 
meditation experiment involving 4,000 participants. They say a permanent 
program could lower what they called "social stress" and cut crime. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-hour news conference at the school's hillside campus and health 
center overlooking the Pacific Ocean, study researchers defended their findings 
as reporters questioned the survey's methods and credibility. But the most 
unexpected response came from the Maharishi himself, who spoke to the meeting 
by telephone from his home in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not wasting my time on scientific research anymore," said the guru, who 
is perhaps best-known for serving as spiritual adviser to the Beatles during 
the late 1960s. "Scientists can continue enjoying their lives, but don't expect 
anything good to come out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 These remarks and others left the scientists and sociologists who produced the 
report scrambling to define its purpose and the future of the meditation 
project. In separate interviews, a school official and a study researcher 
contradicted each other on whether the program would request public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what the Maharishi was doing, and this is my own interpretation, was 
not to say that scientific research doesn't provide valuable studies," said 
Charles (Skip) Alexander, a professor of psychology at Maharishi University in 
Fairfield, Iowa. "He's just less and less convinced that scientific research 
will lead to changes in public policy." 
</P>
<P>
 A change in public policy seems to have been the whole point of the study, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maharishi's followers believe large groups of meditators can send positive 
energy through a so-called field of consciousness that unites the universe. The 
larger the group, the greater the opportunity to reduce social stress and 
crime. School officials hope that the government might sponsor such groups in 
cities across the country, although they could not provide details on how such 
an effort would be organized or how much it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters challenged the study's assertion that crime in the nation's capital 
dropped during the survey period, pointing out that the researchers compared 
actual crime rates against unofficial rates that had been predicted for the 
same period, as opposed to comparing actual data from previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 A Riordan spokeswoman said city officials had not yet been contacted about the 
meditation program. "But I can say that the mayor's No. 1 priority is public 
safety, and he supports any desire to make the city safer," the spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came with an open mind," said Los Angeles Police Officer Steve Howenger, 
who attended the event with two colleagues at the invitation of Maharishi 
school officials. He said he had no idea what effect the program might have on 
law enforcement. "I don't meditate, so I guess I was at a disadvantage there."

POLICE UNION PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR D'AGOSTINO IN COUNCIL RACE; ELECTION: LEADERS 
CONTEND THAT BARBARA YAROSLAVSKY WOULD BE A PUPPET FOR HER HUSBAND, THE 
OUTGOING COUNCILMAN. HER OPPONENT WOULD BE A FRIEND TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, THEY 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police union leaders endorsed one Los Angeles City Council candidate and 
blasted another last week, backing Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin D'Agostino 
while claiming that Barbara Yaroslavsky, if elected, would be a puppet of her 
husband, outgoing Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strings will still be pulled by him (Yaroslavsky)," said Danny Staggs, 
president of the Police Protective League. Staggs characterized the councilman 
as antagonistic toward the police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs, who cited the councilman's vote last summer against settling a bitter 
wage dispute with police, made his remarks at a news conference Wednesday at 
Parker Center. He also announced that the league had endorsed D'Agostino in the 
race to succeed Yaroslavsky, whose district includes Bel-Air, Century City, the 
Fairfax district and Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agostino will be a strong friend of the police, said Staggs, who vowed to 
send union members to work for her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agostino, 57, caught the public's eye in 1987 when she prosecuted producer 
John Landis on involuntary manslaughter charges stemming from the deaths of 
actor Vic Morrow and two children during filming of "Twilight Zone -- The 
Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the case, she was transferred out of the central courts by her 
boss, then-Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. In 1988, she ran against Reiner and lost. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agostino distanced herself somewhat from Staggs' prediction that 
Yaroslavsky's wife would be his puppet at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, D'Agostino, a Westwood resident, said she is concerned that having a 
husband in one branch of government and his wife in another would risk 
potential conflicts of interest. The two jurisdictions have been known to sue 
each other and squabble over public policies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running for the 5th District seat are former Los Angeles school board 
member Roberta Weintraub and attorney Michael Feuer, head of Bet Tzedek, a 
nonprofit legal services agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Zev and Barbara Yaroslavsky dismissed Staggs' views. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, Danny Staggs will not have any impact on the 5th District race," 
an angry Zev Yaroslavsky said. The league not only fails to represent 
rank-and-file cops but is also out of touch with 5th District voters, 
Yaroslavsky contended, noting that voters there supported the so-called 
Christopher Commission reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky, meanwhile, said that despite their differences, she hopes 
to work with the police union if she is elected to sharply beef up the LAPD, 
which has been called the most understaffed big-city police department in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 She denied that she would be controlled by her husband. "Anyone who says that 
hasn't awakened and smelled the roses of this generation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After 19 years on the council, Zev Yaroslavsky was elected in June to the 
County Board of Supervisors and will take his seat in December. VOTER DEADLINE 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for registering to vote in the Nov. 8 general election is 
Tuesday. To be eligible to vote, registrants must be at least 18 by Election 
Day and must be U.S. citizens. Those wishing to register can do so in person at 
the headquarters of the registrar-recorder/county clerk at 12400 Imperial 
Highway in Norwalk. They also may request registration-by-mail forms at various 
locations, including county buildings, city halls, post offices and libraries, 
or by calling the county's 24-hour election information system at (310) 
462-2748. The postage-paid forms are mailed within a day after the request is 
received; they must be received by election officials by Tuesday.

 The coins that pedestrians drop into dolphin sculptures on Santa Monica's 
Third Street Promenade add up to not-so-small change. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of $12,000 collected from the Promenade's dolphin fountain and dolphin 
heads has been turned over to a Los Angeles charity for distribution to 
homeless support agencies serving Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The donations were collected over seven months as part of the Dolphin Change 
Program. Founded one year ago to raise money for the homeless, the program is 
run by the Bayside District Corp., a nonprofit agency that manages the 
Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 The $12,000 will be distributed by the California Community Foundation, 
established in 1915, which will administer the funds to the selected homeless 
support agencies around Santa Monica on Nov. 15.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; HOMEOWNERS, PLAYERS CALL TIME OUT

 Parks: Complaints of crime and crowds at Culver West handball courts have 
subsided for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension between neighbors and young people using Culver West Park has eased in 
the wake of the city's banning adults from a soccer field and threatening to 
close handball courts unless complaints about gangs, noise and drugs subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Human Services and Park Commission has threatened to close the 
courts in six months if residents continue to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 But the handball players say they are simply tolerating the situation. They 
said they believe residents assumed they were gang members solely because many 
players are Latino. Police say they have found no evidence that the park is 
attracting gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order for them not to close the courts, we have to do what they want," 
said Jose, 20, of Venice, an avid handball player who would not give his last 
name. "If people come here and they want to drink or something, we tell them to 
go somewhere else to do it. Usually they just say, 'OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of 100 people packing the park on some weeknights, now there are maybe 
10 playing handball and another 10 shooting baskets. Soccer, which at one time 
attracted throngs to Culver West, is now gone altogether -- it was banned last 
month by the Park Commission in response to complaints about crowded fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's directive mystified some residents. Although soccer players 
generally outnumbered handball players in the park, soccer never had caused 
much disruption in the neighborhood, said Bill Sollima, who has lived on Moore 
Street since 1985 and has been leading the fight to close the handball courts. 
The problems with gangs, drugs and serious overcrowding started more than a 
year ago, he said, when the handball courts grew more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Players seem convinced that discrimination fueled the residents' effort to 
clamp down on handball. Allegations about it being a gathering place for gang 
members and drug dealers are simply untrue, players said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to the baggy denim shorts and purple T-shirt worn by his nearby 
friend, Jose, 23, of Mar Vista said: "You see a Latino dressed like this and 
you think what -- that he's a gangbanger, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some gang members here sometimes from V-13 (a local gang), but this 
is not a gang hangout," Jose said. "We come here to play handball." 
</P>
<P>
 There are just two other handball courts in the area -- one in Venice, which 
is always crowded, and the other in Oakwood, where a number of shootings have 
made it too dangerous to play, said Efran Martinez, 16, from Venice. Culver 
West, moreover, is the only court that has lights at night, the players said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sollima and others are convinced that gang members have marked the spot as 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 They point to two shootings near Culver West last November as proof it had 
been attracting a bad crowd, although police would not confirm whether the 
incidents were gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is V-13 turf. . . . I know what they look like," Sollima said. "They 
have tattoos . . . (the word) Venice drawn across their backs. It's not hard to 
figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no proof that handball is the root of any persistent gang problems at 
Culver West or any of the city's 17 other parks, Culver City police said. Few 
park-related incidents have been reported, and police officers make three to 
five rounds in the parks every day, said department spokesman Lt. Tom Gabor. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not a V-13 spot," Gabor said. "The neighbors might feel that their 
lives are being disrupted, but when you have decent people in this community 
who want to play (handball or soccer) in a park, is it OK to tell them not to?" 
</P>
<P>
 Early last month, the Park Commission responded to the complaints of a group 
of residents by blocking off the handball courts with a chain link fence, 
although the commission took no action at the time to limit soccer. Within a 
week, about 20 of the handball players showed up at a Department of Recreation 
and Parks meeting to protest the closing of the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 At that meeting, the commission reversed itself, reopening the handball courts 
for a six-month trial period but then banning soccer for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the quiet continues on Moore Street, Sollima said, he is willing to 
drop his fight against the handball courts. In fact, he took the "For Sale" 
sign off his property a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it going in the right direction around here," he said. "On this 
handball thing, I'll just wait and see." MARY MOORE

 A summary of selected City Hall actions last week that affect the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * WESTWOOD VILLAGE -- Took initial steps toward forming a Westwood Village 
Business Improvement District, directing the city clerk to mail hearing notices 
concerning the proposal to businesses in the area. The improvement district, 
which must be approved by the majority of businesses in the area, imposes a tax 
used to provide security, maintenance, lighting and landscape improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 * CHRISTMAS TREE WARNINGS -- Approved an ordinance that requires retail 
sellers of Christmas trees to attach a tag to each tree explaining the fire 
danger of trees inside the home and suggesting various safety measures to be 
taken by the purchaser. The Fire Department will pay for the tags. 
</P>
<P>
 * COUNCIL TV -- Instructed the city clerk to prepare written summaries of City 
Council agendas, to be shown on Channel 35 before meetings are televised. HOW 
THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * TAXICAB SERVICES -- Approved an ordinance that extends for five years the 
authority for seven taxicab services to operate in specific areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Cab Co. will continue to provide services in the part of Los 
Angeles bounded by the San Diego Freeway on the west, Mulholland Drive on the 
north, Culver City on the south and La Cienega Boulevard on the east. 
</P>
<P>
 The Independent Cab Co. and United Independent Cab Co. will cover the area 
roughly bounded by the Pacific Ocean, Los Angeles International Airport, 
Mulholland Drive, and Topanga Canyon and La Cienega boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Transportation Commissioners had recommended a 10-year renewal 
period, but the council limited it to five years. A spokesman for the 
Department of Transportation said L.A. Taxi, which covers the central, eastern 
and South Central sections of the city, provides the best cab service in town, 
while San Fernando Valley Checker Cab provides the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Passed: 14-0 
</P>
<P>
 Voting yes: John Ferraro, Marvin Braude, Zev Yaroslavsky, Ruth Galanter, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Nate Holden, Jackie Goldberg. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: VIEW PARK; FUND AIDS YOUTHS STUDYING LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Johnetta Jones had been wanting for years to start a scholarship program in 
her late husband's name but was always put off by the amount of work she 
figured it would take. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1992, Jones got the spark she needed. As she stood at the window of 
her View Park home watching Crenshaw Boulevard burn during the riots, she 
decided the time was ripe to start encouraging young people of color to pursue 
careers in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked out at the street and saw not enough firetrucks, not enough police," 
said Jones, a retired schoolteacher. "I decided then that the only way to 
change the system is from within, not without." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones quickly established the Donald Jones Scholarship Fund in memory of her 
late husband, a 32-year veteran of the county Sheriff's Department who died in 
1984. At a dinner in late September at Holman United Methodist Church, Jones 
and her scholarship committee presented the first three awards of $1,000 each. 
The recipients were all local college students pursuing studies in 
administration of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said that the scholarship is intended to continue her husband's legacy 
of involvement with community youths, including active participation in the 
Crenshaw YMCA and being a mentor to fatherless young men. Perhaps most 
important to her husband, Jones said, was ensuring that young people of color 
were made aware of career opportunities in law enforcement -- something that 
barely existed when he started in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were very few blacks in the department at that time. It was tough," 
Jones said. "But he hung in there, weathered the storm. He always believed in 
it . . . He thought that too many people judge law enforcement officials by one 
bad incident." 
</P>
<P>
 For 22-year-old Sean Smith, the scholarship means fewer financial burdens as 
he continues justice studies at Santa Monica College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning a lot about the justice system that I never knew. It's 
interesting," he said. "Even though I always thought I wanted to do this kind 
of work, I was like everybody else in my neighborhood. I said, 'A cop? No way!' 
But then I thought to myself, 'Well, if it's true that the Klan runs the Police 
Department, then I need to get in there and make some changes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Aubert, 30, said the scholarship will enable her to pursue what she has 
always wanted -- a career as a private investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deciding to go after administration of justice inspired me to go back to 
school," said the high school dropout, who is now back in school at El Camino 
College. "I feel now more than ever there will be changes for the better (in 
law enforcement). . . . Blacks and Latinos have to go into the field and 
straighten things out." 
</P>
<P>
 The third recipient, 21-year-old Inglewood resident Emilson St. Julian, is 
also a student at El Camino College. St. Julian is an LAPD Explorer Scout as 
well as an LAPD reserve officer. ERIN J. AUBRY

COVER STORY; RED-TAGGED RELICS; BATTERED, BLIGHTED HOLLYWOOD LANDMARKS TEETER 
ON EDGE OF EXTINCTION 
</P>

 When the Hollywood-Western building was completed in 1928, movie star Norma 
Shearer opened it with a golden key. Today, the young vagrants who live there 
don't need any keys -- the back door is wide open and admits anyone brave 
enough to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 In these offices, early movie moguls made big decisions on censorship, 
antitrust laws and trade unions. Now squatters use the rooms as crash pads, 
slumbering amid ripped sofas, crumbled plaster and dried puddles of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-year-old building -- Los Angeles historic-cultural monument No. 336 -- 
is rotting inside and out, a victim of the January earthquake and years of 
apathy and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists worry that the red-tagged architectural jewel, an Art Deco 
landmark on the southwest corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue, 
will soon fall through the bureaucratic cracks and face the wrecking ball -- if 
one of its illegal inhabitants doesn't set fire to the place first. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous earthquake-damaged historic buildings in Hollywood face a similar 
plight. These include the Egyptian Theater, the Hillview Apartments and the 
Henry Fonda Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission reports that about a fourth of 
the city's 596 historic-cultural monuments were damaged in the quake. Such 
buildings represent prime examples of a certain architectural style, were 
designed by a prominent architect or played an important role in Los Angeles 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's figures are not broken down by neighborhood, but it is 
believed the damage was extensive in Hollywood. The short list of Hollywood's 
'20s and '30s buildings seems to get shorter every year because of demolitions, 
fires and natural disasters. The fate of what is left depends on a handful of 
Los Angeles agencies and scattered preservation groups that often have proved 
powerless to save old or damaged sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this year, preservationists lost bitter battles to save the Brown Derby 
on Vine Street -- a universal symbol of old Hollywood that was battered by 
fires, vandals and finally the powerful Northridge temblor -- and the Hastings 
Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists seeking a bit of Tinseltown glamour have found many vacant lots and 
orphaned buildings. The locals know better. They say parts of central and east 
Hollywood have been deteriorating into a slum for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists blame absent-minded city officials for allowing the decay. 
City officials blame neglectful property owners. Property owners blame 
government agencies and the bad economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest threats to historic buildings are neglected or deferred 
maintenance," said Tim Brandt, project architect for Historic Resources Group, 
a private consulting company. "But there's also a certain lack of respect for 
the past. There just isn't the mind-set for the preservation of old buildings 
(in Los Angeles) that there is back East." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, such buildings have gotten little respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Egyptian Theater, which at 72 is several years older than the 
celebrated Mann's Chinese Theater just to the west on Hollywood Boulevard. Film 
showings ceased at the Egyptian several years ago, shortly before the Community 
Redevelopment Agency bought the run-down property from United Artists. 
</P>
<P>
 American Cinematheque, a film-preservation organization, has proposed taking 
over the building to show classic films, but that plan was stalled after the 
earthquake left the Egyptian looking like an ancient ruin. Fragile hollow-clay 
tiles -- the 1920s precursor to cinder blocks -- collapsed in the south and 
east walls, exposing the interior to sun and rain. Then vandals stripped the 
theater of whatever they could sell on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency has estimated the earthquake damage to the Egyptian 
at more than $5 million. That's about three times as much as the agency paid 
for the building in 1992. (It can be more expensive to repair such a building 
than to buy it.) Officials now hope that insurers and the federal government 
will pay for repairs so the American Cinematheque plan can proceed, but the 
building's fate remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hillview Apartments, a pink stucco structure that once provided temporary 
housing for silent movie stars, is now the only residential building in the 
Hollywood historic district. It was heavily damaged in the January earthquake 
and by street sinkage in August related to Metro Rail subway construction. City 
officials say repair efforts have been stalled by disputes between the Hillview 
landlords and the remaining tenants, who are fighting eviction from the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 The Henry Fonda Theater -- a 68-year-old movie house formerly called The Pix 
-- had often been dark even before it was damaged by the quake. The theater is 
operated by the Nederlander company, whose officials say they hope to renovate 
the structure by early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the most attention-grabbing blighted property is the Hollywood-Western, 
at one time one of the most important buildings in the movie industry. City 
officials declared the site a cultural-historic monument six years ago, but 
that won't necessarily save the building from demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis B. Mayer, the second M in MGM, and his "boy wonder" production 
executive, Irving Thalberg, originally built it in 1928 to house two movie 
organizations, the Assn. of Motion Picture Producers and the Central Casting 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was a powerful trade association that governed the general policies 
of studios during Hollywood's golden era, including the infamous Production 
Code that limited directors' discretion in depicting sex on the screen. Central 
Casting was formed in 1925 to place extras and other day workers in film jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the '30s and '40s, studio brass frequented the Hollywood-Western, 
particularly the west wing of the fourth floor, which housed the offices of the 
trade association and its imperious czar, Will Hays. The Hays Office, as it 
came to be known, did a lot more than keep movies free of nudity and naughty 
words. The group battled a federal antitrust suit against movie companies and 
played a game of chicken with various trade unions during tense labor standoffs 
before finally moving to another Hollywood site in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-story building originally had 60 offices and 10 stores, including a 
billiard hall in the basement. But its most distinctive feature was, and still 
is, a series of seminude friezes on the fire escapes, which showed Greek gods 
and goddesses cavorting with movie cameras and megaphones. (This was architect 
S. Charles Lee's inside joke aimed at the puritanical Production Code. A couple 
of years before his death in 1990, Lee quipped that his "was the first porno 
work in Hollywood.") 
</P>
<P>
 The decline of the Hollywood-Western mirrors the slide of the surrounding 
neighborhood, which has been hit hard by poverty and the 1992 riots. At one 
time the building's upper floors were rented out for rock-band rehearsals. The 
ground floor has for years housed a bargain shop selling cheap trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the building has been known as the home of Hollywood 
Billiards, a 22-table basement pool parlor "open 10 a.m. to God Knows When." By 
the mid-1980s, the hangout was attracting celebrities while the rest of the 
building went to seed. Many tenants moved out and squatters began breaking in 
as the neighborhood declined. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who live there now don't spend much time admiring the architectural 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti adorns interior walls, boarded-up doors and windows, and the gray 
stone facade. "I Been Dirt But I Don't Care," reads a typical message scrawled 
in a stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Mr. and Mrs. Bill's love nest," smiled Corina Manderley, a 
17-year-old self-described entertainer and poet who was roused from her loft 
bed in the Hollywood-Western one recent morning. Her squalid, closet-sized room 
on the second floor was carpeted with wadded-up clothes, garbage and junk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been living here just about a month," said Manderley, a pale, skinny 
girl with a penchant for funky clothes like stocking caps. "My (boyfriend Bill) 
has been living here for years. Ever since the building was opened (by 
squatters) after the earthquake, he made it OK for the rest of us to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 At least a dozen people stumbled out of various rooms in the darkened building 
as a group of journalists and activists toured the site. Among them was 
Manderley's boyfriend, Bill, a rail-thin 32-year-old who screamed curses at 
reporters and ordered them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of East Hollywood's best-known "squats," the historic building has 
become a haunted, frightful place, governed by the law of the streets. For a 
trip down the hall, squatters arm themselves with baseball bats and crowbars. 
One night not too long ago, the squatters said, a girl coming up the stairs 
failed to identify herself properly and was savagely beaten. A trail of dried 
blood led from the landing to the downstairs lobby, where it ended in a 
sickening red smear. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, a brass-plated elevator sat moldering at the bottom of a pitch-black 
shaft, its cables long ago plundered. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your mother was dying, would you just leave her lying there?" asked Doug 
Carlton, a community activist who has been leading a fight to rid the 
Hollywood-Western of the squatters, whom he considers drug addicts and dealers. 
"Well, Hollywood's mother is dying, and no one seems to care." 
</P>
<P>
 The January quake may have sealed the building's doom. Virtually all remaining 
paying tenants had to vacate the red-tagged site. Now the owner says she 
doesn't have enough money to repair the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Squatters) are ruining the building," said Charlotte Reed, who since 1979 
has owned the Hollywood-Western with her sister, Natalie Robin. Reed complained 
that she had been turned down for a Small Business Administration emergency 
loan and has fallen behind on her mortgage payments because of the earthquake 
damage. "We want them all out or we're not going to have a building to save," 
Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the building isn't repaired soon, city officials say they could pursue 
several options. One would be to seize it through eminent domain, a legal 
precept that gives government the right to take over private property for 
public use. Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg and developers have 
expressed interest in turning the building into a low-income community housing 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 If that doesn't work, officials say, another scenario would be to have the Los 
Angeles Department of Building and Safety declare the structure an imminent 
hazard and raze it. 
</P>
<P>
 But preservationists say that would just be more business as usual in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived in Hollywood all my life, but I don't know if I even want to work 
here anymore," said Greg Williams, a board member of the preservation group 
Hollywood Heritage and co-owner of a puppet studio at Hollywood Boulevard and 
Vine Street. "Hollywood still wants to be the glamour capital of the world, and 
it isn't. . . . The whole place is falling apart."

FOR SENIORS; WATERCOLOR ARTIST'S SUCCESS IS CASE OF A LATE BLOOMER WHO 
BLOSSOMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watercolor artist Jesse Etayo has this advice for people who, like himself, 
bloom a little late in life: "Older people should express themselves and not be 
afraid of ridicule. No matter what you do or how, be yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Etayo, 65, speaks with authority. It was not until he enrolled in a community 
college art class five years ago that he learned how to express himself as an 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has not faced ridicule or reproach. His paintings, Impressionist sorts 
of works that usually depict nature scenes, have sold for $200 to $950 at art 
shows. He recently sold 20 watercolors in a one-man show at the Santa Monica 
Main Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Etayo was born in Lagrono, a small city in the north of Spain. He was the 
youngest of 13 children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the end of the tale. I was both neglected and overwhelmed with 
affection," he said from his studio in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The family left Spain during that country's civil war in the 1930s and settled 
in Venezuela, where Etayo grew up. Both parents died when he was 18, and he 
decided to begin a new life. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in Baton Rouge, La., with $150, not knowing a word of English, 
without a job, a family or an idea of what he was going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew one thing: I was going to explore and learn the American way of life. 
I instantly engaged and knew this was going to be my place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He enrolled in an English-language course and three months later had enough 
money for a train ticket to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, he finished high school, attended community college while doing odd jobs 
and was drafted during the Korean War. When he returned, he went to UCLA, 
graduated with a bachelor's degree in general science, earned a master's degree 
in Portuguese and Spanish literature -- he hopes to someday write and 
illustrate children's books in Spanish -- and spent the next 30 years managing 
chemical tests in a medical laboratory at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time he married his wife, Madeline, and raised a son -- along with 
six nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 Every step Etayo took -- from learning the language of his new country, to 
getting an education, to marrying and raising his own family and the children 
of his brothers and sisters -- helped secure his future. 
</P>
<P>
 Since childhood, however, he had always wanted to be an artist. So throughout 
his life he has taken art courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew eventually I wanted to be an artist, but I had all the 
responsibilities. I think it was my destiny, because I had it on my mind since 
I was a child," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until he was 60 and enrolled in a watercolor class at Emeritus College in 
Santa Monica did his artistic talent blossom. 
</P>

 Etayo credits Emeritus College with nurturing his talent and giving him the 
opportunity to associate with other artists. Marilyn Hall, assistant dean of 
special programs and director of Emeritus, said, "It's always nice to see the 
connections between our classes, students and the community, and Jesse's work 
does that -- it's the epitome of what Emeritus is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't imitate nature, but I could create with my own fantasies what I 
saw," Etayo said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the purple trees he paints make a lot of sense to him and anyone else 
who has ever resented being told when they were young that there's no such 
thing as purple trees. "Everyone has a way of expressing their own charm and 
beauty, and sometimes you think other people won't see it, but they do if it's 
authentic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His purple trees can be seen at the Culver City Main Library through this 
month.

COMMUNITY: SELF-POLICING MAY SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: "The Vigilante of Carthay Square" (Sept. 25) 
</P>
<P>
 Hooray for Joe Connolly. Local police no longer serve as a preventive 
deterrent to the criminal element but often are a reactive after-thought, i.e., 
the crime has been perpetrated, you are now a victim, and the police arrive 30 
minutes later to take a report.It is quite evident that the Thin Blue Line 
cannot effectively police our communities. Living here during the L.A. riots 
has revealed the impotence of law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of frustration and feeling of dissatisfaction (with police) in the 
face of burgeoning crime is high among many community residents. Forget the 
toothless Neighborhood Watch programs. The Venice bench-breaking incident and 
Joe Connolly are the beginning manifestations of citizen self-empowerment. Call 
it vigilantism, if you want. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of you (especially smug liberals) imbued with social-political 
correctitude need only to be a crime victim in order to see the validity of 
community self-policing. 
</P>
<P>
 My only problem now is, how to get Joe Connolly to move into my neighborhood.

JUSTICE: A QUICKER WAY TO PROSECUTE GRAFFITI CRIMINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: Culver City's New Anti-Graffiti Law 
</P>
<P>
 As a resident of Culver City I was very interested in the Culver City 
council's approval of a new anti-graffiti law. Like the council and other 
citizens, I am also very concerned about the spread of graffiti and the 
associated problems regarding offenses committed by juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Culver City council apparently was unaware of the Los Angeles 
County Superior Court Juvenile Traffic Court, which, despite its name, is 
authorized to hear graffiti and other misdemeanor cases when the damage is less 
than $250 and the offender is younger than 18. As a part-time judicial officer 
for the court, I can attest it has made a difference in the lives of youthful 
graffiti offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of having the district attorney involved in Juvenile Traffic Court, 
the police need only write a ticket for the minor to appear in court. The 
closed court hearing is set promptly and the parent or legal guardian is 
required to attend. At the hearing the minor can plead guilty or request a 
trial. The minor is afforded all constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 If the minor pleads or is found guilty, the judicial officer is authorized to 
impose 100 hours of community service, which is normally imposed, or a fine or 
other appropriate punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile Traffic Court is not the magic solution to all the problems regarding 
juvenile crime. It is not designed to handle major crimes committed by 
juveniles, which should be left to the district attorney for prosecution. 
However, as to graffiti offenses and other lesser crimes, it is a quick, 
inexpensive avenue which I trust Culver City and other cities will explore.

BEACHES: A VOICE OF OPPOSITION TO THE OCEAN FRONT WALK PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am pleased that Mark Ryavec is recognizing the voice of the Venice Town 
Council. As past-president of the Town Council, this is quite 
refreshing.However, the rest of Mr. Ryavec's letter (Sept. 29) is the usual 
character assassination and pejorative. I am vehemently opposed to Mr. Ryavec's 
plan for the Ocean Front Walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Mr. Ryavec's pleadings, most of Venice opposed his plan. His 
anti-democratic leanings are obvious when he equates the attendance at the 
workshops with the right to decide. I, like many others, could not spend my 
Saturdays in these workshops. I have testified as to my feelings. He has a real 
commercial interest in this plan, which he disingenuously avoids mentioning. 
But no, Mr. Ryavec, I am not one of those pesky renters. (Although most 
Venetians are.) My wife and I are homeowners. I just resent the divisive 
tactics used by Mr. Ryavec and others in support of this obscene and useless 
reconstruction of the Venice Ocean Front Walk.

THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE BEHIND PROPOSITION 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herman Schwartz, Herman Schwartz is a professor of constitutional law at The 
American University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are a nation of immigrants. Yet, there have always been Americans who 
resented newcomers. Nativism aimed at Catholics flour ished in the 19th 
Century; hostility toward Asian-Americans and La tinos is widespread today. 
</P>
<P>
 This traditional animosity toward newcomers is now aggravated by the existence 
of many immigrants here illegally. The United States Immigration and 
Naturalization Service estimates that 3.4 million illegal immigrants were in 
the United States in 1992, 80% of whom are in Texas, California and Florida. 
California alone is estimated to have 1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants make a significant contribution to the economy, for they 
will do work Americans don't want to do, often under harsh and unlawful 
conditions. But since they are eligible for some social services, particularly 
health care and education for their children, they also cost the state money. 
</P>
<P>
 No one really knows whether, on balance, illegal immigrants benefit or drain 
our economy. Nonetheless, at a time when the standard of living is stagnant and 
public resources are scarce, taxpayers are outraged at spending any tax money 
for these unwelcome guests. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the issue has moved into the political arena. Proposition 187 
would take away almost all the social services that illegal immigrants get, 
including child welfare, foster care, non-emergency health care (including 
prenatal services) and public education for elementary, high-school and 
university students. The purpose is to save money -- but also to make life so 
miserable for illegal immigrants that they will stop coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The wisdom and effectiveness of the measure are open to dispute. What is not 
disputable is that the cutoff of elementary and high-school education for the 
children of illegal immigrants is unconstitutional. A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court 
decision involving a similar Texas effort, Plyler vs. Doe, made that clear. 
</P>
<P>
 And the backers of Proposition 187 know that. Alan C. Nelson, immigration 
commissioner from 1982-89 and a co-author of the initiative, said, "It is meant 
to provoke court action. There's nothing new about getting decisions reversed 
when circumstances have changed, and in immigration terms, we are a world away 
from 1982." 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, Nelson is right. Changed circumstances can produce an 
occasional reversal, as in the overturn of the separate-but-equal doctrine in 
1954, in Brown vs. Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 But such cases are extremely rare. And have circumstances truly changed since 
1982? Not really. The facts and reasons for denying illegal immigrant children 
a public-school education that Texas presented to the court are the same as 
those put forth to justify Proposition 187, and the court's response is no less 
valid today than it was then -- and just as likely. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first place, the illegal-immigrant problem in California and elsewhere 
is not new. In 1986, it led to passage of the Immigration Reform and Control 
Act, which took years to hammer out. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Texas claimed as much trouble from the presence of illegal immigrant 
children in the public schools in 1982 as California does today. About 10% of 
the pupils in Texas school districts bordering Mexico had been born in Mexico. 
The immigrant children often spoke little or no English and had serious 
educational problems. Their presence overcrowded schools already full. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Texas attorney general, all this created financial strains 
and lowered the quality of education for the entire school system -- especially 
for the children of the legal immigrants. "Preservation of the state's 
resources for the education of its lawful residents and the elimination of an 
inducement for illegal immigration are sufficient basis for the statute," 
asserted the Texas attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court's response to this, in an opinion by Justice William J. 
Brennan Jr. for five members of the court, is as applicable now to California 
as it was then to Texas. While doubting that illegal immigrants come for a free 
education, impose a significant burden on the state's economy or degrade the 
overall quality of Texas education, the court's main reasons went to the heart 
of the kind of country we are. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is what the court called the "fundamental conceptions of justice" on 
which our system is based. Although parents who can comply with the law but 
enter unlawfully may be punished, 
</P>
<P>
 "the children . . . can affect neither their own conduct nor their own status 
. . . . (Visiting condemnation on . . . an infant . . . is contrary to the 
basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to 
individual responsibility or wrongdoing . . . . (P)enalizing (them for) a legal 
characteristic over which children can have little control . . . is an 
ineffectual -- as well as unjust -- way of deterring the parent." 
</P>
<P>
 The second reason is the "pivotal role of education in sustaining our 
political and cultural heritage, . . . (its) fundamental role in maintaining 
the fabric of our society." The inability to read and write imposes a "lifelong 
penalty and stigma" that "denies the means to absorb the values and skills on 
which our social order rests." The result, as Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. 
warned, is "the creation of a subclass of illiterate persons . . . adding to 
the problems and costs . . . (of) unemployment, welfare and crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the four dissenters, led by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, called the 
Texas statute "senseless" and agreed that "creating . . . a permanent caste . . 
. of illegal Mexican residents (was) disturbing" and probably more costly than 
educating them. They, nonetheless, could not find it unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The backers of Proposition 187 know all this, for they can read Supreme Court 
decisions, too. The "changed circumstance" they may be relying on is the 
markedly changed composition of the court since 1982. Justices Brennan, 
Thurgood Marshall and Powell, in the majority on Plyler, have been succeeded by 
conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony M. Kennedy. But a reversal is 
still unlikely. The key justice is likely to be Kennedy, and he has shown 
himself reluctant to overrule cases establishing rights, most notably in the 
1992 abortion decision, Planned Parenthood vs. Casey. 
</P>
<P>
 If the law becomes outdated, it should be changed. But the simple justice and 
sound policy that underlay Plyler vs. Doe are not outdated. The denial of basic 
education that Proposition 187 would produce today is as "senseless" and 
"unjust" as Texas' denial was in 1982 -- and it is just as unconstitutional.*

IS IT CURTAINS FOR THE CIA?; THE AGENCY IS IN FOR A BLOODLETTING. IT'S MORE 
THAN THE AMES CASE OR THE STRING OF BAD INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES. OR EVEN DISLIKE 
OF THE DIRECTOR. COLD WAR MISDEEDS ARE COMING BACK TO HAUNT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Powers, Thomas Powers, a contributing editor to Opinion, is the 
author of The Man Who Kept the Secrets: Richard Helms and the CIA (Knopf). His 
most recent book is Heisenberg's War: The Secret History of the German Bomb 
(Little Brown). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hour of truth has arrived for the Central Intelligence Agency. Three years 
after the Soviet Union dissolved while the stunned CIA was in mid-sentence, 
Congress is preparing for a long second look at the intelligence charter it 
approved in a climate of crisis in 1947. The first step is creation of a 
17-member commission, already approved by the Senate and pending in the House, 
to study U.S. intelligence needs and how they ought to be met. 
</P>
<P>
 No one at the CIA is in any doubt about what this means: The agency in its 
current form is no longer sacred. What it will look like at the end of the 
commission's reassessment, the size of its budget, even the name over the door 
-- all are in question. Intelligence professionals fear the worst. There is an 
appetite for bloodletting in Washington, fueled by the embarrassment of the 
Ames case; a sex-bias suit by female employees; a string of bad intelligence 
estimates; the agency's die-hard resistance to cutting its $3-billion budget; 
plain dislike of the agency's director, R. James Woolsey, by many legislators, 
and a growing belief that without the Soviet Union, the CIA has nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is there any lack of bright ideas circulating in Washington for a new and 
improved intelligence service, and perhaps two. For years, critics have 
proposed breaking the CIA in half. Some favor one organization to engage in 
secret intelligence activities, while a second writes up intelligence estimates 
using information from all sources. Other tinkerers would divide the existing 
agency differently -- between a secret collecting-and-analyzing arm and a 
separate body to conduct covert operations. 
</P>
<P>
 A few extremists, led by the sharp-tongued Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
(D-N.Y.), suggest dismantling the CIA altogether and going back to the simpler, 
pre-World War II days, when the State Department collected political 
intelligence, mainly at diplomatic cocktail parties, and the military kept 
track of foreign enemies, if any. 
</P>
<P>
 No consensus for reform yet exists, but discontent is high with Woolsey's 
pugnacious defense of the CIA. A widespread sense that something is badly wrong 
centers on the agency's numerous, in retrospect, flagrant, failures in handling 
the case of Aldrich H. Ames -- who has admitted spying for Moscow between 1986 
and his arrest earlier this year. At least 10 highly placed agents working for 
the CIA disappeared in the mid-1980s, but the CIA's internal investigators 
failed to read the implications of conspicuous spending by Ames, or to note 
many other clues. The Soviets penetrated every other major Western intelligence 
service during the Cold War, but it is doubtful that any other Soviet spy did 
as much damage, over so long a period, with the arguable exception of Kim 
Philby. 
</P>
<P>
 After the CIA's inspector general completed a 400-page report on the Ames 
case, which sharply criticized a dozen agency officials, Woolsey issued 
official reprimands criticizing their performance, but otherwise declined to 
punish the worst offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ames case is one of those highly visible gaffes no official agency could 
survive unscathed -- but even without it, the CIA would have been facing hard 
times. Despite huge growth during the Reagan years, to a peak of more than 
20,000 employees, the CIA failed to grasp what was happening to the Soviet 
Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Soviet Union broke up, it was apparent that the old Soviet 
Union was literally bankrupt, that the CIA had for years been overestimating 
the size of its economy and underestimating the crushing burden of military 
spending and that the agency did not know what to do with the thousands of 
analysts and covert operators focused on Moscow once the Soviet threat had 
disappeared. Almost until the Soviet Union's final moments, the CIA, under 
Robert M. Gates, had been darkly wondering if it all wasn't some elaborate 
trick. 
</P>
<P>
 When Woolsey took over in 1993, he inherited an old agency, huge and set in 
its ways, with which to monitor a new world. He argued that the United States 
confronted a host of new dangers -- each far less threatening than the old 
Soviet Union, perhaps, but harder to watch in the aggregate. The implication, 
which he defended with a lawyer's tenacity in budget hearings, was that the CIA 
couldn't function with less money and, in fact, needed more. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers were put out. They had been cutting Pentagon dollars -- spent in 
their home districts -- and they were impatient with Woolsey's claim that the 
CIA alone should prosper in the post-Cold War world. It is probably the CIA's 
resistance to change that is most directly responsible for Sen. John W. 
Warner's plan to rethink U.S. intelligence with the help of a commission armed 
with a broad mandate to put everything on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real source of this animosity is not bad public relations, 
intelligence estimates that miss the point or the failure to catch Ames in a 
timely manner. It is the Cold War itself -- the accumulated resentments of a 
long, expensive, frightening and sometimes ugly struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the Soviet Union was singled out as the greatest threat facing 
America, but the bear turned out to be toothless, no threat at all. Far from 
being grateful for this happy outcome, many Americans, including longtime 
critics of the CIA in the Congress, began to ask if this trip had been 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the Cold War could have ended long ago, if only the 
military-industrial complex, with the CIA at its heart, had quit sounding the 
alarm. The secret Soviet side of the Cold War is only beginning to emerge, 
while the CIA's role has been spilling out for decades. Beginning in the 1940s, 
the CIA intervened in foreign elections, backed anti-communist unions, secretly 
funded student groups and cultural organizations, planted news stories and 
published magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 After the principal arena of the Cold War shifted from Europe to the Third 
World, the CIA overthrew governments friendly to the Soviets, armed and 
directed secret armies in Southeast Asia, Africa, Central America. It trained 
foreign police forces that were sometimes used to crush local democratic 
forces. It provided foreign heads of state with secret slush funds, looked the 
other way when "friends" went into the drug smuggling business, energetically 
tried to murder the popular leaders of unfriendly countries and political 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of four decades worth of troubling headlines is long. In every case 
the CIA can fairly plead guilty with an explanation -- but democracies have 
short memories; they tend to forget the explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents and secretaries of state occupied the high ground of the Cold War, 
while the CIA did the dirty jobs intended to be kept secret forever. If the 
secrets got out anyway, the CIA was expected to protect the President by taking 
the blame, thus shrouding the true authors of U.S. policy in a blanket of 
"plausible deniability." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth of the matter is that the CIA never undertook a single major effort 
without the full and express authority of the President, but much that is known 
to have been done is still officially denied by Presidents and their defenders. 
Like an army demobilized after a war, the CIA has lost the mission that made it 
useful to policy-makers and finds itself alone. Friends in Congress no longer 
wield the clout they once did, and President Bill Clinton has his attention 
elsewhere. The stage is thus set, politically and emotionally, for major 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, is it possible that the new commission on U.S. intelligence will 
dismember or abolish the CIA? This has routinely been the fate of intelligence 
organizations in the past. The CIA's World War II predecessor, the Office of 
Strategic Services, was shut down and its functions scattered by President 
Harry S. Truman only two months after the surrender of Japan. After the breakup 
of the Soviet Union, the intelligence service was reorganized and renamed nine 
times before it resurfaced in its current form, as the Russian Intelligence 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Soviet intelligence chiefs were not only removed from office, but shot. 
Woolsey need not fear a firing squad but his job is certainly in jeopardy; and 
it is hard to imagine how Les Aspin, the former secretary of defense who is 
expected to head the commission, would be content to spend 18 months simply 
redrawing the arrows on organizational charts of the U.S. intelligence 
community. It is probably safe to predict that from Aspin's efforts there will 
emerge something different, something smaller and something with a new name. 
</P>
<P>
 But it remains to be seen whether these changes will be cosmetic or real. U.S. 
Presidents have grown accustomed to instant information, not just satellite 
photos but the most intimate communications of foreign leaders. In crises, they 
want someone on the ground, as in Haiti. When a new face emerges in an 
important foreign government, they want some background history, and they want 
it yesterday. When they want to send a genuinely secret message, they want 
somebody at hand who knows where the back doors are. U.S. Presidents will not 
want to surrender any of these capabilities, and congressional leaders will not 
force them to do it. What Congress wants is to pay less for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to predict what the intelligence commission is likely to do in 
the end is to consider who will be the tenant of the CIA's huge headquarters in 
Langley, Va., with its vast files and technical capabilities. The CIA's campus 
is not going to be returned to woodland, the building is not going to have a 
second life as a GSA furniture warehouse and the desks are not going to be 
vacant. Sitting at every one of them, in fact, and answering every phone, will 
be someone in the intelligence business, whatever the name on the door.*

THE WORLD; WHY SOUTH AFRICA'S SUCCESS STORY CAN'T BE DUPLICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Clough and Nancy Bodurtha, Michael Clough is a senior fellow at the 
Council on Foreign Relations. Nancy Bodurtha is a program associate at the

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, Nelson Mandela came to the United States to celebrate the triumph 
of democracy in South Africa -- and raise investment money for his country. As 
far as Bill Clinton was concerned, he could not have come at a better time. 
With the Administration's foreign policy under heavy attack, and the verdict 
still out on its intervention in Haiti, the South African success story is one 
that the President and his advisers are eager to trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
 For many senior officials in the Clinton Administration, South Africa is both 
a beacon of hope and a model to be replicated in the struggle for democracy 
around the world. The President made precisely this point in thanking Mandela 
for agreeing to meet with Haiti's soon-to-be-restored President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. He observed that the Mandela delegation should provide the Haitian 
people with proof "that you can bring a country where there have been deep, 
even bloody divisions together . . . in a spirit of freedom, reconciliation, 
democracy and mutual respect." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House can justifiably declare South Africa a success and claim 
credit for putting in place policies that will help to ensure that it remains 
one. It will take a lot of "bread and work" before the country's fledgling 
democracy is secure. But the progress that Mandela's government has made in 
gaining broad-based public support and instituting sound policies is truly 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it is unclear whether the South African success story can be as easily 
replicated in Haiti and elsewhere as Clinton hopes. More important for 
policy-makers, is it unwise -- indeed, foolish -- to use such achievements to 
justify approaches that place great faith in external pressure as an agent of 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarkable reconciliation in South Africa that allowed blacks and whites 
to overcome centuries of hate and distrust to come together and elect a 
multiracial government was not the result of external intervention, either 
divine or American. Rather, it was the product of a long internal struggle that 
was fought in the townships of South Africa and in the minds of Afrikaners. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Frederik W. de Klerk and his followers accepted the necessity 
of ending apartheid only after they recognized that it could no longer be 
defended, save at a cost that was too high for even the racist die-hard. While 
international sanctions certainly accelerated this outcome, it was the 
anti-apartheid movement's long campaign, best symbolized by the 27 years 
Mandela spent in jail, that created the circumstances in which external 
pressures made a difference. And when the time came to settle up, there were 
only South Africans sitting around the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela and De Klerk, along with their constituents, concluded that an 
agreement that protected the legitimate interests of both sides was not just 
the only way to end violence; it was also necessary for their potentially rich 
country to prosper. It is also quite significant that black leaders never 
expected, nor demanded, that the old white rulers leave the country -- or stand 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating similar conditions in countries that have neither South Africa's long 
history of struggle nor its leaders' shared sense of mutual interest is not 
easy. External pressure and support can, as it did in South Africa, help to 
reinforce pre-existing internal movement toward reconciliation and democracy. 
But it cannot substitute for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The truly remarkable extent of U.S. support for South Africa's drive to build 
a viable democracy is also the result of unusual circumstances. Mandela and 
South Africa have captured the imagination of most Americans in a way that no 
other foreign leader or country has. More important, many Americans became 
personally involved in assisting black South Africans. As a result, they 
developed a stake in the success of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-existing emotional and political ties are now being reinforced by the 
perception that support for South Africa makes good economic sense. Last week's 
announcement that a group of prominent African-American investors, among them 
actor Danny Glover and basketball star Shaquille O'Neal, have become partners 
in a Pepsi-Cola bottling-plant venture represents exactly the kind of shift 
from anti-apartheid politics to pro-development politics that Mandela and 
Clinton are eager to encourage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, no other country in the world where democracy is beginning to 
take root can claim a broad-based U.S. constituency of support -- and without 
such a constituency, it is going to be difficult, if not impossible, for the 
Clinton Administration to provide the kinds of assistance to Haiti and to other 
countries that it is providing to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The lessons to be learned from South Africa are twofold. First, where the 
preconditions for a lasting settlement do not exist, the best option is to 
concentrate on strengthening democratic forces already at play rather than on 
using U.S. might to force a premature accommodation. Unfortunately, such a 
policy requires a degree of patience seldom found in politicians, who are eager 
to bask in the glow of dramatic breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, government efforts to promote democracy abroad are unlikely to succeed 
unless they enjoy strong and broad support at home. It is thus a serious 
mistake to believe that presidential action can rally support after the fact of 
an intervention, as Clinton apparently thinks he can do in Haiti.*

THE WORLD; BEHIND MEXICO'S VIOLENCE: THE RISE OF MIDDLE-MAN DRUG CARTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Policy Institute at the New School for Social Research and is an associate

<P>
 Once again, the assassination of a politician is raising troubling questions 
about the power and influence of Mexico's drug cartels in the country's 
politics. In August, a for mer deputy to the Mexican attorney general warned 
that drug traffickers have forged links with prominent members of the 
government and police and may have been behind the assassination of 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. Now, the slaying of Jose Francisco 
Ruiz Massieu, the deputy leader of the ruling party, seems to add credence to 
the earlier warning: His brother is deputy attorney general for drug 
investigations and he was apparently killed by a gunman hired by an in-law of a 
top lieutenant of the Gulf Cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 Both assassinations struck down close associates of President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari, whose approach to political reform seems to have put his allies at 
risk. The power of Mexico's traditional political leaders -- from labor boss to 
regional and local cacique of the Institutional Revolutionary Party -- is 
eroding. Meanwhile, shake-ups in the attorney general's office have put the 
heat on drug traffickers, who once could count on a free hand by bribing 
government officials. With common enemies, and often common interests, corrupt 
politicians in the PRI's old guard and police commanders are making common 
cause with the drug cartels to block Mexico's transition to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the growing political violence is a revolution in the structure of 
drug trafficking. Before Salinas, the Mexican drug business was largely a 
domestic affair. Marijuana and opium poppies, grown in the Mexican Sierras, was 
the primary exports. During the administration of President Miguel del la 
Madrid (1982-1988), the Mexican army routinely staged spectacular incinerations 
of impounded marijuana. Yet, no serious attempts were made to seize the drug 
lords. As illustrated in the case of Enrique Camarena, the Drug Enforcement 
Agent murdered by Rafael Caro Quintero's Guadalajara Cartel, collusion between 
influential members of the government and drug traffickers was widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of Salinas' administration, a number of changes radically 
altered the drug picture. For one, Salinas moved against the drug kingpins. 
Quintero was apprehended and imprisoned, along with several lesser-known 
traffickers. Second, a transformation in the drug business itself was under 
way. Colombian traffickers, who had relied primarily on Caribbean routes to 
deliver cocaine to the United States, began shifting their operations westward. 
With their links in Cuba and the Bahamas under increasing scrutiny, they began 
focusing on the U.S.-Mexican border. The outcome was the rise to prominence of 
new cartels, consisting chiefly of middle men engaged in transshipment. At one 
end of the U.S.-Mexico border, the cocaine trade fed the rise of the Tijuana 
Cartel, led by the Arellano Felix brothers. At the other end, in Tamaulipas, it 
fueled the Gulf Cartel, under Juan Garcia Abrego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian connection has, in turn, introduced new elements into the 
relationship between the government and drug traffickers in Mexico. The switch 
to cocaine has multiplied the amount of money involved by several orders of 
magnitude, leaving greater sums with which to secure the cooperation of 
corruptible officials. By raising the stakes, it has also led to the 
introduction of heretofore unimaginable violence. In the past, hits were 
confined to rivals and nosy journalists. Now, as in Colombia, the circle of 
violence has been extended to government officials who are perceived to be 
threats to what is now Mexico's most profitable -- albeit illegal -- business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arellano Felix brothers are wanted in the murder of Cardinal Juan Jesus 
Posadas Ocampo of Guadalajara. Humberto Garcia Abrego, brother of the Gulf 
Cartel kingpin, has been arrested in connection with the assassination of Ruiz 
Massieu. Significantly, neither the Arellano brothers nor Juan Garcia Abrego 
have been caught. Earlier this year, an attempt to nab a lieutenant of the 
Tijuana Cartel ended in disaster when a team of federal judicial police was 
ambushed by state judicial police. The team leader was killed, the mobster 
escaped. The incident underscored the extent to which traffickers have 
infiltrated the police. The fact that no serious attempt has been made to seize 
the Arellanos themselves suggests they may have friends in high places. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' reluctance to pursue wider political reforms limited his ability to 
confront the threat of drug traffickers allied with corrupt PRI politicians. 
Most notably, he abided by an unwritten rule of Mexico's political elite: under 
no circumstances may present and former members of the Cabinet be investigated 
for corruption. Such impunity has two dangerous consequences. One, it makes it 
easier for drug traffickers to buy protection from officials who have much to 
gain and little to lose by collaborating. Second, it enhances the power of 
well-placed enemies of reform, providing them greater latitude to sabotage 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which confronts the new president, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, with 
a vexing problem: How to outmaneuver the increasingly dangerous adversaries of 
reform without jeopardizing the stability of the country. The PRI's old guard 
and the drug cartels are, in effect, offering him both a carrot and a stick to 
slow down reform. The carrot is the vital support provided Zedillo in a 
difficult campaign. The stick is the implicit message delivered by recent 
assassinations. In the past year and a half, three men at the pinnacle of 
church and state have been killed: a cardinal, a virtual heir to the presidency 
and a congressional leader. If these could be hit, anyone could. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo thus cannot afford to hold on to his predecessor's compromise. If he 
is to root out the web of corruption that enables mobsters and crooked party 
bosses to play politics, he will have to end the policy of impunity for Cabinet 
members. Measures that only affect subordinates just increase the danger to 
reformers. By investigating and, where necessary, indicting corrupt ministers, 
Zedillo can simultaneously remove key adversaries, reduce the influence of the 
drug cartels and deliver a powerful warning to all government officials about 
the costs of breaking the law. True, this risks splitting the party that 
carried him to the presidency, but he now has a broader mandate: that of 
political reform conferred by Mexicans of all political persuasions.*

THE NATION; GOP STANDS READY TO CAPITALIZE ON NATION'S GROWING CONSERVATIVE 
MOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James A. Baker III, James A. Baker III was secretary of state from 
1989-1992.

<P>
 Just over a month from now, if the opinion polls are right, Election Day could 
be a banner day for the Republican Party around the country -- especially in 
federal races. The GOP is in a good position to recapture the Senate, where it 
is only seven seats shy of a majority. Even in the House, a bastion of 
Democratic control for four decades, the GOP has an outside shot at picking up 
the 40 seats needed to elect Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) the first GOP Speaker 
since Joseph W. Martin Jr. in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 This is true not just in the Congress but also at the state and local levels. 
Indeed, the big four states of California, Texas, New York, and Florida may all 
have Republican governors next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the November elections provide Republicans an opportunity to 
begin building a new governing coalition of conservatives and moderates.  
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, any number of reasons why Republicans should be 
optimistic -- though not complacent -- about next month's elections. 
Redistricting, on balance, works in the GOP's favor. Republicans will also 
benefit from one of the iron laws of U.S. politics: The party of the President, 
even popular ones like Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, loses 
congressional seats in off-year elections. 
</P>
<P>
 With most congressional incumbents being Democrats, Republicans stand ready to 
tap the anti-incumbency fever gripping the country. The angry national mood 
against Washington will work against congressional Democrats, many of whom have 
grown remote from their constituencies and disdainful of reform after decades 
of nearly unchallenged rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the GOP should be able to capitalize on the unprecedented 
unpopularity of the President himself, especially in the South and West. Part 
of this, no doubt, is due to the President's leftward "old Democrat" approach 
to policy and personnel; part is a result of the Administration's style of 
governing, where late night, collegial sessions over pizza often take the place 
of the councils of government, and part is the result of a confused foreign 
policy. But the depth of the animosity exhibited against the President seems to 
go deeper than partisan politics -- to the core of his leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
 More important for the long-term, however, Republicans have an opportunity to 
help shape a growing conservatism among American voters. That conservatism 
shows up in poll after poll, where Americans are on record for tougher measures 
against crime, stricter welfare regulations and a return to traditional values 
like personal responsibility, hard work and obligation to family. More 
generally, increasing numbers of Americans are profoundly mistrustful of 
government, especially at the federal level. They believe it has grown too 
large, too expensive and too intrusive in their lives.  
</P>
<P>
 This rising public skepticism about the role of government is the fundamental 
reason for the spectacular failure of the Administration's health-care 
proposal. Much as most Americans lauded the President's goals of universal 
coverage and cost-containment, they drew back, rightly, at the prospect of 
turning the nation's health-care system over to federal bureaucrats. It wasn't 
the special interests or GOP obstructionism that doomed the Clinton health-care 
plan. The plan itself was simply unacceptable to a citizenry wary of too much 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 This growing conservative mood does not translate into a strict ideological 
majority. The balance of U.S. political power in general elections remains 
where it has always been: with the tens of millions of moderates. Now, however, 
those moderates share a range of convictions -- on crime, welfare, values and, 
above all, the role of government -- that resonate far more among conservatives 
than liberals.  
</P>
<P>
 And because they do, Republicans possess a real opportunity -- this fall and 
then, in 1996, at the presidential level -- of building a governing coalition 
of moderates and conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest governments in America have been the result of coalitions. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt's coalition of the center-left brought in the New Deal 
and forever altered the shape of American society. Reagan's own coalition, of 
the center-right, ushered in sweeping changes, leading to the creation of more 
than 20 million jobs, the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history and 
ultimately the end of the East-West confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believed that Bill Clinton's election in 1992 had revealed the 
possibility of creating yet another governing coalition of the center-left. 
Such predictions, it is now clear, were premature. Indeed, the record of the 
Administration over the last 20 months irrefutably demonstrates that no 
workable center-left coalition exists. The reason is simple. Moderates have 
moved right. Liberals have not. 
</P>
<P>
 This is true even within the Democratic Party. Democratic congressional 
leaders have tried to blame Republicans for the failure of much of the 
Administration's domestic agenda -- especially health-care reform. But their 
arguments ring hollow. Clinton's legislative failures occurred in a Congress 
where both houses are firmly controlled by his own party. Again and again, the 
Administration attempted to build coalitions between the party's liberals and 
moderates -- and often failed. Even the Administration's "successes" -- on the 
budget in 1993 and the crime bill this year -- invariably saw dozens of 
congressional Democrats, many of them moderates, voting against the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, many of these moderate Democrats, especially from the South and 
West, are vulnerable this fall. In contrast, some of the most liberal 
congressional voices hold "safe" seats. This means that next year, the 
congressional Democratic Party might well be even more liberal and even more 
incapable of reaching out to a moderate-center to govern. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, Republicans must do more than capitalize on the Clinton 
Administration's failures. In the best scenario for Republicans, we will gain 
control of both houses. Another scenario, could be that Democrats will hold 
nominal control of the House and the Senate, but Republicans and conservative 
Democrats will have an excellent opportunity to control the policy agenda from 
time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 In either of these cases, Republicans will have to provide the American people 
an alternative vision for this country. The GOP will have to develop an agenda 
to govern that both reflects core conservative beliefs and appeals to moderates 
disillusioned with the Democratic Party and dubious about big government.  
</P>
<P>
 In this regard, the recent "Contract with America" issued by House Republicans 
is an important document. The "contract" contains several of the essential 
tenets of a reinvigorated conservatism: term limits; a balanced budget 
amendment; a strong national defense, and using the free market, not 
bureaucrats, to spur economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Some liberal commentators have criticized the "Contract with America" for its 
"Reaganism." This should come as no surprise -- demonizing the Reagan years has 
become something of a cottage industry on the left. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in a way, the critics are right. The "contract" is full of the spirit of 
Reagan. It is firmly rooted in conservative principles and optimistic about 
America's future. But above all, by laying out an agenda with potential appeal 
to tens of millions of both moderate and conservative voters, it is a GOP 
promise to govern. In doing so, it gives voters who already had a reason to 
vote against the Democratic Congress and the Clinton Administration a reason to 
vote for Republicans in Congress.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; JULIUS SHULMAN; CAPTURING THE ESSENCE OF 
CALIFORNIA ARCHITECTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt is a producer for Fox News and a contributor 
to National Public Radio's All Things Considered and Morning Edition. He spoke 
with Julius Shulman at the photographer's home in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1960, Julius Shulman took a photograph that, perhaps more than any other 
single image, conveys the style, grace and allure of postwar Los Angeles. 
Inside a steel-topped glass box balanced lightly on a hilltop, two young women 
in white cotton chat, while the City of Angels sparkles below. It is a picture 
both nostalgic and modern, the work of a self-taught photographer who truly 
invented himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1936, Shulman used a vest-pocket Kodak to snap a shot of a Hollywood home 
designed by architect Richard Neutra. A brash 26-year-old, he showed the 
picture to Neutra, and a career was born. Neutra hired him to photograph some 
of his other projects, and introduced the young photographer to such other 
leading West Coast architects as R.M. Schindler, Raphael Soriano and Gregory 
Ain. Shulman's dramatic prints played an important role in establishing an 
international reputation for these and other Southern California architects, 
especially during the '50s, a period many consider the golden age of Modernism. 
More than any architect of that era, he created a public image of the 
California style of design. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because he never had formal training, Shulman worked intuitively, 
eschewing light meters and fancy light-reflecting umbrellas, and relying on 
nature. Yet, he was a master manipulator, often working at twilight, creating 
long exposures, opening and closing the lens, while turning lights on and off, 
to create texture and contrast. His clients often expressed surprise when 
seeing his images, for Shulman created a vision even they, as the creating 
architects, had never seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Shulman, who turns 84 tomorrow, lives with his wife, Olga, in a steel-frame 
house designed, in 1949, for them by Soriano. Long walls of glass contrast with 
corrugated sheet-steel siding. The house is hidden within two heavily wooded 
acres in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Shulman announced his retirement, in part as a way of expressing his 
distaste for post-modernist design. But the lure of the lens was too strong, 
and now, back at work, he's busier than ever. A retrospective of his early 
photographs is currently on view at the Craig Krull gallery in Santa Monica, 
and a biography, "A Constructed View: The Architectural Photographs of Julius 
Shulman," by Joseph Rosa, has been published by Rizzoli. Inside his 
studio-office, Shulman shows off prints and publications, bouncing around the 
room with the energy of a teen-ager, promising not to retire until he hits 120. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What were the elements that came together to make the 1950s so 
robust in terms of architecture in the Los Angeles area?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I'd say, first, the economy. The '50s were glorious years . . . . The 
population was booming -- people were coming to Los Angeles from all over the 
world. And architects were given free rein. They were allowed to experiment, 
not in the way that is being done today -- these horrible monstrosities being 
made in the name of post-modernism -- but with integrity. The architects of 
this period, people like Richard Neutra, Pierre Koenig, Gregory Ain -- they 
respected the client. Every line they drew was drawn with the client in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the great years and the result was that, throughout the world, 
there was a recognition of these architects' work. I was lucky to be doing the 
right thing at the right place at the right time. So anytime, anybody wanted a 
photograph of a modern house, Uncle Julius provided the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you describe the essence of the design philosophy of these '50s 
Californian architects?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I have to backtrack a little to answer that. In the 1930s, it was the 
heyday of what we call the International style. Architects like Richard Neutra, 
Raphael Soriano -- these men were following a very austere, Bauhaus kind of 
practice. The result was that many architects who followed people like Neutra 
began to edit that style of architecture, by doing things like literally 
raising the roof. They said, "We don't have to have just a box, let's add a 
little character to the design." 
</P>
<P>
 And that was one of the things that happened during the '50s, and right up to 
the '60s. Soriano, for example, who did my house, used an all-steel framework. 
During the earthquake -- it was a shattering, powerful quake -- we had not a 
crack. I am indebted to Soriano for his discipline in using those steel frames. 
The earthquake has proven this type of architecture is completely successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Soriano didn't have a client for 25 years. The public didn't recognize 
his work; they didn't buy it. But other architects modified the austerity, 
began to create more space with higher ceilings, sloping roof lines, and 
created some character. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So would you say that, in the 1950s, California architects held on to the 
framework of the Bauhaus, and humanized it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. The dominant feature of contemporary architecture in the '50s was 
glass. My house has two window walls, which are 30 feet long. That's great for 
us, because we are on a large piece of property, surrounded by a jungle. But, 
as my wife has always said, put this house on a 50-foot lot on a city street, 
and it would be a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Soriano once built a house in Long Beach on a normal, city-street lot. The 
bathroom faced the street, and he walled it with obscure glass -- textured 
glass. He told the owner she didn't need draperies because of the obscure 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved in, had a open house to meet her neighbors, and one of them said to 
her, "I hope we can be friendly and tell you this. We admire your figure when 
you take a shower." The obscure glass provided a perfect view of her 
silhouette. The next day she got draperies. 
</P>
<P>
 So the architects who came down the line refined the architecture. They 
designed with less glass, more solid walls, more space. And the result was an 
architecture that became popular throughout the world. You could almost say it 
was an evolution in design, to fit the needs of more and more people. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happened in the '60s and '70s? Why did modernism in architecture fall 
into disfavor and disuse?  
</P>
<P>
 A: One of the reasons was that the public-at-large still didn't buy the work 
of contemporary architects. And by the '70s, a new breed of architect came on 
the scene -- represented by men like Frank Gehry and Michael Graves and even 
Charles Moore -- who introduced a sloping, high-cathedral-ceiling kind of 
design. People began to say, "Hey, this is good," because these designs didn't 
have the walls of glass like the '40s and '50s designs did. The result was that 
they began to accept what I call "weird architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 And, right now, we are in still another transition. Even architects like Gehry 
are beginning to reform their designs. He admits that he is an experimenter, 
and his work is often not well-received by the public. Nowadays, the elite -- 
the people who can afford it -- they want something "different." They are 
getting it. And they are paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's turn back to your career, and the way you use the camera. You've said 
the camera is not important when it comes to taking a picture. What do you 
mean?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The camera is the least important element in our work. Photography is 
dependent on the eye, the mind, the heart and the soul of the photographer. 
Many times, even architects aren't aware of the presence of their structures, 
and they will ask, "How did you get this picture?" 
</P>
<P>
 In 1937, the architect Stile Clements, one of the old-timers, had done the 
Coulters Department Store on Wilshire (razed in 1980). The building faced 
north. He called me -- it was late in June -- and asked me to photograph it. 
But he said there was a problem: Because it faced north, he thought I wouldn't 
get any sunlight on the face of the building. I didn't say anything other than 
that I could photograph it. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, being a good Boy Scout, I knew that the sun rises in the summertime in 
the northeast and sets in the northwest. Architects often don't know these 
things. And so I went down early one Sunday morning -- I do most of my public 
buildings on Sunday when there is less traffic, especially in those days. I set 
up my camera across the street, the sun was beaming across the north face of 
the building, and I made an 8x10 photograph. I gave it to Clements the next 
week and he said, "How did you do this, I thought the sun didn't hit the north 
side of the building?" And I said, "Oh, it was easy Mr. Clements, I just turned 
the building to face the sun." 
</P>
<P>
 The point is that I have always tried to be conscious of the site, the 
direction of the sun -- by the minute. I learned to look at a building and know 
exactly what time of day to photograph, to best reflect and define the quality 
of the architecture. It has nothing to do with snapping a shutter. My 
photography is based on the quality of my vision, my feeling for nature, the 
site and location of a building and what was around the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You almost always include people in your photographs, something fairly 
unique to you in architectural photography. Why people in a picture of a 
building?  
</P>
<P>
 A: For scale, and also to create a feeling of occupancy. When I photograph, 
for instance, a university building, I will round up some young people and put 
them in places where they fill in voids in the space. Without the people, you 
would get a flat, vacant, austere photograph. Sometimes, I will tell people, 
"OK, that's it, we're all through" -- and just as they start to move and walk 
away, that's when I actually take the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your photograph of the Pierre Koenig house is, to me, an almost perfect 
expression of the optimism of the 1950s -- the house cantilevered over the city 
below, and the two women so breezy and sleek and sophisticated. Did you know 
how dramatic this photograph would be when you took it then?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, people just love to see that picture. It represents a quality of 
architecture and photography that is not very well-observed. But the ironic 
thing is that when I took the exposure in my 4x5 camera, I honestly didn't know 
what I had. I saw something -- a mood and a scene. But I didn't realize I had 
made what would literally be one of my masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It seems silly to ask, but who are those two women?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Pierre Koenig, the architect, told me he wanted to bring some of his 
students when I photographed the house, and I told him to have them bring their 
girlfriends; I'll use them as models. I never imagined this picture, though -- 
we were doing photographs of the interior of the house. Then I happened to step 
outside, and I saw the view, and the girls in the house, chatting. I thought, 
"Wow, this might make a fine picture!" So I set my camera up outside, turned 
the lights off in the house, and exposed the film for about seven minutes, to 
capture the lights of the city below. Then we set off a flash inside the house 
to get the girls on film, and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So it's a composite -- an image the human eye itself could never experience 
in reality?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Exactly. And can you believe that until I read the title of the new book 
about me by Joseph Rosa -- "A Constructed View" -- did I understand that is 
exactly what I was doing for these 59 years: I construct my view of a building. 
My wife has always said that I capture a moment which can never be reproduced. 
No photographer could go back to that Koenig house and reconstruct that 
photograph -- no matter how hard he tried. It was a secret, wonderful moment in 
my life. It almost makes you feel religious -- thank God, I'm an atheist! 
</P>
<P>
 You know, I've never used an exposure meter. I often use natural, reflected 
light. I rely on nature, and the picture comes out because I know the value and 
quality of the film I'm using. I feel blessed that I've been ordained, if you 
will, to do this kind of photography and not only make a success out of it, but 
to create a success for the architects as well.*

RAZING OLYMPIC SWIM STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's unfortunate that there are no professional sports, as we know them, that 
can provide an event which utilizes a swimming pool. If there was one, the '32 
Olympic swim facility would be saved, not razed (Oct. 3). The powers that be 
need to know how historic this pool is.  
</P>
<P>
 It is doubtful that a natatorium will ever again achieve the record of the 
famous Los Angeles swim stadium. In August, 1949, more than 25,000 paying 
spectators saw the Japanese pick up where they left off in 1932. Hironoshin 
Furuhashi set four world records in as many days and his teammate, Shiro 
Hashizume, set two in a spectacular event that was witnessed by an enthusiastic 
crowd that overflowed the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 From that year on, swimmers from the Los Angeles area began their climb to 
world dominance. And it was the swim stadium that was to be the base for their 
climb. In 1956, the Los Angeles Athletic Club named Peter Daland to head its 
swimming program. Then, when he was named new head coach at USC, to replace 
Fred Cady in 1958, the swim stadium became the home pool for the Trojans. It 
was the quest of every swimmer, who knew that this pool had lanes paved with 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 This ancient guildhall of great swimming has recorded 65 world records, the 
last being back in 1970. No other pool in the United States, or the world for 
that matter, comes close to this record tally. The '32 swim stadium is a part 
of Los Angeles and U.S. aquatic history.

 * We appreciated the opportunity to give your reporter the background on the 
earthquake/FEMA status of the Los Angeles swim stadium. In that otherwise 
accurate article, we must clarify the statement that "perhaps a wading pool for 
the seniors and handicapped" would be included as a part of a new project. 
</P>
<P>
 The requests for an outdoor wading pool came from parents of infants and those 
wishing for a place to relax in the outdoors. Discussions regarding swim 
programs, swim classes and special swim times for seniors and handicapped 
persons have nothing to do with providing a separate wading pool. Of course, 
everyone would be welcome in the main pool (whether it winds up indoors or 
outdoors, 50-meters or longer/shorter)! 
</P>
<P>
 With regard to your Oct. 4 editorial, "Don't Take the Plunge Without a Site," 
unfortunately, the Department of Recreation and Parks did not have the same 
opportunity to present the facts with respect to the inference that any 
department or office of the city is interested in any trade-off of swim 
facilities for parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 We have never considered giving up, nor has anyone had the nerve to ask us to 
give up, the swim stadium for a parking lot or parking structure. Furthermore, 
that issue is not a part of negotiations with either the Raiders or the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 We have been asked to do the work necessary to provide the maximum dollars and 
the maximum options to the community so it can determine just what should be 
done with this wonderful "opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the editorial stated that "on summer days, as many as 1,400 swimmers 
used the facility," overall the facility is grossly underutilized, and 
incredibly expensive (over $100 per swimmer) for the city to operate. A new 
indoor facility, size to be determined by the community, could dramatically 
increase the number of swimmers, the hours during which they can swim, and the 
months during which they swim (the city's cost per swimmer could be under $1). 
Also note that a new facility could include amenities like a weight-training 
room, basketball, aerobics, wading pool and other community rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that the existing pool could be kept open until the new 
facility is completed. Alternative sites have been reviewed and are within a 
few hundred yards of the existing pool, and within Exposition Park.

</P>
<P>
 As chairman of the Master Plan Committee of the California Museum of Science 
and Industry (the 6th Agricultural District of the State of California), which 
is charged with the management of Exposition Park, I fully concur with the 
proposition that the community deserves, and should have, a new pool 
appropriate to its needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The community is currently blessed with various leaders who communicate with 
one another. Although the property may indeed be that of the state, the funds 
to improve it with a quality swim stadium are part of the Recreation and Parks 
Department of Los Angeles. Working together with the additional help of the 
county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, we expect to work toward a design 
that is suitable to the needs of the community.  
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, Mayor Richard Riordan, Assemblywoman Marguerite 
Archie-Hudson, state Sens. Diane Watson and Teresa Hughes, Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, and Burke are all to be commended for their willingness to work 
together to bring a year-round full-service facility. Lest there be any doubt, 
it will be located in Exposition Park.

PROPOSITION 186: SHOULD CALIFORNIA BE A GUINEA PIG?; INITIATIVE WOULD ESTABLISH 
AN UNWISE STATE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 186, the ballot initiative that would establish a new system of 
paying for health care in California, sprang from a deep well of understandable 
frustration over the crazy-quilt system that exists now. Americans for the last 
two years have heard President Clinton articulate what's wrong with the 
nation's health care insurance system: too expensive, too unreliable, too 
exclusionary. That said, Proposition 186 is a mix of medicines that no good 
doctor would prescribe: Some of it works but a lot of it is inadequately 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186, called the California Health Security Act, would provide 
health insurance to all legal residents of California starting in 1996. Health 
insurance cards would allow Californians to get care from "any willing 
professional provider" -- much the way Medicare works now, proponents say. The 
range of benefits would be comprehensive -- more generous than those offered 
under Clinton's ill-fated Health Security Act. The significant costs of 
Proposition 186 would be covered, according to the initiative, by $40 billion 
to $50 billion generated annually by hikes in payroll, income and cigarette 
taxes. Proponents suggest the costs are no more than what Californians already 
are paying in health insurance premiums, co-payments, deductibles and insurance 
company paperwork and overhead costs. The proposition would also create a 
powerful statewide elected official, the health commissioner, who would be 
responsible for overseeing the new health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of a health care system that covers everyone and jettisons layers 
of insurance paperwork is viscerally appealing, but 186 contains some serious 
drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 THE UNKNOWN: Although it often is compared to Canada's well-tested 
single-payer insurance system, Proposition 186 would in fact be an untested 
massive government program for a single state. In contrast to the situation in 
Canada, where all of the provincial (state) governments participate, 
Proposition 186 would affect California alone among the states -- at least in 
the short term; in actuality, the long-term political purpose behind 186 is to 
use California as the guinea pig for national single-payer insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent state legislative analyst's office points out that the state 
would need permission from the federal government to include in any new health 
care system those programs currently supported in whole or in part by federal 
money (such as Medi-Cal and Medicare). Also, the state would probably need a 
congressional exemption from a federal law governing employers that provide 
worker benefits; without the exemption the proposition's 4.4%-to-8.9% payroll 
tax could be void. And without that payroll tax revenue, there wouldn't be 
enough cash to finance a wide-ranging state system. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if all proposed taxes were implemented and collected smoothly, there's 
hot debate among health economists as to whether Proposition 186 would generate 
enough money -- especially during lean economic years -- to provide 
comprehensive care to every legal Californian. (The definition of "legal 
resident" itself is uncomfortably murky.) And while the opponents' estimate of 
300,000 lost jobs may be too high, there's no doubt that the payroll tax indeed 
would be another incentive for business to downsize or simply move to another 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 THE KNOWN: The health commissioner, as the post is set forth in Proposition 
186, would be a politician to be reckoned with. He or she would negotiate 
rates, fees and prices with doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. 
And if those fees and prices couldn't be agreed on, the commissioner could 
single-handedly set them. 
</P>
<P>
 The first commissioner would be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the 
Legislature; thereafter the commissioner would stand for election every four 
years and have little or no obligation to respond to government's normal checks 
and balances. To advise on medical policy issues there would be a Health Care 
Policy Advisory Board, which the commissioner would appoint; to oversee 
regional contracts and budgets there would be regional administrators, 
appointed by the commissioner; to investigate complaints there would be 
regional consumer advocates, also appointed by the commissioner. Good deal for 
whoever would become health commissioner. But we're not persuaded that 
Proposition 186 is a good deal for California, and thus we urge a "no" vote.

AWARDS TO EDUCATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a 1987 recipient of the Milken Family Foundation National Educator Award, I 
was pleased to see the colorful and insightful article by Bob Pool (Sept. 29) 
about two outstanding Los Angeles-area educators who had just been paid 
surprise visits by Lowell Milken and told, as admiring students looked on, that 
they had been selected to receive this prestigious award as well as $25,000 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 What your reporter could not know is the long-term effect this award has had 
on me and others like me.I have gained so much from the Milken Family 
Foundation's continued outreach and nurturing. Each spring we recipients from 
around the country are invited to the Milken National Education Conference, 
where we are treated to high-caliber professional development opportunities -- 
speeches, workshops, discussion groups, demonstrations, networking. (This last 
spring, the theme was "Technology in Education.") 
</P>
<P>
 After each conference I return a better teacher; there's a direct correlation. 
Not only am I able to share what I've learned with students and colleagues, but 
I'm re-imbued with a strong sense of professional pride.

<P>
 After reading Police Chief Willie Williams' response to the meddling by 
Councilmen Nate Holden and Zev Yaroslavsky in the personnel affairs of the 
Police Department (Oct. 1), I can only express praise and offer my highest 
compliments to the chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine what anger would be generated if the chief were to object to the 
firing of an aide in either of these councilmen's offices? I would hate to have 
to go where they would consign the chief.It's the old story . . . it all 
depends on whose ox is being gored.

 How about letting the man do the job he was hired for.

benefit Assistant Chief Bernard C. Parks of the LAPD (Sept. 29) are 
overstepping their authority and undermining Williams' authority. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter Parks' expertise and loyal service to Los Angeles -- if he cannot 
work (get along) with Williams' methods, then he has to walk.

<P>
 * What a difference a couple of years makes. When Daryl Gates headed the LAPD, 
everyone wanted to micromanage him and you were pleased that the ACLU-headed 
Police Commission was constantly battling with him. Now you have done a 
180-degree flip-flop, and are saying no one should second- guess Williams 
(editorial, Oct. 3). 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it, Williams has not been a success in improving the LAPD. Morale 
is down and although Mayor Riordan has found the money, Williams has failed to 
develop a plan on how to add the extra police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't two years long enough for a honeymoon? If Williams can't do the job, 
let's admit it and get someone who can.

QUAKE FUNDS FOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recent articles (Sept. 19, 20 and 22) have mischaracterized my actions 
regarding the allocation of $47 million in housing funds. The position that I 
advocated was done in a fair manner, would have boosted, not cut, the amount of 
aid that city staff recommended for earthquake-impacted areas, and sought to 
protect the interests of the city as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Aug. 17 vote on the housing funds resulted through a fair process. 
The vote was noticed 72 hours in advance and action was taken in the full light 
of day on the council floor in a public forum. The Times acknowledged this fact 
in its Aug. 23 editorial by noting that the item was posted on the agenda five 
days before the council meeting. Five of the seven Valley representatives were 
present at the start of the session. If the missing council members had 
concerns about the council taking up the item during their absence, they should 
have communicated them to me, the chairman of the Housing and Community 
Redevelopment (HCR) Committee, or my staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the amount of aid for the quake-impacted Valley areas would have been 
boosted under my proposal, not cut. The staff of the Community Redevelopment 
Agency (CRA) had recommended $8 million. I sought to increase it to $15 
million, $7 million more than recommended! 
</P>
<P>
 My third point is that I sought to protect the interests of the city as a 
whole. My proposal to allocate $7 million more for quake-hit areas than was 
recommended by the CRA staff was coupled with my attempt to ensure that the 
largest portion of funds was directed for citywide housing needs. I sought the 
following breakdown for the $47 million: $18 million for citywide housing, $15 
million for earthquake-impacted areas, and $14 million for civil unrest-hit 
areas. The dire need for affordable housing exists citywide. We cannot lose 
sight of the fact that irrespective of the earthquake, Los Angeles is down 
15,000 housing units on an annual basis according to the Planning and Housing 
departments. The $18 million slice of the pie would have been open to the 
appetites of civil disturbance-hit, earthquake-hit, and other areas based on 
need. I sought to maintain the city's focus on its housing needs for all areas 
of Los Angeles.

 The Rev. J. BENJAMIN HARDWICK, pastor at Praises of Zion Baptist Church in Los 
Angeles and the chairman of the African American Ecumenical Coalition for 
Voters, talks about why clergy members and political leaders are sponsoring a 
three-day voter-registration drive that ends today. Today's event is hosted by 
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Walter Fauntroy and will be broadcast live 
on radio station KGFJ-AM , 1230 , in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 At one time, African Americans were considered just three-fifths of a person. 
Then we were denied the right to vote. Next we were threatened to stay away 
from the polls. Now it seems we are taking our own vote for granted. Low voter 
turnout among African Americans is becoming commonplace. In California's 1994 
primary election, the turnout in the African American community was as low as 
15% in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 By not voting, African Americans are fast becoming a silent minority. In 
failing to participate in the political process, we are failing our community 
and we are failing future generations of African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 We must not allow ourselves to become obsolete players to those who control 
the power in this state. Drugs, guns, unemployment, undereducation, 
inaccessible health services and poor housing have worked in tandem to destroy 
us. It is imperative that we speak for ourselves. It is the person who votes 
who makes sure that the system works for him or her. 
</P>
<P>
 The church in the African American community has the ability to initiate as 
well as sustain this mission of bringing African Americans back into the voting 
process. The community leaders recognize the value of partnering with 
legislative leaders, community organizations and youth groups to bring healing 
to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not about politics, it's about survival. This wake-up call is in 
response to a crisis in leadership and an acknowledgment that the resources 
needed are already in the storehouse but have not made it to our shelves. The 
time has come for reviving our community.

PERSPECTIVE ON HEALTH-CARE REFORM; RX FOR RECOVERY -- NEXT YEAR; THE PUBLIC 
STILL WANTS A PLAN, BUT IT HAS TO BE CONCISE, HONEST AND GIMMICK-FREE -- A TASK 
FOR THE NEW CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THEODORE R. MARMOR and MARK GOLDBERG, Theodore R. Marmor is a professor of 
public policy at Yale School of Management and author of Understanding Health 
Care Reform (Yale University Press, 1994). Mark Goldberg, a management fellow 
at Yale University, is the editor of the magazine Domestic Affairs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the last week of September, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell 
officially declared what had been evident for weeks: For health care reform, 
the future is not now. 
</P>
<P>
 Recriminations have already begun in earnest. But more important than 
assigning blame -- of which there is more than enough to distribute -- is 
drawing sensible lessons for the future. After all, the problems health-care 
reform was supposed to address -- escalating costs and eroding coverage -- have 
not suddenly disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 There are at least three schools of thought about the near-term future of 
reform.  
</P>
<P>
 One view is that reform is dead, not just for this session of Congress but for 
the foreseeable future. Yet public support for reform, as distinguished from 
support for particular proposals (such as the Clinton bill), continues to be 
widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 A Congress that is acutely sensitive to constituency concerns would be 
politically ill-advised, and hence unlikely, to walk away from health care 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Another school of thought arises from September's frenzied, last-minute 
negotiations over various versions of incremental (i.e. less ambitious) reform. 
These discussions, it is claimed, provide a good base from which to proceed in 
the next session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether "lite reform" is an accurate forecast, it is a poor policy 
prescription. The packages put together in September were improvisations made 
under pressure. They were not remedies equal to the problems they purported to 
solve. For example, the plan floated by the self-styled mainstream coalition in 
the Senate had no credible controls of costs and no pretension of achieving 
anything remotely resembling universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which leads us to a more sensible prescription: start over. This does 
not mean beginning with an entirely clean slate. Congress has surely learned 
something about which policies are workable and politically plausible and which 
are not. It is, for example, not likely that there will be a groundswell of 
congressional support for the Clinton bill's particular brand of health 
alliances. Yet, if the public demand for major reform persists and American 
medicine's problems remain enormous, inaction or marginalism will not satisfy. 
What Congress will have to do is regroup and devise a new strategy to take on 
the big problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate just past provides some clues about what form that strategy should 
take. It should be simple and straightforward. Of the six principles the 
Administration's proposal was said to embody, the one it clearly fell far short 
on was simplicity. If a member of Congress can't readily understand a bill and 
explain it to constituents, it fails as a prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 Reform should deal with coverage and cost concurrently, and be presented as 
such. Because of cost-shifting, it is enormously difficult to restrain medical 
inflation without universal coverage. Because of the realities of federal 
budget-making and breaking, it is practically impossible to achieve universal 
coverage without effective restraints on cost. Besides, combining universal 
coverage and cost containment in one bill can bring together those who very 
much want one or the other. It was clearly a mistake for the Clinton 
Administration to have focused its rhetoric on universal coverage alone this 
past summer. The Clinton bill never got the credit its strong cost-containment 
provisions actually deserved, and as a result never got as much support as it 
otherwise might have gathered within the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 Another lesson is that reform should include clearly understandable financing. 
Playing games with smoke and mirrors is not credible public finance. Subsidies 
for employers and families cost money. Everybody knows that and polls have 
consistently shown the public willing to pay something extra for permanent 
health coverage. Gimmicks of structure and labels do not fool the public for 
long. Verbal masking of undeniable truths breeds cynicism about politics and 
about health-care reform. It also helps to defeat incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this suggests that reforming American medical care will be easier next 
year than it was this year. But, as with the Olympics, degree of difficulty 
matters. Congress should aim high before forsaking effective reform for mere 
palliatives. Episodes of legislative stalemate, as the struggle over civil 
rights and Medicare showed in the 1960s, need not mean political defeat or need 
not frustrate later reform.

WARNING FLAG FOR INVESTORS; CAREFUL LOOK IS NEEDED BEFORE BUYING INTO MUTUAL 
FUNDS HOLDING 'DERIVATIVES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If ever a mutual fund investor needed to understand the arcane financial 
instruments known as derivatives, this is the time. Losses in derivatives last 
month forced the first outright failure of a money market fund. Never before 
had a penny been lost, so the funds -- which are uninsured -- had acquired a 
reputation for absolute safety. Investors beware. 
</P>
<P>
 Does your mutual fund have some of its assets in derivatives, the financial 
contracts that derive their value from another asset, such as stocks, bonds or 
commodities? If so, do you know how much, and what the risk might be? 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the answers may not be easy, because public disclosures about 
derivatives are far too limited. This lack of information poses a special risk 
for small investors, many of whom have put their money in higher-yielding 
mutual funds instead of bank accounts in recent years. The more information 
available the better. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect investors, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur 
Levitt Jr. proposes not only greater disclosure but also reducing the maximum 
allowable percentage of a mutual fund's assets that can be held in derivatives. 
Levitt's proposal makes sense.  
</P>
<P>
 When used intelligently and with care, derivatives can help to hedge risks and 
can provide immense benefits by creating a pool of worldwide financial 
resources. But mutual funds certainly have had their problems with derivatives 
lately. Last month's collapse involved Community Bankers U.S. Government Money 
Market Fund in Denver. Fortunately, damage was small and contained. The 94 
shareholders, all institutional clients, will get back 94 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Bankers had $35.5 million of its $82.2 million in assets in 
derivatives -- more than 40%, far above the 15% ceiling established by the SEC. 
Primarily, those derivatives involved secured notes created from a variety of 
U.S. government agency securities. When interest rates were falling, the 
derivative instruments helped boost fund yields. But when interest rates 
started rising, trouble too quickly arose. The fund decided to liquidate rather 
than cover mounting losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Other brokerages and banks, including Bank of America, recently have had to 
put up millions to cover derivative losses in their mutual funds to protect 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC's proposed changes, in addition to calling for greater disclosure, 
would reduced to 10% from the current 15% the maximum that any fund could 
invest in "illiquid" securities, a category that includes most derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The big question is how to measure risk. The SEC will solicit write-in 
comments on its proposals in early 1995. Meanwhile, mutual fund investors 
should ask plenty of questions about derivatives and make sure they know where 
their money is going.

THE STATE; CALIFORNIA'S LATEST GENDER GAP: MALES VOTING FOR MALE CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a contributing editor to 
Opinion, is a senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics at 
Claremont Graduate School and a political analyst for KCAL-TV. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The anthem of the 1992 elections was "I am woman, hear me roar!" The theme for 
1994 could well be "Why can't a woman be more like a man?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if a gender gap develops this year in California, it could favor male 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for California governor, a recent Los Angeles Times Poll showed a 
14-point gender gap in support among men for Gov. Pete Wilson and state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown. Of all registered male voters, 53% supported Wilson, 
39% backed Brown (as compared with the advantage Brown enjoys among women, 48% 
to 40%). More critical, almost one-third of Democratic men said they would vote 
for Wilson. Brown is drawing only 15% of Republican women, while the governor 
is attracting about one in five Democratic women. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. Senate contest, a recent KCAL poll reflected a decisive gender 
gap. Men favored Rep. Mike Huffington over Sen. Dianne Feinstein by 51% to 40%, 
while women supported Feinstein over her challenger by 48% to 32%. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, 1994 is not 1992 redux. The political climate and the dominant issues 
are different. The voters' mood may be the same -- anti-government, 
anti-politician -- but it's grown meaner. None of this is helpful to women 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, many women were politically galvanized by what they considered 
to be the Senate's indifference to Anita F. Hill's charges of sexual harassment 
against then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. They also feared that Roe 
vs. Wade was threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, no comparable issue capable of mobilizing women as a voting group 
has surfaced. Quite the contrary. Voter concerns are not perceived as "women's 
issues." This is particularly true in California, where crime and illegal 
immigration are driving the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein managed early on to inoculate herself against the perception that 
women are weak on these issues by taking tough stands. Yet, despite her "tough" 
credentials, Feinstein finds herself in a close race. 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect of the '92 political climate still prevails: voter anger at 
politics-as-usual. In 1992, women were viewed as outsiders and ran, quite 
successfully, on a platform of change. Well, the day they got elected they all 
became part of the problem -- politicians. They entered the system and the 
system didn't change. 
</P>
<P>
 That's part of Feinstein's problem. It's not gender-specific. It reflects a 
national pattern: Sen. Feinstein is a Democrat, an incumbent and in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-incumbent backlash doesn't appear to be hurting Wilson, though. Maybe 
that's because some voters are using the Wilson-Brown race as a referendum on 
Bill Clinton, with Brown a convenient stand-in for the highly unpopular 
President. Maybe it's because voters perceive the governor's race as just 
another punch-out between two Sacramento politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be another dynamic at work. It has to do with a theory, promulgated 
by Alan J. Baron, the late political analyst, that women represent the "party 
of stability" in society. Women more than men value a sense of societal order, 
he argued, and this preference for order dramatically affects their voting 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 It may thus be no accident that the tag line that flashes across a current 
Wilson attack ad reads: "Kathleen Brown: Can We Afford the Risk?" 
</P>
<P>
 A continuing criticism of Brown's candidacy has been her inability to 
articulate her stands and why she wants to be governor. As one young 
professional woman, who should be the archetypal Brown voter, explained her 
decision to support Wilson, "I may not agree with Pete Wilson's politics, but 
at least I know what he will do as governor. I just don't know what Kathleen 
Brown will do." 
</P>
<P>
 To address such voter concerns, Brown retooled her message last week in a 
62-page plan that her campaign described as "a set of concrete, common-sense 
proposals . . . clearly designed to answer" the questions "Who is she?" and 
"Why should we vote for her for governor?" But an already skeptical electorate 
may view the plan as merely political -- no matter how noble the goals -- 
because of its end-of-the-campaign timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of the difference women voters made in the outcome of the 1992 elections 
(in California, they provided the margin of victory for Sen. Barbara Boxer), 
the California Democratic Party has launched the first-ever program to target 
occasional women voters -- women who were motivated to come out in the 1992 
presidential election but had stayed home in the 1990 gubernatorial election or 
last June's primary. 
</P>
<P>
 But the political demography of 1994 appears to more closely reflect 1990 than 
1992. In 1990, the gender gap that helped give Feinstein a dramatic victory 
over her male opponent in the Democratic gubernatorial primary closed in the 
weeks before the general election. As the state's economy faltered and the 
specter of war in the Persian Gulf began to invade the state's consciousness, 
the political focus began to move toward "harder" issues tending to favor male 
candidates and Republicans. In the end, partisan and ideological considerations 
drove the voters' decisions far more than gender. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown may have best summed up the dynamic of this election year. She once said 
she had three assets -- "I am a woman, a Democrat and a Brown" -- and three 
liabilities -- "I am a woman, a Democrat and a Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 At this late stage of the electoral game, it appears her liabilities are 
outweighing her assets.*

COLUMN RIGHT / RUSH LIMBAUGH: WHY I AM A THREAT TO THE LEFT; LIBERALS ARE NOT 
UPSET BECAUSE I'M WRONG; THEY ARE UPSET BECAUSE THEY SUSPECT I'M RIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSH LIMBAUGH, Rush Limbaugh is host of nationally syndicated radio and 
television programs, the author of two best-selling books and editor of the 
Limbaugh Letter. This article is adapted from the fall, 1994, issue of Policy 
Review, the Heritage Foundation magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the defeat of Clinton-style health-care "reform" (government takeover of 
one-seventh of the U.S. economy), liberalism has experienced its most 
humiliating public repudiation. Thirty years after the commencement of the 
Great Society, 25 years after Woodstock and two years after Democrats secured 
control of the White House and Congress, modern liberalism -- exhausted and 
confused -- is on the run. Thirty years after Ronald Reagan's brilliant 
enunciation of conservative ideals at the end of the Goldwater campaign, the 
torch has been passed to me. And liberal fear is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, in nearly every major media outlet in America -- the New York Times, the 
Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, Associated Press, USA Today, you name 
it -- a sizzling onslaught has been launched against me. But they've 
consistently gotten it wrong. Why do liberals fear me? 
</P>
<P>
 Because I threaten their control of the debate. "We're going to push through 
health-care reform regardless of the views of the American people," insisted 
Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W. Va.) That once was standard operating procedure for 
Washington liberals. No longer. Twenty million people a week listen to my radio 
show on 659 stations nationwide, on short wave and Armed Forces Radio 
worldwide, while millions more watch my television show on 250 stations 
nationwide. Add to that 6 million copies sold of my two books and 475,000 
monthly subscribers to the Limbaugh Letter. Now people actually know what's in 
legislation, what legislators actually say and how Washington impacts on their 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 In their attacks, my critics misjudge and insult the American people. If I 
were really what liberals claim -- racist, hatemonger, blowhard -- I would 
years ago have deservedly gone into oblivion. The truth is, I provide 
information and analysis the media refuses to disseminate, information and 
analysis the public craves. People listen to me for one reason: I am effective. 
And my credibility is judged in the marketplace every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I represent America's rejection of liberal elites. Americans feel lied 
to by the so-called experts. They have been told our health care lags behind 
the rest of the industrialized world; it doesn't. They were told drugs are 
safe; they aren't. They were told free sex is liberating; it isn't. They were 
told massive welfare spending would help people get back on their feet; it 
hasn't. They were told that without government intervention on behalf of 
environmentalists, the world would come to an end; it won't. They were told 
religious people are dangerous to the country; they aren't. They were told 
liberal prison reform would "rehabilitate" criminals; it hasn't. I use facts. 
Statistics. I run the numbers. I provide the evidence, every day, that the 
liberal experts have missed the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 I validate the convictions of ordinary people. Liberals are not upset because 
I'm wrong; they are upset because they suspect I'm right. I expose this 
Administration's real agenda: "How can we fool 'em today?" To do so, I sift 
through newspapers, newsmagazines, miles of videotape, books and speeches in a 
relentless pursuit of the truth. I champion the extraordinary accomplishments 
of ordinary people, the best that the human spirit does. I celebrate the 
greatness of America, the rugged individualism that built it and still makes it 
work. My enunciation of these core beliefs has a power and a resonance that 
liberals cannot match. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I am not running for anything. I am setting the agenda right where I 
am, and liberals flounder as a result. They understand how to fight political 
challenges: war rooms, bus tours, direct mail. They do not know how to fight a 
cultural challenge -- the explosion of talk radio -- except to try to regulate 
it out of existence. (This despite the fact that I cannot raise taxes, 
confiscate business' profits, limit people's freedom or send American soldiers 
to Haiti as part of Operation Just Because.) 
</P>
<P>
 I am not an activist. What people do with the information and analysis I serve 
up is up to them. My listeners are not mind-numbed robots. They are thoughtful, 
informed, engaged citizens. As such, more and more Americans are rediscovering 
what the Founders always intended, that the country's future is in their hands. 
This is a genuine threat to the status quo and to liberal control of America's 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why liberals are terrified of me. As well they should be.

THEATER; PRINCE AT THE HELM; TAKING ON HIS FIRST REVIVAL IN A REMARKABLE CAREER 
ON BROADWAY, DIRECTOR HAL PRINCE HAS REBUILT THE 1927 "SHOW BOAT" TO '90S 
STANDARDS AND REINVENTED AN AMERICAN MASTERPIECE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Isenberg, Barbara Isenberg is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When choreographer Susan Stroman got a call from director Harold Prince asking 
her if she'd be interested in working on his new production of "Show Boat," she 
was certain she heard him wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I misunderstood the name of the show," Stroman says. "Everybody 
else does Harold Prince revivals." 
</P>
<P>
 But she heard him right. Prince, the man who produced the likes of "West Side 
Story" and "Fiddler on the Roof," and directed such shows as "Evita," "Sweeney 
Todd" and "The Phantom of the Opera," had decided to revive a classic, not 
create one. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his 25th-anniversary re-creation of his own show "Cabaret," "Show 
Boat" is, in fact, Prince's first musical revival. Or sort-of revival. Weaving 
chunks of "Show Boat's" many stage and film versions together with his own 
vision, Prince has come up with a show that is quite different from what Oscar 
Hammerstein II and Jerome Kern sent to Broadway in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 With its serious themes of black-white relations, family and, well, show 
business, "Show Boat" is generally considered the first contemporary musical. 
Its memorable score is loaded with songs like "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man," "Ol' 
Man River" and "Why Do I Love You?"  
</P>
<P>
 But for Prince, it was also a personal link to the past. "I wouldn't be here 
if it weren't for 'Show Boat,' " the director says. "The kind of theater I 
chose to be involved in is completely a direct reflection of what 'Show Boat' 
made possible." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of theater includes 40 years' worth of musicals, from "The Pajama 
Game" in 1954 to last year's Tony winner, "Kiss of the Spider Woman." His stage 
pictures, which have influenced everyone from the late Michael Bennett to Peter 
Sellars, have brought the flow of cinema to the stage and made casts of dozens 
look like casts of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 His Rockefeller Center offices chronicle a life in the theater. His 19 Tony 
Awards are crammed together on top of one cabinet, adjacent to a wall full of 
photographs of Prince with composers, Presidents and royalty. Other walls are 
covered with framed telegrams, musical scores, set designs and other mementos 
of a theatrical legend who, at 66, shows no signs at all of slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes "Show Boat," an $8.5-million extravaganza with a cast of 73 and a 
top ticket price of $75, a Broadway record. After a year in Toronto, where 
another production is still running, "Show Boat" last Sunday joined Prince's 
"Phantom" and "Kiss" on Broadway. And among the excellent reviews was the New 
York Times' commentary that Prince is "still the undisputed master of the 
Broadway musical." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, a warm, thoughtful man whose casual dress belies his seriousness, 
admits to feeling "mellower," and why shouldn't he? Things are going very well. 
He just learned he will receive a Kennedy Center Honor, he's soon off to Buenos 
Aires to direct "Madama Butterfly," he's directing the new musical "The 
Petrified Prince" Off-Broadway in December and his beloved "Show Boat" is 
finally playing New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commercial theater is not what it used to be, and Prince's lingering 
message is that few other people in the theater enjoy such luxuries of 
production time and money. With "Show Boat," he hooked up at the right time 
with Toronto impresario Garth Drabinsky, chairman of Live Entertainment of 
Canada, and the man who also saved Prince's "Kiss of the Spider Woman" from 
oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Show Boat' is a very large and very expensive investment," says Prince. 
"But nothing artistically has been compromised." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the day before previews start, rehearsals are under way and Prince is 
sitting on the aisle in the nearly-empty Gershwin Theatre. Leaning back in his 
seat, he looks pleased, almost relaxed. For about 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody wants his attention, from choreographer Stroman to producer 
Drabinsky to stage managers, actors and lighting people. "It's the home 
stretch," he apologizes before rushing off. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cast, including all of the principals, played in the Toronto 
production of the show, but there are 18 new people in the New York cast and a 
brand-new set. There are 500 costumes, and so many people backstage changing 
clothes at any given time that they have to use the freight elevator as a 
dressing room.  
</P>
<P>
 Prince is everywhere. A blond wig doesn't look right. Moving a major prop 
requires some new staging. And, he tells an assistant, "I'm sorry to make a lot 
of trouble, but that's a conventional little signboard (onstage) when we had 
something wonderful before."  
</P>
<P>
 You can be sure there was a better signboard onstage that night. "When Hal 
leaps up out of his chair, everybody stops in his tracks," Stroman says later. 
"There's an incredible want to please him. Hal is walking history, and he's a 
star in the theater community."  
</P>
<P>
 Prince has been a theatrical star nearly all his life. Brought up in New York, 
the child of German Jewish parents, Prince talks vividly of stage performances 
he saw when he was 8. He wrote novels and plays while at the University of 
Pennsylvania, and after finishing college at 19, used his plays as bait to 
attract potential theatrical employers.  
</P>
<P>
 He offered to work for free for legendary producer-director George Abbott and 
was doing just that by the time he was 20. Two weeks later, Prince was making 
$25 a week. And 46 years later, he and Abbott, who is now 107 years old, still 
share office space. (Abbott hasn't been in lately, but as Prince assistant 
Jonathan Arak puts it, "as long as there is a Mr. Abbott, there is an office 
for Mr. Abbott.") 
</P>
<P>
 The first musical Prince co-produced was "Pajama Game" in 1954, and it was 
also his first hit. He was 26 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 More hits followed -- "Damn Yankees," "West Side Story," "A Funny Thing 
Happened on the Way to the Forum," "Fiddler on the Roof." 
</P>
<P>
 The last show he produced and didn't direct was "Flora, the Red Menace" in 
1965. "Flora" fared poorly but, in addition to making Liza Minnelli a star, it 
launched Prince's long, fruitful relationship with composer John Kander and 
lyricist Fred Ebb.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hal is responsible for a great many careers, including mine," Ebb says. "He 
gave me my first break. And if he hadn't given me a show after 'Flora,' I might 
not have been offered another show." 
</P>
<P>
 They were still on the road with "Flora" en route to Broadway when Prince 
approached Ebb one day during rehearsals. "He said that the day after 'Flora' 
opened, no matter how we did critically, he would like to start a musical 
version of (Christopher Isherwood's) 'I Am a Camera,' " recalls the 
Tony-winning lyricist. "It was a demonstration of his faith in us." 
</P>
<P>
 The show was "Cabaret." And Ebb, who later worked with Prince on "Zorba" and 
"Kiss of the Spider Woman," speaks of the director as "a loyal, organized, 
forceful and assured leader. You're never confused when you work with Hal about 
what his vision is." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince's creative life in the '70s centered largely on works by 
composer-lyricist Stephen Sondheim, a man he first met the night "South 
Pacific" opened in 1949. (Prince was there with Richard Rodgers, and Sondheim 
was there with Oscar Hammerstein.) Prince produced and/or directed such 
landmark shows as "Company," "Follies" and "Sweeney Todd." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Merrily We Roll Along," Prince's sixth directorial collaboration with 
Sondheim, things changed. That 1981 show was the first of several box-office 
and critical failures, including the musicals "A Doll's Life" and "Grind." It 
was to be the only truly dark time in Prince's career. 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, says Prince, "no matter what I did, it could not please critics 
or audiences. (Those) years were very fallow -- I did eight shows and not one 
of them happened. If you take six years over a 40-year career lifetime, it 
really isn't all that dramatic. But during that period, I thought maybe I'd 
ceased to be able to create something that people want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 What brought him back to Broadway -- indirectly -- was Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
Prince had cabled the composer too late about wanting to direct "Jesus Christ 
Superstar" -- "I was heartbroken," Lloyd Webber recalls -- but got in early on 
"Evita." Just before the "Evita" album was released, preceding the show, Lloyd 
Webber played the album for Prince. He liked it but wasn't available for 18 
months. "We did the right thing," says Lloyd Webber. "We waited." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't have to wait the next time around. When Lloyd Webber told Prince 
about his idea for "Phantom of the Opera," Prince was ready." 'Phantom' seemed 
absolutely right," says Prince. "I said 'yes,' and that was the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Or the start, really, of Prince's leap back atop the Broadway mountain. 
"Phantom" opened in London in 1986, and by the end of June, 1994, its worldwide 
grosses topped $1.5 billion. Its Broadway incarnation starts its seventh year 
in January, and there are currently 12 productions of the show playing 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Webber recalls Prince telling him once that "you can't listen to a 
musical if it doesn't look right. . . . The thing about Hal is he is incredibly 
visual. There is always a style, a look. On 'Phantom,' he was absolutely 
bull's-eye." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the success of "Phantom" didn't erase the lesson of the '80s for 
Prince that big investments too often meant big compromises. It was 
particularly painful for him with "Grind," a 1985 musical about burlesque he'd 
hoped would also explore the subject of violence from various perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince's decision to work away from Broadway may have come after "Grind," says 
that show's playwright, writer-producer Fay Kanin, "but he had been talking 
about it long before. He had several setbacks on things he loved and no chance 
to work on them in a less than hysterical atmosphere. Which Broadway has 
become."  
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, senior statesman Prince attended a meeting of several young New York 
producers who were railing against the system. The next day he called Marty 
Bell, who had chaired the meeting, and they met for drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said in this environment, he could never have gotten 'Company' or 
'Follies' produced," says Bell, now vice president of creative affairs for Live 
Entertainment of Canada. "Money wasn't available for shows that adventurous. 
And that depressed the hell out of both of us." 
</P>
<P>
 So the two men started talking about a way to get new shows going without the 
financial and critical pressures of Broadway. They looked into various 
locations, and four years after they started talking, got a program going at 
the State University of New York's Purchase campus, about 45 minutes from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first show was "Kiss of the Spider Woman," based on the Manuel Puig 
novel that had also inspired the 1985 film. It opened in May, 1990, was 
reviewed unfavorably by the New York Times' then drama critic, Frank Rich, and 
others, and the entire SUNY New Musicals program died in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kiss," however, survived. Drabinsky, whom Prince first met when the 
impresario produced "Phantom" in Toronto, had been involved in financing the 
film version and knew of Prince's interest in the property. 
</P>
<P>
 When Prince went to Vancouver to open a production of "Phantom" there in 1991, 
he showed Drabinsky a reworked "Kiss" script. Author Terrence McNally, Prince 
and other collaborators refocused the "Kiss" plot on cellmates Molina, a gay 
window dresser, and Valentin, a political prisoner, and re-conceived Molina's 
movie-musical fantasies of the Spider Woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised "Kiss" opened at Toronto's St. Lawrence Centre in June, 1992. A 
success there, it opened in London that October and on Broadway in 1993, 
picking up awards and very nice grosses all along the way. Even critic Rich 
called its reworking "a much improved version" and praised director Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 "The SUNY experiment was destroyed but we proved our point," says Prince. "The 
show is flourishing." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time to open his new, $48-million North York Performing Arts 
Centre in Toronto, Drabinsky again turned to Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing a production of "Show Boat" abroad, Drabinsky decided it was the 
perfect show to launch his new theater. It took him seven months to negotiate 
the worldwide rights, he says, "and as soon as the ink had dried on the 
agreements, I ran down to Rockefeller Center and told Hal, 'I want you to 
direct a re-creation of what may be the greatest musical ever written.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bridging 40 years, "Show Boat" traces the Hawks family and others from their 
early days on the Cotton Blossom theater-boat in 1887 Natchez to Chicago in the 
'20s. Blacks and whites do not rest together easily, love does not conquer all 
and, despite the gorgeous songs, "Show Boat" is not a lighthearted musical. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge appealed to Prince. He'd been asked to do revivals before, but 
nothing interested him the way "Show Boat" did.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was the best score ever written and a wonderful, wonderful 
story," says Prince. " 'Show Boat' contains also one of the best book scenes a 
director could ever ask for, which is the miscegenation scene (where 
entertainer Julie is fired for being black and having a white husband). It's 
perfect and couldn't be improved upon today." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince concedes that William Hammerstein, the lyricist's son and an old 
friend, told him candidly that he was very nervous about tampering with "Show 
Boat." He worried, for instance, about Prince putting back the song "Mis'ry's 
Comin' Aroun'," which the original authors had taken out because it was too 
dark. And he worried about Prince's new notions to open the second act. 
</P>
<P>
 To assuage those fears, Prince first reworked the show's book for a year, then 
hosted a reading in New York for Hammerstein and others. "It went wonderfully," 
says Prince. "I needed to reassure them and reassure me. It gave me the courage 
to follow my mind and (them) some security to let me go." 
</P>
<P>
 Few stories have been so mined as Edna Ferber's novel, adapted first by 
Hammerstein and Kern, then reworked in several other stage and film versions. 
Universal's 1936 film, for instance, was one of the director's primary sources 
on the show's reworking.  
</P>
<P>
 The resulting show is enormous in both scale and aspiration, one reason 
producer Drabinsky gives for its unprecedented $75 top ticket. "On opening 
night, at the curtain call, we invited everybody involved with the show 
onstage, and 200 people came out, including cast, orchestra and backstage 
crew." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince scrapped a World's Fair sequence that opened the second act, calling it 
a "diversion," and came up with two new montages that use dance, fashion, 
newspaper headlines and other devices to clarify the show's often confusing 
passage of time. The second montage spans 21 years, providing what Stroman 
calls "a wonderful vehicle" to show such things as the fact that blacks 
invented the Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince has also tried to craft a story that exalts the family. "The idea that 
I have to be on the same side of the fence as Dan Quayle is cruelly depressing 
to me," he says at one point, "but the truth is, I believe in family values. 
The show celebrates its love affair with two major parallel lines in the life 
of Mr. Hammerstein and certainly in mine: family and theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Family for Prince, however, sweeps in far more people than just his wife, 
Judy, daughter Daisy and son Charley. Many of the director's shows have carried 
heavy-duty messages, and he considers "Show Boat" consistent with the muse for 
more overtly political shows such as "Cabaret" or "Kiss." "The fact that I'm 
doing this now seemed to surprise people," he smiles. "But I think once you see 
it, you see that I'm on the same course I was always on." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a serious man. When Lloyd Webber first played the score of "Cats" for 
Prince, "I looked at him curiously and said, 'Andrew, I don't understand. Is 
this about English politics? (Are) those cats Queen Victoria, Gladstone and 
Disraeli?' He looked at me like I'd lost my mind, and after the longest pause 
said, 'Hal, this is just about cats.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Prince is concerned about the future of his industry. "I'm not fooling 
myself," he says." 'Show Boat' comes up every 10 years or whatever, and it's 
well received or encouraged. But brand-new musicals are where the future of the 
musical theater lies.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just keep recycling revivals. And you can't keep betting on the 
efforts of guys like me who've been around. You have to take the next step and 
bet on the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would submit that audiences don't care where the material comes from, 
whether it's from a famous composer, director or librettist. They only care 
about whether the show is going to please, stimulate, surprise (and) astonish 
them. Not merely trivially entertain them. Audiences are quite happy to be 
astonished and they don't care who does that astonishing." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince does his own part in spotting and encouraging new talent, an activity 
reflected in his next show, "The Petrified Prince," a musical based on an 
unproduced Ingmar Bergman screenplay. Its creators include Michael John 
LaChiusa, a young composer-librettist Sondheim recommended (and whom Prince 
boasts that he hired before LaChiusa hit it big earlier this year with his 
musical "Hello Again" at Lincoln Center) and playwright Edward Gallardo, whose 
play "Simpson Street" Prince saw when the Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre 
produced it in New York several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Drabinsky has added "enhancement money" for "The Petrified Prince's" 
production at the Public later this year. And should the show fare well there, 
says Drabinsky, he expects to take it to Broadway "within 12 months" after its 
opening downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince has directed only two films, both in the '70s, but many operas. In 
early 1992, he directed 22 members of New York's Irish Repertory Theatre 
Company in "Grandchild of Kings," his own adaptation of two of the six volumes 
of playwright Sean O'Casey's autobiography. "The Irish Rep keeps asking when 
we're going to do (another O'Casey adaptation)," he says. "I keep saying, 'When 
I get through with what I'm doing now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It could be a long wait. Besides "Madama Butterfly" for Argentina's Teatro 
Colon, "Candide" at the Chicago Lyric Opera and "The Petrified Prince" at the 
Public, he launches a U.S. touring production of "Kiss of the Spider Woman" in 
November. Then there's another production of "Phantom" to open, this time in 
Singapore, followed by a trip to the Far East. Actually, he concedes, "I can't 
do every little bit of everything. I don't have the patience. Elaine Stritch 
(who co-stars in "Show Boat") said something that I really like, so I'll quote 
it. She said she gets up every morning for rehearsal thinking, 'I've got to go 
in there and entertain Hal Prince because his patience threshold is so low.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't fall asleep, but my mind wanders. I have a short attention span."

<P>
 Playwright August Wilson and filmmaker Quentin Tarantino haven't heretofore 
gotten lumped together in the same breath too often. But since we're asking, 
"actually, they compare quite favorably," says Samuel L. Jackson, who has as 
good a right to render judgment as anyone, having worked with each of them more 
than once. 
</P>
<P>
 One shoots, the other doesn't, but the trigger-happy Tarantino "tends to write 
quite theatrically too," Jackson enthuses. "They're both very literary and 
expository in getting ideas out there and eliciting a feeling and moving an 
audience in a certain way oratorically rather than visually." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oratorical" hardly begins to describe what Tarantino wrote for Jackson in 
"Pulp Fiction," giving him the showiest part in the most buzzed-about movie of 
the year. As the hit man Jules -- given to unexpected bouts of introspection 
between mob rub-outs and chats with partner John Travolta about the finer 
points of fast food -- Jackson gets to deliver a withering series of speeches 
that momentarily halt the movie's ensemble feel, fiery diatribes that invoke 
the wrath of the biblical prophet Ezekiel. Even though -- this being a 
Tarantino picture -- the speeches are delivered while Jackson is revving up to 
blast holes through someone, there's the rush of good theater as well as good 
cinema: These are honest-to-Godot monologues . 
</P>
<P>
 Says Tarantino: "If you think about what Sammy does in the last scene, he's 
doing this almost Richard III storm sequence kind of thing -- except he's in a 
coffee shop, bent over, sitting in a booth." (Albeit wielding a gun, of 
course.) "He's dominating the entire room while never getting up from that 
booth. Sam's just really remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is as grateful for this writerly roughage as an actor who took the 
all-too-typical path from serious leads on the New York stage to bit-part bad 
guys in Hollywood blockbusters ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing monologues is so rare in movies. Watching 'Jaws,' and seeing that shark 
story that Robert Shaw does, I always wanted to do that," he remembers. "It's 
really scary in a way. You don't have to depend on another actor being able to 
carry his emotional weight with yours. It's a great 
flying-by-the-seat-of-your-pants feeling. The great thing about film is they 
can bring the camera right into your face and people can see all that emotional 
stuff happening, whereas on stage you do it larger than life so you can hit 
that person in the back row who couldn't get that really good seat." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the actorly dignity of it all. Only . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of funny," says Jackson, "because somebody told me Spike (Lee) 
had seen 'Pulp' and said, 'Sam was great in the movie -- but what's up with 
that hair?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Spike's speaking, of course, of how Tarantino wrote Jackson a highly 
theatrical part that demands he be the most intensely violent and frightening 
figure in the film and the one who must convey an unlikely sense of redemption 
at the end, a balancing act that dare not be seen as ridiculous . . . and then, 
to top it off, stuck America's coolest black actor in the attention-flagging 
equivalent of a fright wig: a full, incongruous set of Jeri-curls. 
</P>
<P>
 It's, well, a look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to remind these people," continues Jackson, "to tell Spike that he was 
the first person to put that wig on me, in 'School Daze.' " Of course, in Lee's 
golden oldie, Jackson was supposed to be ridiculous, not just look it. So what 
is up? Just an odd balancing act that's right up Jackson's versatile alley. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard III, meet Superfly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wig was Quentin's idea, because he likes these blaxploitation movies. 
He's thinking Jules is one of these guys that liked those movies too, so when 
he told me I was gonna wear the wig, I decided to grow the mustache and 
sideburns to go with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Tarantino: "I never would have had Sam wearing a Jeri-curl wig normally. 
But I had it in my mind that I wanted Sam to wear an Afro. I like Afros. If I 
was black, I'd wear an Afro. And Sam was up for it. But the makeup woman who 
was getting the wigs I don't think knew the difference between an Afro and a 
Jeri-curl. It was there by mistake, and he put it on, and he looked so great, I 
can't tell you. When you get it, you know you got it, you know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson goes on to explain -- in a reverie as close to self-psychoanalysis as 
he's likely to get in this setting -- that as a boy at play, he loved the 
business of dressing up as the cowboy or Indian or pirate or soldier or spy, 
and hasn't since dispensed with the glee of hiding out in plain sight, as it 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love changing the look. Like 'Menace II Society' -- a lot of people don't 
even know I'm in that movie, because they don't read credits. But I like 
disguising myself in films; it keeps people from putting me in a certain 
category." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the idea of pulling a Jim Brown or Fred Williamson didn't hold an 
especial nostalgic appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I watched 'Shaft' and all those movies too. In fact, I bought Quentin 
a 'Truck Turner' poster for a wrap gift. That's one of the things he couldn't 
find, and" -- a pleased, conspiratorial chuckle -- "I have a source, so I 
hooked him up." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, clearly, had he come along a generation earlier, could have had a 
great career in blaxploitation. As it is, he's simply having a great career. 
</P>
<P>
 If Tommy Lee Jones was the Gene Hackman of this past sum mer -- as ubiquitous 
actors go -- then Sam Jackson may be the Tommy Lee Jones of the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 By a combination of coincidence and workaholism, the 45-year-old Jackson can 
claim four movies out within a few months of each other. Two are still in 
theaters -- "Fresh" and "The New Age" both feature him in small but vivid parts 
-- and two more are on the way: Besides "Pulp Fiction," touted as a phenomenon 
for months and opening Friday, there's the adoption drama "Losing Isaiah," with 
Jessica Lange, tentatively set for late winter.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet it won't surprise him, or particularly displease him, he claims, if this 
spate of exposure doesn't significantly boost his public profile: "In these 
four pictures that they're gonna see this fall," Jackson points out, as 
something of a matter of pride, "they're going to see four different people. 
They're not going to see the same guy that has a different name but he's doing 
the same things with each character. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's OK. I'm still not a movie star. I'm an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 Till now, although he's done a few leading roles in inconsequential movies, 
Jackson has been most famously revered by his peers as the guy who comes in, 
kicks ass for 15 minutes and disappears. Think of his dangerously manipulative, 
ill-fated addict, Gator, in "Jungle Fever" -- for which the jury at the Cannes 
Film Festival voted him a supporting-performance award (even though there was 
no precedent at Cannes to give out honors for anything short of a leading role) 
-- and think of how the movie softened whenever he slipped off to some 
offscreen crack den. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon actor and movie star will likely intersect. He has as much screen 
time as anyone in the uniformly stunning "Pulp Fiction" ensemble, and the 
showiest scenes. Jeri-curls or no, if the picture takes off the way just about 
everyone expects, Jackson's status as the most frequently seen anonymous face 
in the movies may be history. 
</P>
<P>
 Even precluding that, he's in the middle of filming the behemoth that's the 
surest thing for a commercial breakthrough, "Die Hard III: Simon Says," where 
he's the secondary lead and first real sidekick Bruce Willis has had. 
</P>
<P>
 The luxury car that has just deposited Jackson at his publicist's office in 
Westwood on an early September morning is waiting outside to whisk him back to 
LAX, where his flight from New York arrived just the night before. He's 
grateful to have had even a few hours at home to enjoy L.A.'s Indian summer; 
back in Manhattan, where "Die Hard III" is in the middle of four months of 
location filming, it's starting to get brisk. There, much of the summer-set 
action has him sprinting from Wall Street to Central Park in thin clothes made 
more coolish by the faux sweat the continuity checkers spray on between takes. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, the natives aren't friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the week (New Yorkers) are real upset when they see those orange 
cones, because we disrupt traffic quite a bit," says Jackson, chowing down on a 
cinnamon roll that will suffice as his pre-flight breakfast. "And really, 
they're not happy on the weekends, either. This past week we were in Tompkins 
Square Park, so the homeless people and the squatters and the punk kids that 
live there have pretty much been angry with us all week. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, they even had out a flyer talking about 'Bruce Willis fighting 
communism while he's disrupting our lives and displacing us from our homes. And 
this time he has a black Tonto.' I thought, 'Who? You're talking about me? Me? 
I'm Tonto? Oh, no!' " 
</P>
<P>
 He raises his eyebrows and makes a mock-nervous face, but Jackson doesn't seem 
overly distressed by the flyer's taunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that same buddy kind of formula thing," he says of "Die Hard III," with 
an acknowledging snicker, "where I don't want to be there but I'm there, and he 
doesn't really want me there but I'm there." (The plot has a mad bomber, Jeremy 
Irons, forcing Willis and Jackson to team up as a defense against his schemes 
to make smithereens of Manhattan.) "But," he adds, smiling, "we don't have one 
of those buddy-bonding fistfights where we gain respect for each other through 
our physical prowess." 
</P>
<P>
 "Die Hard III" director John McTiernan is requiring "Action" Jackson's 
reluctant hero to leap out of speeding cars and off of exploding boats, jump 
turnstiles to dodge flying subway cars that have jumped their blown-up tracks, 
et al. And even -- subsidiary as it may be -- to act. "He still has things to 
do -- not just reacting," Jackson says. "He's not a superman. He gets afraid. 
He admits that he can't do certain things. He's not looking death in the face 
with a smile." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking anything in the face with a smile is the last thing anyone who has 
attentively followed Jackson through his screen disguises would expect. He 
grins easily and relaxedly enough off-screen, seeming the relatively 
uncomplicated Valley family man (his wife is actress LaTonya Richardson, and 
they have one daughter, Zoe) to all who might look in and wonder where the reel 
rage comes from, but most of his on-camera career until recently was spent as a 
menace II screen society. Twenty years or so he toiled, less than unsung, as a 
chief denizen of Glower Gulch, staring down SAG's more virtuous citizenry. The 
roles were small, and smaller, but rarely ever remotely subservient, given his 
inescapable indomitability. Tonto? . . . With a hatchet, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 In person, Jackson is conservative-looking, garrulous and not at all likely to 
make anyone nervous about a hint of something scary seething under. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there's a rage that exists in me sometimes, and sometimes it's very 
frustrating trying to find or tap into something that can hurt that much," he 
allows, acknowledging that the intensity isn't usually too close to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Tarantino, not exactly resolving the enigma: "Sam's a bunch of different 
guys." (At least one of them is a guy with tastes similar to Tarantino's; the 
director says he often dropped in to Jackson's trailer between scenes to find 
him watching obscure Hong Kong sock-'em flicks from the '70s, proving this a 
match made in some kind of kung fu heaven.) 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a really terrific father, and he's been married forever to a wonderful 
woman, and he's been working in theater forever," Tarantino adds. "But he's 
also had a real rough-and-tumble life. He grew up in the South and everything. 
Now that he's old enough, he has this little Valley household."  
</P>
<P>
 Born in Atlanta in 1949, Jackson majored in drama at Morehouse College, where, 
as a black-power activist in the late '60s, he was suspended after taking part 
in a sit-in that involved locking up the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson went on to originate August Wilson-scribed roles at Yale Rep and the 
Seattle Repertory Theatre ("Fences," "The Piano Lesson," "Two Trains Running"), 
and worked in a number of New York Shakespeare Festival productions. But as he 
made the move into movies and TV, his theatrically honed gifts were used mainly 
to breathe quick life into bit brutes. 
</P>
<P>
 This was partially, of course, because that's what African American actors 
were (and are, it can be argued) offered, but also -- to be fair -- because 
Jackson's wide-set eyes are uniquely capable of a scary, hair-trigger glare 
that might bore through you into the next borough. 
</P>
<P>
 He worried about being typed as a TV villain, but his wife reassured him that 
Bogart and Cagney got their start doing hoodlums by the cinematic dozen, too. 
Being a workhorse, he accepted this, not stopping to dwell on the fact that 
hundreds of forgotten character actors had heard this very speech from their 
spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything I had an opportunity to do, I just went in and did it. It's a tired 
old cliche that they tell you when you enter the theater: There are no small 
parts, only small actors. And that's a very true thing. You're actually 
building little blocks of a life in the business. You can't take anything for 
granted. You don't go in there and just half-do something because, 'Hey, I'm 
not the co-star, I'm not the third lead.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to just go in and play the result. 'You have a criminal who's got a 
gun, he's gonna rob somebody, and that's what we want you to do, Sam.' But you 
have to sit at home and say to yourself, 'OK, this guy's gonna rob somebody, 
but why? Is he an addict? Is he a veteran who couldn't get a job? Is his rent 
due? Is his kid sick? Why does he need this money so bad?' 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have had a life before they saw you on screen, and a life that's 
going to go on when you leave the screen. And hopefully you'll have an audience 
see you show up, boom , you're there, you do your thing and leave, and they'll 
say to themselves, 'Damn, I wonder what happened to that guy?' " 
</P>
<P>
 After doing a lot of stock hand gun-wielders, he at least got to be menacing 
in a higher class of movie. In his third picture for Spike Lee, "Mo' Better 
Blues," he was a thug who memorably beat the hell out of Denzel Washington in a 
jazz club's back alley. But he topped that ugly turn by a mile with his 
harrowing turn in "Jungle Fever," and the honors he picked up for it started 
getting him the right meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 His two real leads in theatrical features to date, in "Amos & Andrew" and 
"National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1," have both been comedies in which he 
played it straight, dignity under assault. Otherwise he's not the slightest bit 
known for comedy, but begs to claim it's really been a part of a lot of his 
dramatic roles, even the toughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you know, Gator in 'Jungle Fever' is an immensely funny guy. But 
underneath all that, there's this whole sense of menace and deceit. Because 
he's actually trying to find a way to get something out of everybody that he 
sees, and he uses comedy to disarm 'em, to take their minds away from whatever 
his real purpose is." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's non-villainous turns tended to be a bit less riveting, as with his 
computer whiz in "Jurassic Park"; there, his disembodied arm had a bigger 
effect on the audience than he was able to. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson may be at his bracing best combining vice and virtue -- something 
he's had a chance to do lately in "Fresh," where he did a small but moving turn 
as the 12-year-old protagonist's chess-playing deadbeat dad, and "Pulp 
Fiction," where he's the only character allowed a significant moral 
transformation in an essentially amoral jigsaw puzzle. In these tricky roles, 
he is able to suggest a warmth made all the more intriguingly palpable by how 
antisocially the characters begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Tarantino wrote the "Pulp" part with Jackson in mind, they both 
admit he almost lost out on it. Not until the final audition did the actor get 
a handle on his climactic monologue, where he again quotes Ezekiel, but in the 
service of amity, not murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the hardest part of the film," says Jackson, "to be able to take a 
speech that you used to create mayhem to discover a sense of peace, and still 
have that menace in it. Because he's still at a crossroads. Even though he's 
made up his mind to not do this anymore, there are little things that could 
trigger him right back into that space he was trying to escape." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino, for one, was sorry to see Jules consider retirement; he harbors 
fantasies of a rapprochement between Jules and John Travolta's Vincent, such 
was the chemistry: "It's rare to actually see this natural comedy team -- and 
that's what they are. I mean, I'm almost tempted to do a series of Jules & 
Vincent movies -- 'Jules & Vincent Meet Frankenstein,' 'Jules & Vincent Meet 
the Mummy' . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Which may be Tarantino's way of saying about Jackson, too: Damn, I wonder what 
happened to that guy?

MOVIES; . . .AND FOR TRAVOLTA, THE MOVIE HAS ALREADY REIGNITED A CAREER THAT

HOTSHOT AGAIN

<P>
 You're at a luncheon on a balcony overlooking the French Riviera. It is the 
day after your latest film, "Pulp Fiction," had its world premiere at the 
Cannes Film Festival, the day after you saw the movie for the first time 
yourself, and you're here with your director, Quentin Tarantino, and co-stars 
Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson to discuss it with the 
international press. 
</P>
<P>
 As you move from one table to another, in a media ritual known as the round 
robin interview, you find that you're not being interviewed so much as being 
adulated. The critics and journalists loved the movie, a black comedy about 
killers and molls and double-crossers, but they are astonished by your 
performance as a fast-talking, heroin-addicted hit man, and as rude as they may 
normally be, they can't stop gushing today. 
</P>
<P>
 An actor can't hear too much praise, you will say later, and you certainly got 
plenty of it when you were the hottest movie star on the planet. But that was a 
long time ago -- before circumstances and a series of box-office failures 
drained your popularity, before critics and film industry mavens lost interest, 
before the tabloids started calling you fat and a religious cultist, before you 
resigned yourself to perhaps never getting another chance to reclaim your 
stardom -- and the response to you here is overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 Your name is John Travolta, you're 40 years old, and you're afraid you're 
going to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point, I had to leave one of the tables and gather my feelings," 
Travolta recalls, three and a half months later, in the library of his home in 
an exclusive subdivision of Daytona Beach, Fla. "I didn't want to cry in front 
of (the press), but I felt like it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cannes Film Festival is famous for launching new stars, and the Palme d'Or 
won by "Pulp Fiction" in May is having that effect on director Tarantino. But 
in the case of Travolta, the film, which opens Friday, has relaunched an old 
star and may be sending him further than he has ever gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Cannes, my career has had more forward progress than it did any time 
after one of my hits," Travolta says. "In terms of both the quality of the 
projects offered and the money paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Jonathan Krane, a film producer who has doubled for the last 10 years as 
Travolta's business manager: "It has been the most direct and immediate 
response I have ever seen in my life between a performance and the way it was 
received. From the moment the film was seen at Cannes, (industry) people have 
been coming to John with offers." 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Pulp Fiction" has so far been seen only at festivals, Travolta has 
already signed for two new movies, including one -- an MGM adaptation of Elmore 
Leonard's bestseller "Get Shorty" -- that provides the highest upfront salary 
of his career (which he declined to confirm but is reportedly about $3.5 
million), plus a reported $750,000 bonus if he receives an Oscar nomination for 
"Pulp Fiction" and another $750,000 if he wins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if that's ever been done before," Travolta says of his bonus 
arrangement with the producers of "Get Shorty." "Wouldn't it be something if I 
started a trend?" 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking on the role of Chili Palmer in "Get Shorty," Travolta will star 
in "White Man's Burden," a low-budget independent feature being produced by 
Tarantino's film company and directed by Tarantino's friend Desmond Nakano. 
Travolta says he loves Nakano's story, a dramatic fable about a society in 
which the roles of whites and blacks are reversed, but acknowledges that he 
agreed to work with a first-time director partly out of loyalty to Tarantino 
and to his partner, Lawrence Bender. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to trust those guys because I'm where I am because of them," Travolta 
says. "It's funny, one movie can make you, and one movie can remake you. It's 
like I went to the moon, then came back down to Earth, and now I get to go to 
Mars or someplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Earth to moon in this celestial metaphor is Englewood, N.J., where Travolta 
grew up, to Hollywood, where he gained quick fame as Vinnie Barbarino in ABC's 
"Welcome Back, Kotter" (1975-79) and as Tony Manero and Danny Zuko in the movie 
blockbusters "Saturday Night Fever" (1977) and "Grease" (1978). For a while, 
Travolta even reigned atop the rock charts as a recording artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon to Earth was his fall from grace after the 1985 flop "Perfect" and a 
series of movies that were barely released in theaters. His fall was broken by 
the popular "Look Who's Talking" series, but his role did little to resurrect 
Travolta as a dramatic leading man. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, thanks to Tarantino, a 31-year-old fellow high school dropout who had 
been a fan of Travolta's since grade school, the star is headed for Mars or 
someplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like this young man comes into my life and gives me an opportunity to 
rekindle the kind of career people expected from me and that I expected from 
myself," Travolta says. "There was always a trickle of hope brought in with 
each production, but last year, I just decided to live my life and stop 
worrying about (my career). Then, within a couple of days, I got a call from 
Quentin." 
</P>
<P>
 To appreciate the full impact of that call, you have to imagine another lunch 
scene, this one in the restaurant of Beverly Hills' Four Seasons Hotel. It was 
there, early last year, where Travolta and Tarantino -- whose first feature, 
"Reservoir Dogs," had made him one of the hottest directing prospects in the 
industry -- first met. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was writing 'Pulp Fiction' then, but I didn't have John in mind for a 
part," says Tarantino, an inveterate movie buff who can recall Travolta's films 
with almost scene-for-scene detail. "In the back of my mind, I hoped we'd get 
along and that I could work with him later, but I just wanted to meet him." 
</P>
<P>
 Travolta says he agreed to the lunch because his agent and friends urged him 
to, and because he was flattered by Tarantino's enthusiasm. The guy was hot, 
sure, but after taking a look at the ultra-violent "Reservoir Dogs" on video, 
he wondered, "What would I be doing in something like this?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Four Seasons lunch was another gusher for Travolta, who nourished himself 
on Tarantino's praise. And Emma Thompson, who was eating at another table, 
dropped by to flatter him some more. Thompson, who won the best actress Oscar 
for the previous year's "Howards End," had been a Travolta fan since her uncle 
took her to see "Saturday Night Fever," she told him; then, turning to 
Tarantino, she admonished him to "put this man in one of your movies; he needs 
a good movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Travolta had been in similar situations before and didn't think there was 
anything special going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino, who collects board games based on movies and TV shows, ended that 
lunch by inviting Travolta to drop by his West Hollywood apartment the 
following week to play the games he had that were based on "Welcome Back, 
Kotter," "Grease" and "Saturday Night Fever." Travolta agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "Grease" game, Tarantino says, each person plays a disc jockey 
collecting hit records. "When we started, John said, 'This is a really lame 
game,' but every time a song title came up, we'd both start singing. You're not 
supposed to, but we did. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
 If Tarantino's neighbors were wondering why two grown men were belting out the 
lyrics to "You're the One That I Want" that night, what they were doing was 
sowing the seeds of Travolta's comeback. Tarantino went back to writing "Pulp 
Fiction," suddenly inspired to tailor one of his principal characters for the 
star, while Travolta went blithely on with his life. 
</P>
<P>
 As grim as things may have seemed to outsiders looking at Travolta's career, 
the actor says he was on a personal high in 1993. He had married actress Kelly 
Preston in 1991, and their son, Jett, was barely a year old. The couple divide 
their time between homes in the Spruce Creek Fly-In development in Florida, on 
an island off the coast of Maine and in Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 Travolta, an avid flyer since age 16, owns three jets (yes, his son was named 
for his hobby), and he keeps the two smaller ones -- a Lear and a vintage 
Vampire British fighter -- in the hangar behind his house in Daytona Beach. 
With wealth, lovely homes, a beautiful wife, a son he says has given him a 
sense of wonder and vulnerability he had never known before, Travolta was 
facing his 40th birthday with everything his heart desired -- except a 
flourishing film career. 
</P>
<P>
 How did an actor who, at 22, was being heralded by some as the new Marlon 
Brando, end up making movies that barely went to video, let alone theaters, a 
decade later? 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until 1985, I think I made all the choices I was supposed to make," 
Travolta says. "But when the onslaught of wonderful young actors came on the 
scene -- Tom Hanks, Cruise, Costner, Mel Gibson -- it was suddenly less 
interesting to give me all the best scripts. It wasn't that there weren't hits 
or some good work after that, but it wasn't at the top level. . . . I had to 
settle for third and fourth choices and make the best of what was offered to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Travolta insists that things were never as grim as they may have seemed to 
outsiders examining his career. There was always something going on, offers he 
didn't take, or things that didn't pan out. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought he had it wired in 1989, when he starred in a Michael 
Douglas-produced drama called "The Tender" and in Robert Altman's one-hour 
dramatization of Harold Pinter's "The Dumb Waiter." But "The Tender" got caught 
up in a bankruptcy and has never been released, and "The Dumb Waiter," in which 
Travolta plays a cockney British hit man, was dumped by ABC in a low-viewer 
time slot. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman raves about Travolta's performance in "The Dumb Waiter," while 
acknowledging that he agreed to consider him only because he was asked to by a 
network executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have cast him based on what I'd seen him do before," Altman 
says. "I was impressed with his confidence. He said he could do it and I 
believed him. . . . I was thrilled with what he did, and Pinter just loved 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 When you look at Travolta's career in the context of what was going on in 
Hollywood, he seems as much a victim of timing as of mismanagement. He arrived 
at the very moment the studios were trying to target youth audiences with 
either special effects or fad movies, and with his good looks, dramatic talent 
and music ability, he was the perfect candidate for those pop culture movie 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saturday Night Fever" tapped into the disco craze, "Grease" into '50s 
nostalgia, "Urban Cowboy" into cowboy chic, "Perfect" into the health club 
singles scene. When Travolta wasn't in films exploiting pop culture trends, he 
was being exploited himself, in Sylvester Stallone's "Staying Alive" and in 
"Two of a Kind," a listless comedy whose only draw was his on-screen reunion 
with "Grease" co-star Olivia Newton-John. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because he rose so fast, when the chain was broken, he fell very quickly," 
says movie critic Gene Siskel, who ranks "Saturday Night Fever" among 
Hollywood's greatest coming-of-age movies. "After that, people put him in a 
box. He was perceived of as a youth performer. People loved him so much in that 
youthful role, they didn't want to let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that even if Travolta had wanted to try some small, "serious" 
films, the industry wasn't making many of them in the early '80s. Only at the 
end of the decade did the studios begin to recognize the viability of movies 
aimed at older audiences. By then, Travolta's image was closer to that of Tab 
Hunter than Marlon Brando. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people doubted he was a good actor," says "Pulp Fiction" 
producer Bender. "But there was the perception in Hollywood that John Travolta 
was not going to get your movie made." 
</P>
<P>
 Travolta himself acknowledges that when "Look Who's Talking" was being 
developed, the studio would green-light it only if one of five actresses -- 
Kirstie Alley, Meg Ryan and Goldie Hawn among them -- would agree to co-star. 
The movie, released at Christmas in 1989, eventually grossed $138 million, and 
the first sequel, "Look Who's Talking Too," sold another $47 million in 
tickets. Travolta made a lot of money through profit participation, but the 
level of scripts being offered to him did not improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Re-enter Quentin Tarantino. 
</P>
<P>
 While Travolta was preparing for the third "Look Who's Talking" movie in 
Vancouver, Canada, Tarantino was tailoring the role of hit man Vincent Vega in 
"Pulp Fiction" for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "After meeting John, I kept thinking of him whenever I was writing for 
Vincent," Tarantino says. "I had another actor (Michael Madsen) in mind when I 
started out, but I could see John doing it. When I finished, I called him and 
said, 'I'm sending you something. Look at Vincent.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an amazing script," says Travolta. "Beyond clever, it was alive and 
unique and real. I thought, 'I would love to do this character, but there is no 
way in hell they're going to let me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Travolta's instincts were right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reaction was 'You can get anybody in the world -- why do you want John 
Travolta?' " Bender says. 
</P>
<P>
 Travolta said at a press conference in Cannes that Tarantino had put his job 
on the line to get him in the movie, and publicly thanked him for it. Tarantino 
says he didn't have to go quite that far, saying he persuaded the film's 
financial backers with "my enthusiasm." Even after he was approved for the 
role, Travolta had to sign on for a fee that he says didn't even cover his 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to (Miramax Chairman) Harvey Weinstein, 'I'll accept this, but isn't 
this inverted? I grew up thinking that if you did some work, you got paid for 
it.' I just had to look at it as an investment, and it worked out pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, of course, it's the performance, not the casting 
gimmick, that has returned Travolta to the Hollywood A-list. With 
shoulder-length hair and earrings, his six-foot frame swollen to a sluggish 200 
pounds, Travolta plays Vincent as a gently disoriented sociopath, talking his 
partner's ears off about the comparative qualities of American- and 
foreign-made French fries while preparing to carry out a Mob execution. 
</P>
<P>
 As critic Pauline Kael observed about him early in his career, Travolta is a 
great physical actor -- "he has the gift of transparency," she wrote -- and you 
can hardly look at Vincent floating along on a heroin high and not giggle. 
</P>
<P>
 There is certainly nothing transparent in Travolta's appearance. He was more 
than 40 pounds heavier for "Pulp Fiction" than he was for "Saturday Night 
Fever" and is unabashed about it. There's a scene in the film where he is 
compelled to strip, and, by his own description, it's not a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw that scene for the first time in Cannes, I went, 'Ooh.' I told 
Quentin, 'I'll do this, but if I turn around and show my big ass, audiences 
will be going, 'Do we really have to?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his weight now, Travolta runs through the numbers as if they were 
part of his resume. He weighed 180 as Barbarino, 160 as Tony Manero and nearly 
230 as the expectant father of Jett Travolta. "When Kelly ate," he says, "I ate 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino says Travolta offered to bulk up for the role of Vincent, but they 
agreed that a middle-aged hit man addicted to heroin and french fries wouldn't 
spend much time in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The real genius was in Tarantino's casting of Travolta, says the star's 
supporters. "There is a sweetness that's always there," critic Siskel says. 
"That's a real powerful thing in him." 
</P>
<P>
 "John has a quality of vulnerability and emotional connection that is evident 
in every movie he's ever done," says producer and business manager Krane. "You 
get it from him no matter what kind of character he plays." 
</P>
<P>
 John Badham, who directed Travolta in "Saturday Night Fever," ranks his 
Oscar-nominated performance in that film as one of the finest he has ever seen 
and says it would have been a different movie with anyone else in the role. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Manero was the most negative, rude, manipulative, using kind of 
character that I'd ever seen in a script," Badham recalls. "An actor without 
sympathy would have made him totally hateful. John brought a quality to him 
that made him work, made audiences feel something for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen years later, Travolta seems to have done the same thing in "Pulp 
Fiction" for Vincent Vega, a lowlife thug with a quick trigger and a kindly 
spirit.  
</P>
<P>
 There is a scene in "Pulp Fiction" in which Vincent accidentally shoots a man 
in the head, creating a mess in his and his partner's car that takes them the 
next 20 minutes of screen time to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 "That scene to me was the hardest part of saying yes to the project," Travolta 
says. "In the original script, I shoot the guy once in the throat and he's 
still alive, so I have to shoot him in the head to put him out of his misery. 
Then we worry about the mess. It was the scene most like the torture scene in 
'Reservoir Dogs,' and I didn't think it was going to be funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Travolta ended up suggesting changes that both soften the cruelty of his 
character and take the entire sequence directly into black comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 However "Pulp Fiction" does at the box office, Travolta says, it has already 
changed his life and his thinking about the industry that coveted him, rejected 
him and is now coveting him again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warren Beatty told me something 10 years ago that I didn't quite believe," 
Travolta says. "I asked him, 'Warren, what's more important: movies that do 
well from a box-office point of view or movies that the industry admires more?' 
Without a beat, he said, 'What you need to do is impress the people who can 
further your career.' I thought he was crazy, but I can't disagree now. The 
perception of 'Pulp Fiction' is changing the perception of who I am in 
Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Tarantino, the fan who rescued the star, it all seemed so obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "It drove me crazy in the last five years seeing John in the movies he's been 
in," Tarantino says. "I looked at them and said, 'Why aren't directors taking 
advantage of him? Don't they know they have this great natural resource out 
there?' " 
</P>
<P>
 They do now.

ART; THE APARTMENT OF ANTIQUITIES; A COLLECTION OF 200 WORKS FROM THE ANCIENT 
WORLD MOVES FROM A MANHATTAN COUPLE'S VERY PRIVATE ENCLAVE TO A RARE PUBLIC 
VIEWING AT THE GETTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Hi. I'm Larry Fleischman," says an energetic man, striding down a hall and 
shaking my hand as I step out of an elevator in an elegant high-rise. The 
high-powered businessman, who gained financial success in television, real 
estate and investments before taking over Kennedy Galleries, one of the world's 
leading American art dealerships, is anything but the intimidating character 
one might expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm Barbara," says his effervescent wife, inviting me into the couple's 
apartment, where treasures from ancient Greece, Rome and Etruria compete with 
stunning views of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronze and marble statues of Greek gods -- Dionysus, Athena, Apollo and Venus 
-- stand on pedestals and window ledges. Fragments of ancient frescoes hang on 
walls. Painted ceramic vessels sit on shelves, while jewelry, small sculptures 
and hardware nestle in vitrines. Seen through a broad sweep of windows, the 
bustling city resembles a modern tapestry with miniature buildings deliberately 
organized in geometric patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an astonishing environment, known only to the Fleischmans' friends and to 
scholars who make pilgrimages here to see one of the world's leading private 
collections of antiquities. Neither art as decor nor a pretentious showcase, 
the two-story apartment is a sort of live-in museum that mixes domestic comfort 
with aesthetic and intellectual stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
 As befits a couple who treat their art acquisitions as members of the family, 
the Fleischmans' collecting is essentially a private love affair. But it's 
about to go public in "A Passion for Antiquities: Ancient Art From the 
Collection of Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman," an exhibition of more than 200 
objects opening on Thursday at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu. The show 
will continue at the Getty through Jan. 15, then travel to the Cleveland Museum 
of Art from Feb. 15 to April 23. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming exhibition is the first and -- the Fleischmans say -- only time 
most of the ancient artworks will be removed from their apartment and put in 
the public eye. Parting with their treasures for several months may prove to be 
traumatic, but a few days before the tedious process of wrapping and crating 
begins, the Fleischmans are excited about the project. "We trust the Getty," 
Barbara says. "They are doing everything in the most professional way." 
</P>
<P>
 Going all out for the event, the Getty will install the works in about half of 
its first floor galleries, which are appropriately housed in a replica of a 
1st-Century Roman villa. Getty Trust Publications has issued a fully 
illustrated color catalogue of the Fleischman collection. In addition, a series 
of public programs will offer Roman-theme family days, lectures by scholars and 
Larry Fleischman and performances of ancient Greek and Roman comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fleischman celebration recognizes private collectors as a source of 
inspiration and support for museums, says Getty Museum Director John Walsh. But 
the exhibition also offers a hint of the future at the Malibu villa. In 1997, 
after the Getty's collections of European paintings, drawings and sculpture, 
decorative arts and photographs move to a new museum at the Getty Center in 
Brentwood, the villa will be converted into a museum and study center for 
antiquities. Temporary exhibitions will then become a major part of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Large private collections of antiquities are extremely rare, but the 
Fleischmans' cache is extraordinary, says Marion True, the Getty's curator of 
antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What distinguishes their collection is both the variety of the pieces -- from 
a Cycladic head to beautiful late Roman glass -- and their quality. Every 
single piece is exceptional. . . . I have never seen a collection selected with 
such sure taste," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition is designed to celebrate the Fleischmans' day-to-day 
relationship to their chosen artworks. The idea is to preserve the intimate 
character of the relatively small objects and to display them in thematic 
categories, as at the Fleischmans' apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Visitors will not only have the chance to view some of the most brilliant 
works of art from ancient Greece and Rome to be seen anywhere, but they will 
also have the unusual opportunity to experience some of the pleasures and sense 
of discovery that true collectors enjoy," True says. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing exhibition visitors will not witness, however, is Larry's penchant 
for tinkering with the collection's arrangement. "He's our installation and 
lighting man," Barbara says. "If I hear a noise at 5 a.m., I know it's Larry 
moving things around." And if all is quiet at that hour, he is probably reading 
one of the books in their antiquities library. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he brings pieces together because of their function, as in a group 
of metal weights. "Larry became fascinated with weights," Barbara says of a 
display of tiny metal objects in the shape of animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes them so incredible is that they weigh exactly what they are 
supposed to weigh, but they have been fashioned as something that's really 
quite beautiful and charming. Apparently there's always the yearning to make 
something functional look nice and interesting and pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading a tour through the apartment, Barbara points out themes and 
connections. One display case holds athletic figures, while theatrical scenes 
and characters -- a favorite subject of the Fleischmans -- turn up in several 
displays of terra-cotta vases, bronze pots and masks. As we progress from room 
to room, she compares different artists' interpretations of Greek gods and 
points out details of particularly fine workmanship. But what pleases her most 
is the timelessness of the art's human qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's so extraordinary is that these objects make it very obvious 
that life hasn't changed much," Barbara says. "Family life, daily activities, 
the quest for intellectual stimulation, all kinds of concerns that you see in 
these objects are the same today as they were when these pieces were made. We 
have Saran Wrap, but life really has not changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing out a Roman bronze statue of a chubby toddler, she says: "Here's a 
little boy, a baby Dionysus from the period before the eruption at Vesuvius. 
And look how beautifully observed he is. He's just a chunky little Italian 
boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Further on, Barbara confides her affinity with an Etruscan sprite clad only in 
shoes and jewelry -- her own favorite accouterments. 
</P>
<P>
 Nodding at his wife's remarks, and chiming in with occasional comments, Larry 
offers a small Hellenistic bronze likeness of an old woman. "This is a special 
old lady," he says. "Scholars are debating who she is. One thinks she's an old 
madam. One thinks an old prophetess. Another thinks she's a spinner of wool."  
</P>
<P>
 The varied array of artworks raises questions about how the Fleischmans decide 
to add to their collection. "The first thing is, visually we have to like it," 
Larry says of potential acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara agrees: "The objects have to grab us. This is more than an 
intellectual pursuit." And it is something they do together. "We don't have his 
and hers pieces," she says. "If one of us really disliked something we wouldn't 
buy it, but we rarely disagree. I think that after 46 years of marriage we have 
sort of merged." 
</P>
<P>
 The collection is so extensive that it may appear to be a marriage-long 
project, but most of the works have been assembled during the last 14 years. 
What's more, it is not their first extraordinary collection. Indeed, the 
Fleischmans are so closely identified with a completely different genre -- 
American art -- that they might be expected to live with paintings by members 
of the Peale family or John Singleton Copley, Winslow Homer, Albert Pinkham 
Ryder, Charles Burchfield and John Marin. 
</P>
<P>
 They did, during a former life in Detroit. Larry founded the Archives of 
American Art in 1954, lectured on American art for the U.S. Information Agency 
in the 1960s and from 1962 to 1966 served as president of the Detroit Institute 
of Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry began to turn his passion into a profession in 1966, when he became a 
partner in Kennedy Galleries, a New York-based American art dealership. The 
Fleischmans moved to New York about 14 years ago, and he is now owner and chief 
operating officer of the firm, which recently moved its operation from 57th 
Street to 5th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to the couple's American art? 
</P>
<P>
 "We divested ourselves of the collection to avoid competing with our clients 
at Kennedy Galleries," Larry says. 
</P>
<P>
 But once a collector, always a collector. Deprived of their American 
paintings, the Fleischmans turned their attention to classical antiquities, a 
field that had long intrigued them. Having bought a few pieces of ancient art 
through the years -- beginning in 1951 with a Roman bronze lamp -- they began 
to pursue antiquities in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 Piece by piece, marble statuary, bronze vessels and sculpture, terra-cotta 
vases, fresco panels and gold and silver jewelry found their way to the 
Fleischmans' apartment. Book by book, so did an extensive library. Before long, 
word about the collection was out in scholarly circles. With this exhibition, 
the public will get the message too.

POP MUSIC; HE'S NO WALK IN THE PARK; THERE'S DARK, THERE'S ANGRY AND THEN 
THERE'S ROCKER GLENN DANZIG. HIS MUSIC IS NOT DESIGNED TO MAKE ANYONE FEEL 
GOOD, OR EVEN FEEL BETTER. BASICALLY, HE SAYS, 'I HATE THE WORLD.'

<P>
 Knocking on the heavy wooden door of Glenn Danzig's Los Feliz-area house, you 
half expect Lurch to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrought-iron-fenced front yard is a patch of dead weeds, and the braces 
propping up earthquake-damaged beams make the place a cross between the Addams 
Family mansion and the House of Usher. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark and musty interior, a clutter of kitsch presenting some disturbing 
contrasts, furthers the impression: A real stuffed wolf stands menacingly near 
an incongruously cute Snoopy telephone; a collection of jack-o-lantern figures 
shares shelf space with a vast array of Looney Toons items. 
</P>
<P>
 And there, amid this cultural chaos, sits Danzig, railing against the evil he 
sees in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 It's what he's been known for since his days leading the late-'70s punk band 
the Misfits, through his current role fronting the dark hard-rock quartet that 
bears his last name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is a (messed)-up place," he says, steely-eyed and matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm angry at everything," Danzig, 35, continues, his eyes softening and his 
mouth curling into just enough of a smile to make it clear that he's given it a 
lot of thought. "I hate the world."  
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take long with Danzig's music to figure that out. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's new album, "4," covers typical Danzig thematic territory with such 
songs as "Until You Call on the Dark," "Bringer of Death" and "Stalker Song," 
all in a focused, metal-tinged style marked by an elastic yowl reminiscent of 
Jim Morrison's ( see review, Page 70 ). Capping it off is an unlisted "bonus" 
track that sounds like an excerpt from a Black Mass, with creepy organ and 
chants to the "demon." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of thing that's gotten Danzig branded a satanist -- something he 
doesn't deny but won't discuss at length -- and has made him a perennial 
outsider with a me-against-the-world attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also won him a fiercely loyal following that has made him a touring 
favorite and has pushed several of his albums past the 500,000 sales mark. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Danzig says, it's also gotten him many enemies in the music industry -- 
people put off by his brash manner and insistence on doing things his way at 
all times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glenn's not anybody's friend," say Rick Rubin, the head of American 
Recordings, which releases Danzig's records. "He's Glenn Danzig's friend, and 
sometimes his biggest enemy as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, the outsider is moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 The new album is one of the most hotly anticipated releases in hard rock of 
late, following the surprise MTV and radio success last year of "Mother," a 
live track from Danzig's 1993 EP "Thrall-Demonsweatlive." And after a career of 
self-management, Danzig has signed up with the same management firm that 
represents Guns N' Roses. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also started a publishing company to put out both prose and his beloved 
comics, and he has plans to expand into the world of video games and other 
multimedia ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 This comes after more than a decade of cult recognition for the singer, who as 
the leader of the Misfits was a mainstay of New York's do-it-yourself 
punk-metal scene, the Eastern equivalent of L.A.'s Black Flag. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig grew up in the town of Lodi, N.J., as did his longtime bassist, Eerie 
Von. But if you want Danzig to provide any clues of what his young life was 
like, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer studiously avoids talking about his childhood in interviews -- the 
publicists at American Recordings say they can't recall any stories dealing 
with his early years. Even manager John Reese says he knows very little of 
Danzig's background beyond the Misfits. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Danzig himself about the roots of his anger and intensity, and all he'll 
say is that it comes from a lifetime of dealing with the "hypocrisy" in the 
world. But those who know him and work with him have no doubt that those roots 
go deep -- the dark mystique is not just an act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," Reese says. "He's a very complex, intelligent individual." 
</P>
<P>
 The satanist label, Rubin says, "is something people grab on to too easily." 
</P>
<P>
 But he adds, "I don't know how right or wrong it is. It's an easy label, and 
Glenn transcends a lot of boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Fronting Danzig, which evolved out of his post-Misfits band Samhain, he ranks 
perhaps with Henry Rollins and Fugazi as a symbol of independent rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a matter of time," Rubin says of Danzig's success. "There are 
bands like this that are maybe not the most MTV-friendly or radio-friendly or 
even press-friendly, but they're kid-friendly. It reaches a point of mass 
combustion, a natural progression from the ground up." 
</P>
<P>
 The band sold out a Halloween show two years ago at the 15,000-seat Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre, where it will return for a repeat performance on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all that, there's still a kind of respect that Danzig craves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just headlined a festival in Holland where there was like 116,000 people," 
he says. "How many more people do we have to play for before our breakthrough 
is recognized? What do we have to do to be considered a real band? How long do 
we have to tour before we're not a fluke anymore? How many albums do we have to 
do? 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm saying is there are bands that play in front of a lot less people 
than us, sell less records than us, and are considered successes. Yet we're 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Danzig believes that the powers that be -- in the record industry, the 
media and the government -- have a stake in keeping him and his message of 
independence underground. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want people to think -- the people in charge," he says, laughing 
at how this will look in print. "It'll sound like a conspiracy theory, but 
basically I've had a lot of problems. You think it's a joke -- it's not a joke. 
It's very serious. I've had to live with it. I've had the CIA try to arrest me. 
I have people filming my shows. I have people try to set us up on the road. 
I've been branded a satanist with people saying I'm gonna ruin the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Says manager Reese: "It's not just paranoia. There are some incidents that 
have gone down in the past where he's been harassed." 
</P>
<P>
 One person who was willing to give him respect was Johnny Cash -- himself one 
of pop music's most legendary outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rubin signed Cash to his label last year and started to produce sessions 
for the recent "American Recordings" album, he asked Danzig to write a song for 
it. Danzig, whose father had been a big Cash fan, jumped at the chance and 
penned "Thirteen" for the Man in Black. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Rick asked me, all I said was, 'Sure!' " says Danzig, who also had a 
song recorded by the late Roy Orbison on the Rubin-produced "Less Than Zero" 
soundtrack album a few years back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part was that Johnny Cash was a real nice guy. I don't think he 
really knew much about me," Danzig says. "I think his grandchildren had told 
him a little. And after we met he asked around and found out more. It was 
really funny. I read an interview with him where he was asked about me and 
said, 'I don't know. I met him and he wrote me a damn good song and was a nice 
guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig is hoping that if one thing comes from increased fame, it will be that 
more people will see through the hype and accept him on his own terms, not as a 
media caricature. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people get preconceived notions about what we are about," he says. 
"They hear that it's all satanic or this or that. But when they hear it, it's 
like, 'Wow, this is pretty good.' That's all we ask -- that people decide for 
themselves."

COVER STORY; EVERY DAY'S CHRISTMAS FOR TIM; OR IS IT? 'HOME IMPROVEMENT,' A NEW 
BOOK AND THE ROLE OF SANTA IN AN UPCOMING DISNEY MOVIE, LIFE SHOULD BE GOLDEN 
FOR TIM ALLEN. BUT AS HE'LL TELL YOU, IT'S NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE. 
</P>

 These days, when Tim Allen cries out for "more power," he's likely to be 
talking about the megabytes of RAM in the hard drive of his Macintosh 
Powerbook. He doesn't have much time to spend with the circular saws, power 
drills and leaf blowers that were the heart of his stand-up comedy act -- and 
that served as the inspiration for ABC's "Home Improvement," the most popular 
TV show in America for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen still regards his tools as toys, and as the bonding agent of all men, 
but they are of a largely different variety today. Instead of wearing a tool 
belt with a hammer dangling from it, Allen putters around the "Home 
Improvement" stage on the Walt Disney Studios lot with a cellular phone 
strapped to his belt. Lying on the floor of his dressing room is his Powerbook 
and an oversized Wizard pocket organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love these things," says Allen, one of seven brothers who grew up in 
Colorado and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 All the gadgets are there to help Allen, 41, manage his image as the nation's 
biggest TV star, one who is carefully, thoughtfully building his career the way 
a carpenter constructs a house. 
</P>
<P>
 When Allen was released from prison in 1982, after a 28-month stint for 
selling cocaine to an undercover police officer, he found his salvation in 
humor on the comedy-club circuit, which eventually led to his own sitcom. 
Today, in between taping weekly episodes of "Home Improvement," he's busily 
promoting a book, "Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man," and finishing 
post-production on his first motion picture, "The Santa Clause," due out Nov. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 The modestly budgeted holiday movie was produced by Hollywood Pictures, a 
division of Walt Disney Studios. After seeing the footage, however, Walt Disney 
Pictures swooped in, pumped more than 
</P>
<P>
 $1 million into added music and special effects, and will now release it under 
the more prestigious Walt Disney banner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home Improvement," meanwhile, showed one and all last month that it is still 
the sitcom of the '90s, maintaining its No. 1 Nielsen standing despite having 
moved to a new night to face new competition -- NBC's Emmy Award-winning 
"Frasier," starring Kelsey Grammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's own power is such that he could joke during the Emmy telecast Sept. 11 
about having former Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg fired -- 
for not entering Allen's name in time for the Emmy competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen took a break on the set of "Home Improvement" last week to sit on the 
floor of his dressing room and discuss his book, his movie, his future and the 
intoxicating effects of his career on himself, his wife, Laura, and their 3 
1/2-year-old daughter, Kady. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: So are you more powerful than Jeffrey Katzenberg? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Right now I am. He doesn't work here. (Laughs.) No, I don't think so, 
no. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Describe your book. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Hyperion, the publishers, wanted something, and I wanted something else. 
That's why it took me too long to do this. I read a lot of philosophy, and I 
always thought I could write a philosophy book. I haven't been able to take any 
of my philosophy further than speculation because I can't prove the theories I 
have. But I wanted to add some of that in there, and they wanted all jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you resolve the situation? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I pretty much decided to write what I wanted to write. I said: "I'll write 
two chapters. If you don't like it, don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So is the book philosophy or comedy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I took some personal risks, revealing certain things so that I might have 
more credence by saying, "Because of this, I understand this." It's similar to 
what I do in my stage show. (In the book) I was able to give some opinions 
about behavior -- and I'm not an expert -- and a little bit of philosophy. 
Cheap philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you give me an example of something new that you revealed in the book, 
something you haven't revealed onstage? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I never revealed anything about prison before, about taking 
responsibility for your actions. That's not all that damn funny. I never, ever 
talked about my father's death on stage, about milestones in one's life that 
change you dramatically. I never talked about my real last name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which is? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Dick. The whole first part of the book, the first two chapters, are about 
penis. I go overboard on it, and some people take offense to it. But the reason 
is, hopefully, to put you in the mind-set of where I was. Up until I was 16 
years old, I'd say, "Hi, I'm Tim Dick." And they'd go: "Ha ha. Penis!" So I was 
constantly being related to a penis -- all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You call yourself a masculinist, and you propose a sort of national men's 
movement . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, a personal men's movement. I really kind of shy away from any kind of 
mass movements. There's a bunch of unhealthy men out there, and it would take a 
very few steps to make them healthy: Stop listening to so much bull----, do the 
things that come natural to you, and enjoy them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What comes natural to men? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Men are really confused about who they are supposed to be. There are times 
when men are in touch with their feelings, and it's usually around these stupid 
icons -- I say stupid because they are stereotypes -- cars, tools, guns. They 
are basically the way men communicate with other men. We're comfortable in a 
sports bar with another guy talking about stats. We're not as comfortable if he 
says, "How do you feel about me?" I don't think there's anything wrong with the 
way men communicate. The problem is we don't communicate very well with women, 
and women don't understand how we say things, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you ever find you insult women with your views about men and women?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Because I'm not a brilliant guy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How have you offended women? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sometimes my views on periods and babies can be misinterpreted. I've had 
fights over them, because obviously I know nothing about them. You're in a 
dangerous area talking to women about those kinds of things -- anything about 
their processes.  
</P>
<P>
 In the same way, I somewhat resent women telling me all about my penis -- what 
my penis does, and what my penis tells me to do. You hear it all the time: 
"That's your penis talking." Well, how the hell would you know? I don't know 
(anything) about your cycles. Why do you think you would know anything about my 
penis? It goes both ways. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think there's anything men can do that women can't? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Write their name in the snow. I mean, women can do it, but you have to be 
very good. Very, very good. There are certain things we're better equipped to 
do, but it doesn't mean women can't do them. So you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's talk about your movie. What is "The Santa Clause" about? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In a nutshell, it's a relationship story about an estranged boy and his 
father. This man is divorced. Doesn't see the kid much. Doesn't relate to the 
kid. He's kind of lost the kid in him. Through a twist of fate, he slowly has 
to assume the position of Santa Claus. It's a very good emotional gift for the 
guy because he learns to appreciate things that he's lost. He finally relates 
to his kid. He gets into a wonderful relationship with his kid, but on the 
outside reality rears its ugly head, because this is a guy who's claiming to be 
Santa Claus. So his kid has to go through this ugly mess with him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why are you doing a movie? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have no idea. Two friends of mine (Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick) 
brought me the script and said, "We wrote this with you in mind." So I read it 
with my wife on vacation, and we both cried and laughed. I said, "This is a 
marvelous movie." I had never read a screenplay before. So I assumed they were 
all like this. And I took it to Jeffrey Katzenberg. He read it over in one 
night and called me right back and said, "I'll buy this tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was it a backhanded compliment that Walt Disney Pictures picked up the 
film, considering you were asked to produce your first film for Hollywood 
Pictures at the outset? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I never worried about it. "Home Improvement" was the same way. When you put 
all your ducks in a row and you do your job and you work hard, it tends to pay 
off. And we did all of that. We planned very well, and everyone jumped into the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see this as a perennial holiday re-release? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not with Disney. It will be on mugs at Del Taco before you know it. They'll 
market the hell out of it. If it was up to me I'd handle movies differently. I 
wouldn't release everything on videocassette so quickly, because it spoils it 
as a future Christmas release. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you executive producer on the film? Do you own part of it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. I didn't need any of that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you want out of this?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I just wanted the experience, to see if I like it. This movie involved 
several different locations, special effects, blue screen, harnesses, flying, 
prosthetics, elves, animals, children. There's a touch of every blockbuster 
movie in this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Through all of this, I've gathered a wealth of information, not the least of 
which is working with a studio. Because an actor happened to bring the project 
to them -- very similar to "Home Improvement." I had a lot of input in "Home 
Improvement," because it was my act, and (the characters) Wilson and Al were my 
invention. With this movie, I was part of the creative team. So you have an 
actor with a voice. That's not the ideal situation for a studio. 
</P>
<P>

 Q: You're arguably the biggest TV star in the country right now. Do you want 
to become a movie star? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know. I certainly don't want any more attention. I certainly don't 
need any more people writing about me -- no offense. It's just that there are 
other things that are more important. What scares me is becoming -- forgive 
this word -- bigger . I mean, the power of this medium, TV, is unbelievable. 
Are movies any different than this? Or will they just add more texture to this 
persona that TV has created for me? I don't know yet. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: You could fill up a season's worth of "Love Boat" episodes with all the TV 
stars who failed in the movies. Do you have any concerns about that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I don't. None of that matters. We made a wonderful movie. Every goal 
that I set for this thing has been accomplished. The rest of it is not actually 
a crapshoot. We've got a built-in audience for the movie (because of the 
subject matter). I've seen it, just like I watch every episode of this show. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is very good. John Pasquin (its director) directed the first year of 
"Home Improvement"; we both have the same sense of humor. There are some 
burst-out laughing moments. There are some really funny sight gags. The North 
Pole is fabulous. And the transition of me to 270 pounds -- well, the picture 
is on the cover of USA Today's Life section this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are you dealing with this flood of success? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm really not. I think I'm probably in denial. I very rarely sit and think 
about it. There always has to be, I believe, some personal cost for all this. I 
think that anybody in my position has some problem with it. I've never spoken 
to the Spencer Tracys or the Gregory Pecks, these people who have dealt with it 
and seem to be fairly normal. 
</P>
<P>
 If you go my route, I'm actually more like Bob Hope, if I can use him, because 
he went from stand-up comedy, to vaudeville, to radio, to television, to 
movies. And he seems to have handled it. Because he became Bob Hope. He doesn't 
have another persona. I'm afraid that's what's happened to me. I end up 
becoming Tim Allen. That was just a name change, and that name change has 
actually taken over. But Tim Dick owns all of this. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure a psychiatrist would say this is dangerous -- I'm segmenting my life. 
Because Tim Allen is a figment of everybody's imagination. It's a character Tim 
Dick created, for stage. And now Tim Dick is way in the background. The guy who 
created all of this is very quiet, and you very rarely see him. He's still 
there. He's still there when I'm quiet. He's still there when I sleep and when 
I'm dreaming. He's still there when I'm in the bathroom. But the part that can 
be him is very small. Even with my family, he becomes very small. Because 
eventually, "Home Improvement" will come up. It's a very powerful image in 
America right now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the price Tim Dick is paying for Tim Allen? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know. I don't think I'm all 100% healthy -- mentally, physically 
and spiritually. My spheres are all out of proportion: you know, your material 
life, your home life, your work -- you have all these spheres. And when one of 
them gets bigger, it starts crowding the other ones out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which of your spheres are out of balance? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think my spiritual thing. I haven't been around my church enough. I 
haven't been giving enough. Because just giving money to charity is less than 
effective. You have to give something, give up some of your time. Right now my 
time is so valuable, I covet it. I'm always doing something that's worth 
something to somebody, whether it be Disney or my management or "Home 
Improvement." And that, I think, will change. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You're America's most visible dad, and yet you seem to keep your home life 
private. How come? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My wife doesn't like it. She's trying to stay out of the hurricane. And I'm 
really trying to keep my daughter out of it, although it's impossible. She 
watches me on TV. I would not wish this (stuff) on anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the biggest impact of having Tim Allen, the creation, for a father? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know. It just worries me. I don't know what it does to her. It 
might come out later in life. I have her to the set. She knows all the TV kids. 
But somehow the Power Rangers aren't the same to her. Because I say, "That's a 
TV show too." She says, "Yes, but they're real ." I'm trying to get her to know 
that TV is an illusion that you manipulate, and not vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 So we have an editing machine at home, and we watch videocassettes. I show her 
the process, so that she understands technically what TV is. But the emotional 
side of it -- I don't know what this does. My fear is that she will use it, 
like every child uses something, to get attention. You know, "Guess what my dad 
does?" She's done a little bit of that, and we try to caution her, but I can't 
stop her from doing it. I'm glad that she's proud of me. But there's a 
difference between being proud and boasting. All that's left to be seen. I just 
hope we can manage it. Otherwise, we'll have to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have any fears that all this will end? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think sometimes I do, because it's intoxicating, this attention. 
Everybody knows that. I mean, children vie for attention. Dogs vie for 
attention. To get this much attention, for God's sake, it's intoxicating. When 
it goes away, there's a little vacuum -- I'm not sure what it is. And then I 
just go out to the supermarket: Ah, there I am again. Because I get so used to 
that persona, being recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was at this party, and even the guy who played Gomer -- or wait, who was 
the guy on "The Love Boat"? Goober? No, Gopher (Fred Grandy) -- he's still 
recognized. This is "The Love Boat"! This is, what, 17 years ago (that the show 
went on the air)? So it doesn't really end. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel about kicking Kelsey Grammer's butt in the ratings? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't. That's between NBC and ABC. Going into it, I was sorry that it 
even happened. Just like I was sorry when ABC put us up against "Seinfeld" (two 
years ago). It does two things that I don't like. First, we (at "Home 
Improvement") are always posed in the press as some 600-pound gorilla with no 
taste that's knocking off these wonderful, eclectic shows. I think our show is 
different than that. It's much deeper than most people think. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, I don't appreciate the networks screwing around with Kelsey or me, or 
Kelsey's family (on the show), or my family (on the show), or our studio, or 
anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 You get very protective, so you get in a very competitive mode to make sure 
you do all you can to come out on top. But I called him (Grammer) the day 
before this all happened. And I just said: "No matter what you read in the 
press, I like your show. I think you're a very talented man. And I'm sorry this 
happened." And he said the same thing. I did the same with Jerry (Seinfeld). 
Because it somehow comes out me against Kelsey Grammer. What it is is (ABC 
executives) Bob Iger and Ted Harbert against (NBC executive) Warren 
Littlefield. That's what this is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How long are you signed on to star in "Home Improvement"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm signed for seven years total (three more after this season). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "The Cosby Show" sold for more than $3 million an episode in syndication, 
making Bill Cosby a multimillionaire. How much do you stand to make, and what 
does that kind of money do to a person? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I try to keep it out of my mind. This whole business is silly money anyway. 
And I say "silly money" in the most respectful way. I worked my ass off for 15 
years being a comic. My wife and I saved, and we bought a nice house in 
Michigan, and we put a bedroom on for the kid with very hard-earned money. It 
was a $64,000 house. Means nothing today. But we bought that, and we almost 
paid that thing off. 
</P>
<P>
 When I started "Home Improvement," I left all that. I left my bank account 
there. I left my life back there. Now I don't know what's going to happen. 
We're still pretty much the same people. I still like turkey cutlets. Nothing 
has really changed. All that money seems like an illusion. I like to actually 
see it. Because you never really get this money. Over half of what I make goes 
to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where does the rest of it go? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It goes to accountants, managers, bills, and then we put some money into 
the bank and into the college fund for my kid. I'll tell you the best thing 
about it: I don't have to worry about where I live. I've always worried about a 
mortgage payment, like everybody else. I was able to pay off my mortgage in 
Michigan, and I own that house. It's a wonderful thing to own a house. I've not 
paid my mortgage off here, but I own a house, way earlier than my parents did. 
They were 60, and at 40 I own my house. So if the bottom falls out of 
everything, I own the house, I've got a nest egg, and the rest is an illusion.

IN THE MATTER OF JUSTICE THOMAS; SILENT, ALOOF AND FREQUENTLY DOGMATIC, 
CLARENCE THOMAS' JUDICIAL PERSONA EMERGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David G. Savage, David G. Savage, a Times staff writer, covers the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exactly at 10 o'clock on a Monday morning, the strike of a gavel echoes 
through the courtroom, and the nine black-robed justices of the Supreme Court 
emerge from behind a red velvet curtain. As those assembled in the ornate hall 
take their seats, the lead lawyer rises, and the arguments begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, most of the justices are up on their elbows, hurling questions at the 
attorneys. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg take turns 
poking holes in the advocate's argument. Justice Antonin Scalia, sympathetic to 
his case, leaps in to prop up his contention. "Aren't you really arguing that . 
. . ," Scalia offers helpfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony M. Kennedy, looking pensive, asks a philosophical question. Troubled 
by the answer, Justices David Souter and John Paul Stevens want to know how far 
the advocate seeks to push his claim. All the while, Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist leafs through the briefs, trying to find a disputed passage of the 
law in question. 
</P>
<P>
 But one justice looks out of place. At the far end of the bench, Justice 
Clarence Thomas rocks back in his leather chair and gazes at the ceiling. He 
rubs his eyes and stares off into the distance. Sometimes, Thomas has a 
brooding look, as if he is pondering deeply. More often, he just looks bored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand it. He is engaged," says a former Thomas clerk, who like 
most of those who have worked for him, expresses great admiration for the 
justice. "He likes to argue out the issues in chambers" and displays a special 
interest in bankruptcy law and state tax disputes, he says. But Thomas' 
interest is not apparent in the courtroom. While Scalia and Ginsburg may ask 
five or six questions during a one-hour argument, Thomas asked not a single 
question during the last term of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers in Washington and visitors to the courtroom never fail to comment on 
how removed he seems. "What's wrong with Clarence Thomas?" one lawyer new to 
the high court commented. "He just sits there." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a marked contrast from his 18 months on the U.S. Court of Appeals in 
Washington, says a judge who observed him then. "He's like two different 
people," says the judge. "He was talkative, gregarious on our court, a real 
participant. Now he seems to be in a shell." 
</P>
<P>
 This eerie courtroom silence has marked Thomas' career for all of the three 
years since he inadvertently became the best-known member of the Supreme Court. 
At first it seemed that he was simply trying to retreat, somehow, from the 
stinging visibility of the "he said, she said" confrontation with Prof. Anita 
Hill that made him the ostensible villain in a TV drama about sexual 
harassment. It was, perhaps, the worst imaginable fate for a fiercely proud and 
intensely dignified man. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time he was the most carefully watched, most reviled man in town. On the 
November day he took the oath of office at the court, his ceremonial walk down 
the marble steps was cut short when a small group of protesters began to boo 
and shout, "Down with the Male Supremacist Court." Not surprisingly, rather 
than beam for assembled photographers, Thomas turned away and walked back into 
the basement of the court. A few months later, the new justice accepted an 
invitation to judge a moot court competition at Seton Hall University Law 
School but canceled when word came that a women's student group was planning a 
candlelight vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 Wounded, Thomas retreated into the silence that protects a judge who is even 
more rigid and dogmatic than his opponents feared. As the hoopla over the man 
has died down, his judicial record has become clearer. He has compiled the most 
conservative voting record on a conservative court and lambasted his colleagues 
for refusing to go further in changing the law. He has voted to revoke the 
right to abortion and return some prayer to the public schools. He cast a key 
vote to cut off further hearings in a death penalty case, even when newly 
revealed evidence might have proven the defendant's innocence. He cast the 
deciding votes to make it harder for minorities to prove they were victims of 
job discrimination, harder for victims of stock fraud to sue lawyers and harder 
for environmentalists to be heard in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has shown himself to be exactly what his opponents said he would be: a 
knee-jerk right-winger," says University of Virginia law professor Pamela 
Karlan. "He was always going to be tainted somewhat for how he got to the 
court, but I think he is going to be more tainted by how he is acting now. He's 
shown no capacity for growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgetown University Law Center Associate Dean Mark Tushnet concurs. "So far, 
it's been the least impressive performance of any justice since Whittaker," he 
says, referring to justly forgotten Charles Whittaker, who resigned from the 
court in 1962 after having a nervous breakdown in his fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
 But friends and admirers say Thomas is unfairly treated because he is a 
conservative. "He is not the justice that the NAACP would like," says Stephen 
McAllister, a former Thomas clerk who teaches law at the University of Kansas. 
"He brings his own perspective to the law, but he certainly knows what it was 
like to grow up poor and black." 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling the debate are Thomas' activities outside the court. The confirmation 
fight separated Thomas' allies from his enemies, and it deepened an already 
strong commitment to conservative values. While other justices avoid any 
appearance of partisanship, he boasts of his friendship with conservative 
commentator Rush Limbaugh, speaks mostly to gatherings of conservatives, brags 
about not reading the papers and indulges a "not politically correct" fondness 
for smoking cigars and driving a black Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
 Both his demeanor and his record have renewed questions about his 
qualifications for the high court. No one, not even Thomas himself, had rushed 
to defend President George Bush's assessment that he was "the best man for the 
job." After all, he had had no significant legal experience as a prosecutor, 
defense attorney, trial lawyer, law professor or judge and had spent only a 
year as Bush's appointee to the influential U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington 
when he was nominated to the Supreme Court. But at the very least, Thomas 
promised, he would be impartial. "My personal views have no place in 
adjudication," he said. "I can assure you, I have no agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who believed him, such as Sen. Arlen Specter, a moderate 
Pennsylvania Republican who cast a key vote for him, now admit they are 
dismayed by Thomas' record. "Frankly, I have been very disappointed with his 
first three years," Specter says. "I had thought his roots would show. But he 
came out of those hearings a changed man, an embittered man." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each day when the court is in session, Thomas and his wife, Virginia, leave 
their new home in suburban Virginia and drive into town before most 
Washingtonians have hit the road. "We travel everywhere together, like a pair 
of nuns," Thomas tells friends. His wife, a senior policy coordinator for the 
House Republican Conference, was said by friends to have been deeply hurt by 
her husband's confirmation ordeal. She said they survived by praying together. 
It "was not a normal political battle. It was spiritual warfare. Good versus 
evil," she told a People magazine interviewer a few days after his 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is a strange sort of celebrity: They are instantly recognized but 
seldom seen outside carefully chosen venues. While none of the justices sits 
for TV interviews on Sunday morning, most make the rounds of bar groups, civic 
organizations and law schools, giving speeches and answering questions about 
the work of the court. As members of the nation's highest court, they can count 
on a warm reception and instant respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so with the youngest justice. "It's like he's in the federal witness 
protection program," says one prominent Washington lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas has told friends he quit watching most television -- for a time, he was 
a regular punch line on some sitcoms -- and stopped reading most newspapers and 
magazines, with the exception of reliably conservative publications such the 
Washington Times. (He also refused requests to be interviewed for this story.) 
"They can say absolutely anything they want about me. I will never read them 
again to see it," he told one friendly interviewer last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the confirmation struggle sealed his loyalty to those who stood with him. 
Each morning as he lifts weights in the Supreme Court's gym before his workday 
begins, he says he likes to listen to tapes of Rush Limbaugh poking fun at 
feminists, environmentalists and all manner of liberal crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The men are more than passing acquaintances. On May 27, when the rotund 
entertainer married for the third time in a ceremony at the home of Virginia 
and Clarence Thomas, the justice performed the official duties. After a 
sit-down dinner, the assembled guests gathered for "cigars and adult beverages 
on the deck," according to Limbaugh's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Among friends, Thomas hardly appears to be a bitter man hidden in his shell. 
"He is not brooding or angry at all," says McAllister, his former clerk. "I 
found him to be warm, supportive and friendly. He has a positive outlook." He 
has a big handshake and a hearty laugh, although his eyes have a wary look. As 
a speaker, he has an endearingly personal style. Far from being the polished 
high official whose comments drift above the audience, Thomas speaks slowly, 
emotionally, as if measuring each word to describe his joys and pain. Almost 
invariably he speaks of his childhood and recounts stories about his 
grandfather. Even if the tales are a bit familiar now, he comes across as warm, 
genuine and personal. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, conservatives pointed to Thomas life story as his main 
qualification for the high office. Here was a man, the vaunted story went, who 
was born to a teen-age mother in a dirt-floor shanty near the marshes of 
Pinpoint, Ga., and grew up poor in the segregated South. When his mother could 
no longer care for him, young Thomas was rescued first by his grandparents and 
then by the Catholic schools, working his way through Holy Cross College and 
then Yale Law School, where he graduated a year behind Bill Clinton. "I was 
drunk with anger," he told students at Holy Cross, describing himself in the 
late 1960s, "out of control with hostility toward what I saw as the oppression 
around me." 
</P>
<P>
 But his up-from-poverty experience brought him to far different conclusions 
than did the middle-class upbringing of Thurgood Marshall, his black liberal 
predecessor on the court. Success depends on hard work and individual effort, 
says Thomas, espousing the lessons that conservatives champion, and government 
welfare checks or official "affirmative action" preferences serve only to hurt 
blacks by dampening their drive and cheapening their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was denouncing his sister back home in Pinpoint for being dependent on 
her monthly welfare check when he came to the attention of leaders of the 
incoming Ronald Reagan Administration at a 1980 conference of young 
conservatives in San Francisco. (The sister, Emma Mae Martin, was receiving 
welfare assistance while raising her children and caring for an aunt but soon 
after worked her way off welfare.) 
</P>
<P>
 Offers of government positions followed, and despite Thomas' having announced 
that he would not work on "black issues," he became assistant secretary for 
civil rights in the Education Department in 1981. A year later, he was named 
chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency 
charged with enforcing the laws against job discrimination, though he often 
seemed skeptical of its mandate. He had no patience with the civil rights 
activists who urged him to enforce the law more vigorously. All they do, he 
said, is "bitch, bitch, bitch, moan and whine and whine." 
</P>
<P>
 In a steady round of provocative speeches, he denounced the conventionally 
liberal positions on race and civil rights, criticized environmentalists, 
called for strengthening property rights and praised as "splendid" an article 
calling for the reversal of the Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 His star rose quickly in the Reagan Administration, and Bush's Court of 
Appeals appointment signaled what came next: He'd be the designated Republican 
successor to the aging Justice Thurgood Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 In five days of Senate testimony -- largely obscured by Anita Hill's later 
accusations -- Thomas publicly backed away from many of his earlier statements. 
"A judge must be fair and impartial," Thomas said in his opening statement to 
the committee. "A judge must not bring to his job, to the court, the baggage of 
preconceived notions, of ideology, and certainly not an agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about his previous comments on affirmative action or the right to 
abortion, about his criticisms of liberal decisions and his long track record 
of deriding the civil rights establishment, Thomas reverted to the same theme. 
He denied he had any such strong views, and regardless, none of it would affect 
his judicial role. A justice has a nearly sacred duty "to strip down like a 
runner, to eliminate agendas, to eliminate ideologies," he said. When 
interpreting the law, "it is the will of the legislature that counts," he added 
reassuringly. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas raised eyebrows when he testified that he had never discussed or 
debated Roe vs. Wade, even during his law school days when the case was 
decided. Asked about the separation of church and state and the so-called 
"Lemon test" often criticized by conservatives, Thomas replied that he had "no 
quarrel" with it. (The term refers to the court's 1971 ruling in Lemon vs. 
Kurtzman that it will strike down any law or government program that has 
religious purpose, advances religion or creates "an entanglement" between 
church and state.) "I think the wall of separation is an appropriate metaphor," 
Thomas commented, sounding more like a Jeffersonian liberal than a Reagan-era 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 He also praised the doctrine of stare decisis , Latin for letting the matter 
stay as decided. Many senators were skeptical, but the nominee sought to 
reassure them. "I understand your concern that people come here and they might 
tell you A and then do B," he told one senator who had pressed him on the 
abortion issue. "But I can assure you . . . I have no agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the Clarence Thomas whose provocatively conservative speeches, 
articles and statements the committee Democrats had reviewed for weeks prior to 
the hearing. And it was not the Clarence Thomas whose true views became clear 
soon after he took his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' first opportunity to weigh in on abortion came in January of 1992, two 
months into his tenure, when the court agreed to hear a case from Pennsylvania 
challenging that state's new abortion regulations. The law didn't prohibit 
abortion but required pregnant teen-agers to obtain parental consent, wait 24 
hours before undergoing the procedure and, if they were married, to inform 
their husbands in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the case of Planned Parenthood vs. Casey did not require the court to 
decide the fate of Roe vs. Wade and the right to abortion, and Pennsylvania's 
lawyers urged the court to uphold the regulations as consistent with Roe, it 
looked like a suitable vehicle for the court's conservatives, who were 
determined to overturn the abortion right. Three years earlier, in Webster vs. 
Reproductive Health Services, four members of the court -- Rehnquist, Scalia, 
Kennedy and Byron White -- had indicated a willingness to reverse Roe vs. Wade. 
Clarence Thomas could provide the fifth vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But that majority didn't coalesce in the Casey case. Kennedy, citing the 
importance of precedent and stare decisis , joined an opinion affirming women's 
basic right to choose abortion, and Roe was upheld. As expected, however, 
Thomas took the other side, signing on to one dissent by Rehnquist that called 
for Roe to be overturned and to a second, more fiery one from Scalia that 
compared the abortion ruling to the Dred Scott decision, the pre-Civil War era 
ruling that sanctioned slavery. Pretty strong stuff for someone who had had no 
views on the matter just a few months earlier. Since neither side in the case 
had argued that Roe vs. Wade should be flatly overturned, Thomas could have 
filed an opinion upholding the Pennsylvania regulations, but deferring a ruling 
on the broader question of Roe vs. Wade. According to the scuttlebutt from the 
court's clerks that year, however, no such half-step was even considered in 
Thomas' chambers. The justice's mind was made up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He clearly lied to them (his confirmation committee) about legal issues, " 
says Karlan, the University of Virginia professor. "I think he perjured himself 
about Roe." 
</P>
<P>
 That same term, the issue of prayer in the public schools returned to the 
docket. For a decade, lawyers for the Reagan and Bush administrations had 
pressed the court to permit more religion in the schools and to stop insisting 
on such a strict separation of church and state. They had made little progress, 
but pressed ahead in a case from Rhode Island that arose when a middle-school 
principal invited a cleric to deliver a prayer at a graduation ceremony. After 
a Jewish parent complained, a federal judge ruled that the graduation prayer 
was unconstitutional and could not be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of Lee vs. Weisman was appealed to the high court when again there 
was a surprising setback for the conservatives. Thomas did join them once 
again, but Kennedy switched to the liberal side, and a 5-4 majority upheld the 
judge's ruling, saying that officially sponsored religious invocations have no 
place in the public schools. An angry Scalia slammed the decision as as 
"jurisprudential disaster" and demanded the scrapping of the Lemon test for 
judging religion cases. Thomas, who had said he had "no quarrel" with the 
standard a few months before, signed Scalia's dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first three years on the court, Justice Thomas has rarely had a chance 
to write a major opinion. Having staked out a position on the far right, he 
rarely affects the outcome in key cases, except to supply the fifth vote for a 
conservative majority. He seems less interested in being an influential 
coalition builder than in forcefully stating his position. So far, his voice 
has been heard more loudly in political circles than within the confines of the 
court. So repeatedly, the chief justice has assigned him to write mundane 
decisions involving federal jurisdiction or bankruptcy disputes. However, 
Thomas has strongly asserted himself in two areas of law: prisoners' rights and 
voting rights. Parting company even from conservatives such as Chief Justice 
Rehnquist, Thomas has called for reversing precedents that have benefited 
inmates and Southern blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas had been on the bench just two weeks when the court heard a case 
involving Keith Hudson, an inmate in a Louisiana prison. Late one night, 
Hudson, locked in his cell, got into an argument with a nearby guard, Jack 
McMillian. Assisted by two other guards, McMillian handcuffed and shackled the 
prisoner and took him into a hallway. As the others held Hudson, McMillian 
punched him in the face and jaw and kicked him in the stomach. A supervisor on 
duty watched but merely told the guards "not to have too much fun." Hudson 
emerged with a badly swollen face, loosened teeth and a cracked dental plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson sued the officers in federal court, alleging he had suffered cruel and 
unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. A magistrate concluded 
that the beating was unrelated to any disciplinary purpose and awarded Hudson 
$800 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 7-2 vote, the court upheld the magistrate's decision in Hudson vs. 
McMillian. Justice O'Connor said prison guards have broad authority to use all 
necessary force to enforce discipline or put down disturbances, but "the 
unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain" violates the Eighth Amendment. 
Thomas, however, argued that the prisoner's injuries were at most "minor" and 
accused his colleagues of creating "a National Code of Prison Regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 His written dissent attracted attention, and not just for its strident 
conclusion. During his confirmation hearings, Thomas had displayed a minimal 
knowledge of constitutional law. He drew a blank, for example, when Sen. 
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) asked him to name some of the most important high-court 
rulings of the past 20 years. But his dissent in the Hudson case delved into 
early English law and quoted a series of precedents from the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the court, that was seen as a sign that Thomas had turned over his 
writing duties to his young clerks. Most justices employ their clerks to do 
research or write preliminary drafts, but their final opinions tend to reflect 
their own personal styles. Not so with Thomas. "I don't see any distinctive 
touches, what you might call 'Thomasisms' in his opinions," says a veteran 
attorney who appears regularly before the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissent in the prisoner's case argued that in the 18th Century, "cruel and 
unusual punishments" referred to the punishment imposed by a judge. Therefore, 
the court should limit the Eighth Amendment only to officially imposed 
punishments and not to "a deprivation suffered in prison." Of course, if 
Thomas' view became the law, prison guards could use electric shocks, cattle 
prods and other means of torture without violating the ban on cruel and unusual 
punishments. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a few observers remembered how Thomas had, during his confirmation 
hearings, told the senators that he could identify with the plight of 
prisoners. From his courthouse window, he said, he saw "busload after busload" 
of young men going into the jailhouse. Leaning forward intently, he'd 
concluded, "I say to myself almost every day, but for the grace of God, there 
go I." 
</P>
<P>
 Scalia, the court's liveliest intellect, its most energetic questioner and its 
best writer, signed Thomas' dissent, but he later confided to a friend that he 
did not fully agree with it. Rather, he wanted to protect his embattled new 
colleague from being "out there all alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Twice since then, the court has revisited the issue of prisoners' rights, and 
in both instances, Thomas has slammed the majority for adhering to the view 
that the Constitution forbids cruel and unusual punishment in prison. "Judges 
or juries, but not jailers, impose punishment," he wrote in a dissent issued in 
June. This time, however, Thomas spoke only for himself. Scalia had joined with 
the majority. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Thomas has stepped boldly into the mine field of voting-rights law, the 
controversial area that was the undoing of C. Lani Guinier in her bid to become 
Clinton's attorney general. Unquestionably, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has 
had an enormous impact in the South. Under penalty of that law, Southern 
officials could no longer use techniques "subtle as well as obvious" to nullify 
the votes of blacks, and finally, a century after the Civil War, black citizens 
have gained a voice in government. The reach of the law, however, is uncertain, 
and Thomas has taken an active role in trying to define it. Some had expected 
him to show a special sensitivity because of his background, but instead he 
urged the court to overturn past rulings favoring blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 One case testing the act's limits came before the court in his first month on 
the bench. In 1986, Lawrence Presley became the first black man in this century 
to be elected a county commissioner in Etowah County, Ala., after a judge 
ordered the county to select its commissioners by district, rather than 
county-wide. Presley won a seat in a new black-majority district, and the post 
was a powerful one, since each commissioner also controlled the budget for road 
maintenance in his section of the county. Soon after Presley was elected, 
however, the new county council voted to put all road decisions in the hands of 
the whole commission. With one stroke, the white majority had regained all 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley sued, contending that this move to strip him of power violated the 
Voting Rights Act. But on a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court rejected the claim in 
Presley vs. Etowah County. "This is a case where a few pages of history are far 
more illuminating than volumes of logic," John Paul Stevens wrote for the three 
dissenters. Congress wanted to end schemes used to deprive blacks of political 
power, so the court should enforce the will of Congress, not thwart it, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But writing for a conservative majority, Justice Kennedy said the 1965 law 
applies only "with respect to voting," not to "routine actions of state and 
local governments." Thomas joined his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Presley told Emerge magazine that her husband had, in the tumultuous 
days of Thomas' confirmation, believed that because of his background, "we 
ought to give the guy a chance." But after the 1992 ruling, Presley, who died 
in January, 1993, realized he had made a mistake. "That really hurt him more 
than the decision. He would walk around saying, 'I can't believe Thomas voted 
against me,' " Alice Presley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Thomas cast the deciding fifth vote to rule that drawing 
congressional boundaries solely to create black-majority districts violated the 
constitutional rights of whites. And this year, Thomas went even further and 
disputed the entire 25-year history of using the Voting Rights Act to help 
elect more blacks in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose in an unusual case from rural Bleckley County, Ga., where all 
power is exercised by a single county commissioner who acts as both executive 
and legislature. Blacks, who make up 20% of the population, said they were 
excluded from power and filed a suit under the Voting Rights Act. The U.S. 
Court of Appeals, relying on Congress' 1982 amendments to the voting rights 
law, agreed with the black voters and ordered the county to switch to a 
five-member commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Those amendments underlined that any "standard, practice or procedure" used in 
the electoral process would violate the law if it denied racial and ethnic 
minorities the right "to elect representatives of their choice." If a large 
black or Latino population is denied representation because of the way district 
boundaries are drawn, those lines are illegal, even if they were not intended 
to discriminate. Minorities are not guaranteed proportional representation, but 
the law tells judges they must examine "the extent to which members of a 
protected class have been elected to office in the state or political 
subdivision." 
</P>
<P>
 On the high court, the justices voted 5 to 4 to overturn the appeals court and 
uphold Bleckley County's single commissioner system. Why? Three members of the 
majority -- Kennedy, Rehnquist and O'Connor -- said the courts can't decide the 
size of a governing body because there is no "benchmark" for deciding what is 
fair. If Bleckley would need five commissioners to give blacks a voice, should 
the next county have 20 commissioners so it could serve a group with 5% of the 
population? they asked. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas, in a 59-page separate opinion, took the view that the Voting 
Rights Act does not cover the make-up of governing boards and the drawing of 
electoral boundaries, no matter what their effect on minorities. He said he 
would reject 25 years of court precedent on the issue and ignore what Congress 
has said on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 His broad arguments, though familiar, have a certain power. The law as 
currently interpreted "encourages federal courts to segregate voters into 
racially designated districts . . . . In doing so, we have collaborated in what 
may aptly be termed the racial Balkanization of the nation," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street Journal columnist Paul Gigot called his opinion, which Scalia 
joined, an "intellectual bombshell" and a "tour de force." This is Thomas at 
his best, arguing that there is a price to pay for elevating race as the 
all-important factor in politics and the law. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas' view of the law has one obvious drawback: Congress does not agree 
with him. As Justice Stevens pointed out in an opinion joined by Souter, 
Ginsburg and Blackmun, it is "crystal clear" that Congress wrote the law to 
apply to voting districts that denied minorities the right "to elect 
representatives of their choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Specter, who had closely questioned Thomas to seek assurance that the 
nominee would abide by long-standing interpretations of federal civil rights 
law, heard Thomas give the desired assurances. "If there is a longstanding 
interpretation and Congress does not act . . . that certainly would be, at 
least from my way of looking at a statute, evidence that cannot be ignored in 
revisiting that particular statute," he told Specter. But that was just the 
kind of longstanding interpretation of the voting-rights law that Thomas 
ignored in June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While no one has proved whether Thomas told the truth when he "categorically 
denied" all of Anita Hill's accusations, there is ample reason to believe that 
he did not honestly describe his legal views in his testimony before the 
Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not a problem in the eyes of those who strongly supported Thomas from 
the beginning. "I think he is proving to be an excellent justice," says Charles 
Cooper, the former Reagan Administration lawyer. C. Boyden Gray, White House 
counsel under George Bush, praises Thomas' opinions on voting rights and the 
prisoners' cases as "gutsy, not politically correct. I think he's doing a great 
job. He's been just what I had hoped for," Gray says. Danforth says he has paid 
little attention to his performance on the court. "I stood by him as a friend," 
he replies. "I'm not a critic." 
</P>
<P>
 But disappointment and anger are strong in other circles. Ralph Neas, the 
executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, concludes that 
Thomas has been exactly what he feared. "We opposed him because we thought he 
would be a right-wing ideologue, and that's what he's been," Neas says. Before, 
Scalia had been generally seen as the court's most conservative justice, and 
Thomas has voted with him in 86% of the cases. It is the closest pairing of 
justices since the liberal tandem of William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Harsh criticism has come from blacks. Last November, Emerge magazine, which 
appeals to black professionals, published a scathing attack on Thomas titled 
"Betrayed" in which several black Republicans who supported Thomas three years 
ago said they now regret having done so. Film director Spike Lee commented that 
"Malcolm X, if he were alive today, would call Thomas a handkerchief head, a 
chicken-and-biscuit-eating Uncle Tom." The magazine's cover featured a photo of 
Thomas with his head wrapped in a handkerchief. 
</P>
<P>
 Reactions to Thomas differ so sharply in part because his friends indeed see a 
different person. Consider these two stories: 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Danforth calls Thomas "warm, pleasant, funny, inspiring, just a 
delightful person to be with." To illustrate, he cites his summer interns, who 
expressed an interest in seeing the Supreme Court. "I called Clarence, and he 
had them come over the next day. He took time with every one of them. The 
personal warmth just comes through. That's the real Clarence Thomas," the 
senator says. 
</P>
<P>
 William L. Robinson, dean of the District of Columbia School of Law, also 
wanted to bring some young students by the Supreme Court. A black civil rights 
lawyer who knew Thomas from his EEOC days, Robinson considered the justice a 
friend, even if they disagreed on the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would really mean a lot to these kids if they could see someone like him 
(Thomas) who made it. I just hoped he would duck his head in the room and maybe 
say 'hello' while we were there," Robinson says. He called Thomas's chambers 
repeatedly, explained why he was calling and left messages. "He wouldn't even 
call me back. And I guess I'm pissed about it now," Robinson says. That's the 
real Clarence Thomas, too. 
</P>
<P>
 A more confident Thomas was on display this spring as the justice showed a new 
willingness to get outside the court. He gave talks at his high school and 
college alma maters, discussed crime before the Federalist Society, spoke to 
judges in New York and Baltimore, dropped by uninvited to chat with the disc 
jockeys at a local "oldies" radio station and even donned a football jersey and 
visited the practice field of his favorite team, the Dallas Cowboys. Why the 
Cowboys? Because the local Redskins are hugely popular in Washington and their 
arch-rival, the Cowboys, are generally hated, he explains. He also says he 
likes the Los Angeles Raiders "because everybody hates them." 
</P>
<P>
 His Federalist Society speech on crime was powerful and provocative, sounding 
like the Thomas of old. He blamed the "rights revolution," promoted by 
1960s-era liberals, for much of the crime and mayhem that besets America's 
cities today. It's a view gaining increasing currency in Republican circles. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing seems certain. Justice Thomas and the controversy that follows him 
figure to be with us for many years to come. This fall, two new books on his 
confirmation fight are due to be published. Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson of the 
Wall Street Journal take a critical look in "Strange Justice: The Selling of 
Clarence Thomas." The authors are not promising a "smoking gun" about sexual 
harassment, but they do say that the Bush White House deliberately painted a 
misleading picture of Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Danforth gives an insider's account of the 10-day fight to save his 
friend's nomination in a book entitled, "Resurrection: The Confirmation of 
Clarence Thomas." Danforth, according to an account in Washingtonian magazine, 
describes how Thomas' nomination was saved by a quick prayer session in the 
moments before Thomas presented his final defense. Thomas, his wife, Virginia, 
and Danforth, along with Danforth's wife, Sally, met in the restroom of 
Danforth's office, the story goes, praying and listening to a recording of 
"Onward Christian Soldiers." "We reached out to each other and held hands as we 
listened: 'Onward Christian soldiers, marching as to war.' I looked at 
Clarence. His eyes were closed, his head bowed; his foot beat time to the 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 "An effective criminal justice system -- one that holds people accountable for 
harmful conduct -- simply cannot be sustained under conditions where there are 
boundless excuses for violent behavior and no moral authority for the state to 
punish," Thomas said. He ticked off the modern-day explanations for crime -- 
"poverty, substandard education, faltering families, unemployment, systemic 
racism" -- but none of them can excuse an individual's wrongdoing, he said. 
While he offered no precise recommendations for what can be done, his message 
about crime and personal responsibility seems sure to win broad approval. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the 46-year-old Thomas, he tells almost every audience that he is 
"getting comfortable" being a justice and is settling in for a long stay. "It's 
a joy to work at the court," he told a meeting of federal judges in New York. 
"And in good health, I hope to be there for another four decades or more."

THE TAIWAN CONNECTION; A NETWORK SOME AUTHORITIES CALL THE SINGLE MOST 
IMPORTANT CRIMINAL THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES SMUGGLES 100,000 ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS FROM CHINA EACH YEAR, COLLECTING BILLIONS TO BANKROLL A DIVERSE 
CRIMINAL EMPIRE. AS FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS STRUGGLE TO FIGHT IT, ALL ROADS LEAD 
TO TAIWAN.

<P>
By Marlowe Hood, Marlowe Hood is a Paris-based journalist. His last piece for 
the magazine covered the plight of illegal Chinese immigrants once they reach 
the United States. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jorge Guzman, a special agent for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
has a price on his head. It is his reward for snapping at the heels of one of 
the biggest, and most profitable, human smuggling operations in the world, a 
network that in turn fuels criminal enterprises from drug trafficking to credit 
card fraud, from prostitution to extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 A broad man with a broad grin, Guzman wears his moods on his sleeve. Shielding 
himself behind the mask and monotone so typical of his law- enforcement 
colleagues is clearly an unnatural act. Nor does he suffer fools easily, on 
either side of the law -- the grin can disappear in a flash. But Guzman would 
hardly rate an assassin's contract if he didn't have an effective sting. As the 
L.A.-based coordinator of investigations into Asian organized crime, he 
engineered the only successful undercover operation to date against Chinese 
migrant smugglers. Operation Dry Dock arrested 132 illegal Chinese immigrants 
and yielded a wealth of information on the smuggling masterminds. 
</P>
<P>
 The man suspected of ordering the hit on Guzman is Taiwanese. Based in 
Guatemala, his criminal shadow looms largest over Southern California. Federal 
officials have asked that I not reveal his name, so let's call him Mr. Li. 
</P>
<P>
 Poker-faced and a bit jowly from too much banqueting, Li looks like what he 
is, a successful Chinese businessman in middle age. But rather than athletic 
shoes or dried mushrooms, multiple sources say, Li imports China White, an 
exceptionally pure form of heroin. Rather than the Rotary or Kiwanis Club, they 
say, he is affiliated with triads in Asia and street gangs in Los Angeles. And 
rather than mini-malls, he invests in L.A.-area nightclubs staffed by 
prostitutes from Shanghai and Fuzhou. 
</P>
<P>
 But these interests are all peripheral to his main, multimillion-dollar line 
of business: smuggling economic migrants from China into the United States, 
some by sea and even more by air. Li has had a stake in nearly half of the 
20-odd human-cargo boats apprehended in the Pacific since August, 1991, 
according to a confidential State Department memo outlining his career. And 
those are just the ships of which law enforcement is aware. "Li doesn't have 
any real competitors on the West Coast," says a senior INS official. 
</P>
<P>
 As big as he is, however, Li is only one link in a transnational chain of 
ethnic Chinese enterprises that are flooding the United States with illegal 
immigrants and high-potency heroin. They generate tens of billions of dollars 
each year, much of it used to bribe officials around the world, and have 
become, in the words of the Washington official, "the single most important 
criminal threat to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 One cannot but marvel at a network that was able to sneak 100,000 people a 
year through dozens of countries around the globe with hardly anyone paying 
attention -- until a migrant-laden tramp steamer, the Golden Venture, ran 
aground near New York City in June, 1993. Since then, the smuggling of Chinese 
immigrants has fallen out of the headlines, but it continues unabated, not only 
in the United States but all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Li's empire, and the larger empire of which it is a part, gives a 
glimpse of the reaches of this network, which Guzman and other front-line 
agents, outmanned and out-financed, are fighting in their two-front battle 
against Asian organized crime. On one front are Li and his far-flung, highly 
mobile army, connected in myriad ways to criminal -- and possibly official -- 
organizations in Taiwan. On the other is a government that has been slow to 
recognize the scope and reach of highly diversified Chinese criminal groups and 
whose unfocused policies have made it frustratingly hard for investigators like 
Guzman to penetrate the human smuggling rings that turbocharge these groups 
with cash and manpower. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Li's business empire began to burgeon in the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping opened 
China to trade. In the boom that followed, Taiwanese were among the first and 
most aggressive investors, despite the political tension between Beijing and 
Taipei. They naturally gravitated to their ancestral province of Fujian -- 
virtually a stone's throw from Taiwan -- where they speak the same dialects and 
often have relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 There, criminal entrepreneurs found what would become a gold mine. Farmers in 
Fujian, on the southeastern coast of China, were being squeezed off their land. 
The country's breakneck transition to industry was replacing farms with 
factories, displacing millions of agricultural workers. The farm jobs that did 
remain were being filled by desperately poor peasants from China's interior, 
willing to work for next to nothing. The pressure of unemployment and personal 
debt, combined with abuse from venal officials, made daily life increasingly 
difficult for growing numbers of Fujianese. 
</P>
<P>
 From afar, the United States shimmered with wealth and opportunity. And in 
Fujian, which has a long history of rebellion, secret societies and sea-based 
smuggling, a tradition of emigration began to reassert itself. Conflicts 
arising from the emergence of the Ching dynasty in the 17th Century had led to 
a massive migration, mainly to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and later to Latin 
America. Now, with help from enterprising investors like Li, another massive 
exodus would begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Li and his main competitor, another Taiwanese man now based in Brazil, are the 
biggest of the many entrepreneurs in the smuggling business. Both men quickly 
transformed their mom- and-pop smuggling ventures into full-service, global 
operations. Fleeing a murder rap in Brazil in the mid-1980s, Li moved to El 
Salvador and then Guatemala, where he worked his way through the ranks of his 
new trade. He didn't come alone. "Smuggling (had been) controlled by a base of 
Cantonese families," notes the State Department memo. But then the "Taiwanese 
moved in and established a base of about 150 families." By 1991, they had taken 
over, and Li was the new boss. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, by no coincidence, the clientele had changed too, both in 
number and kind. More than 90% of the estimated half-million migrants who have 
been smuggled from mainland China into the United States since 1984 are from 
Fuzhou -- the capital of Fujian province -- and three adjacent counties, an 
area not much bigger than greater Los Angeles. Seldom has so large a migration 
been so geographically concentrated at the source, and never has one been so 
overwhelmingly illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is not the only promised land. A Taiwanese man in league 
with Fuzhou "snakeheads" -- booking agents for migrant smugglers -- was 
recently convicted of alien smuggling in Japan, where Chinese crime syndicates 
have forged ties with their Japanese counterparts, the Yakuza. More than 20 
ships unload their cargo there annually, according to an INS agent based in 
Asia. Australian authorities have apprehended four ships in the past eight 
months. Last fall, the interior minister of Austria announced that police had 
"uncovered a Europe-wide network of Mafia-like (Chinese) organized crime" 
responsible for smuggling thousands of migrants into Vienna. Similar reports 
have come out of Italy, Germany and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 And these are only the target countries. China's Public Security Bureau 
estimates that there are half-a-million Chinese nationals in smuggling 
way-stations around the world -- 50,000 in Moscow, 15,000 in Ho Chi Minh City, 
25,000 in Bangkok, 25,000 in Africa, 10,000 in Brazil, 5,000 in other countries 
including the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Romania and Bulgaria -- waiting to 
complete their journeys. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the '80s, says Jim Hayes, Guzman's boss and head of anti- smuggling 
operations for the INS in Los Angeles, "alien smuggling had always been a 
localized, small-scale affair -- people would find their own way to the other 
side of the Mexican border and hire a smuggler from there. But as demand 
increased, organizations began to spring up around the world. Today it has 
gotten to the point where a smuggler can accommodate someone who walks in off 
the street in Fuzhou or Kiev or Karachi." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The engine of the people-smuggling network, the heart that makes the blood 
flow, is Taiwan. The 40 ships identified by U.S. authorities that have tried -- 
successfully, in most cases -- to deposit their cargo in the United States 
since 1991 are "overwhelmingly connected in some form or fashion to the island 
of Taiwan," notes Assistant U.S. Atty. James Walsh, who heads the Organized 
Crime Strike Force for Los Angeles. Most are owned, and many were captained and 
crewed, by Taiwan nationals. The few vessels that were not Taiwan registered 
disguised their origins with flags of convenience from Belize, Panama or 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Taiwan connection goes much deeper than that. "The boats are set up 
there, the money is laundered there," says a senior INS official in Washington 
who requested anonymity. "The behind-the-scenes people who control some of the 
gangs that pick up at airports, control safe houses and collect money are also 
Taiwanese" -- people like Li and his rival in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
 And people are apparently not the only commodity moving through the network. 
Walsh, who says that Asian crime is by far the "premier consumer" of the strike 
force's resources in Southern California, has also identified "several Asian 
heroin smuggling and distribution organizations active in the L.A. area" that 
may be connected to larger smuggling networks. Here, too, links to Taiwan are 
emerging. Mainland Chinese police have arrested several dozen Taiwanese over 
the last couple of years for manufacturing, processing and trafficking both 
heroin and crystal methamphetamine, called ice. "Both Taiwan and China play a 
major role in drug trafficking to the U.S.," says a senior Drug Enforcement 
Administration official in Washington. "Taiwan is a major transit area -- there 
is no doubt. It has replaced Hong Kong." 
</P>
<P>
 The changeover has been startlingly rapid. Throughout the late 1980s, Taiwan 
police seized about three kilos of heroin a year. Then the numbers began to 
explode, from 98 kilos in 1991 to 1,100 in 1993. By the end of June this year, 
seizures totaled 1,000 kilos, the most of any country in Asia except China and 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan denies that it has become the preferred stepping-off point from 
mainland Asia for heroin and ice smugglers. "Taiwan is not a major 
transshipment point," says the country's minister of justice, Ying-jeou Ma. "We 
have our own drug problem." 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt true, but U.S. experts still see a discrepancy. "The massive amounts 
of heroin seized is far in excess of the amount needed to supply the Republic 
of China's domestic needs," noted a 1993 FBI report on the United Bamboo Gang, 
a huge Taiwan-based criminal organization with a major presence in the United 
States, especially Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 So far there is no smoking gun linking the operations that traffic in drugs 
and people. Smugglers are too smart to move contraband carrying vastly 
different penalties -- a couple of years for migrants, up to life in prison for 
drugs -- in the same shipments. Yet the suspicions remain. "There is evidence," 
says San Francisco-based U.S. Atty. Michael Yamaguchi, who helped set up an 
Asian organized crime strike force for the West Coast and Hawaii last year, 
"that heroin and aliens are being smuggled by the same people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Taiwan connection to smuggling is so consistent as to raise troubling 
questions about official corruption. A 150-foot fishing vessel, the San Tai No. 
1, for example, was purchased in 1991 by the Taiwan government as scrap metal 
only to turn up a year later off the coast of California with a boatload of 
migrants. Of the more than 10,000 Taiwanese passports -- used to smuggle 
migrants via commercial air carriers -- that find their way into smugglers' 
hands every year, hundreds, and perhaps more, are issued by Taiwan consulates 
around the world, especially in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, who has worked on several Taiwan-related cases, sees "no reason to 
believe alien smuggling is connected to the government." To be sure, Taiwan has 
given the United States permission to board Taiwan-registered smuggling ships, 
provides information on Taiwan nationals apprehended on board and usually pays 
to repatriate mainland Chinese migrants. Once, on request, it even ordered 
every Taiwan flagship on the high seas to radio in their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials have doubts about Taiwan. "I'm not sure the government has 
as much control as it thinks it does," says Timothy Wirth, Clinton's 
undersecretary of state for global affairs. And John F. Shaw, INS assistant 
commissioner for investigations, questions Taiwan's "will to cooperate" on this 
issue. Another frustrated federal investigator says that while Taiwan police do 
forward information about some suspects, they somehow never acknowledge queries 
about others. "We've requested arrests records for Li and his top people many 
times," said one frustrated federal investigator, "and we always draw a blank." 
</P>
<P>
 The historical ties between the ruling Kuomintang party and organized crime 
are a matter of record. From Shanghai's Green Gang in the 1940s to the 
still-thriving United Bamboo Gang, party leaders have frequently used powerful 
crime syndicates to do their dirty work, even political assassination on U.S. 
soil. When Henry Liu, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Taiwan, published an 
unflattering biography of Taiwan's then-President Chiang Ching-kuo, Taiwanese 
intelligence officers recruited and trained United Bamboo Gang leaders to 
murder him at his home in Daly City in 1984. Only enormous international 
pressure brought the culprits in Taiwan to justice, and even then they were 
paroled after a few years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Well before that, in 1977, Taiwan had already earned a place on the State 
Department's "criteria list," a select category reserved for "foreign 
governments whose intelligence activities are hostile to, or of particular 
concern to, the national security of the United States so that 
counterintelligence activity is required." The FBI, which set up a special 
Taiwan Counter-Intelligence Unit known as Squad 13, is equally wary. "Since the 
government (on Taiwan) has lost diplomatic status," concludes a December, 1993, 
FBI report, "it may depend on the United Bamboo Gang to carry out assignments 
that normally would be assigned to its intelligence agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Ma's terse response when I asked whether any linkages remained between the 
government and organized crime: "That was a long time ago."

 Willard H. Myers III is a bona fide maverick. As a radical trial attorney in 
the early 1970s, he defended domestic terrorists pro bono; today, the 
51-year-old immigration lawyer from Philadelphia is one of law enforcement's 
best friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with shards of data gleaned over the course of a decade from his 
clients -- thousands of illegal immigrants from the Fuzhou region of southern 
China -- this methodical, soft-spoken ex-professor pieced together a detailed 
map of smuggling routes and the organizations that maintain them. He identified 
key players, including Li, and was so alarmed by the scope of criminality he 
uncovered that he wrote up his findings in 1991 and sent them to top INS 
officials in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own practice notwithstanding, when I realized the extent to which 
international organized crime was involved, I felt compelled to act," says 
Myers, whose wild gray hair and beard seem at odds with his button-down 
lawyer's garb. "I was amazed. From entirely different sources we were coming up 
with the same names and the same connections." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, Guzman and INS investigators in other cities were amazed, too. Here was 
an attorney in private practice who, on his own, had penetrated not one, but 
two highly elaborate smuggling rings. "It was obvious," concedes one agent, 
"that he knew more about this stuff to begin with than we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers is today widely recognized as the leading authority on Chinese alien 
smuggling, perhaps on Chinese organized crime in general. Besides having been 
called to give testimony before the House and Senate, he is regularly consulted 
by three federal agencies and as many foreign governments. His annually updated 
report -- last year's edition weighed in at 500 pages -- was the cornerstone of 
a recent headline-grabbing CIA study about immigrant smuggling. Comments he 
made during interviews on CNN led to the indictment and dismissal of Said 
Mouse, minister of immigration in Belize. Myers, who runs a single-engine think 
tank called the Center for the Study of Asian Organized Crime, in other words, 
has done more to sound the alarm about the growing power and influence of Asian 
organized crime than anyone in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without doubt, nationals of Taiwan represent the most powerful group in 
transnational ethnic Chinese organized crime," Myers told the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee in April. A few month earlier, he told a House committee 
much the same, pointing an accusatory finger at unnamed "high-ranking members 
of (Taiwan's) National Police Agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers suspects that rogue members of Taiwan's military or intelligence 
community beyond the reach of civilian law enforcement are profiting directly 
from the trade in human cargo from Fujian. (Justice Minister Ma, for his part, 
bristles at the suggestion of high-level corruption and points to the lack of 
hard evidence. "We would be happy to have such information," he adds, "because 
we are in the process of cracking down on corruption.") 
</P>
<P>
 After his congressional testimony, recalls Myers, he was contacted by Taiwan's 
diplomatic office in Washington, the Coordination Council for North America, 
and invited to lunch. "They wanted to know where I had gotten my information 
and how much I knew." Hardly surprising. But then came a call from a man who 
identified himself as an investigator, based in New York, with Taiwan's 
Ministry of Justice. He, too, wanted information. When Myers checked with his 
U.S. law enforcement contacts, however, he was told that the caller was 
actually a member of Taiwan's intelligence bureau. Because the incident 
involved a nation on the criteria list, a State Department official advised him 
to contact the FBI. Since it was about that time that a couple of relevant 
files were stolen from his locked car, Myers did just that. A federal official 
later told him that the Taiwan agent, who used the name David Ho, had been 
expelled from the country. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Whether or not senior Taiwan officials are involved, corruption is undoubtedly 
what greases the ever-shifting pathways of migrant smuggling, from police 
stations in seaside villages near Fuzhou, to INS offices in New York or San 
Francisco -- and everywhere in between. When gross earnings are in the 
billions, then millions in bribes becomes an acceptable cost of business. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical $30,000 air-smuggling package, for example, begins with the routine 
purchase of a genuine People's Republic of China passport: $500 plus another 
$250 for the exit permit, payable in cash or kind to one's local police. The 
luxury class of smuggling routes -- direct from China to the United States -- 
is available to those who can find and afford an "official government business" 
passport, issued by the foreign ministry rather than the public security 
ministry, and seldom challenged by the INS. Add $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent incident suggests just how deeply the smuggling business has 
corrupted officials in Fujian. Sometime last year, Hong Kong police were tipped 
off about a protection-racket shakedown. They set up a sting, but wound up 
arresting the wrong men. Two of them, by coincidence, were holding drugs -- ice 
-- so the police conducted a thorough search. They soon discovered that the six 
men, all from Fuzhou, were snakeheads. And among their possessions, police 
found a little black book with the names and home phone numbers of dozens of 
senior government and Communist Party leaders in Fujian. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating," says the U.S. federal agent who told me about the 
incident. "We know exactly where the bad guys are -- down to the hotel room 
numbers in Fuzhou -- but we can't do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, it seems, can the central government in Beijing. Mainland China -- the 
head of the payoff trail -- has just concluded a yearlong anti-corruption 
campaign, the most virulent in the post-Mao era, resulting in tens of thousands 
of arrests and hundreds of executions. Every sector has been infected: foreign 
trade, the military, railways, housing, education, even the family planning 
bureaucracy and the media. But the campaign, even by official accounts, has had 
scant impact, for corruption in China has already become a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 When a utilities official in Fujian was arrested for accepting bribes and 
kickbacks, to cite a typical case, another 110 cadres in state-run banks, 
construction companies and other government offices were also implicated. And 
the police, military and judiciary have themselves been deeply affected. 
Prisoners routinely buy their way out of jail, naval units engage in piracy on 
the high seas and senior police officials operate big-city prostitution rings, 
run extortion rackets and relicense thousands of luxury automobiles stolen from 
Hong Kong and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, in addition, ample evidence of a growing link with organized crime 
groups, "nearly all of which have government officials behind them," conceded a 
government-run newspaper. A confidential report by the Royal Hong Kong Police's 
Anti-Triad unit documents extensive contacts between Hong Kong's most powerful 
triad leaders and senior Communist officials in Beijing, some of whom have 
publicly characterized triad members as "patriotic" and invited them to set up 
businesses in China. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chinese-American businessman who was in Fuzhou at the same time as Li tells 
another revealing story, one that established a connection between Taiwan and 
mainland China. Shortly after I had interviewed police officials in Taiwan for 
this article, a senior Communist official in Fuzhou approached the businessman 
and handed him a piece of paper with my name written in English. "Do you know 
this person?" the official asked. The official, it turned out, had gotten a 
warning call from someone in Taiwan about my investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-corruption campaign has been no more effective in stemming the flow 
of migrants from Fujian. "It's pretty much business as usual," says the 
Chinese-American businessman. "I personally know 15 people who left while I was 
still there and were already in New York when I came back a month later." And 
wherever safe-houses and transit points appear along the smuggling trail, 
corruption is not far behind. Last fall, Mousa, the minister for immigration in 
Belize, was sacked for accepting huge bribes from Chinese smugglers. Then, in 
July, the regional chief of the Mexican immigration service in Tijuana and two 
of his deputies were dismissed and charged with corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Such revelations did not surprise INS investigators, who have long known that 
Li and other Chinese smugglers had secured the services of officials in Mexico, 
Central America and more recently the Caribbean. But the July arrest of one of 
their colleagues in San Francisco did. INS Deputy Assistant Director William 
Tait is suspected of having sold green cards -- primarily to Chinese customers, 
according to one source -- for more than a decade, according to the indictment 
and other court documents. "There is more corruption within the INS than the 
government cares to admit," comments Myers. When Myers discovered several INS 
clerks in the New York City office accepting bribes from ethnic Chinese, he 
collected evidence -- including tape-recorded conversations -- in cooperation 
with the Office of the Inspector General, which monitors corruption in 
government agencies. "It's been more than a year now, and the same clerks are 
still selling employment authorization cards. When I inquired recently, the OIG 
said the investigation had been moved to another unit." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that "the potential problem of Asian organized crime is 
much, much larger" on the West Coast than Russian and Jamaican crime 
syndicates, or even the Mafia, Yamaguchi, the U.S. attorney in San Francisco, 
insists that law enforcement is not too far behind the curve. "It has not yet 
affected our political and financial institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 But that may be wishful thinking. Employees at banks, telephone, utility and 
insurance companies in New York produced thousands of fraudulently pre- dated 
receipts and statements to support false residency claims for Chinese nationals 
trying to prove they had entered the United States before April, 1990 -- the 
cutoff for eligibility for permanent residence under an executive order signed 
by George Bush. The IRS has also uncovered banking fraud and money-laundering 
schemes related to immigrant smuggling, according to one investigator, though 
indictments have yet to be handed down. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad figures in Hong Kong and Taiwan have also cultivated friends in high 
places, including the U.S. Congress. When a known officer of the notorious Sun 
Yee On triad attempted to circumvent laws forbidding his entry into the United 
States, he enlisted the help of a congressman, since voted out of office, to 
secure a visa with a "waiver of criminal activity." The congressman lobbied 
with INS officials on his behalf, though to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. law enforcement has set its sights too low," comments Myers, who 
recently spoke before the 16th Annual International Asian Organized Crime 
Conference, a gathering of prosecutors, cops and investigators from around the 
world. "Chinese criminal syndicates do not begin and end with street gangs and 
tongs. That's just the hired muscle." 
</P>
<P>
 But even catching up with the lower echelons has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jorge Guzman, the INS investigator, had just returned to Los Angeles after a 
stint in Washington when his unit received a tip that a Chinese couple wanted 
to charter a vessel to ferry passengers from another boat to shore. Posing as 
the captain of a large pleasure boat called the Corinthian, he arranged to be 
introduced, meeting the couple on the boat in the San Pedro harbor. "I drove a 
hard bargain," he says, breaking into a grin. "When they offered $30,000, I 
said, 'It's got to be $50,000, and you're going to pay me half up front.' The 
man said, 'I don't have the authority to make that type of decision.' So he 
pulled out a cellular phone and made calls to the East Coast, Hong Kong and 
Taiwan." Finally the deal was struck: $42,500, half up front. 
</P>
<P>
 After the money was delivered, the next phase of the undercover operation 
unfolded like clockwork. Working with a crew of federal agents, Guzman steered 
the Corinthian 300 miles offshore and picked up 132 Chinese nationals. Once 
ashore, says Guzman, "we transported them in government undercover vehicles to 
a parking lot where they were, in turn, picked up by other Chinese and taken to 
a drop house in Garden Grove. They stayed there for three days. We allowed one 
group to go back to New York, where they were supposed to be followed, but 
there was a miscommunication -- the press was there waiting -- so we had to 
arrest them." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the glitch, Operation Dry Dock, carried out in summer, 1991, was a 
stunning success. Besides the arrests, the sting yielded a mother lode of 
valuable intelligence about the smuggling networks. Though the case was 
dismissed by the lower courts on a technicality, the government won on appeal 
and went back to trial earlier this month. "Dry Dock was one of the finest 
undercover operations it has been my pleasure to work with," says Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Walsh, who is handling the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the first and last time Guzman and his team have been allowed to 
run a sting. Seven times since then the L.A. anti-smuggling unit has submitted 
requests to do similar operations, and seven times they have been turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejections became especially frustrating after President Clinton outlined 
his strategy for combatting migrant smuggling while announcing the appointment 
of a new INS commissioner in June, 1993. Less than two weeks earlier, the 
Golden Venture had run aground in New York, causing both concern and 
embarrassment. "We can't afford to lose control of our own borders," Clinton 
proclaimed, pounding the lectern. 'Deterring this transport in human cargo and 
traffic in human misery is a priority for our Administration."  
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan was threefold. First, introduce legislation that would 
increase the penalties for alien smuggling from a couple of years to at least 
10, allow prosecutors to use the same racketeering statutes that worked so well 
against the Mafia and make it easier to repatriate smuggled migrants. The 
second policy prong: interdict boats on the high seas. Returning would-be 
immigrants before they landed would, it was hoped, deter others. 
</P>
<P>
 The third part of the plan was music to Guzman's ears. "We will strengthen law 
enforcement efforts in the United States by expanding our investigative 
efforts," Clinton said. "We will go after smugglers and their operations at the 
source." That was precisely what Dry Dock was about. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year later, however, the Clinton plan is in a shambles. His 
omnibus crime bill finally made it through Congress, but all the anti- 
smuggling legislation he had called for was dropped, including the provision 
that Administration officials wanted most: summary exclusion, the power to 
return illegal immigrants quickly. "We're right back where we started," says 
Jack Shaw, the assistant INS commissioner for investigations. "The smugglers 
are carrying out their activities with impunity."  
</P>
<P>
 Why, in the words of assistant district director Hayes, is the INS "less able 
today to appropriately respond to pressing criminal alien-smuggling incidents 
than ever before"? One reason, he says, is the orphaned state of anti- 
smuggling programs, which seem to have disappeared from INS organizational 
charts. A lengthy memo outlining a major INS overhaul, in effect as of July 1, 
fails to even mention that category. "The INS is the bastard child of the 
Justice Department," quipped one field agent, "and alien-smuggling is the 
bastard child of INS." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever is accomplished here," says Hayes, "is done through force of will. 
The bottom line is that Chinese aliens are still coming and there's no 
apparatus in place nationwide to handle that level of activity. The Chinese are 
much, much more organized and sophisticated than any other organization we have 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Interdiction has proven to be a cumbersome, nightmarish procedure. Each time a 
boat is seized at sea, it paralyzes the resources of local INS and Coast Guard 
units -- sometimes for weeks at a time -- and requires complicated 
international negotiations with China and the vessel's flag country (usually 
Taiwan). And because the United States does not want to give smuggled migrants 
access to the asylum procedure by allowing them onto U.S. soil, it strong-arms 
neighboring countries into serving as a transit depot for processing and 
repatriation. Mexico took on those functions last year, but has since refused 
to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, interdiction has not worked as a deterrent. Fewer ships have been 
sighted this year, but that only means that smugglers have adapted and gone 
back to using air routes, or combinations of commercial flights and small ships 
leaving from the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, from Guzman's perspective, the interdiction policy prevents him 
from doing his job and prosecuting smugglers to put them out of business. When 
asked whether that makes his job more difficult, he lets out a bone-rattling 
sigh. Long pause. "We do the best we can." Walsh is less circumspect. "With 
this policy in place, there is little room -- none, in my judgment -- for the 
calculated, proactive, intelligence-based work that might lead to uncovering 
and prosecuting snakeheads." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing illustrates this quandary better than the Jin Yinn 1, a 168-foot 
Taiwanese converted fishing trawler first spotted by the Coast Guard 350 miles 
from Los Angeles on April 9. The L.A. INS anti-smuggling unit once again 
proposed an undercover operation, and once again it was rejected. Instead, it 
was told to intercept the ship and conduct interviews on board. It took a month 
of pursuit on the high seas, international negotiations and costly travel, but 
that is exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 As the process unfolded, Guzman felt sure that there was enough evidence to 
bring the captain, possibly the crew, back to the United States for 
prosecution. Walsh agreed. They had statements from about 20 passengers who had 
been subjected to or witnessed beatings with electric stun guns and lead pipes. 
Moreover, they said, the captain had threatened to kill anyone who cooperated 
with U.S. authorities. He even boasted to a U.S. interpreter that he had 
powerful connections to the United Bamboo Gang that would shield him from 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the migrants were repatriated to China from Guatemala, and Taiwan 
exercised its right under international law to prosecute its own citizens. 
"There was no pressure," Shaw complains. "When it's a case of diplomatic versus 
law enforcement priorities, the State Department develops an endemic condition 
called weak knees."  
</P>
<P>
 For now then, Li is out of reach while Guzman tries to stave off an ulcer, not 
because he has a price on his head, but because politics, foreign policy and 
bureaucratic ineptitude have tied his hands.

IN SEARCH OF MR. KATO; A QUEST FOR THE CREATOR OF A MYSTERIOUS JAPANESE GARDEN 
CONJURES UP A FACELESS GHOST, MODERN PREJUDICES AND A WILLFUL HEIRESS

 Thus shall ye think of all this fleeting world ; A star at dawn, a bubble in a 
stream , A flash of lightning in a summer cloud ; A flickering lamp, a phantom, 
and a dream . -- FROM THE DELUSIONS OF APPEARANCES, THE DIAMOND SUTRA 
</P>
<P>
 It was hidden beneath a layer of muck on the bottom of the small retaining 
pond by the back fence, scratched faintly into the concrete and visible only 
because I had drained off the putrid water and shoveled out the rotting 
sycamore leaves. "KATO" was written in childish block letters beneath a barely 
legible date, "1916," and above the initials "THG" and "EGO." They had said it 
would be there, the former property owners. This was where a man known only by 
his surname, Kato, had etched his signature after meditating on the landscape 
for three months and then building the ponds, the bridges, the stream bed and 
the waterfalls for what was said to be the oldest privately owned Japanese 
garden in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I had acquired the property on an impulse, instantly seduced by 
the overgrown and unkempt garden behind the modest bungalow. From the living 
room you look past a screen of spindly bamboo and the trunks of redwood and 
cypress trees, to a pond banked by myrtle and azalea shrubs, and beyond that to 
the old azumaya , an open-air tea shelter, shaded by a huge live oak. 
</P>
<P>
 From the tea shelter, you can see the four stone-encrusted ponds spanned by 
little concrete bridges, one of them designed in a zigzag pattern to evade 
demons in hot pursuit. To the north, a snow lantern stands on an island in the 
main pond, next to a large rock jutting out of the water in a shape suggesting 
a tortoise, auspicious for its longevity. This pond and its waterfall are 
guarded by sculptured pine trees and flanked by a hillock studded with irises 
and sago palms. A curtain of yew trees backs this tiny universe, and above 
their tops the San Gabriels serve as borrowed scenery, framing the upper limits 
of the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the landscape was moody, contemplative, confusing -- and 
familiar. My wife, Susan, and I had lived many years in Japan, and had 
undergone a subliminal indoctrination to the Japanese ethos, a mind-softening 
process cynical gaijin call "tofu-nization." Maybe we were quivering cakes of 
bean curd, vulnerable to the sorcery of this garden. And so we ended up owning 
an incredible yard with a small house attached. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japan thing, though, does not explain it all. I was recovering from a 
brain tumor that was about a year or so in remission. I felt robust, confident 
that my health had been restored, but I was also aware of how fragile, and 
brief, life can be. I suppose I was looking for hidden meaning, and this garden 
struck me as a cosmic window -- if only I could learn how to see through it. 
</P>
<P>
 I had more mundane motives as well, because our first encounter with Kato's 
garden came two months after the Los Angeles riots. Before we went 
house-hunting I had agonized over persevering in the city or retreating to the 
suburbs. During the riots a flying ember had set fire to the roof of our 
apartment building. We were on a delayed honeymoon in Italy, taking the 
obligatory gondola ride in Venice at about the moment quick-thinking neighbors 
dowsed the flames with garden hoses, leaving no more damage than a soggy 
bedroom. Discomfort with the neighborhood was nothing new, however. Earlier 
that year I had awoken at 3 a.m. to a blood-curdling scream, squinted out my 
bedroom window to see a man holding a pistol to my neighbor's head and, for the 
first time, dialed that metaphor for American urban life, 911. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening we went to check out a report of a private Japanese garden in 
Sierra Madre, I was brooding about the bid we had placed that morning on a 
large Craftsman house in Hollywood, a half-block from a strip on Sunset 
Boulevard notorious for its prostitutes. I was receptive to buying some quiet 
and peace -- or at least forestalling L.A.'s creeping nightmare. This seemed 
liked a place where I could enjoy a little instant rapture and perhaps meditate 
on some of the ambivalent feelings I had about my 10 years studying and working 
as a befuddled foreigner in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony, of course, was that once we settled in, we found it difficult to 
sit down and relax without seeing another onerous chore begging to be done: 
pruning, raking, weeding, digging, replanting. Dead trees had to be removed, 
the ponds needed to be drained and cleaned. My primordial dread of yardwork, 
acquired long ago in suburban Chicago, reawakened. We sought bids from two 
prominent Japanese landscape architects; each said he could restore the garden 
for about $1,000 a day. We had no choice but to go it alone with the help of a 
mortal, two-hour-a-week gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I felt a compulsion to find out what Kato's intentions were. Did he 
leave behind any plans showing how his 7700-square-foot legacy was supposed to 
look? I wanted to know what Kato was saying to me through this botanical relic, 
through generations of decayed and replanted vegetation. His spirit was present 
in the haggard pines; it was reflected in the murky ponds, where goldfish 
flitted about and coquettish pink blossoms yawned atop lily pads. 
</P>
<P>
 The integrity of this voice -- if it was his -- had survived more than 
three-quarters of a century. Kato, whoever he was, haunted the place. Is it 
pure coincidence that our daughter's dependable nanny insists she has twice 
seen a male ghost in the garden? Dressed in black, he appeared suddenly during 
daylight and then vanished. I asked the nanny what kind of features the ghost 
had, assuming it must be an Asian apparition. The man had no face, she said, 
but he seemed to "belong" to the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlocking the secrets of Kato's garden became an obsession, but I also wanted 
to know more about what I was doing here in this lush little oasis on the 
outskirts of a city in distress, taking refuge in an illusion of time and 
space. What meaning was I projecting onto Kato and his microcosm as I sat by 
the tea shelter and drank my coffee in the morning haze, observing the garden 
dumbly through a drowsy trance? 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Madre, with its goofy July 4th parade and its volunteer fire 
department, has a placid tree-lined ambience that reeks of Midwestern, 
white-bread values. Populated by 10,800 souls -- or 9,360, depending on the 
welcome sign -- it seems like a town you could not invent if you tried. But the 
truth is, it was invented with calculated artifice, as was nearly all of 
Southern California. In 1881, an ambitious real estate huckster from 
Massachusetts named Nathaniel C. Carter bought 1100 acres on the incline rising 
to a mountain range called, at the time, the Sierra Madre. He laid out a plan 
for a utopian community, much in vogue at the time, this one for gentlemen 
citrus ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
 To sell the dream, Carter went back east and returned with trainloads of 
tourists and prospective buyers. The Sierra Madre tract, significant because it 
was the site of the trail head for the burro-ride ascent to the Mt. Wilson 
summit, acquired a reputation as a retreat from the urban afflictions even then 
plaguing Los Angeles and Pasadena. By the turn of the century, riding on a 
speculative land boom, Sierra Madre was well established as a prosperous town 
with its own water system, post office, amateur drama society, sanitarium and 
cigar factory. 
</P>
<P>
 The date of Kato's arrival in Sierra Madre, much less California, remains 
unknown. But the debut of his patron, a wealthy Southern heiress named 
Thomasella Hardeman Graham -- the "THG" in the pond-bottom glyph -- is well 
established. The strong-willed daughter of a plantation owner and cotton miller 
who built the town of Pinewood, Tenn., Graham started traveling with a chaperon 
in her teens, making grand tours of Europe, Asia and the American West, and did 
not stop until she landed in Sierra Madre in 1908, at the age of 38. Graham 
knew of Sierra Madre because of Frank Sauerwein, a consumptive painter of 
Native American and Western scenes, whom she discovered in the late 1890s at a 
hotel art gallery outside the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 She admired the young artist so much she took him along on one of her European 
trips and gave him a gift of $4,000 -- a staggering sum in those days -- to 
study in Italy. Sauerwein, in turn, invited Graham to stay at his cottage in 
Sierra Madre, which he rarely used. When Sauerwein died of tuberculosis in 
Connecticut in 1910, he bequeathed the shack to Graham. The patch of ground 
around it, shaded by a large pepper tree, became the nucleus for Thomasella 
Graham's Italian-Japanese-Californian fantasy. Graham, who had once dreamed of 
buying a villa in Italy, decided instead to construct her own Italianate manor 
that, in those unimaginably smog-free days, afforded a Tuscan view of vineyards 
and orchards sweeping all the way to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 To build her palazzo , she hired architect Robert D. Farquhar (he would later 
design the California Club building Downtown and UCLA's Clark Memorial 
Library). As villas go, the Graham house is on the small side, with three 
second-floor bedrooms, a downstairs maid's room, English oak paneling in the 
dining room and terrazzo floors in the butler's pantry and kitchen. Last 
inhabited in 1991, the building still stands, but is now behind a chain-link 
fence warning trespassers that the structure has been condemned because of 
earthquake damage. Graham expressed her grandiose visions of culture by naming 
her 5.5-acre property "Italia Mia," incorrectly entered in county land records 
as "Mia Italia," the story goes, because a craftsman inverted the words on the 
wrought-iron fence that still encircles the old estate. 
</P>
<P>
 I have found it tempting to imagine that Graham, mourning Sauerwein's death, 
built the Japanese garden as a Bohemian memorial. And others have speculated 
about Graham's feelings for Sauerwein. "Thomasella never married," wrote local 
historical society stalwart Phyllis Chapman in an August, 1982, article in the 
Sierra Madre News. "Was it because her feelings for Sauerwein were of the 
heart, too, and no one else filled that void after his death?" Placed below the 
Italian villa, a majestic alley of Irish yew trees, a conventional flower 
garden and a marble fountain imported from Florence, a Japanese garden is at 
odds with everything else on the Graham estate. Whatever its inspiration, 
Kato's garden cries out for explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Graham was far from alone in her Oriental fascination. By the early part of 
the century, a Japanese garden had become a sign of sophistication for the 
social elite, following the rage for Japanese art that swept Europe in the late 
1800s. In Southern California, rail baron Henry E. Huntington created what he 
called an "Oriental garden" around a large pond on his San Marino estate, after 
acquiring the necessary plants, gates, lanterns and other accouterments from a 
financially distressed tea garden in Pasadena in 1912. As it turns out, the 
garden -- which sprawls uncharacteristically -- is not really a Japanese garden 
at all, but a studied improvisation by Huntington's gardener, William Hertrich. 
Also in this faddish cross-Pacific cultural firmament, G. W. Wattles built a 
Japanese garden on his Hollywood estate that is now open to the public as 
Wattles Gardens Park, and the antique-dealing Bernheimer brothers reassembled a 
17th-Century Japanese temple villa in the Hollywood Hills as the tourist 
attraction "Yamashiro," which is now a restaurant. Since the name Kato 
(pronounced KAH-toe and common in Japan) is not connected to Huntington's 
garden, I was hoping he had a hand in the tea garden that Huntington had 
stripped. But Kato's services were not needed there, either. That garden, built 
around 1903, was the work of a curio dealer named George Turner Marsh, who had 
designed the Japanese garden at the 1884 California Midwinter Exposition in San 
Francisco. It survives as Golden Gate Park's famous tea garden, a continuing 
tourist attraction, where the fantasy of Japanese landscaping made one of its 
earliest marks on American pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The other seminal event in the introduction of Japanese landscaping in 
California was the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition at San 
Francisco's Presidio Park, where an ambitious three-acre "Imperial Japanese 
Garden" was laid out by H. Izawa and a crew of temple architects and 
professional gardeners from Japan. This seemed a perfect place to find Kato, 
but here, too, he goes unmentioned in the guidebooks and pamphlets. If the 
Pan-Pacific Expo did not bring Kato to America, it seems plausible that it 
served as inspiration for Graham. Although there's no record of her actually 
visiting San Francisco at the time, her cosmopolitan interests would have 
likely drawn her there. 
</P>
<P>
 The history gained importance as my wife and I struggled to restore the garden 
and wondered if we were making the right decisions. We argued about whether the 
sago palms, characteristic of some Edo-style gardens, belonged on the hill, or 
in the garden at all. It became essential to get a better idea of what it might 
have looked like 70 years ago. After six months of searching, I found a Sierra 
Madre resident who had seen it in its prime. 
</P>
<P>
 She was Yoneko Hashimoto, the 75-year-old daughter of Yukataro Aisawa, who 
built the garden's rustic azumaya tea shelter and served as Italia Mia's 
groundskeeper for many years. The Aisawa family lived on the estate from about 
1922 to 1930, while Hashimoto attended elementary school. "Miss Graham," she 
says, was an authority on horticultural matters and taught her father his 
gardening skills, including the Japanese techniques of which he had no prior 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Aisawa continued to work as a gardener in Sierra Madre until he was detained 
on suspicion of espionage, shortly after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. 
Federal authorities arrested the gardener because of his activity in Sierra 
Madre's Japanese Assn., which operated a Saturday language school and community 
center serving the 20 or so families of Japanese ancestry. Like other Japanese 
community leaders throughout the Western United States, Aisawa was eventually 
cleared of suspicion and reunited with his family behind barbed wire in an 
internment camp. 
</P>
<P>
 As a little girl in the 1920s, Hashimoto romped on the lawns of the Graham 
estate and played with her younger sister in the garden, "which looked a lot 
different then." It was more lush, she says, filled in with the bamboo-like 
nandina. A huge tree on the northeast corner of the garden (she cannot remember 
what kind) muted the harsh sunlight that was scorching the zoysia grass on a 
recent Sunday afternoon. The only evidence of that tree is the remnant of a 
steel cable that was used to anchor the trunk as it deteriorated, one small 
puzzle solved in the archeology of Kato's garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Hashimoto never met Kato. Considering the tightknit nature of the town's 
Japanese community, this suggests he probably was not around when she was old 
enough to remember. She does recall hearing Graham talk about him, however, 
conversations that left an impression that Graham brought Kato over directly 
from Japan, which was encouraging news. If Kato had been brought over 
temporarily, it would explain why his name had eluded public mention. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Hashimoto's reminiscences also raised questions about Kato's very 
existence. As a child she played almost exclusively in the garden's shallow 
retaining pond, because her father forbade her from approaching the larger main 
ponds and bridges. But she has no memory of the "KATO" inscription on the 
bottom of the pond. She first learned of it in the 1960s, after Graham had 
died, the estate had been subdivided, and our bungalow had been built. Could it 
have been scratched into the cement after the war, fabricated to bolster the 
garden's legitimacy? What if Graham, a horticulturist in her own right, 
invented him for prestige purposes after designing the garden herself, using as 
her guide the various texts and publications on Japanese landscaping available 
at the time? 
</P>
<P>
 A gardener named Kato does not appear in the old directories kept by Southern 
California's early Japanese community. He does not surface in the city 
directories for Pasadena and Sierra Madre. Local historical society documents 
describe Kato as having been on the "staff of the Imperial Gardens" in Toyko, a 
claim impossible to trace. The archivist at the Japanese American National 
Museum couldn't offer any clues about the gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, one morning I thought I had a breakthrough in my quest for Kato as I was 
perusing the ledger of acquisitions kept by the historical archive at the 
Arboretum of Los Angeles County. Item A-69-326-535 jumped off the page: "One 
set blueprints Italia Mia garden plans." Gertrude Bailey, a longtime employee 
of Graham, had donated them to the collection in 1969, along with Graham's 
wicker baskets, sock darner, mouse trap and a Japanese tooth powder box. But 
the red line drawn across the entry for the garden blueprints, curator Sandy 
Snider explained, meant they were "missing from the inventory." I was free to 
look anyway, she said. My frantic search through acid-free preservation boxes 
and dusty old trunks turned up nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 I was already harboring suspicions that Kato was apocryphal when I had a long 
conversation with Kendall Brown, a lecturer in fine arts at USC, who is 
compiling research for a book on the history of Japanese-style gardens in 
California. Brown pointed to the book "Landscape Gardening in Japan" by Josiah 
Conder, first published in 1893 and popular among horticulturists in Graham's 
day. All the characteristics of an Edo-period tsukiyama - sansui (hill and 
water) garden, the variety built on the estate, can be found among the book's 
detailed sketches. Brown thinks non-Japanese landscapers like George Marsh and 
Huntington's gardener, William Hertrich, relied heavily on the book as a 
reference. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Graham and Hertrich were said to be friends who swapped information on 
plants and collaborated in experimenting with cuttings such as Cycas revoluta 
(sago palms), of which four mature specimens survive in the garden. If Hertrich 
and Graham were in close contact, she could have gleaned from him lessons in 
the craft of Japanese garden design, using miscellaneous props and unskilled 
labor. "Maybe Kato was simply a hired hand," suggested Brown as he looked out 
on the garden from the tea shelter. "Maybe Tommy Graham wanted a Japanese 
garden because Henry Huntington had one. It was the fashion. This was an era 
when women dressed up in kimonos. I wouldn't be surprised if she had a copy of 
Josiah Conder's book and told some hired hand, 'This is what I want.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We may never know whether Thomasella Graham was the sole auteur of the garden, 
but she dominates its story. A refugee from the social strictures of the Deep 
South, Graham came to California, as so many did, to establish her 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sierra Madre, Graham is remembered as a tough woman who fought tenaciously 
to preserve the community's trees when she served on the city Planning 
Commission. Perhaps it is her masculine spirit that haunts Kato's garden. She 
never married; her close companions were always women. In the early years it 
was her chaperon from Tennessee, Ida Munsell, whom Yoneko Hashimoto recalls as 
a school marm who befriended her with great tenderness during the years she 
lived at Italia Mia. Later in life, after selling the Italia Mia estate and 
moving into one of the smaller houses down the street she owned as rental 
property, Graham was inseparable from Florence Pride. 
</P>
<P>
 They had an evening ritual of sitting out on their porch and having two 
whiskey sours each, administered punctually by a trusted male friend who kept 
the booze out of their reach until the appointed hour, according to their 
neighbors Pat and Pauline O'Neill, now in their 80s, who occasionally joined 
them for drinks. The pair also made a habit of playing with their Ouija board. 
One of the O'Neills' most cherished possessions is an antique photograph 
depicting Graham at age 16 with Munsell, sitting in a gondola in a Venetian 
canal. The photograph was passed on to her by Gertrude Bailey, Graham's 
longtime employee and final companion, who died last year at the age of 94. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesbianism was not a subject discussed openly in that era, so Graham's private 
life remains uncertain. But it is clear that she had little interest in men. 
Harry Graham Schneider, her grand nephew who heads her only line of surviving 
relatives, inherited her collection of Sauerwein paintings and letters, but 
doubts the artist was ever her lover. "To put it bluntly, she didn't need men. 
She was independent as hell," says Schneider, a bank chairman in Lake 
Providence, La. "My aunt was one of those flag-raising feminists." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider visited Sierra Madre on several extended trips, the last of which 
was in 1947, when Graham was about to sell Italia Mia for the surprisingly 
modest sum of $30,000. She apparently had made some bad investments during the 
war; Schneider suspects she was cheated by her lawyer as well. "She couldn't 
afford to take care of it. She would have died a pauper," he says. "She hated 
to give it up, not just the house, but the yard. That Japanese garden was her 
pride and joy. She used to work all the time in the garden. She had a full-time 
gardener, but she was always out there in her hat and gloves, kneeling and 
working in the dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomasella Graham, the rebellious Southern daughter, died in 1957 at 87 years 
of age. According to her wishes, her remains were sent back to Pinewood, Tenn., 
for burial next to her parents' graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Graham's legacy was looming very large and hope of establishing Kato's 
existence was deteriorating, I got a call from a friend at a local real estate 
office, who stunned me with a tale of Kato's being at yet another historical 
Sierra Madre estate. On the property was a mansion and the remnants of a 
Japanese garden built in 1917, the year after Kato would have finished his work 
at Italia Mia. The original owner was a J. Gamble Carson, who disappeared in 
the early 1920s, shortly after being accused of murdering his wife. Nolie 
Howard, the current owner, said her parents bought the property in 1947. The 
seller had told them that "a Mr. Kato" from Japan had meditated on the terrain 
for one month before laying out an exquisite three-tiered Japanese 
hill-and-water garden, with streams, waterfalls, bridges and ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 All that survives is a pathetic shell of the middle tier. There is an empty 
pond (no signature on the bottom), a concrete lantern and bridge, flanked by a 
chaotic overgrown hillside. A metal railing, installed to help Howard's elderly 
mother negotiate what is left of a zigzagging stroll path, scars the hill. 
After the estate was subdivided, "a tenant with a big dog" let the garden go to 
waste, according to Howard. Only a few original trees, including a conspicuous 
sago palm, remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the asymmetrical balance of the rocks, the lumpy stonework in the 
bridge and the concrete toro lanterns reveal a stunning resemblance to the 
Italia Mia garden. If this was not Kato's doing, it seemed highly probable that 
the two gardens were made by the same person or crafted from the same designs. 
If Kato had stayed on in Sierra Madre to build this garden after finishing the 
one for Graham, the Sierra Madre News, a gossipy community weekly still in 
operation, would have probably noted his presence in town. But Howard found no 
reference to Kato when she scanned the microfilm of old editions. I had no luck 
either. What I did find was a note saying that all editions between October, 
1915, and September, 1916, a critical period for the Kato garden at Italia Mia, 
were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Remnants of early Japanese landscaping are not unusual in Southern California. 
"I think there are more (old Japanese gardens) out there than we realize," says 
Bruce Coats, an authority on Japanese gardens who teaches art history at 
Scripps College. "The old estates have been subdivided and people have parts of 
these gardens in their back yards and don't really know anything about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Madre has at least one other relic of a Japanese garden, this one 
hidden behind the elementary school, Sierra Madre School. The issei fathers of 
the two dozen Japanese-American children who attended the school in the 1920s 
built a small garden there as a gesture of good will to celebrate the 
completion of a new building in 1930. It had a tiny fish pond, a miniature 
bridge, a bonsai pine tree and a stone lantern. But amid the anti-Japanese 
passions of the war, schoolchildren vandalized the garden. All that remains are 
a few stones buried in the dirt, an overgrown pine, a skinny sago and the 
bridge, signed by cement man Roy Kaya, March 1931. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Obazawa, now 74, was one of the Japanese children attending the school. 
She has vivid memories of visiting Italia Mia's Japanese garden, when the 
school staged "tea party" field trips during a unit on Japan in social studies. 
The children played there in a rikusha they built, she recalls, and practiced 
bowing upon entering the tea shelter. "Miss Graham liked parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham's idea of having the Aisawa family live on her estate during the 1920s 
has parallels with other Japanese gardens of distinction. Huntington had 
gardener Chiyozo Goto and his family live in the small Japanese house he 
obtained from Marsh's Pasadena tea garden, from where he also hired Goto. 
Makoto Hagiwara, an entrepreneur who had the teahouse concession at Golden Gate 
Park, lived there with his family. The presence of Japanese gave these gardens 
a diorama effect, which no doubt amused visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Antonio, Tex., Kimi Jingu and his family lived in the stone teahouse on 
the grounds of a Japanese garden the city built on the site of an old quarry in 
1917. A park commissioner wanted a more "authentic atmosphere." But after Pearl 
Harbor, the city turned off the water and evicted Jingu's widow, Alice, and her 
five children, who had no other means of subsistence. They were replaced with a 
Chinese couple, and the city renamed the park the "Chinese Tea Garden." The 
family eventually found their way to Los Angeles, where Alice Jingu became a 
successful actress -- her credits include the film "Teahouse of the August 
Moon." 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment value placed on Japanese culture is reflected in some of the 
old photographs of the Italia Mia Japanese garden. They depict kimono-clad 
Japanese men and women in what appears to be a scene from a movie. A 1931 
Sierra Madre News article mentions the use of the garden by an unnamed 
Hollywood film company as a set for a "Japanese story," but these photos are 
puzzling, undated and without captions. They were in a photo album we acquired 
with the property, given originally to a former owner by the local historical 
society along with an unsigned and garbled essay on the history of Japan and 
the supposed symbolism of the Kato garden. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall Brown, the USC scholar, says all gardens -- especially Japanese 
gardens -- are "rhetorical statements." Gardens cannot be separated from their 
political and social context, he insists, and that is why the Japanese 
government helped build them at expositions in the United States, when it was 
testing its fledgling diplomatic skills after 2 1/2 centuries of feudal 
isolation. That is why the Jingus were evicted in San Antonio and the little 
garden at Sierra Madre School was trashed by children whose Japanese playmates 
had been sent away to internment camps. And that is why Graham hired Kato, or 
invented him, to enshrine her liberated life in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to say a Japanese garden is merely a political metaphor that can be 
interpreted, a physical asset copied out of a book, owned, bought and sold or 
appraised by a bank, misses the whole point. The humbling lesson to be learned 
in the search for Kato is that my wife and I are mere custodians of this 
garden, never mind what the deed says. A nagging riddle, found in the Kato 
etchings at the bottom of the small retaining pond, goes directly to the 
question of ownership. Someone wrote "1916, KATO, THG," all of which is easy 
enough to decipher, but what about the letters on the lower right: "EGO"? 
</P>
<P>
 This has been interpreted to mean "Edo," as in the old name for Tokyo, seat of 
the Tokugawa shogunate, and a reference to the Edo style of garden design. But 
I have looked at those markings over and over again, and they definitely say 
"EGO," matching the initials of no one I have found remotely connected to the 
garden. Was it a co-worker? Was Kato's English so poor that he misspelled Edo? 
</P>
<P>
 Or was he familiar with Freudian theory and, fresh from the experience of 
toiling for the indomitably proud Thomasella Graham, scratched in the word 
"EGO" by her initials as a cryptic Zen message to future generations? After 
all, Kato's training would have been in Japan, where the discipline of 
landscape architecture is inseparable from the tradition of Buddhism. Perhaps 
this is the key to understanding the ultimate meaning of Kato's garden, that 
the notion of self is an illusion in this transitory world, where gardens decay 
and are rejuvenated, cities rise and burn, property owners come and go, and 
venerable gardeners appear, and then vanish.

 In the future, feature films may travel directly to viewers' televisions via 
the information superhighway, but studios have already started to use 
telecommunications technology to send their marketing campaigns straight into 
the homes and onto the computer screens of potential moviegoers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, almost every major studio has done marketing for at least 
one of its films on such commercial on-line services as America Online and 
Compuserve. The studio's interactive kits, which subscribers choose by browsing 
through a listing of what's available, and then selecting and downloading onto 
their hard drive, present basic information in tailor-made ways.  
</P>
<P>
 For last summer's action film "Blown Away," for example, users cut colored 
wires connected to bombs to read biographical information on the stars, look at 
production notes, or view very short scenes from the film in a small onscreen 
window. The kit for "Forrest Gump" lets users point to a timeline to see 
various scenes from the movie, and Forrest himself even gives a multiple-choice 
quiz on recent American history, offering users a piece of chocolate when they 
answer questions correctly, and making such comments as "Stupid is as stupid 
does" when they do not. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line marketing can give potential moviegoers more information about a film 
than a conventional print or television advertisement, and though the reach of 
such services is limited, studio marketing executives see on-line marketing as 
a key part of Hollywood's inevitable future.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have three groups," says Paramount marketing chief Arthur Cohen 
of film marketing decision-makers who are trying to evaluate on-line media. 
"Enthusiastic people, people who go along out of fear (of being left behind), 
and people who say we didn't need it before and we don't need it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen places himself in the first group, though he goes on to say that on-line 
marketing's current effectiveness is difficult to measure statistically because 
of the relatively small size of the audience it reaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount and other studios including Columbia and Fine Line do much of their 
on-line marketing through Hollywood Online, a Santa Monica-based company that 
has emerged as a leader in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Using mostly existing media materials such as film images and production 
notes, the company creates "interactive multimedia kits," which take about 20 
minutes to download with a fairly high-speed modem. They can now be downloaded 
from Compuserve, America Online and eWorld, and Hollywood Online is now in 
discussions with other services about making them available elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The kits) definitely help sustain word of mouth on a film," says Steven 
Katinsky, president of Hollywood Online. "It's a very small investment for (the 
studios) and they're getting a very large return." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Online wouldn't say how much that investment is, although company 
officials and studio marketers agree it is still a very small part of a major 
film's marketing budget. The distribution package generally includes the 
creation and on-line distribution of the interactive media kit and the on-line 
distribution of downloadable video clips and still pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 That distribution can vary considerably according to the public's interest in 
a film, and though the interactive kit for "The Mask" has been downloaded by 
more than 3,100 users on America Online alone, the kit for "It Could Happen to 
You" generated just 300 downloads. A star's popularity can influence the number 
of times a film still is downloaded, and though a picture of Harrison Ford from 
"Clear and Present Danger" was downloaded an impressive 1,600 times on America 
Online, a picture of the comely "Mask" actress -- and relative newcomer -- 
Cameron Diaz was downloaded by more than 4,500 people. A still from "The Scout" 
has already been downloaded 50 times. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also other offerings for movie buffs. America Online, for example, 
also offers an on-line "auditorium" for hosting film stars and directors who 
answer members' questions (Oliver Stone recently fielded softball questions 
about "Natural Born Killers" on America Online, under the auspices of Wired 
magazine), and bulletin boards dedicated to such subjects as new films, foreign 
films and Hollywood gossip.  
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the bulletin boards are more of a forum for discussion and 
networking than part of a marketing plan, although they spread word-of-mouth 
about movies to an audience very interested in films. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes Hollywood Online makes me want to see something more than I would 
have if there are glowing reports," said Lincoln Kupchak, 24, while on America 
Online. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Baumrucker, who looks at the information in Hollywood Online every 
couple of weeks, said that she saw "Natural Born Killers" because of an on-line 
recommendation. "Someone whose opinions I trust said it made 'Reservoir Dogs' 
look like 'Mary Poppins,' " she said via America Online. "I guess it was easier 
than flipping through papers or news directories." 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that we toe the line," says Stuart Halperin, the company's executive 
vice president of marketing. "To the people on-line, we're an information 
provider. The studios view us as a conduit of entertaining information that can 
be viewed in a marketing sense." Hollywood Online started on America Online in 
July, 1993, marketing "In the Line of Fire"; it became available on Compuserve 
later that year.  
</P>
<P>
 One of Hollywood Online's strong points, said marketing executives, is the way 
it allows a self-selecting audience to find out more about a film, and in 
April, the company's interactive kit for last year's "Addams Family Values" won 
an Advertising Age media award for informational on-line advertising and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM, which has marketed films using Hollywood Online for almost a year, now 
gives an on-line marketing push to any film targeting the demographics of 
on-line services. Such upcoming science-fiction-oriented MGM/UA releases as 
"TankGirl," "Hackers" and "Species" will be marketed heavily on-line, and the 
campaign for this month's "Stargate" will include an interactive kit from 
Hollywood Online.

 Moviegoing cybernauts have several places to go for on-line film information, 
though Hollywood Online is the most marketing-oriented of their options. 
Compuserve's Entertainment Drive Forum, an information provider positioned as 
the "Entertainment Tonight" of cyberspace, maintains entertainment-oriented 
bulletin boards and provides downloadable video clips and still images from 
films. The forum, which has registered more than 53,000 members since launching 
in March, according to executive producer and president Michael Bolanos, makes 
a portion of the money people spend using its services, although it also gets 
money from studios to defray the cost of digitizing film clips. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy, which has about 2 million members, offers on-line celebrity press 
conferences and an entertainment area that includes movie reviews, a movie 
guide and a poll of members' reactions to films.  
</P>
<P>
 Delphi has fewer users, but its recent purchase by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. 
makes it a strong contender. Delphi already runs bustling discussion groups 
devoted to "The X Files" and "Melrose Place," and Matt Jacobson, Delphi's vice 
president of entertainment services, sees Delphi's film discussions as a kind 
of "virtual water cooler" that can help spread the word of mouth about upcoming 
films. As more information about movies become available on-line, the question 
still remains: Does any of this cyber-marketing help put actual people in 
actual theater seats? 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to reach as many people with a video clip as you're going to 
reach with a 30-second TV spot in a major market," says Elliot Stein, owner and 
operator of the ShowBiz Forum. "(But) there's a lot of discussions on the forum 
-- after you read all this, what are you going to do? You're going to see the 
film."  
</P>
<P>
 Others are more cautious, saying the medium is not yet effective for most 
films because of its size. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a CPM (cost per thousand) basis, it doesn't make sense," says Chris Pula, 
president of theatrical marketing for New Line, who chose to market "The Mask" 
through Hollywood Online and Entertainment Drive because he thought the film's 
youthful appeal would dovetail with on-line users' interests. "It will get 
better, and frankly, it will get cheaper . . . I think what it is, is an 
investment in the future. It's not in our interests to ignore a new venue. . . 
. The fact that everyone is putting their toes in the water means the potential 
for an explosion is there."

FILM CLIPS / MORIAH FILMS: FOR WIESENTHAL CENTER, A LIBERATING EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Anne Bergman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles, decided late last year that it was time for the institution to venture 
into filmmaking, to make its own documentaries on what has always been its 
foremost interest: Keeping alive the memory of the Holocaust. Thus, Moriah 
Films, the center's official film division, was born. 
</P>
<P>
 With its name inspired by Mt. Moriah where, Judaic teachings say, Jerusalem 
was founded, the division saw its first documentary, "Liberation," screened 
last month at the Deauville Film Festival in France, where it was the only 
documentary shown in a special edition of the festival devoted to commemorating 
the 50th anniversary of D-day. The film chronicles life on the Allied 
homefronts as Adolf Hitler's military machine acted to decimate Europe's Jewish 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't see this as another Holocaust film -- this is much more," Hier 
says. "But on the other hand, to ignore the Holocaust by telling only the 
military aspect would be a grave disservice. So we balanced the two."  
</P>
<P>
 "Liberation" will have its Los Angeles premiere on Oct. 18, and then will be 
released throughout the world early next year to coincide with the 50th 
anniversary of VE Day in May, 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 The film begins with British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's radio 
broadcast announcing on Sept. 3, 1939, that "this country is at war with 
Germany." What follows is a collection of images -- still photographs and 
archival and newsreel footage -- supplemented by original radio news broadcasts 
and first-person accounts culled from letters and journals written during 
wartime.  
</P>
<P>
 "Liberation" often tells its story by documenting ironies that are difficult 
to accept. One segment focuses on the response of Europe's Catholics to the 
war. Pope Pius XII, for instance, is shown praying for the swift victory of 
Hitler and his invading armies, despite the eyewitness accounts detailing how 
many German Catholics were themselves interred in concentration camps, or even 
executed, for offering help to Jews.  
</P>
<P>
 And even Jews themselves differed in their response to the war and to Hitler. 
In a chilling sequence, newsreel footage shows a group of rabbis, all recent 
European immigrants, marching through Washington hoping to implore President 
Roosevelt to meet with them and draw his attention to the massacre of European 
Jews. But at the last-minute urging of American Jews, fearful of an 
embarrassing confrontation, Roosevelt refuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Hier co-wrote the screenplay with Martin Gilbert, a fellow at Oxford 
University. Hier and "Liberation" producer-director Arnold Schwartzman, an 
Oscar-winning team in 1981 for their documentary "Genocide," also collaborated 
in 1990 on "Echoes That Remain," a film documenting pre-World War II European 
Jewish life. 
</P>
<P>
 With such a strong body of work behind them, financing the $650,000 film came 
relatively easily, mostly from "friends of the Wiesenthal Center who liked the 
idea of its being involved in producing documentaries," says Hier, 55. 
</P>
<P>
 "Liberation" has the look of an expensive film, thanks to the liberal use of 
footage from film archives around the world. Actors who participated in the 
project as narrators, including Whoopi Goldberg, Ben Kingsley and Patrick 
Stewart, donated their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the songs Schwartzman, 58, chose for the film were his own favorites 
from that time, which he often contrasts with a tinge of irony to groups of 
images for a glaring effect. Footage of Hitler standing in front of the Eiffel 
Tower during the French Occupation, for instance, is set to "The Last Time I 
Saw Paris."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Hier says with a laugh that there are "no plans to challenge the 
big-time studios in town," in testimony to the center's commitment to Moriah 
Films, they'll get their own offices, where they hope to regularly produce 
documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 As for future films, Hier sees resistance activity during World War II as a 
possible subject. "Each country had their own resistance movement, he says, 
"yet we don't know who they were. If someone asked me to name 15 major 
resisters, I couldn't even name them!"

THEATER; TWO FACES OF THE ADAMS SISTERS; LYNNE AND BROOKE WERE BORN INTO THE 
ENTERTAINMENT WORLD, AND THEY COMBINE THEIR DRAMATIC TALENTS FOR 'TWO FACED,' 
THE STORY OF AN ABANDONED HOUSEWIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a glance "Two Faced," a one-woman play written and performed by Lynne 
Adams, seems like a feminist work. Directed by Adams' sister, actress Brooke 
Adams, the play -- which opens Friday at Theatre 1761 -- is a study of a 
middle-aged housewife who's had the rug pulled out from under her. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband's left her for a younger woman, she's losing her house, she's 
estranged from her children and -- slightly overweight and angry -- she's 
forced to re-enter the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 As the play develops, however, it moves beyond women's issues and becomes an 
inquiry into the masks we all don in order to protect the more fragile parts of 
ourselves from a world that can be less than kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally written as a screenplay, "Two Faced" premiered as a play in 1992 at 
the Common Stage Theater in Woodstock, N.Y., and made its Los Angeles debut 
last January with a five-day run at Theatre 1761. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened right after the earthquake," recalls Lynne Adams during a 
conversation at the L.A. home that Brooke shares with her husband, actor Tony 
Shalhoub, and their two children. "It was hard to get audiences then, though, 
so we're trying again." 
</P>
<P>
 Talking with the Adams sisters, one is struck by the love and respect they 
clearly feel for each other; they never interrupt each other, they laugh at 
each others' jokes, and speak candidly of the effort it has taken them to 
arrive at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooke, the younger of the two at 44 (Lynne is 46), first came to prominence 
in 1978 starring in Terrence Malick's remarkable fable of turn-of-the-century 
America, "Days of Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 While Brooke was becoming a movie star, Lynne was a featured player on 
"Guiding Light" and "The Secret Storm" from 1972-82. One imagines there must 
have been an element of competition between them, but they seem to have 
resolved that. "Brooke was always the favorite who got everything she wanted," 
Lynne declares, getting no argument from Brooke. This is clearly a fact of life 
that no longer appears to concern them, and Brooke seems content to work from 
the wings on "Two Faced." 
</P>
<P>
 "The narrative line in this play isn't based on my life," says Lynne of "Two 
Faced." 
</P>
<P>
 "The part that is about me is the idea of living with two different faces. 
When I began thinking about this play, I was spending half my time in blue 
jeans in the country on a farm, and the other half in a more glamorous 
incarnation of myself in New York. There was a big dichotomy in the way I was 
treated, depending on how I was dressed, and then when I decided to stop dying 
my hair and let it go white, the difference in the way I was treated was 
appalling. I was simultaneously terrified and enraged by the fact that I was 
essentially being forbidden to age. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say who's responsible for this culture's obsession with youth 
and beauty, but it's used in many ways to keep women down," she adds. "The 
beauty industry is responsible to an extent, but nobody forces women to buy 
into it -- they do that by choice. And the movie industry plays a big role in 
perpetuating a standard of beauty that doesn't allow women to age -- what the 
industry does to middle-aged actresses is awful. There are no roles for them!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm treated like an old discarded shoe," Brooke interjects with a rueful 
laugh. Pegged as one of Hollywood's next big things in the late '70s, she's 
seen her film career lose considerable steam since then, and admits that the 
mercurial nature of the movie business had a lot to do with her decision to 
shift her attentions to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of this as a feminist play," Lynne continues, "but the audiences 
we've gotten haven't been predominantly women. Men respond to the play, too, 
and tell me they experience a similar passage in life. Looking in the mirror 
and seeing an older person there is shocking for everybody, and I think the 
anxiety it induces is, ultimately, about death rather than the loss of one's 
youth. That older face is also a reminder that life is slipping by. When you're 
young your life is ahead of you, and I think we've all had the experience of 
reaching a certain age and not being where we wanted to be by that point. 
That's upsetting." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooke's decision to try her hand at directing wasn't entirely a result of the 
fact that Hollywood doesn't make it easy for actresses to age gracefully. "I'd 
thought about directing prior to this -- in fact, I almost directed the sequel 
to 'The Unborn' for Roger Corman," she points out. "But when Lynne was looking 
for a director for the play in L.A., it didn't immediately occur to me that I 
should do it. It didn't take us long to figure that out though, because we had 
a great time working together in 1987 -- we played sisters in a play Lynne 
wrote called 'Over Mother's Dead Body' that was about our relationship. It was 
also about our parents, both of whom died in the early '80s." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our parents were extreme alcoholics and the play was also about alcoholic 
parents," adds Lynne. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York, the Adamses were in the world of the theater from the start. 
"My father was a producer, my mother was an actress, and we made our stage 
debuts when we were 6 and 8 in 'Brigadoon,' " Brooke recalls. "My father had a 
tent in Michigan where he staged musicals and we spent our summers there. In 
Manhattan we lived in a townhouse and Lynne and I slept in what was the parlor 
in the house. The piano was in there and we'd often wake up in the morning to 
somebody auditioning in our bedroom and a line of actors out in the hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooke left the theater for film in 1974 when she came to L.A. "with a burning 
desire to get into the movies," she recalls. She achieved that goal in fairly 
short order, appearing in just two small roles (she was in "Car Wash" in 1976 
and "Shock Waves" in 1977) before landing the lead in "Days of Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bitch making my debut in such an extraordinary movie," she recalls. 
"I knew it was extraordinary when we were making it and that I'd never have 
another experience like it and I was right. I was offered lots of stuff after 
that -- and looking back I have to say I didn't handle things so well." 
</P>
<P>
 A fter completing a handful of films, Brooke Adams moved back to New York in 
the late '70s when her parents became ill. She spent much of the '80s in New 
York doing plays, one of which was Wendy Wasserstein's "The Heidi Chronicles" 
in 1990. Also in the cast was actor Tony Shalhoub, presently a regular in the 
TV sitcom "Wings," whom she married in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Adams tried her hand at the movies too, leaving the soaps in 1982 to 
pursue a film career in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "That didn't go well," she recalls. "Brooke was at a high point in her career 
then and people were constantly asking me, 'What's it like having Brooke Adams 
for a sister?' " 
</P>
<P>
 So, Lynne left Hollywood and moved to Woodstock, where she completed an 
unpublished novel along with several screenplays and plays. She thinks of 
herself primarily as a writer, and between rehearsals for "Two Faced," she's 
putting the finishing touches on another one-woman show, that Brooke plans to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Brooke of her shift from film to stage: "When I think about doing a film 
-- just being in the makeup chair can be an ordeal, and in front of a movie 
camera you find yourself worrying about whether you're wrinkling your brow. 
Those things aren't an issue onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sort of dedicated the last few years to my children and don't really go 
up for parts any more," she continues. "When I got married in 1992, it was the 
first time since I was 16 that I didn't have to support myself, so I guess I've 
just been enjoying that. Of course, I'd love to do another film, but I'm trying 
to adjust to the idea of not doing that because it's too brutal a way to make a 
living. This is the most competitive business in the world, and there are so 
many young, beautiful, talented actresses that it's a miracle I've worked at 
all."

PERFORMING ARTS; COMMENTARY; KARL BOHM, A SOLID STRAUSSIAN; A SERIES OF 
HISTORIC OPERA RECORDINGS DOCUMENTS THE ARTISTIC HERITAGE OF RICHARD STRAUSS' 
LAST DISCIPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Martin Bernheimer, Martin Bernheimer is The Times' music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karl Bohm, who would have celebrated his 100th birthday in August, was hardly 
the most flamboyant conductor of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't a glamorous podium magnet like Herbert von Karajan, or a saintly 
romanticist like Bruno Walter. He wasn't a prickly perfectionist like Arturo 
Toscanini, or a poetic hero like Wilhelm Furtwangler. He wasn't a sensitive 
humanist like Fritz Busch. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't command the spacious repose of Hans Knappertsbusch. He inspired no 
cult following in the manner of Erich Kleiber, and he didn't appear to be a 
high-powered autocrat like Clemens Krauss. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohm was, above all, a solid musician -- quiet in matters of demeanor, strong 
in matters of technique, fussy in matters of style. He was informed, 
intelligent and, above all, reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 During his long career, he assumed several personalities. In the shadow of 
gigantic colleagues, he seemed somewhat pedantic, perhaps more a Kapellmeister 
(in the best sense of the much-misused term) than an inspired individualist. 
Then, gradually, as his illustrious colleagues began to die off, he assimilated 
their status of giganticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Survival means a lot in the arts. So does innocence by association. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohm, who died in 1981, was one of the last of his breed. When he approached 
his dotage -- a most active and amazingly productive dotage -- he served as a 
symbol of an old world and an exponent of the best in an expiring Germanic 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 He paid high artistic dues from the start. After all, he had been a follower 
of Carl Muck, a friend of Alban Berg, a champion of both Ernst Krenek and Paul 
Hindemith and a faithful disciple of Richard Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Strauss connection may have been the most important one. The composer 
repaid the conductor's unwavering constancy in numerous ways. Bohm conducted 
the world premiere of two Strauss operas -- "Die Schweigsame Frau" in 1935 and 
"Daphne" in 1938. The latter was actually dedicated to him. 
</P>
<P>
 It can't be too surprising that the master appreciated the servant. Bohm was 
relatively self-effacing. He never imposed a false perspective on the work at 
hand. He savored clarity and economy. He valued the ideals of Mozartean 
restraint, which, believe it or not, are helpful in the delineation of decaying 
romanticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohm was only 55 when Strauss died in 1949. With the passage of time, the 
music world eventually came to regard the conductor as the composer's alter 
ego. It wasn't that no one else conducted Strauss well. It was, simply, that 
increasingly few rivals could claim to have conducted Strauss with Strauss' 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 The cumulative impact of Bohm as a Strauss conductor is being documented these 
days by Deutsche Grammophon in a fascinating series of historic opera 
recordings. Some of the CD sets are merely reissues of entries available in the 
commercial catalogue long ago. Others, more important, are taken from the 
broadcast archives of the Salzburg Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Most interesting, perhaps, is a performance of "Arabella" from the summer of 
1947. The Austrian city lay in postwar ruin. Bohm, whose cooperation with the 
Nazi regime had cast a long shadow, had just been granted permission to resume 
his career. Food was scarce, and morale was obviously low. The time didn't seem 
ideal for a lighthearted performance of Strauss' nostalgic demi-masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 But here it is -- always elegant, sometimes charming, ultimately poignant (DGG 
445 342-2). The proceedings, astonishingly well-recorded, are dominated -- 
authoritatively despite a few moments of distress -- by veteran soprano Maria 
Reining. She is nobly seconded by the very young Lisa della Casa (herself an 
incipient Arabella) as the radiant Zdenka. Hans Hotter introduces an unusually 
powerful yet sensitive Mandryka, and Georg Hann is a splendidly hearty Waldner. 
In those days they had ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 A performance of "Ariadne auf Naxos" from 1954 finds Bohm bridging the 
contradictory intimacy and grandeur with exemplary poise. Attempting the title 
role for the first time, Della Casa offers a rather pale preview of future 
achievements, and Irmgard Seefried's classic Composer is better preserved 
elsewhere. Still, Hilde Guden is an irresistibly daring Zerbinetta, and the 
teamwork is marvelous. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohm did not conduct "Rosenkavalier" very often. He preferred to concentrate 
on less popular challenges. His Salzburg performance in 1969, however, 
testifies to uncommon refinement and gentle wit (DGG 445 338-2). Christa Ludwig 
is the warm and wise Marschallin, well matched by Tatiana Troyanos' dignified 
Octavian and Edith Mathis' silvery Sophie. Theo Adam is cast against type as 
wily, slender-sounding Baron Ochs -- certainly more baron than ox. The Vienna 
Philharmonic is, well, the Vienna Philharmonic. Enough said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recording of "Die Schweigsame Frau" (DGG 445 335-2) actually deserves that 
overhyped adjective definitive . It preserves the Salzburg production of 1959 
in which Bohm enforced a perfect fusion of pathos and whimsy. The ideal cast 
includes Guden, Hotter, Fritz Wunderlich and Hermann Prey, all in their 
overwhelming prime. In those days, the voices had faces. 
</P>
<P>
 More familiar and still welcome re-entries from the Bohm catalogue include a 
chilling "Salome" from Hamburg in 1970 with Gwyneth Jones as the virginal 
Princess of Judea (DGG 445 319-2); an extraordinarily affecting "Daphne" from 
Vienna in 1964 with Guden as the nature girl who turns into a tree (DGG 445 
322-2), and a sweeping, classic "Frau ohne Schatten" from Vienna with Birgit 
Nilsson, Leonie Rysanek and friends doing their unique thing (DGG 445 325-2). 
Also on the agenda are solid studio productions of "Capriccio" (DGG 445 347-2) 
and "Elektra" (DGG 445 329-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Bohm knew how to accompany singers. Unlike many of his successors, he 
understood the frailties of the human voice. He brought that knowledge with him 
to the orchestra pit. 
</P>
<P>
 A famous Viennese critic discovered the maestro's simple secret in 1954: "With 
Bohm," Heinrich Kralik wrote, "the instruments sing, speak, play and dance, 
just like the characters on the stage."

ART; HOW TO PUSH THAT BAD-TASTE BUTTON; 'MY WORK IS LOUD,' SCULPTOR JOEL 
OTTERSON ADMITS. BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A GUY WHO CUT HIS TEETH ON PUNK 
MUSIC? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1977, artist Joel Otterson graduated from high school, moved to New York 
and enrolled at the Parsons School of Design. That was the year punk broke, and 
there was a strong relationship then between New York's community of young 
artists and the highly conceptual punk scene. You'd assume an artist with 
Otterson's interest in pop culture spent his nights at CBGB seeing Talking 
Heads and Television, but you'd be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at Studio 54 six nights a week -- I've always loved disco," enthuses 
the 35-year-old artist, who paid homage to the maligned musical genre in 1990 
with a massive kinetic sculpture titled "Disco Bed." A multipurpose mattress 
wired for sound, with a built-in light show and spandex sheets, it's a rococo 
creation worthy of Liberace, and it's typical of Otterson's work.  
</P>
<P>
 "My work is loud, and I want it to yell at people," the artist confesses 
during a conversation at the Shoshana Wayne Gallery in Santa Monica's Bergamot 
Station, where his first Los Angeles exhibition in five years continues through 
Nov. 7. "I admit my work looks ugly to me sometimes -- I often look at it and 
can't believe I made it," Otterson says with a laugh. He had recently arrived 
in Los Angeles after a three-day drive from his home in Covington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it has a horrific beauty, though, and people who write it off as 
kitsch aren't looking deep enough. People tend to dismiss my work as light and 
funny, and the phrase bad taste often comes up in critiques of my art, but that 
has never made sense to me. My idea of bad taste is stupidity and 
narrow-mindedness." 
</P>
<P>
 Otterson's point is a good one, but he certainly doesn't refrain from pushing 
the bad-taste buttons. With its parodies of class consciousness and taste, 
Otterson's work is rooted in an aesthetic of excess that combines debased 
elements of interior design, motifs from rock culture, and a wonderfully wacky 
approach to comfort. His body of work includes heirloom china decorated with 
logos of rock bands, a kitchen table equipped with a TV, a bathtub that has 
been transformed into a love seat, and a vintage jukebox flanked by life-size 
glass skeletons that functions as an urn to hold the ashes of a loved one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>

 Otterson, who was born in Los Angeles in 1959, had an idyllic childhood spent 
mostly in Grants Pass, Ore., where his family moved when he was 8. Otterson's 
father was a plumber, as is his older brother, but Otterson himself was never 
pressured to take up the family trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oregon was great until I turned 13; then I wanted to be running up and down 
Sunset Boulevard in platform shoes," he continues. "From the time I was 13 
until I got out of high school, I spent summers in L.A. with my half-brother 
Ken and his wife, Barbie, and I was totally into the glitter scene -- I had an 
earring, a Bowie cut, the works." 
</P>
<P>
 After he graduated from high school in 1977, Otterson enrolled at Parsons 
School of Design, planning on a career in fashion design. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the coolest artists of the second half of the 20th Century were the 
designers -- things like the Lincoln Continental with the denim roof designed 
by Bill Blass really knocked me out. (Car designer) Ettore Bugatti is on par 
with Duchamp for me, and I also love Thomas Chippendale and Daniel Marot, who 
was a decorator who did parts of Versailles. During my second year, however, my 
design teacher took me aside and said, 'Joel, stop making art and start making 
dresses,' and a light bulb went on over my head. I realized I didn't move to 
New York to become a dressmaker -- I moved there to be an artist, so I switched 
my major to sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pattern and Decoration was the big thing in New York then and I loved it, but 
painting isn't physical enough for me," he continues. "At that point I was very 
interested in Rauschenberg's work; I like the fact that his work doesn't abide 
by any rules. I was also influenced by Brancusi, and early on I made really 
quiet work -- tall, thin things that stood in the corner and almost 
disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 Otterson had his first exhibition at Manhattan's Nature Morte Gallery in 1983, 
the year after he graduated from Parsons. He became part of a community of 
young artists exhibiting their work on the Lower East Side -- a group that 
included Jeff Koons, Richard Prince and Haim Steinbach -- and he felt a 
connection with the work they were making. "It's often happened that I'll see a 
piece by Richard Prince or Jeff Koons and think, 'I don't have to do that now.' 
We have a lot of parallel interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Otterson's work, however, is tougher to sell. "It's a huge commitment to buy 
my work -- a lot of it is kinetic, and it's big and heavy," says Otterson, who 
supported himself for much of the '80s working for a company that made 
hand-painted fabric. Otterson is now able to live off his work, partly because 
he moved last year from New York to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "A dealer I know named Carl Solway moved to Cincinnati after having a gallery 
in New York for 10 years," he explains. "Carl often assists artists in having 
works fabricated, and my $1,200 rent in Brooklyn was killing me, so when he 
offered me a studio, I decided to move there. I really love it: Money goes 
further, I was able to buy a house, I love having a car, and I can concentrate 
on my work more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Midwest is the metal heartland, and I love it because of that too," adds 
Otterson, whose forearm is tattooed with a wrench in memory of his father, who 
died of a heart attack when the artist was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Otterson's interest in American culture centers for the most part on the 
domestic environment. "I'm interested in the things we need around us in order 
to live -- refrigerators, tables, beds -- and in the emotions we attach to 
inanimate objects. I'm also curious as to why there's a market for fake 
Chippendale furniture, for instance. Do people think they'll live like kings 
and queens if they surround themselves with knock-offs of furniture once owned 
by royalty? 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, I'm parodying domesticity by creating new combinations -- a sofa 
that's also a bathtub and a fish bowl," he adds. "Some people use these pieces 
as furniture, and I intend that they be functional; however, I'm not a 
furniture-maker. What makes these objects art rather than furniture is the fact 
that they have a text, and there's more to be said about them than that they're 
comfortable and functional. There are more layers to art." 
</P>
<P>
 As for how his work is evolving, Otterson says: "I'm slowly working my way 
through the house, and what I'd like to do next is design an entire space. I'm 
also done with disco and want to deal with '80s music -- stuff like Adam Ant, 
Culture Club and Duran Duran. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fascinated by the genealogy of heavy metal," he says, settling into a 
favorite subject. "What made Guns N' Roses great is that they're the perfect 
combination of all the rock bands that preceded them; they're totally a product 
of Led Zeppelin, which was the most influential band ever . I dismiss the 
Beatles -- they bore me. At the moment I'm listening to a lot of Top 10 heavy 
metal, bands like Metallica and Danzig. 
</P>
<P>
 "And a few weeks ago I saw the Stones. It was like seeing Jesus," he declares 
solemnly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joel Otterson's work is at Shoshana Wayne Gallery, Bergamot Station, 2525 
Michigan Ave., No. B1, Santa Monica. Through Nov. 7. (310) 453-7535.

 HOUSE PARTY: Less than a month before voting day, Gov. Pete Wilson recruited 
volunteers for his campaign and urged supporters to keep up the fight at a 
house party in Burbank on Saturday. Burbank school board member Joe Hooven 
hosted the gathering, which was also attended by state Sen. Newt Russell 
(R-Glendale) and Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale). . . . The house party is 
one of 1,030 being held for Wilson in nearly every county in the state, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 BRUSH FIRE: A fast-moving blaze scorched more than 1,000 acres of land in Agua 
Dulce on Saturday. No one was hurt and no structures were damaged in the fire, 
the cause of which has not been determined (B1). . . . About 350 county and 
U.S. Forest Service firefighters fought the wind-whipped flames, which forced 
the closure of the Antelope Valley Freeway for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 FINE DINING: "Idiot" and "go to hell" are common words and phrases at Phil's 
Diner in North Hollywood, and the customers couldn't be happier (B1). . . . 
After all, where else can you get a "go-to-hell omelet" or the "idiots' mish 
mosh" -- home fried potatoes, diced ham, salami, bologna, pastrami, American 
and Swiss cheese, eggs, fresh spinach and mushroom, all scrambled together -- 
for $4.35? 
</P>
<P>
 ON A ROLL: Fueled by a ground game that amassed 280 yards, Cal State 
Northridge cruised to a 40-14 win in a non-conference football game at Sonoma 
State (C14). . . . Running backs Shaun Coleman, Mark Harper and Darren Walton 
carried the load for the Matadors (3-2), who rolled up a 34-0 lead in notching 
their second consecutive easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
 WOUNDED: A resident of a Northridge halfway home was shot and seriously 
injured by a police officer early Saturday. . . . Police say Lawrence Friedman, 
24, brandished a knife at two officers who were called to the house to check on 
a domestic dispute. "He was hit in the spine," Friedman's mother said. "The 
doctors tell us our son may never walk again." (B1)

 YOU CAN STILL VOTE: With Election Day just weeks away, have you registered? Or 
have you moved but forgotten to re-register? You've got until the end of the 
day Tuesday to make this election. To accommodate you, most city clerks here 
will extend their hours till 8 p.m. that day. The county's registrar of voters 
office will remain open until midnight Tuesday to help you out. 
</P>
<P>
 PHONING OUT: Tuesday is also national Coming Out Day, when many people 
nationwide will tell their families for the first time that they're gay. . . . 
To ease the trauma, the Gay and Lesbian Services Center of Orange County has 
set up a talk line -- (714) 534-3261. Parents and gays who have been through 
"coming out" will be on the line to talk with callers. . . . The center's 
Kimberly Syre says a wide variety should be coming out: "For some reason, we've 
gotten this stereotype that we're all drag queens or drive diesel trucks, but 
90% of us are in mainstream society." 
</P>
<P>
 NEW NEIGHBOR: For public television, he's bigger than Roseanne, and he's got 
the most popular neighborhood on the tube. He's Fred Rogers, and his "Mr. 
Rogers' Neighborhood" -- seen here on KCET (Channel 28) -- is going strong 
after 26 years. . . . You can meet the star of children's TV in person: Rogers 
will be at the grand opening of the KCET Store of Knowledge -- educational 
merchandise -- at Newport Beach's Fashion Island, noon to 2 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 WEALTH OF FRIENDS: If the late Richard Nixon stirred emotion among his 
enemies, he also evoked strong loyalties from friends. Peter and Mary Muth of 
Santa Ana, longtime Nixon friends, have pledged $1 million toward the Center 
for Peace and Freedom the former President created at the Richard Nixon Library 
& Birthplace in Yorba Linda shortly before his death in April. . . . Total 
gifts toward the center are now at $15.5 million, well along toward its 
$25-million goal. Peter Muth is chairman of the Orco Block Co.

TIMOTHY ASCH; USC ANTHROPOLOGIST, FILMMAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Timothy Asch, an anthropologist whose exotic yet scientific documentary films 
have been seen in classrooms around the world, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for USC, where he was director of the Center for Visual 
Anthropology, said Asch was 62. 
</P>
<P>
 He died Monday at his Los Angeles home of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Asch had served his photographic apprenticeship with such giants of the camera 
as Ansel Adams and Edward Weston but it was not until he became a teaching 
assistant to anthropologist Margaret Mead that he was encouraged to meld his 
two interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead was the only one of his anthropology mentors who encouraged him to use 
pictures as well as words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until recently," Asch told The Times in a 1987 interview, "film was 
considered academically suspect and was tolerated only as a supplement to the 
real work of anthropologists -- writing." 
</P>
<P>
 And for nearly four decades -- from the mid-1950s to the present -- he 
emphasized the science rather than the glamour involved in this new discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 His work has been honored by the French ethnographic society Musee de l'Homme 
while retrospectives of Asch's films have been staged in Germany and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to USC in 1982 and the next year was named director of the visual 
anthropology center. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years his students have produced films on Los Angeles gangs, the 
homeless in Venice, Chinese shamanism, the Portuguese American community and 
the Peking Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Patsy, and four children, two sisters, a brother 
and two grandchildren.

L.A. SCHOOLS FAILING TO PREPARE FOR NEXT QUAKE; SAFETY: FEW CLASSROOMS HAVE 
BEEN MADE MORE SECURE, DESPITE DEADLINE SET FOR FRIDAY. SOME OFFICIALS SAY THEY 
WOULD RATHER USE THE MONEY AS INTENDED, FOR BASIC SUPPLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Many Los Angeles schools have failed to take even the most elementary steps to 
make classrooms safer despite predictions that students and teachers could be 
seriously injured in their classrooms during the next big earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on lessons from the Northridge quake, Los Angeles Unified School 
District officials issued a bulletin two months ago requiring all principals to 
improve classroom safety by Oct. 14, using money from their school supply 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But many principals say they have not even seen the memo and they are 
reluctant to spend money earmarked for classroom supplies -- such as pencils, 
paper, chalk and computers -- on bolts and brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early morning temblor rocked the city nine months ago, district 
officials have said repeatedly that schools remain the safest place for 
students during an earthquake or any other emergency. They boast that no school 
buildings collapsed -- even in areas closest to the epicenter where apartments, 
houses, malls and freeways were shaken apart. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, they and other officials say the greatest threat at 
schools to students and staff remains inside the classroom. It was in 
classrooms where bookcases toppled; televisions and overhead projectors were 
shattered; cabinets and closet doors flew open, spilling their contents, and 
chemicals and other science equipment created hazardous spills. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at dozens of schools in the district, the potential hazards remain. 
Bookcases remain unbolted to the walls, boxes are precariously stacked inside 
high closets, televisions are not anchored to carts, and chemicals remain 
unsecured in some science labs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Northridge earthquake confirmed that non-structural hazards can be 
life-threatening in schools," said Tom Tobin, executive director of the state 
Seismic Safety Commission. "Falling (objects) from closets and cabinets can be 
a serious threat." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Jan. 17 earthquake, much of the damage inside classrooms was caused by 
light fixtures and ceiling tiles crashing down. The district expects to correct 
those problems with federal funding.  
</P>
<P>
 But district officials say it is up to teachers and custodians to take basic 
steps to make their classrooms safer -- removing heavy items from high shelves, 
bolting bookcases to the walls, strapping cabinet doors shut and securing heavy 
pictures and bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that big a deal to secure those things," said Deputy Supt. Ruben 
Zacarias, who oversees the district's earthquake safety committee. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no state law or regulatory agency that deals with non-structural 
classroom safety issues. Dennis Bellet, the principal structural engineer with 
the state architect's office, said a guidebook was issued to warn districts of 
potential problems, but no one regulates or inspects the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It falls on the local school districts to control that issue," Bellet said. 
"We're definitely learning how widespread these problems (in classrooms) are. 
It used to be a suspicion but now it's a reality." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say the costs to remove at least some classroom hazards are 
minimal, and the school system is seeking outside funding to reimburse schools' 
supply accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Limerick Avenue Elementary School in Canoga Park, Principal Ronni 
Ephraim had an outside earthquake preparedness company survey the campus and 
found that it would cost $600 just to quake-proof the school's front office. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Sherman Oaks Elementary School, Principal Edward Krojansky said he is 
loath to use school materials money for earthquake supplies such as brackets 
and cables. "We have limited funds as it is," Krojansky said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At some schools, teachers and parent groups have made earthquake safety a 
priority since the quake. Teachers have removed potential hazards -- such as 
boxes balanced on bookcases -- and secured tall storage closets, and parents 
have financed earthquake preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 But even at Sherman Oaks, where parents bought a cargo container and filled it 
with earthquake supplies, the school's classrooms are not risk-free.  
</P>
<P>
 In one room, a television sits on a glass cabinet; in another, an aquarium is 
on a cabinet, and bookcases are not bolted to the walls. Many classrooms still 
have free-standing, four-drawer filing cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 Many teachers, parents and administrators are questioning whether it should be 
their responsibility -- or the school district's -- to make classrooms safer.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the teachers' responsibility to be bolting bookcases," said Francine 
Cantero, a science teacher and teachers union representative at Portola Junior 
High School in Tarzana. "There are things teachers can do to make things a 
little safer. (But) they certainly can't invest any of their own money -- we do 
that enough already." 
</P>
<P>
 But Helen Fallon, who heads the Los Angeles Parent-Teacher Assn.'s earthquake 
preparedness committee, said teachers should take responsibility for arranging 
their classrooms to keep children safe. "It involves a lot of classroom 
reorganization -- that's all," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon said parents and district officials should inspect schools to make sure 
safety measures have been taken. "I've seen classrooms where I'd say there are 
major problems. I've seen classrooms that look like teachers' personal storage 
containers." 
</P>
<P>
 But Zacarias said the district does not have the personnel to inspect all 
schools for safety compliance, although he does intend to ask administrators to 
conduct spot checks of some classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some school systems, the Los Angeles district has not conducted a 
survey to determine how much needs to be done to quake-proof classrooms. The 
Burbank and Glendale school districts have compiled school-by-school surveys 
and are securing classroom furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Board of Education members, who recently requested more 
information on the potential risks to students and teachers in classrooms, said 
they believe local campuses should be more vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something that is so easily within our grasp to make sure materials are 
tied down, cabinets secured," board President Mark Slavkin said. "I want to be 
assured that schools have taken the steps necessary."

MAHONY CALLS PROP. 187 A THREAT TO MORAL PRINCIPLES, URGES ITS DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying the measure would undermine "clear moral principles" of "compassion and 
welcome," Cardinal Roger Mahony on Saturday called on California Roman 
Catholics to defeat Proposition 187, which promises sweeping crackdowns on 
public benefits for undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The spiritual leader of 3 million Catholics in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties also said the so-called "save our state" initiative runs 
counter to the church's teachings and traditions because it would harm 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church recognizes and supports the need for immigration reform," the 
cardinal said. "But Prop. 187 is fraught with measures that will tear families 
apart and will have a severe negative impact on children." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony made his remarks in a homily during a Mass before several hundred 
people at the 17th annual Multiethnic Celebration of the Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles. The Mass, in a gymnasium at Cantwell-Sacred Heart High School in 
Montebello, followed a procession of Catholic immigrants from 38 nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying tribute to the immigrants, the cardinal said that the church and the 
nation share a history of people who have made risky decisions worthy of 
respect to move in search of better lives for their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Together, we can take a step toward protecting families by seeing to it that 
Prop. 187 never becomes law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would, among other things, bar illegal immigrants from public 
elementary and secondary schools. To stay in school, children would have to 
prove their legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 also would bar publicly funded clinics and hospitals from 
providing all but emergency care to the undocumented. And it would require law 
enforcement agencies to notify the Immigration and Naturalization Service of 
any arrestees "suspected" of being illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony's opposition to the initiative came as no surprise. The Catholic 
bishops of California had joined the top leadership of all the state's other 
major religious denominations in announcing their opposition. And Mahony had 
denounced the measure at a conference for Latino Catholics, calling it "a 
devastating assault on human dignity," and more recently in a pastoral letter 
in a church newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, he said the initiative would harm everyone. Youngsters deprived 
of education would constitute "a new class of young people without the 
opportunity to grow and develop," undocumented immigrants deprived of health 
care would pose a public health threat, and health care workers and educators 
would create widespread distrust because of requirements that they not only 
deny services but report to the INS people they suspect are here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony last used his pulpit to comment on a ballot initiative two years ago 
when he blasted ill-fated Proposition 161, which would have allowed the 
terminally ill to choose doctor-assisted suicide.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; ASIAN AMERICAN GROUPS ORGANIZE TO FIGHT 
MEASURE; ACTIVISTS SAY THIS IS THE FIRST ISSUE TO DRAW SUCH A GRASS-ROOTS 
RESPONSE. STILL, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR DENYING SERVICES TO ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS.

<P>
 The campaign to defeat Proposition 187 has spawned an unprecedented 
grass-roots movement in California's diverse Asian American communities, 
bringing politically savvy third-generation Chinese and Japanese Americans 
working side by side with newer Korean, Vietnamese, Thai and Cambodian 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though this is the most insidious, mean-spirited initiative, it really 
provides us with an organizing opportunity," said Miya Iwataki, co-chairwoman 
of Californians United Against Proposition 187. The Nov. 8 ballot measure would 
prohibit health, education and social services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwataki and other veteran activists in Southern and Northern California say 
this is the first time a statewide ballot measure has generated such interest 
in the Asian American community, which has a statewide population of more than 
2.8 million. They hope that the campaign's legacy will be a united Asian 
American political bloc that can translate into political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Asian Americans oppose the so-called "save our state" initiative on 
the November ballot. Although they may not be vocal or organized, many Asian 
Americans plan to vote for Proposition 187 and believe that the measure will 
benefit them. 
</P>
<P>
 Their rationale is no different from the measure's other supporters. They say 
California cannot afford to continue providing services to people who are here 
illegally when the state government and residents are struggling in these 
financially strapped times. And, they add, the policy makes a mockery of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like saying, 'Hey, break the law, come into our country and we'll 
provide you all the services you need,' " said Gary Kim, president of the Korea 
American Republican Assn. of Los Angeles. "People tend to see this as a race 
issue. But I see it as what is right and what is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Chet Wong, a Chinese American teacher who was born in Los Angeles, compares 
illegal immigrants to unarmed invaders. "We're being invaded across our 
borders, and the federal government is not doing anything about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the only organized Asian American group pushing Proposition 187 seems 
to be Asian Americans for Border Control in Sylmar. Spokesman Gil Wong says 
illegal immigrants are unfairly taking advantage of American resources. His 
10-member group is part of the bigger Orange County-based California Coalition 
for Immigration Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong added that Asian American organizations and activists opposing the 
initiative are acting out of self-interest. Social workers, lawyers, health 
care providers and teachers have a financial stake in having illegal 
immigrants, he said. "They wouldn't have their jobs if there were no illegal 
immigrants. But the taxpayers are not in the business of giving them job 
security." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, hundreds of volunteers and more than 60 organizations -- 
ranging from the venerable Chinese American Citizens Alliance and Japanese 
American Citizens League to the younger Thai Community Development and United 
Cambodian Community -- form Asian Pacific Islanders Against Proposition 187, 
the Asian contingent of Californians United Against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, organizers have targeted about 30,000 Asian American voters in 
heavily Asian communities. Volunteers, many of them students from area 
universities, are working the phones in the evenings to reach Asian American 
voters and encourage them to vote against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates, Asians 
made up less than 10% of the more than 1.1 million illegal immigrants living in 
California in 1992. Two-thirds of the 100,000 illegal immigrants from Asia were 
Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal status of Asians is not the issue, opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all going to be affected whether we're illegal immigrants or we've been 
born and raised here, as long as we're racially and ethnically visible people 
of color," said Iwataki, a third-generation Japanese American. "If we look 
Asian, if we speak with an accent, we're going to be asked to provide 
documentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Quynh Tram Nguyen, a Vietnamese who came to California legally as a refugee in 
1984, says it is unfair to dismiss the contributions of newer arrivals to the 
state's work force -- even if they are in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Chanchanit Martorell, executive director of the Thai Community Center, the 
only service agency for Thais in Los Angeles, says Proposition 187 would hurt 
her clients because many have overstayed their visas after coming here as 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the United Cambodian Community organization is campaigning to 
defeat the measure even though most Cambodians have legal refugee status, said 
Vora Kanthoul, executive director of the group. Based in Long Beach, where an 
estimated 35,000 Cambodians live, the organization believes that the initiative 
could have the effect of picking on all people who look foreign and do not 
speak English well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers for Asian Pacific Islanders Against Proposition 187 have used such 
major community functions as Nisei Week in Little Tokyo in August, the Moon 
Festival in Chinatown in September and the Korean Parade in Koreatown this 
month to spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, after two naturalization ceremonies at the Los Angeles Convention 
Center, volunteers registered 1,600 new voters -- half of them Asian. Two 
hundred volunteers are expected to attend the next two naturalization events 
Oct. 20 and 21 to sign up more voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Asians, who are 10% of California's population, make up about 5% of the 
state's registered voters. In Los Angeles County, more than 700,000 people with 
Asian Pacific Islander surnames are eligible to vote, but only a fourth are 
registered voters, according to Nancy Au, president of the Asian Pacific 
Planning Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate goal of Asian Pacific Islanders Against Proposition 187 is to 
defeat it. But the activists' bigger dream is to use this campaign as a vehicle 
to organize and educate the disparate Asian communities whose differences 
between them have been more pronounced than their similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 Because a majority of Asians in the United States arrived in the 1970s and 
1980s, many are unaware of the history of legally sanctioned discrimination 
against Asians, Proposition 187 opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first undocumented immigrants were Chinese, not Mexicans," said Bill 
Tamayo, an immigration lawyer with the Asian Law Caucus in San Francisco, 
referring to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that barred Chinese laborers. 
This and subsequent statutes aimed at the Chinese were the only immigration 
laws in U.S. history directed at a specific nationality. 
</P>
<P>
 Asians have a duty to share this history with Latinos, who have become the 
latest target of the immigrant bashing, Proposition 187 opponents say.

FIRE SCORCHES 1,000 ACRES IN NORTHERN L.A. COUNTY; BLAZE: NO ONE IS INJURED AND 
NO STRUCTURES ARE DAMAGED. HIGH TEMPERATURE OF 100 AT CIVIC CENTER TIES 95-YEAR 
RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As temperatures soared, a fast-moving brush fire engulfed more than 1,000 
acres in the rural northern Los Angeles County community of Agua Dulce on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured and no buildings were damaged by the blaze, which for a 
time threatened a mobile home park and several other structures. A spokesman 
for the Los Angeles County Fire Department said a downed power line had been 
found at the site of the fire, but the cause of the blaze has not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 About 350 county and U.S. Forest Service firefighters were needed to contain 
the blaze as winds in excess of 20 m.p.h. helped spread the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters kept the blaze from reaching homes in Bee Canyon and a mobile 
home park after clearing away brush by hand and with bulldozers. Nature played 
a hand too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winds are kind of squirrelly here," said Capt. Steve Valenzuela. "They 
can change in either direction. In this case, they helped us by blowing the 
other way." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was 80% contained by 7 p.m., firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dry conditions and stronger-than-expected Santa Ana winds caused the fire to 
move rapidly and made it difficult to contain, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong Santa Ana winds will continue today, which is typical for this time of 
year, although they will be calmer than they were Saturday, said Kris 
Farnsworth, a meteorologist at WeatherData Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's high temperature at the Civic Center was 100 -- tying a record set 
in 1899. The low was 67. Today will be slightly cooler, with a high of 97 and a 
low of 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were notified of the fire about 10 a.m. Saturday. It started near 
Agua Dulce Canyon Road, about one mile south of the Antelope Valley Freeway, 
and headed west toward Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway was closed from Via Princessa to Red Rover Mine Road for several 
hours, backing up traffic for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the brush-covered, sparsely populated canyons handled the crisis 
calmly, even as the blaze roared down the west side of Agua Dulce Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Kurich saw the fire coming his way and prepared for an exit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a couple bags packed and had my dog ready to leave," he said. But the 
firefighters' actions reassured him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lit some backfires and when it got down to here, they had all kinds of 
equipment on it," Kurich said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the day's most dramatic incidents involved a county Fire Department 
bulldozer that crawled up and down the rugged ridges east of the freeway 
cutting firebreaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Operator Steve Oldaker came upon a nearly vertical slope and could not back 
away from it. For the next 20 minutes, with a rapt audience of Fire Department 
brass, sheriff's deputies, camp crews and reporters looking down from the 
otherwise empty freeway, Oldaker used every trick in the bulldozer's repertory 
to ease the giant machine down safely. 
</P>
<P>
 First planting the blade into the dirt, he repeatedly lifted the whole tractor 
into a horizontal position on the blade's hydraulic arms and then spun the 
steel tracks to cut dirt away from behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Little by little, the loose dirt filled in under the front of the rig, 
building a pad from which to launch the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, asked how steep a grade the tractor could descend, Oldaker said: "That 
was too steep."

AHMANSON PLAN WOULD BE FATAL FOR SANTA MONICAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan Genelin's commentary regarding Ahmanson's proposed development between 
Thousand Oaks and the west San Fernando Valley was right on target. It is a 
prime example of a developer's total disregard for anything but the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily traffic created by this behemoth would destroy the quality of life 
on North Las Virgenes Road and beyond for the hundreds of families that live in 
the condos and houses of that area. 
</P>
<P>
 If Las Virgenes Road is burdened by Ahmanson's automobile traffic, plus a 
large proposed commercial development at Las Virgenes Road and the Ventura 
Freeway plus Soka's proposed development that would be larger than Topanga 
Plaza, we can kiss our rural life goodby. Most of us moved to "horse country" 
to get away from it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners must unite and oppose this insanity with all that we've got!

AFRICAN AMERICAN REPRESENTATION; GLENDALE'S HISTORY SUPPORTS IMPORTANCE OF 
INCLUDING THIS ELEMENT OF POPULATION ON PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale included no African Americans on a new human relations panel formed 
this year, an especially regrettable omission considering its history of race 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Eileen Givens says she tried unsuccessfully to find one or two black 
people for the 14-member Blue Ribbon Task Force on Community Relations when it 
was formed in the spring, and that the search is likely to resume. The group 
already has two Latinos and five members with, variously, Filipino, Korean and 
Armenian backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although blacks make up less than 2% of Glendale's population, they clearly 
should be represented on such a cultural-rainbow task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the least reason is Glendale's history. For decades it was well-known as 
an all-white city distinctly inhospitable to African Americans. It still has 
that reputation among many. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1920s saw an active Ku Klux Klan there. Longtime residents remember 
hearing in the 1950s that black people were not allowed on the city's streets 
after dark. In the 1960s, Glendale was West Coast headquarters of the American 
Nazi Party. In the 1980s, the Pace Amendment Advocates, an extreme nativist 
organization, established its headquarters there. A few years ago, a minority 
officer won a lawsuit alleging race discrimination by the police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Two versions of a Human Relations Commission came and went, the latter in the 
1980s. Two years ago, a Glendale Community Council bloomed briefly, but it had 
no African Americans when it was formed or when it fell apart a bit later. 
</P>
<P>
 All this helps to explain the suspicion that blacks are bound to feel toward 
any signs of racial exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course it does not mean the average white citizen of today's polyglot 
Glendale is likelier than anyone else to harbor racist views, or that the city 
is not trying commendably to improve the human relations climate as it 
continues to grow more racially, nationally and ethnically diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear mostly strong support" from constituents, Mayor Givens says, but she 
acknowledges that forming the task force in the first place -- and thus 
implying that the city is not perfect -- was and is controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials took the praiseworthy step of speaking out firmly against "hate 
crimes" this year when an Armenian organization's offices and a Jewish temple 
were vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
 We look forward to the good work of Glendale's human relations task force -- 
and to prompt representation of African Americans, the minority group with 
perhaps the longest and bitterest memories of its past.

A GOOD IDEA HITS THE STREET; LOAN COULD BRING LIFE TO DEAD ZONE ON VENTURA 
BOULEVARD, DESPITE NEIGHBORS' AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dead zone in Sherman Oaks has moved a little closer to a welcome rebirth, 
under terms that unfortunately are opposed by some of its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting the views of the naysayers, a City Council committee has approved a 
$2.4-million loan to create a building with a ground floor of retail stores and 
two floors of apartments for elderly people. The loan, though its terms are 
favorable, is no gift but is to be repaid from rental income. 
</P>
<P>
 The empty buildings to be replaced at Ventura Boulevard and Woodman Avenue are 
in advanced disrepair. They have assaulted thousands of eyes daily for five 
years, since the owner evicted his tenants, sought to construct a three-story 
building that appalled neighbors and slammed into a bureaucratic wall thrown up 
by then-Councilman Michael Woo at his constituents' request. As the dispute 
dragged on through the years and into court, the stores became a haven for rats 
and vandals. They also became a textbook example of the recurring conflict over 
development on the Valley's "Main Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement endorsed by City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the building 
will be neither an elephantine monster nor the trim row of little shops many 
residents yearn for. Instead, in an innovative retail/housing mix, 83 
one-bedroom apartments will be occupied by low-income people over 62 years old. 
Couples with annual incomes of $24,000 or individuals who make a bit less will 
be eligible. They will pay $550 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. will have none of it. Among other things it 
opposes the precedential violation of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan's 
30-foot height limit, if only by five feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Even giving appropriate respect to the neighbors' views, the project's pluses 
more than offset the minuses. 
</P>
<P>
 First off, it will replace the present mess. Rejection would mean further 
deterioration or empty land or, someday, a commercial building that would 
almost certainly generate more traffic than what's proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, it has unusual benefits beyond providing needed housing. People living 
above stores and going out to shop or ride buses will add pedestrians, 
customers and perhaps even Neighborhood Watchers to the boulevard. They will 
make it better, not worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has worked to allay various fears. Resident parking, at one space per 
apartment, exceeds the city minimum, and the retail market meets it. A turn 
lane will be added for northbound Woodman. To help preserve neighbors' 
back-yard privacy, rear apartments will be limited to six. 
</P>
<P>
 Other objections in our view are of dubious merit or outweighed by the good 
points. The full council should approve the loan when it comes up for a vote in 
November.

TIMES SHOULD ENCOURAGE EXPRESSIONS OF DISSENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial "2 Issues Inflame Tensions at CSUN" (Sept. 25) suggests that 
Cal State Northridge should have delayed a much-needed reorganization of our 
Educational Opportunity Program by referring the issue to a committee. 
</P>
<P>
 You agreed the changes are needed; you note correctly that we had already laid 
the groundwork for the changes.What seemed to disturb you is the fact that the 
students protested. 
</P>
<P>
 One would think that The Times would be a little bit bolder in its 
understanding and tolerance of dissent. We understand that the audibility and 
visibility of racial and ethnic issues make people nervous, but The Times' 
editorial pages, of all places, should be the first to encourage and support 
expression on those issues, even if you disagree with the expressions 
themselves. After the Farrakhan appearance on our campus last year, The Times 
said "CSUN has had too much of this sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Too much? Are we overexercising the First Amendment here? Since when did The 
Times become such a faint-hearted soul? 
</P>
<P>
 The voices you hear at Cal State Northridge are not CSUN's; they are among the 
diverse voices of our community. You should listen to the ideas underneath the 
voices.

WHAT JUSTIFIES SCHOOL'S 'VIVA MEXICO' EVENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article "Kids Dance to Fete Mexican Independence" (Sept. 17) left me 
confused. If one didn't know better, one would think the program initiated by 
school Principal Lucky Hemphill more appropriate for a Mexico City elementary 
school class, particularly the "Viva Mexico" epithets.I would hope there is an 
equivalent and more publicized celebration at O'Melveny school when 
California/USA became liberated from its undemocratic Mexican forebears. 
</P>
<P>
 As an activist in multicultural and racially interactive arts expression and 
appreciation, I do not understand the segmentation and fragmentation of the 
purported multicultural "mixing" at a 99% Latino school. Are there any 
Salvadorans, Guatemalans, pure Spaniards, or is the school 99% Mexican? It 
appears that other Caucasian, Asian and African races were missing or excluded 
from this program. 
</P>
<P>
 Most confusing of all was Principal Hemphill and the faculty leading a rousing 
cheer of "Viva Mexico" in a Los Angeles Unified School District, 
taxpayer-supported school. I hope this program began with the singing of the 
"Star Spangled Banner" and the Pledge of Allegiance.

WILL CSUN STUDENTS SIT ON SIDELINES IN ELECTION?; VOTE WILL DECIDE ON FEE

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If things go according to form, the vast majority of an electorate in 
money-conscious Southern California will pass up a chance next week to vote on 
a 148% tax increase for a government activity that appears to mean little to 
most of them.

 Cal State Northridge students will decide Oct. 18 and 19 on a "tax" increase 
in the form of a higher activity fee. The fee, now $33 a semester, would 
balloon to $82, with most of the $49 increase used to keep CSUN's big-time 
sports healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively big-time, that is, and relatively healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago CSUN moved into college sports' highest competitive rank, 
Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. It holds its own in sports 
such as baseball, softball and men's volleyball, doing less well in football, 
where it's in a less-demanding subcategory called Division I-AA, and in 
basketball, where it plays big schools but often loses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even little-big-time sports cost money, however, and CSUN's chronically 
strapped athletic department says it desperately needs an infusion of cash. It 
has been warned to expect a drop of $700,000 next year in its $3.6 million 
budget. The fee increase would raise about $2 million for 1995-1996 and would 
bring CSUN's sports budget to about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing, including this vote, will make CSUN a gridiron powerhouse, but the 
election is important to the future of CSUN athletics. At the same time, from 
the "taxpayer" viewpoint, $98 a year is real money to a lot of CSUN students. 
Nearly half are part-timers and 70% hold jobs. For less money, San Fernando 
Valley adult voters have twice rejected hiring more police officers. Yet a big 
question hanging over this election is: Will most voters sit it out? 
</P>
<P>
 A reason for pessimism is a campus election this past spring on essentially 
the same issue. The fee increase lost 993 to 906, with about 8% of the students 
casting ballots. (The deciding votes came from the campus in Ventura, where the 
higher fee lost 118 to 14.) Athletes were campaigning for "yes" votes all over 
campus last week, with unknown impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Further uncertainty surrounds the election because it will not be held at 
ballot boxes but over the telephone. Students will dial a number, punch in 
personal identification numbers and touch-tone their verdicts. It seems odd to 
decide a crucial question using a new technique with an apparently high 
potential for foul-ups. PIN numbers, mailed days ago to students' homes, can 
also be picked up from a campus office, but who'll bother? 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a homecoming king and queen will be picked in the election; 
maybe they have coattails. 
</P>
<P>
 To the other big question -- what's at stake? -- the answer isn't clear 
because officials won't predict the exact outcome if students turn thumbs down. 
Scholarships in at least some men's sports would be cut. Women's sports are 
safer, because CSUN, for legal reasons, must bring male and female athletics 
into parity. 
</P>
<P>
 A possibility being frankly considered: Kill football, the most expensive 
sport. On the one hand it has glamour and tradition on its side, not to mention 
the theoretical potential for making CSUN famous. But it's the sport at which 
CSUN is least likely ever to be among the best. Plenty of regional universities 
like Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach have survived its departure. And CSUN 
is not exactly football-crazy. Game attendance is usually about 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents will argue that sports add an intangible but important ingredient 
to the college experience, giving alumni a link with one another and the school 
and, on a more practical plane, making their alma mater slightly less obscure 
to strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the students' call. They will listen to the arguments. They will weigh up 
their interests. They will peer into their wallets and their hearts, and they 
will exercise their democratic right accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Or will they?

NEW SUBWAY ROUTE COST ESTIMATES QUESTIONABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial "Break the Gridlock on Mass Transit for Valley" (Sept. 18) gave 
far too much credibility to the revised cost estimates for the proposed 
Burbank-Chandler subway/open trench route for the Red Line extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The claims that the subway/open trench proposal will cost only about $20 
million more than the monorail are highly dubious.One only needs to look at the 
experience of the Red Line construction through the Downtown, mid-Wilshire and 
Hollywood areas to see the massive credibility problems with that estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 What is more believable is the reporter's estimate of a minimum $250-million 
cost savings for the Ventura Freeway monorail over the Burbank-Chandler 
deep-bore subway. That is what I was referring to in the quote used in the 
editorial, "I am very glad that the (freeway route's) cost savings have been 
verified." 
</P>
<P>
 But the cost savings aren't the monorail's only advantage. A Valley subway 
would force residents to cope with a decade-long construction project, 
including the mining of over 2.2 million cubic yards of earth, the hauling of 
that soil through Valley neighborhoods to already overcrowded landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 What does the Valley itself want? Valley voters favored the Ventura Freeway 
alignment over the Red Line extension by a 5-1 margin. It is my hope my 
colleagues on the Metropolitan Transit Authority Board of Directors ratify that 
option on Oct. 26 when they are scheduled to decide on a route.

PARENT CENTERS NEED FREEDOM TO DEVELOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last several years, more than 70 parent centers have developed in the 
Los Angeles public schools. They are unique and in varying stages of 
development, representing the various communities and needs of the parents and 
families as they evolve from the grass roots up. According to your article 
"Unwelcome Support" (Aug. 24), LAUSD feels parent centers should be expanded to 
all schools and standardized so that they are alike. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Resource Connection is an advocacy group for families and 
children at risk in California. Our research has led us to many of these family 
centers, where over two years we have observed and interviewed parents, 
teachers, principals and social service agencies. We are convinced that parent 
centers empower parents and this empowerment leads directly to an improvement 
in the academic and social success of their children and to improved behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 This success is precisely because they are unique and meet the needs of 
families. Each center expands its programs as more parents are attracted and 
they in turn empower each other. The beauty of this is that children are 
benefiting because the whole family is positively involved at school. 
Standardization would be unwise and counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 We enthusiastically support the idea of all schools having parent centers, and 
the dissemination of information to every parent is a great idea. But if the 
LAUSD will study the results of these gems that already exist in the district, 
especially in the San Fernando Valley, it will have to conclude that they 
should expand and build on what they have already. This would be consistent 
with the district's enthusiastic adoption of the LEARN program and the state's 
charter school movement. 
</P>
<P>
 If parent involvement is really desired, let's give it a real chance.

POLICE OFFICER DESERVES EXTRA-SPECIAL PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Above and Beyond" should be police Officer Mitch Windsor's slogan rather than 
"Protect & Serve." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 3 we had a blowout and were parked on Kester Avenue in Sherman Oaks 
awaiting the arrival of the Auto Club when Officer Windsor drove past on his 
motorcycle.He glanced over and then made a U-turn and came back to inquire 
about our situation. 
</P>
<P>
 He insisted upon removing the blown tire and replacing it with the spare. 
Despite our protestations he proceeded to do just that and was almost finished 
when the Auto Club arrived. His concern over our situation and his efforts on 
our behalf were certainly more than expected, and we truly commend him for his 
help.

WHAT U.S. CONGRESS SHOULD DO TO KEEP OUR STREETS SAFE; THE COMPREHENSIVE AND 
EFFECTIVE ANTI-CRIME ACT RECENTLY PASSED SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE THAT VIOLENT 
CRIME WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY C. BEILENSON

<TEXT>
<P>
 The most fundamental right that government owes its citizens is personal 
safety. This summer, Congress took an important step in protecting that right 
by passing the toughest and most effective federal anti-crime measure ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act will go a long way toward 
helping the states and local governments make streets and neighborhoods safer, 
increasing their ability to enforce our laws and to punish those who commit 
violent crimes. Although law enforcement is and should remain primarily a state 
and local responsibility, the severity of the crisis warrants federal 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 This comprehensive act will help provide: 
</P>
<P>
 * One hundred thousand more police officers in our neighborhoods. Grants will 
help provide 20% more cops patrolling neighborhoods, responding to community 
concerns and getting criminals off the streets. Putting more police in troubled 
neighborhoods is the most effective way the federal government can help make 
neighborhoods crime-free. 
</P>
<P>
 * More police officers with better education and training. A new Police Corps 
program will provide college scholarships for students who agree to serve as 
law enforcement officers for at least four years. Scholarships will be 
available to men and women already serving as police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 * More federal crime fighters. The Border Patrol will hire 4,000 more agents 
over the next four years. The bill also provides for hundreds of additional 
agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also requires tougher sentences for violent criminals and more prisons 
to put them in: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Three-Strikes-and-You're-Out" will keep career violent offenders in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The law mandates life imprisonment for anyone convicted of a third violent 
felony when the last one is a federal offense. Statistics indicate that a very 
small percentage of criminals account for a large percentage of violent crimes 
-- and that they spend shockingly little time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 * States will receive $9 billion to keep violent criminals behind bars and to 
repay the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 Grants will help states build necessary prisons. A large portion of those 
funds are for states that impose rigorous standards for jailing violent 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 As the result of an amendment I offered to the bill, $1.8 billion of these 
funds will be used to reimburse states and local governments for the costs of 
imprisoning criminal illegal aliens. California will receive the largest single 
payment, meaning a savings to California taxpayers of about$750 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Juveniles will be punished according to the crimes they commit. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, offenders as young as 13 can be tried as adults for 
certain violent crimes if the prosecutor and the presiding judge agree. 
Alternative incarceration approaches for juveniles, such as boot camps to 
provide discipline and training, are also a part of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug offenders will receive substance-abuse treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 To help reduce the number of people incarcerated for nonviolent crimes, 
special Drug Court programs will provide rehabilitation and close monitoring of 
first-time or nonviolent drug offenders. More federal and state inmates will 
receive intensive treatment during their incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 60% of violent crime is associated with drug use. Addicts commit 15 
times as many robberies and 20 times as many burglaries as criminals not on 
drugs. Approximately 70% of the nation's 1.4 million prisoners have drug 
problems, but only 1% of federal inmates and about 15% of state prisoners 
receive adequate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Properly run prison-based anti-drug programs have produced good results: The 
rearrest rate for prisoners who undertake them is about one-third the rate for 
those who do not. And treatment in prison is a bargain. Housing one inmate one 
year costs $28,000; adding full drug treatment, about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the new law provides more prevention to stop crime before it happens: 
</P>
<P>
 * Assault weapons and gun sales to juveniles are banned. The bill bans 19 
semiautomatic weapons -- the weapons of choice of drug dealers, gang members 
and mass murderers. It also prohibits sales of guns to minors and prohibits 
minors from carrying handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 * Young people will be steered away from crime and gang membership. To deter 
children and youths living in high-crime areas from embarking upon a life of 
crime, intensive programs are established or expanded to educate youths, find 
them jobs and provide sports activities and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Efforts to stop domestic violence will be expanded. Additional federal 
resources will be available to combat sexual and domestic violence through 
education, law enforcement training and a national domestic violence hot line. 
Gender-based violence will now be a federal civil-rights violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, crime remains the No. 1 concern for most Americans. While 
local and state governments remain responsible, as they should, for enforcing 
most of our criminal laws, it is entirely appropriate that the federal 
government make additional resources available and send a strong message that 
violent crime will not be tolerated. The $30 billion that Congress has just 
voted is an appropriate and measured response to the widely held belief that 
this is a problem that we need to attack with all our resources.

SUBWAY OR MONORAIL? DEBATING THE MERITS OF VALLEY TRANSIT PROPOSALS; PUTTING

INTERESTS AND DECIDE ONCE AND FOR ALL WHO SPEAKS FOR THE REGION.

 Declaring itself in favor of a Valley east-west subway may have been 
politically correct for the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors, considering 
some of the powerful industry groups that also support this technology. But as 
one of 102,810 people who voted for a monorail type technology on the Ventura 
Freeway in the June, 1990, advisory election, I feel betrayed by this 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 As we approach an Oct. 26 decision by directors of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, the city is learning about faulty materials, 
contractor short cuts and lack of safety precautions in Hollywood subway 
building. The federal government has put a hold on funds for subway 
construction until it is convinced MTA has solved the tunneling problems there. 
</P>
<P>
 And that isn't the only problem with subways. 
</P>
<P>
 Practically as the realtors' association was endorsing one for the Valley a 
few weeks ago, the MTA staff was releasing a report describing a so-called 
"open air" subway on the Southern Pacific's Chandler and Burbank boulevards 
right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 The realtors' group said the Burbank-Chandler line "is more feasible and will 
be less disruptive to residential areas." Of course, an "open air" subway, 
which would be closer to grade than a full subway, would be less expensive, but 
it would also be less environmentally sound and much more disruptive. And I 
believe it would violate the state law mandating a subway if that route is 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA staff has desperately tried to undermine the concept of a monorail on the 
Ventura Freeway since its inception. The primary pro-monorail argument has 
always been the cost difference between the technologies, and MTA staff has 
continually overstated a monorail's cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of an inferior "open air subway" is a ploy to reduce the cost of a 
subway and allow MTA to build on the railroad right of way, for which it 
foolishly paid nearly $120 million in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I don't think the voters in the San Fernando Valley are nearly as 
stupid as some of our elected officials and the MTA staff think they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, in the advisory vote in 1990 102,810 Valley voters chose the 
monorail system on the Ventura Freeway versus 22,044 voters in favor of a 
subway. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in favor of the subway argue that the people voting for monorail did not 
know what they were voting for. 
</P>
<P>
 But did the handful of people voting for subway know of the water leaks in the 
tunnels and problems that have caused the MTA to cease tunneling in Hollywood 
pending an independent investigation into why sidewalks and buildings along 
Hollywood Boulevard were being undermined? 
</P>
<P>
 Would the handful who voted for subway do so today if they knew of the 10 
whistle-blower lawsuits filed against the MTA and its contractors in the last 
three years alleging fraud, abuse and corruption during subway construction? 
</P>
<P>
 To those who still argue that the monorail voters did not know what they were 
voting for, I have a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not place the issue on the November ballot in the San Fernando Valley? 
This will take our elected officials off the hook and will decide, once and for 
all, who really speaks for our Valley. The cost of one more referendum would be 
far less than the cost of the wrong choice for rapid transit that we and our 
children will have to live with forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Do I think our officials will accept the challenge and place this referendum 
on the November ballot? Of course not! 
</P>
<P>
 The politically correct thing for them and the realtors' association to do is 
to follow the wishes of certain special interest groups and a handful of people 
who chose subway against monorail, while ignoring the wishes of the general 
public.

 As we approach a decision over the east-west Valley rail alignment, it is 
important to remind ourselves of the history of this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The state established the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build an 
L.A. mass-transit rail network to provide for growth and reduce congestion, 
dependence on foreign fossil fuels and emissions. It was to be financed by a 
half-cent sales tax (Proposition A, 1980), with other sources such as federal 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the MTA concluded its evaluation for the best location for a Valley 
transit line and selected the Southern Pacific's Burbank and Chandler 
boulevards alignment from North Hollywood to Warner Center. MTA purchased the 
right of way and land for $159 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A local newspaper conducted a biased readers' survey to determine whether the 
people of the Valley were interested in a "Disneyland-style monorail," if the 
taxpayers could save half a billion . The results were interpreted as a mandate 
for monorail, and the freeway alignment for an elevated train was adopted by 
MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 The same misapprehensions surrounded the 1990 Valley advisory election which 
gave a 48% plurality to a "monorail" system. In fact it would in all likelihood 
not be a monorail but rather a multitracked elevated train bed -- an "el." 
</P>
<P>
 The official findings since 1992 have concluded that an elevated train will 
not save $500,000. Nor is the proposed rail a monorail like Disneyland's. What 
has been verified by the MTA and its contractors is that the freeway alignment 
will actually cost the taxpayers over $200 million more than the 
Burbank-Chandler alignment. MTA will be required by law to reimburse the state 
approximately $80 million for the state's unused contribution. That should be 
added to the $159 million spent on the Burbank-Chandler right of way. This 
money is already spent, regardless of which alignment is chosen, but MTA added 
the cost only to the subway's. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's compare the verified facts of the two proposals. The freeway alignment 
is through affluent areas where ridership will be low. It would be obtrusive, 
with 20-foot sound walls, 75-foot towers and no more trees. It would not 
interface with any other transit system and might be unsafe. We know the 
earthquake Jan. 17 was real. A future earthquake could mean the loss of both 
the freeway and the rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for the Burbank-Chandler alignment addresses the same issues with 
differing results. This alignment is more central to the needs of the Valley. A 
rider could go to or from Warner Center and downtown L.A. and all points in 
between without changing trains, which will increase ridership and reduce 
operating costs. Additionally, the passenger capacity of a Burbank-Chandler 
train is 17% greater than a freeway train. 
</P>
<P>
 From a safety perspective, we have the histories of the Bay Area and Mexico 
City. We still see images of the Nimitz Freeway and the Bay Bridge in ruins, 
yet both cities' subways remained fully operational immediately after the 
quakes. They were the only form of transportation not disrupted. If there is a 
quake when you're a commuter, a subway is where you want to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The people and businesses of the San Fernando Valley have studied this issue 
at length. Virtually every homeowners' group, business group and elected 
official at every level through the proposed areas are united in support for 
the Burbank-Chandler alignment. The Valley knows what it wants and needs for a 
viable future! Is the MTA board listening?

 The most fundamental duty of any responsible government is public safety. No 
society can prosper, no business can operate without a basic level of personal 
security. In too many neighborhoods, however, people are trapped behind locked 
gates and afraid to open the front door. Middle-class residents of the San 
Fernando Valley and their children should not have to live like this. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not view poverty and social inequality as legitimate causes of criminal 
behavior, although we should certainly work to reduce such conditions. Poor 
people too know the difference between right and wrong and should be held to 
it. The best preventive program is not midnight basketball (which merely means 
your house may now be burgled at 2 a.m.) but a proper family, good values and a 
stake in the community through neighborhood schools and homeownership.

 I am sorry for the maladjusted youth who is now a criminal. But my first 
concern is for the safety of law-abiding citizens. My wife should be able to 
drive to the market without worrying about her safety. My daughter should be 
able to go to school and focus on her education. 
</P>
<P>
 I propose specific steps we can and should take to combat crime: 
</P>
<P>
 * Abolish parole. We should simply abolish parole and time off for good 
behavior (criminals are in jail because of their bad behavior). Keeping 
criminals in jail may be expensive, but letting them out causes even more 
damage. A huge proportion of crimes are committed by a small group of repeat 
offenders who should be kept locked up. Sometimes "three strikes" may be too 
many if the second or third strike might be you or your family. 
</P>
<P>
 * Address juvenile crime. Juveniles should be treated like adults if they 
commit adult crimes. It is also high time we fought gangs as what they are -- 
organized crime -- with much greater cooperation between local law enforcement 
and federalagencies. To reduce juvenile crime in the first place, we need 
welfare reform and a renewed stress on teaching children right from wrong and 
responsibility for individual behavior. Just as we must reform the criminal 
justice system to discipline, we must reform the social and school systems to 
instill values. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reform criminal law. Federal law should be changed so that convicted 
murderers and other criminals can no longer block justice with endless appeals 
and delays. There is something fundamentally wrong with a system that excuses 
the Menendez brothers and turns the O. J. Simpson case into a circus. We need 
to focus on the search for truth, not procedural technicalities or bogus 
psychological arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make national security assets available to fight crime. We Americans spend 
$263 billion a year on national security, including equipment, computers and 
military police. Let's make some of those resources available to local law 
enforcement authorities if they want them. Before we send the Army to disarm 
bandits in Somalia and Haiti, maybe we ought to do the same here. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stop illegal immigration. A quarter of California's violent felons are 
illegal aliens. Although my opponent, Anthony Beilenson, is now claiming credit 
for the provision in the recent crime bill to reimburse California for their 
costs, the proposal came from me in the governor's office, and Beilenson gave 
it away by agreeing to delay reimbursement until the year 2004. In fact, he 
recently introduced legislation calling for sensitivity training for the Border 
Patrol and voted against a tracking system for illegal alien felons and 
requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the "crime bill" just passed in Congress will make none of 
these needed changes. The "100,000 police" the bill promises to put on the 
street are a fiction, since the federal funding is only a 20% matching grant. 
The bill's greatest failure is its refusal to impose real gun control -- 
mandatory minimum sentences for the use of a gun in a crime. My opponent voted 
against it at the same time he was voting for the use of racial quotas in the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, our congressman voted against every meaningful amendment to the crime 
bill that would have given it real teeth, including the death penalty for 
murders committed during a sexual assault and increased sentences for assaults 
on the elderly. Contrary to what he is now telling us, the incumbent has a long 
record of being soft on crime. He opposes the death penalty, supported Rose 
Bird and according to the Los Angeles Times "consistently gets good reviews 
from such left-leaning groups as . . . the ACLU." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, I campaigned against Rose Bird, have sought vigorous and fair 
enforcement of the death penalty and have a long record of advocating tougher 
controls on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result I have been endorsed by Sheriff Sherman Block, the California 
State Police, the California Reserve Peace Officers Assn., former L.A. Police 
Chief Ed Davis, Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, former Los 
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian and anti-gang activist Chuck 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime will be my No. 1 focus in Congress. This is the area of greatest 
difference between myself and the incumbent. In the past, he has said that 
crime is a state problem. I think it's everyone's problem until we can walk 
down the street and our kids can go to school without fear of violence.

ANALYSIS; TRACK, FIELD ARE KEY CHIP IN '96 HAND OF OLYMPIC POKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND and AND RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the 1996 Summer Olympics still nearly two years away, it is curious that 
the schedules for competition in all sports but the flagship event, track and 
field, have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody had to be last, I guess," said Amadeo Francis of Puerto Rico, a 
member of track's international federation committee in charge of scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 If only it was that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Although International Amateur Athletic Federation and Olympic organizers say 
the process takes time, it might also turn out that it takes money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the behind-the-scenes deal-making that often dictates Olympic movements, it 
appears that IAAF President Primo Nebiolo of Italy is using the Atlanta Games' 
track schedule as a pawn to bring in more money for his group and to boost the 
lagging popularity of his sport in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the IAAF Council must approve the track schedule, Nebiolo has the 
final say. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebiolo is saying that the finals, which draw wide television audiences, might 
be scheduled for prime time in Europe. That would put them on in the heat of 
the Georgia afternoon, prime time for neither the athletes nor the TV-viewing 
public in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebiolo apparently is hoping to push NBC, which has the U.S. television rights 
to the Games, into agreeing to televise more of other IAAF events at higher 
rates if the Olympic finals are moved into U.S. prime time. That would mean 
more money for IAAF coffers, more television coverage from NBC and, presumably, 
rejuvenation of U.S. track interest. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sports Intern, a German publication, Nebiolo also wants the 
Atlanta Committee of the Olympic Games (ACOG) to pay more for a proposed 
expanded schedule. ACOG is considering holding track and field events over nine 
or 10 days, an increase from the eight-day program used in previous Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The publication reported that an extra day of track competition would yield at 
least $2.5 million extra in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebiolo is arguing that NBC will benefit from the increased track program and, 
thus, should pay more for coverage of the 1995 World Championships in Sweden, 
and guarantee coverage of the 1997 championships in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just cannot be that the 1995 World Championships are only worth very 
little, when one year later the Olympic track and field events are a big hit 
with the same program and same athletes," one IAAF Council member told Sport 
Intern. 
</P>
<P>
 That Nebiolo would work to renew track interest in the United States indicates 
the IAAF's lack of confidence in USA Track & Field, the sport's national 
governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 The IAAF has long been concerned about USA track's ineffectiveness against the 
decline of the sport in a nation that produces some of the world's best 
athletes, but barely acknowledges it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebiolo sees the Atlanta Games as an opportunity to market the sport here. The 
fallout could be the downfall of longtime USA track leader Ollan Cassell, who 
has a cool relationship with Nebiolo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad that the state of track and field as a sport has fallen so low in 
the United States that the IAAF has to target us as a developing nation in 
terms of trying to build popularity and interest," said Craig Masback, a former 
Olympic runner and television commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not formally positioned to challenge Cassell, USA track's executive 
director, Masback is being mentioned as a possible replacement if Nebiolo is 
successful in upsetting the balance of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Such rumblings occur periodically in track, upon which Cassell has held a firm 
grip for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Nebiolo is behind the campaign, a coup might have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to work with the U.S. federation," Nebiolo said last August in 
Paris. "We have offered our assistance many times, but they have never 
responded." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassell said USA track has long welcomed outside assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it has to be in coordination here with what we're doing," he said from 
his Indianapolis office. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebiolo apparently has not involved Cassell, an IAAF vice president, in his 
attempts to use Atlanta's track schedule as leverage for increased marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States has no marketing plan whatsoever," Masback said. "The IAAF 
has to take aggressive steps to develop a plan for television, sponsorships and 
marketing. There is no vision whatsoever nationally." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassell disagrees. He said USA track has planned some programs for the next 
two years that will coincide with the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassell is well aware of IAAF efforts to undermine his leadership. But he said 
he is not concerned about the recent developments. 
</P>
<P>
 IAAF involvement in the United States is not unprecedented. When the New York 
Games were about to fold, IAAF money helped keep them afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nebiolo is a formidable opponent. If his manipulations are successful, it 
would not be the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 He used the track schedule for the Seoul Olympics to get $20 million from 
Korean organizers, who were afraid that their $500-million American television 
contract would be sabotaged if they did not meet the IAAF president's demands, 
according to the book, "Dishonored Games," by Vyv Simson and Andrew Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
 An Atlanta organizer characterized the Seoul situation as tantamount to 
blackmail, but declined to comment on whether it was happening again with the 
'96 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always things going on (with) the people at the top of the Olympic 
family," an IAAF official told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Francis, an executive assistant to the governor of the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, said his three-member delegation hopes to have a proposal 
before the IAAF Council when it meets Nov. 29 in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 ACOG has made 19 revisions of the track schedule since January, and David 
Maggard, director of competitions, is satisfied with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary and a few final events are scheduled for morning sessions, from 9 
a.m. to noon. Most of the finals will be held in the evening, from 7:30 to 10 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 If Nebiolo approves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're not just fighting here in the United States for track and 
field, but worldwide," Cassell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in our best interest to do what is best for us. If we can use (the 
schedule) some way to get NBC to give (us) more coverage and it fits within the 
regulations of the IOC and ACOG, then I see nothing wrong with it."

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; A SON'S DUTY; LAN QUOC NGUYEN LEFT VIETNAM BEHIND. BUT HE 
WILL NEVER ESCAPE THE OBLIGATION HE FEELS TO HELP REFUGEES AND PROVIDE FOR HIS 
PARENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers office is almost invisible, 
tucked into a far corner of a strip mall on the edge of Little Saigon. Inside, 
it is spare, decorated only with posters extolling human rights and postcards 
painted by Vietnamese refugees living in Asian detention camps. 
</P>
<P>
 On a hot Sunday, Lan Quoc Nguyen is about to settle in for a typical day's 
work as the supervising attorney for the Southern California branch of LAVAS. 
He and his staff will again pick up the often frustrating and labyrinthine job 
of reviewing case after case of a refugee who desperately wants asylum in a 
country -- any country. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, who escaped Vietnam by boat with his family and spent time in a 
Malaysian detention camp, believes this is his moral obligation. On top of his 
general law practice, he puts in 30 to 40 hours a week at LAVAS. And he 
volunteers even more time as a guest on radio and TV shows broadcast to the 
Vietnamese-speaking population in central Orange County, tailoring legal advice 
on everything from property law to traffic violations for an audience 
unfamiliar with federal and state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no sense, however, that Nguyen is a careerist. His ground-floor 
Tustin law office is small, neat and functional -- hardly the sort of sanctum 
designed to impress or intimidate. He dresses neatly but without flash. And 
although his passions are genuine, he has lived with them for so long -- 
through years of his own persecution and confinement -- that he speaks in 
matter-of-fact tones, with conviction but without missionary zeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Between his high-profile pro bono work and his commitment to upholding 
Vietnamese tradition by living with and supporting his elderly parents in 
Westminster, Nguyen says, smiling, that he is barely making it. "But I'm happy. 
That's more important. I spend long hours, but I think it's worth it. I do feel 
I have an obligation to the community to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he turned 14, life in Saigon had become intolerable for Nguyen and 
his family. It was 1979, and his father, a teacher, and oldest brother, a 
former soldier, were interned in "re-education camps." 
</P>
<P>
 "Security was tight in the Vietnamese government at the time, and persecution 
was rampant," Nguyen says. "Any intellectual family couldn't do anything, and 
we had a black mark on our history because of (supposed political activities) 
by other members of the family. We were always under surveillance by the 
authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the family planned to escape by boat, but time and time again the 
attempts failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had to do everything secretly," Nguyen says. "Get a boat, find petroleum, 
get food and water, find people you could really trust. Some of the people 
would just rip you off and run, and you couldn't go to the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven times the plans went awry before the Nguyens could even get to a boat. 
Family members were turned in to authorities, jailed and later released. 
Finally, on the eighth try, the seven boys and their mother sailed away on a 
small boat with several other families. 
</P>
<P>
 During seven days at sea, they ran out of fuel and water before taking on 
other refugees from a smaller boat with an abundance of both. After weathering 
a fierce storm, the boat landed at Malaysia. The Nguyens were immediately 
processed into a detention camp, where they lived for 10 months before 
transferring to a transit camp in Kuala Lampur. After two months there, they 
emigrated to the United States with the help of sponsors in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's father was finally released in 1990 from the camp in Vietnam (the 
oldest brother had escaped with the others), but the government refused to 
allow him to join his family. He got a tourist visa to East Germany at about 
the time the Berlin Wall came down, Nguyen says. "When he arrived there he 
crossed into West Berlin, went to the nearest American embassy and applied for 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I passed the bar, he was my first client. I was scared to death, because 
if I lost that case I didn't know what I was going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, a graduate of Hastings Law School in San Francisco, won his father's 
case. And with the family reunited, he was free to "work fully on behalf of 
refugees without worrying about retaliation against (my family) by the 
Vietnamese government." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's experience as a refugee "is what I think drives him," says Van Tran, 
who also works at LAVAS. "He's seen as very committed, a very bright attorney 
who has a deep concern for the welfare of the refugees -- his own people -- as 
well as the community welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lan is a person with a conscience, and that's what I find appealing about 
him. He doesn't forget his roots as a boat person. He's definitely one of the 
key members of the future generation of Vietnamese Americans in this community, 
and we can expect him to contribute more as the years go by." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lam, mayor pro tem of Westminster and the first Vietnamese American 
elected to public office in the United States, calls Nguyen's commitment to pro 
bono work amazing. "He could be making a much better living at (his practice), 
but he spends so much time at LAVAS. I really credit him for that. He has a lot 
of passion and compassion. He's already earned the respect and affection of the 
community here." 
</P>
<P>
 The need for refugee advocacy, Nguyen says, is more urgent than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The asylum-seekers, he says, would almost surely face persecution in Vietnam 
as political undesirables. And under a deadline agreed upon by the United 
Nations High Commission for Refugees and U.N. member nations, the camps will 
close at the end of this year unless an extension is granted. Thousands of 
refugees may face forced repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunger strikes in protest of the policy are now common in the Asian camps, he 
says. Some of the about 50,000 refugees there, believing themselves beyond 
hope, have resorted to self-immolation, hanging or poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of them would rather die than return to Vietnam," Nguyen says. "Legal 
abuse over there is so rampant. Under international law, they're no longer 
recognized as official refugees. It's an unfair rejection of their refugee 
status. So it's not really an immigration problem now; it's a human rights 
problem. That's where we come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen and his staff at the Westminster office of LAVAS, which is 
headquartered in Virginia, have confronted massive and sometimes impenetrable 
bureaucracies on behalf of about 230 clients with contacts in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially," Nguyen says, "we work on a specific person, but along the way 
we also engage in some (general) advocacy, speak out on the part of refugees 
and asylum-seekers." 
</P>
<P>
 The process most often begins, he says, when someone comes to the office to 
ask for help in getting a friend or relative out of a camp. 
</P>
<P>
 If Nguyen determines a case has promise, he files appeals for refugee status 
with the review board in the country where the asylum-seeker is being detained, 
with the U.N. High Commission for Refugees or with the U.S. State Department, 
depending on how far previous appeals have gotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen and his half a dozen associates only handle cases that have been 
rejected at least once. They win about 80% of the cases they take on in the 
Hong Kong camp and about 45% in the Philippines camp. The percentages vary 
among countries, Nguyen says, because some authorities make their job easier 
than others. 
</P>
<P>
 To see for himself how things work, Nguyen traveled at his own expense to the 
Philippine detention camp known as Palawan in 1992. Joining international 
volunteers there, he began processing cases from the day of his arrival, often 
working outdoors in stiflingly hot and humid weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palawan is one of the best camps in the region," he says, "but the living 
conditions are still very difficult. Families live in a very small space: 12 
feet square for a family of three or four, with all the facilities there. They 
cook there, and much of the food is rotten. All communications with the outside 
world are censored. There's no work, and people have nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is Wednesday morning, and Nguyen is half an hour from his departure to Long 
Beach, where he is due in court. At the moment, however, he is wedged into a 
corner of a tiny studio at the offices of Little Saigon Radio and Television in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 During his weekly call-in show from 9:30 to 10 on KWIZ (96.7 FM), he usually 
answers about 20 calls on legal matters. On this day, he will also explain in 
Vietnamese how property taxes work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be talking about how people can apply for a reduction on their 
property taxes," he says. "A lot of people don't know they can do that. Next 
week, I'm going to talk about what to do if people get stopped for a DUI." 
</P>
<P>
 He gets no pay for the radio show or for the 15-minute legal advice TV spot he 
does biweekly on KRCA Channel 62. In the eight months since their start-up, 
they have become among the stations' most popular shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find his programs very, very educational," says LAVAS co-worker Tran. 
"There's a great need for that in our community because . . . many of us are 
newly arrived, and we may be intimidated by the legal system here." 
</P>
<P>
 Diem Do, who hosts shows on Little Saigon Radio and Television dealing with 
youth and human rights issues, says he and Nguyen often exchange ideas about 
their programs and occasionally appear together. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen has come a long way, Do says, and many of his listeners can relate to 
that. "He came with nothing, had lost everything, came to a strange land not 
knowing the language, being on the bottom of society, having to fight his way 
up. He has a lot of good ideas, and he's a man with a good heart. I think what 
he's been through helps him relate better to a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen says he enjoys his time in the broadcast booth, partly because it 
involves research. "I can't just get a lot of this stuff off the top of my 
head. It helps me learn." 
</P>
<P>
 That thirst for knowledge, and the passion to use it, drove Nguyen even before 
his arrival in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in the camp," he says, "I always had a desire to become one of 
those people who helped. It's very emotional for a boat person to return to a 
camp and do that. During my time in the camp, my education was still in my 
mind. And when I was in law school, I did research in international law. The 
refugees were my major concern." 
</P>
<P>
 And will continue to be, Nguyen says: "Even though they say they're closing 
the camps, there may be some people still there. So we'll continue to work." 
</P>
<P>
 And Nguyen will continue to divide his time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's really intelligent," Do says, "and he could be really successful in 
his (private law practice), but he diverts his time and energy to so many other 
things. He's managed to find the time to do that. Money is not the only thing 
in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all that he gives back to the community is what really enriches his 
life." Lan Quoc Nguyen

<P>
 Age: 30 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Family: Single. One of seven sons of Hoi Thuc Nguyen and Lan Thi Pham, whom he

<P>
 On bringing his father to the United States: "When I passed the bar, he was my 
first client. I was scared to death, because if I lost that case I didn't know 
what I was going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 On reuniting with his father after an 11-year separation: "My mother and 
brothers went through a lot, but we didn't know what he went through during 
those years. We had to fill each other in. It took a long time to get used to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 On his commitment to helping asylum-seekers: "I spend long hours, but I think 
it's worth it. I do feel I have an obligation to the community to do this."

HOT PROPERTY: 'ACE' IS WILD ON PALISADES HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 JIM CARREY, the rubber-faced comic who became a superstar earlier this year 
with "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" and "The Mask," has purchased a Pacific 
Palisades home for $4 million, including furnishings, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey, who was an ensemble member of Fox TV's sketch comedy show "In Living 
Color" when he signed to star in the two movies at less than $500,000 each, is 
now known in Hollywood as "the $7-million man" because that is what he is 
getting for his next film, "Dumb and Dumber," a buddy comedy due out in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to start shooting a sequel to "Ace Ventura" in January, Carrey is 
now filming "Batman Forever," in which he plays the Riddler, a villain played 
mainly by Frank Gorshin but also by John Astin in the 1960s TV series. Val 
Kilmer plays Batman in the movie, which is being shot in New York and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Canada, Carrey, 32, has been a stand-up comedian since he was 15 and 
performed at a comedy club in Toronto to help his family make ends meet. When 
he was 19, he moved to Los Angeles. Before buying his Pacific Palisades home, 
Carrey, who is going through divorce and has a daughter from that marriage, was 
living in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 His new home has two master suites, chauffeur's quarters, a tennis court, 
pool, two spas, a lagoon, wading pool, waterfall and pool house with a 
big-screen TV and sauna. The house is on an acre, behind gates with canyon 
views. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which has seven bedrooms in 11,000 square feet, was built in the 
1950s but was gutted and rehabbed about five years ago. The home had been on 
the market for a few years, at first in the $6-million range, sources say. The 
last asking price was just under $4.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 RALPH MACCHIO, who starred in "The Karate Kid" films (1984-1989) and played 
Bill Gambini in "My Cousin Vinny" (1992), has leased a Studio City home at 
$5,000 a month, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Macchio, who lives in New York with his wife, Phyllis, and their daughter, is 
in town working on the NBC sitcom "The Ties That Bind," due to air in January. 
In the series, Macchio, 31, co-stars with Anita Barone as young newlyweds 
dealing with their mostly single friends and intrusive in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Macchio also appeared in the movie "Naked in New York," released earlier this 
year, and starred in the 1993 TV movie "The Last P.O.W.? The Bobby Garwood 
Story." 
</P>
<P>
 The leased house has four bedrooms in 3,500 square feet. It was built in the 
1940s but was recently renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 Macchio was represented in the short-term lease by Rosanna Locke of Fred 
Sands' Brentwood office, and the lessors were represented by Judy Lyon of Fred 
Sands' Studio City office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holmby Hills home of Academy Award-winning composer HENRY MANCINI, who 
died in June at the age of 70, and his wife, GINNY, has been put on the market 
at $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A Golden Globe Award and Lifetime Grammy Achievement Award winner, Henry 
Mancini won four Oscars, for the songs "Moon River" and "Days of Wine and 
Roses" and the scores of "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and "Victor/Victoria." 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 25 new songs last spring for the musical version of 
"Victor/Victoria," which is expected to open on Broadway in March. The musical 
adaptation of Blake Edwards' 1982 movie will be directed by Edwards, and it 
will star Julie Andrews, who also starred in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mancinis' home was built for them in 1980 and is about 10,000 square feet 
in size with a tennis court, all behind gates. June Scott of June Scott 
Estates, a Jon Douglas Co., has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 Philanthropist and nightclub owner ALBERT GERSTEN has listed his Malibu home 
for sale at $2.95 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He was going to build a house for himself and his fiance, Camilla Bennett, in 
South Beach, Fla., where he owned some land, but he decided, instead, to build 
on a site he owns in Malibu and to sell his existing home in Malibu, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Gersten is co-owner of the Gate, a nearly 2-year-old, English manor-style club 
on La Cienega in Los Angeles, where La Cage aux Folles, and its female 
impersonators, operated for many years. He also helped finance construction of 
Gersten Pavilion, the Loyola Marymount University gym where basketball star 
Hank Gathers collapsed two hours before dying in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Gersten bought his Malibu home a year ago for nearly $2.7 million, then put 
$600,000 into it, adding a sculpted rock spa and other features, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-story, Cape Cod-style house, which is on a promontory overlooking 
Escondido Beach, has three bedrooms and a maid's quarters in 3,500 square feet. 
It is listed with Paul Czako of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor CHRISTOPHER MURRAY, son of actor Don Murray and actress Hope Lange, has 
purchased a 4,500-square-foot getaway home on 2.5 acres in Sonoma for just 
under $500,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Murray, in his late 30s, lives in a 2,500-square-foot, Malibu 
home, which he built himself in 1988. He recently completed work on "Just 
Cause," in which he appears with Sean Connery, Laurence Fishburne and Kate 
Capshaw. He was also in "The Pelican Brief" (1993).

YOUR MORTGAGE; UNDISCLOSED FEES SPARK TRUTH-IN-LENDING BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 The $226 in undisclosed fees that Marta Rodash was charged at her home 
mortgage closing have triggered a Capitol Hill "truth-in-lending" brouhaha that 
could ultimately touch thousands of consumers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 It could also cost Rodash -- who has multiple sclerosis and lives on 
disability payments -- her house, plus tens of thousands of dollars in legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the story and what it might mean to you. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago Rodash needed money for medical treatments that she otherwise 
couldn't afford on her $500-a-month disability income. To raise the cash, she 
refinanced her home in Miami for $102,000 and netted about $11,000 in cash. 
That was enough, Rodash calculated, to finance a trip to a medical clinic in 
Germany that specializes in multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 What she didn't focus on sufficiently, she now concedes, were the terms of her 
refinanced mortgage: Monthly payments of $914, nearly double her income and 
$7,600 in settlement charges -- including four points on the loan. (A point is 
equal to 1% of the amount borrowed.) 
</P>
<P>
 Since she couldn't afford the monthly payments, Rodash quickly slipped into 
default. The mortgage company began foreclosure proceedings, jeopardizing the 
last major asset Rodash possessed -- the $50,000 in equity she had in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightened about ending up on the street, she contacted Charles M. Baird, an 
attorney then working with the Miami neighborhood legal services program and 
now in private practice. Baird said he immediately recognized the mortgage to 
be a rip-off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should never have been made. It was outrageous," he said. "She absolutely 
did not qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 To forestall foreclosure, Baird scoured the loan documents for any legal basis 
to challenge the mortgage contract itself. In the end, all he could find was a 
seemingly minor technical violation. The mortgage company had not provided 
proper advance "finance charge" disclosure of just two of the many items that 
ultimately ended up on Rodash's settlement sheet: A $22 Federal Express fee for 
document delivery and a $204 Florida state tax on the lender that was passed on 
to the borrower. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Truth-in-Lending Act, Baird argued, the lender was required to 
include such charges in the "good faith estimate" it sent to Rodash three days 
after application. Its failure to do so opened it to a suit that would force 
rescission of the entire transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a federal district court ruled against Rodash, a federal appellate 
court reversed that decision earlier this year. The net effect was to send the 
case back to the lower court and to halt the foreclosure against Rodash. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the federal appellate court's decision has sent legal shock 
waves far beyond Miami. Mortgage lenders in half a dozen states have been 
slapped with truth-in-lending class action suits grounded on the same theory as 
Rodash's: Improper advance disclosure of even minuscule fees -- like Federal 
Express delivery charges -- may allow borrowers to challenge and unravel their 
refinance transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 With a three-year statute of limitations on truth-in-lending, the potential 
for a wave of suits "is nightmarish," in the words of one mortgage executive. 
"We could have people crawling out of the woodwork, claiming that we didn't 
properly disclose some $15 courier fee and wanting out of the deal. Hell, we 
never thought we had to disclose those fees as finance charges anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Some local attorneys, according to the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America, 
already are advertising that they will bail borrowers out of loans they don't 
like, using a truth-in-lending attack. One Boston law firm promised in a recent 
mailing to consumers that "if you were charged fees for overnight mail . . . or 
couriers or any other delivery fees, you are probably entitled to money damages 
under the federal Truth-in-Lending Act." 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney in Jupiter, Fla., advertised in boldface type: "Do You Want Your 
Money Back?" and held out the possibility of "thousands of dollars in payment 
to you or increased equity in your home." 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent a wave of litigation -- and multimillion-dollar settlements -- 
mortgage industry leaders are asking Congress to amend the Truth-in-Lending Act 
to eliminate the requirement for "finance charge" disclosure of courier fees 
and certain state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 They have persuaded Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) to push an amendment to the 1994 
Federal Housing Act that would accomplish this not only prospectively -- on all 
future loans -- but retroactively as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Draft language circulated by Mack would apply to any court judgments "that are 
inconsistent" with the revised disclosure rule, if a lender requests such 
relief within a year after enactment. 
</P>
<P>
 This would not only throw land mines in the paths of class action suits being 
filed across the country, but would also nullify the decision in Marta Rodash's 
case. The foreclosure could then proceed, and Rodash could be held liable to 
pay her lender's legal bills -- tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who represent low-income homeowners, particularly legal services 
attorneys, are horrified at the prospect of Mack's amendment sailing through an 
election-bound Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truth-in-lending violations are often our most effective -- or only -- way to 
help keep people out of foreclosure," said Margot Saunders of the National 
Consumer Law Center. Before watering down the most important consumer 
protection law for mortgage borrowers, she said, Congress ought to at least 
hold public hearings and not be stampeded by lenders.

ROOTS VS. ROAMING; WHILE SOME WOULD RATHER JUST STAY PUT, OTHERS FIND MOVING 
OFFERS THEM A CHANCE TO SPREAD THEIR WINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Since moving into their Granada Hills home 33 years ago, the McGraths never 
considered leaving. In this long, rambling ranch house they raised seven 
children and have since opened the home's doors to 11 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things just wouldn't be the same if we moved into a different house," said 
Geraldine McGrath, 64, who has directed a nearby church choir for the past 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids couldn't bring their children here and tell them things like, 'This 
is where I sat when I did my homework,' " McGrath said. "I think an attachment 
to the past is important. You don't set down those kind of roots if you move 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jay Livingston, 60, the concept of filling up closet space in one house is 
a foreign one. The novelist and video writer, director and producer calls 
himself a nomad, and he has definitely earned the title. He has moved 45 times 
in his life, with no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the moves made me who I am -- an extrovert who can get along with just 
about anyone and adjust to almost any situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Livingston, who now lives in the South Bay, is married and has two children. 
As a child he lived, among other places, in New York City; on a dude ranch in 
Santa Maria, where he rode horseback to a one-room schoolhouse, and in a 
36-room English tudor mansion in Cleveland, Ohio, where he held his senior prom 
in the third-floor ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 During his adult life, Livingston and his wife and children have lived on the 
Palos Verdes peninsula, Upstate New York and on a tiny island off the coast of 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 While most people today don't move around as often as the Livingstons, 
changing residences has become a lot more common than in years past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty years ago families were much less mobile," said Joanie Heinemann, an 
individual and relationship therapist at Coastline Counseling Center in Newport 
Beach. "People would tend to stay in the same jobs, and some families would 
even pass homes down through the generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, for a variety of reasons, including job changes and transfers, divorce 
and the need for bigger or smaller living quarters, moving has become much more 
common. Every seven years the average Californian moves, according to the 
California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 What that number doesn't show is how moving and staying put affects families 
and the individuals in them. For some personality types, moving represents a 
chance to spread their wings and experience new things, while for others it is 
a stressful time and they would much rather stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not much research has focused on the subject, but moving affects us 
psychologically and emotionally much more than anyone gives credence," says 
Heinemann. "The fact that a move can and usually does affect our work/school 
and personal relationships makes it a major life stressor." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the move is an anticipated "step up," leaving a home represents a 
loss of a way of life, including daily routines, friends and neighbors. And 
when someone doesn't want to move, leaving a way of life can be very traumatic 
and potentially threatening to a person's emotional well being, Heinemann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance moves tend to be much harder and more disruptive than local 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving far away, out of the state or country, is very hard on people of all 
ages, because it represents pulling away from important ties in their life," 
Heinemann said. "Cross-country moves very often put distance between close 
families. It's hard to be directly involved in someone's life if he or she 
lives across the United States or world." 
</P>
<P>
 Local moves aren't as traumatic for most people, because friends and family 
are still close. Although for some individuals, even leaving a particular house 
and neighborhood can be hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying in the same house, on the other hand, can create familiarity and 
stability in a person's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an intense feeling of home you develop when you've lived in a house 
for some time," said Carlfred Broderick, who is a professor of sociology at USC 
and director of the school's Marriage and Family Therapy Training program. 
Originally from Long Beach, as an adult Broderick lived in various areas of the 
United States for 20 years, finally settling in his present Cerritos home 22 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I counsel people, and they tell me they've moved a lot, usually they 
consider moving a deficit, rather than an asset," Broderick said. "People will 
say the frequent moves hampered their sense of self-identity. Some people will 
even say that constant moves have caused them to avoid putting down roots 
anywhere; they don't unpack physically as well as emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 For other people, moving has its benefits. "For some people, moving away from 
family and friends puts excitement and change into their lives," Heinemann 
said. "They'll start new hobbies and develop new interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Staying in the same house year after year isn't for everyone. "Some people are 
risk-takers and thrive on change; they tend to get stagnant and bored with 
their surroundings if they don't make a move," Heinemann said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to how people react to moving, experts say the biggest factor is 
personality type. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are cosmopolitans -- they move more readily than others," 
Broderick said. They tend to be outgoing people who enjoy the excitement of 
newness. 
</P>
<P>
 Those people who don't enjoy moving thrive on security. They are often stable, 
and their home is their haven, Heinemann said. "People who stay put aren't 
usually risk-takers and don't adapt well to change," she said. "They will even 
become upset if a member of the neighborhood decides to move away. Many of 
these people are comfortable in their home, and they figure, why change things 
and move?" 
</P>
<P>
 For people who have lived in a home a long time, it is especially difficult to 
move, because who they are is rooted in their house and neighborhood, Broderick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Livingston's wife, Bernice, 51, feels that there is something about her 
personality that allows her to have moved 18 times in 22 years of marriage to 
Jay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a real joiner," said Bernice, who is an executive assistant. "I'm not 
a member of clubs and groups, which makes it easier for me to leave. Jay and I 
also aren't dependent on large groups of friends; we entertain each other. 
We're self-sufficient, self-contained and comfortable wherever we are. I've 
always had a wandering streak, which I think attracted me to Jay." 
</P>
<P>
 For Bernice, the experiences she has had in her many different homes created 
precious memories that she wouldn't have if she had stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Livingstons lived off the coast of Seattle on a tiny island with just 
three other houses, they had to travel to and from the island on a small boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winter days there are very short," she recalled. "It was pitch black 
outside when I'd take the kids on the boat over to school. As I returned to the 
island, the sun would start to rise over the water. It was the most beautiful 
thing I'd ever seen -- like a Hallmark card." 
</P>
<P>
 A house at Lake Sherwood in Thousand Oaks was Bernice and Jay's favorite. 
"That was a warm and lovely home that had a certain charm to it. We had a 
sailboat at Lake Sherwood's docks, and we used to picnic by the water," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people fancy themselves nomads, yet find out they don't have the 
wandering streak after all. Broderick calls them "boomerang movers." 
</P>
<P>
 "If people leave an area and within a two- to four-year period don't 
re-establish a network of intimacy and trust with friends, associates and 
community services, they are likely to return to what they consider home," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick has seen the boomerang phenomenon often. 
</P>
<P>
 "After retirement, many couples will sell their homes and buy a house in a 
remote area or even a motor home, without having any concept of what it is like 
to be rootless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a couple of months they realize they overestimated the value of clean 
air and long to see their grandchildren and neighbors. Or in the case of a 
motor home, they've had all the gypsy driven out of them, and they could care 
less if they ever see another campground again." 
</P>
<P>
 Betty, 61, a Huntington Beach woman who didn't want her last name used, knows 
what Broderick is talking about. Nine years ago she and her husband were each 
anticipating surgery that would make it difficult to climb stairs, so they 
decided to sell their two-story Westminster home of 25 years and move to a 
house they own near the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we thought the move would be ideal," said Betty, 61, who is living 
in Huntington Beach. "We thought we'd fix the house up a little, and it would 
be fun to live near the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality the house needed more renovation than they were willing to do at 
this time in their lives, and Betty's husband found that he didn't like the 
cold and damp weather at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, the couple misses their old house. So much so that they've 
attempted to buy the house back from the present owners three times, but were 
turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I are more traditional than we realized," she said. "That was 
more than a house -- it was a real home. We raised our two children in that 
house, and my daughter held her wedding reception in the back yard. Our whole 
life was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the couple is looking for a house in the area near their old home. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her experience, Betty has very definite advice for individuals who 
will be retiring: 
</P>
<P>
 "Carefully weigh the pluses and minuses of moving away. You may find that it 
would be better to stay put and enjoy your home. It's probably almost paid for, 
the taxes are low and you will be close to friends and familiar shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 Sociology professor Broderick agrees: 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are wise if they establish a continuity between retirement and 
working life. If you will be moving to a place after retirement, make certain 
you've already established it as a nourishing place -- not just an area you saw 
once on vacation or somewhere you're moving to just to get away from where you 
are. Many people are so anxious to retire and move that they forget to notice 
what they are leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving is generally more difficult when the move is away from family and 
friends, rather than closer, said Irene Goldenberg, a family psychologist at 
UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Moves that aren't a family decision are also hard, Goldenberg said. "It can be 
extremely stressful if the family has to move because dad got a better job." 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows this better than Lynn Kelley, 48, who found herself moving around 
the East Coast and out of the country for 16 years to further her husband's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we left California for New Jersey, I was only 19, and I felt like I was 
leaving my entire life behind. I was so miserable," said the registered nurse, 
who is now remarried and lives in Orange. "It was fall there, and we lived in 
cold and drafty student housing where I spent my first Thanksgiving without my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kelley and her husband befriended other married couples and she 
decorated so that their place was cozy, she says she never felt at home in that 
apartment or the following three homes that kept her away from California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we moved about every four or five years, everything we did in a house 
was for resale. There was never any sense of permanence," she said. "The first 
time we bought a new house, I remember thinking, I should be happy. This is a 
wonderful time. But I wasn't home. I wanted to be near my parents and share my 
four daughters with them. Instead, I wrote my mother nine-page letters every 
week because phone calls were too expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Although in retrospect Kelley says that she gained from her experiences living 
in different areas, she gave up more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving was broadening, but during some of those years, my grandmother, with 
whom I was very close, was alive. I regret losing the time I could have shared 
with her and my parents." 
</P>
<P>
 After 16 years of living away from California, in 1981 Kelley returned to 
Orange County and remembers clearly how she felt at her homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked off the plane and my two feet hit the ground, I was so happy to 
finally be home after all those years. I start crying now just thinking about 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent moving due to employment in the military or a large company can be 
very difficult for family members, agreed therapist Heinemann. "I've seen 
military and corporate wives who have no personal items and no pets. They are 
generally dissatisfied with life and have a lack of personal identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving a lot in childhood can also be traumatic, as Roxie Martin discovered 
when she moved nine times before 6th grade, with a mom who married three times 
during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just when I was getting settled in a school and starting to be accepted, we'd 
have to move," she said. "The first day of school I'd usually have to go to 
school by myself because my mother worked. I'd get really nervous and vomit. It 
was horrible. Although some kids might have learned to adapt quickly, it was 
not in my nature. I ended up standing in the corner with no one." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, 28, now has a 19-month-old daughter of her own, and although they have 
been renting for the past few years and saving for a house, it's very important 
to her that they settle in a home by the time her child starts school. 
</P>
<P>
 To Martin, the ideal childhood is like her husband Clay's. He was brought up 
in the same Texas house where his mother still lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay agrees. "I treasure the fact that I was able to grow up in the same 
neighborhood and go to the same schools," says the 33-year-old Orange County 
urban forester. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I brought Roxie back to my house in Texas, it was really neat to show 
her the trees that I planted when I was a kid and my old bedroom. I didn't know 
it at the time, but when I was a kid, my dad turned down a promotion for more 
pay because it would mean moving to another city and out of the house. I'm 
grateful for my parent's decision not to uproot the family, and I'd like to do 
the same for my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Even nomads like the Livingstons agree, there is something to be said for 
living in one home. The couple has decided they want to settle in one place and 
satisfy their desire to wander by traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to not have to pack again, and to have closets and drawers with 
shelf paper that never has to be changed," Bernice said.

 While Sierra Madre was once dubbed "Nature's Sanitarium" by easterners who 
came there in the late 1800s believing the climate could help speed their 
recovery from respiratory diseases, the city has taken on another kind of 
curative power in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 A hamlet (population: 10,800) in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, 
Sierra Madre is an antidote for strip mall and hip-weary Southern Californians 
looking for a wholesome, small-town atmosphere in which Beaver Cleaver would 
have felt at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, people come into my office and ask, 'Where am I? This looks like 
the 1950s,' " said Judy Webb-Martin, owner of Webb-Martin Realty in Sierra 
Madre. "This town hasn't moved much beyond that and people just love it." 
</P>
<P>
 That time-warp atmosphere attracted John and Marlene Borger when they got 
re-routed during Rose Parade traffic a few years ago and found themselves in 
Sierra Madre. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wondered where we were," Marlene Borger said. "I felt like we were in a 
little alcove away from everything." Six months later, when the couple, who 
lived in Santa Clarita, decided to look for something closer to their jobs in 
Pasadena and Chino, they remembered Sierra Madre. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long into their househunting the Borgers found "a cute little dream house" 
for $215,500. Built in 1947, the two-bedroom, one-bath house had 950 square 
feet. The couple added 400 square feet and spruced up things with new paint, 
landscaping and French doors. "It was kind of a little box when we bought it," 
said Marlene Borger, "But it's no Plain Jane now." 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Madre lies northeast of Pasadena, north of Arcadia and west of 
Monrovia. It is bounded by Michillinda Avenue on the west, Orange Grove Avenue 
on the south and Santa Anita Avenue on the east. 
</P>
<P>
 The northeastern part of the city -- known as "The Canyon" -- provides access 
to the Mt. Wilson hiking trail and offers residents seclusion from noise and 
traffic. The canyon has long been known as a haven for creative types. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Madre's housing prices range from $200,000 to $1 million with the 
average price at $310,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bath home with 1,600 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the city's 4,000 homes are custom built, Webb-Martin said, and modest 
bungalows and stately mini-mansions may share the same street. 
</P>
<P>
 In an advertisement from 1887 luring easterners to Sierra Madre, the city was 
said to have a view of neighboring cities below, "...while vessels can be 
counted on the Pacific Ocean, 30 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
 When newlyweds Phyllis and Edward Chapman left a bad winter in upstate New 
York to visit relatives in Pasadena in the early 1950s, they decided to set 
roots. "I stood on Baldwin Avenue, looked up at the mountains and thought, 'My 
goodness, if we lived here, we'd be on vacation all year round,' " recalled 
Phyllis Chapman, who is the town historian. 
</P>
<P>
 The Champmans bought a three-bedroom, two-bath ranch-style house for about 
$13,000. They have since added on, and Chapman estimates the house is worth 
about $320,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents like Chapman take pride in the preservation of the city's landmarks 
and older homes, which date back as far as 1881. 
</P>
<P>
 Two groups, the Cultural Heritage Commission and the Historic Preservation 
Society, perpetuate the city's history and traditions, including an annual 
entry in the Tournament of Roses Parade and its wisteria vine, listed in the 
1990 "Guinness Book of World Records" as the world's largest blossoming plant. 
The vine attracts visitors during its blossoming season every March and 
recently celebrated its centennial. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded and developed by Massachusetts native Nathanial Carter in 1874, Sierra 
Madre was an agricultural community until the Pacific Electric Railway made it 
possible for workers to commute to Los Angeles. Carter, who made his fortune in 
the garment and travel industries, came to Sierra Madre for his health and 
later brought his family with him. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1881, he purchased the 1,103-acre Sierra Madre Tract of Rancho Santa Anita, 
845 of those acres from his friend Elias J. (Lucky) Baldwin, and subdivided the 
land. His own estate, Carterhia, was on a view lot of 103 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city experienced somewhat of a boom in 1886-88 and many of those 
old gems remain, there is no predominant period when houses were built, said 
realtor Webb-Martin. So too do architectural styles vary. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides historic Victorians and big, old farm houses, there are a mishmash of 
Craftsman, cabin-like hideaways, Spanish and ranch-style houses, along with 
some multi-family units. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable architects plied their trade in Sierra Madre, including Greene and 
Greene, Samuel and Joseph Cather Newsom, Richard Neutra, Irving Gill and 
Wallace Neff. More than 75 structures are historical landmarks, such as the 
Victorian-style Sierra Vista Hotel built by Joseph Newsom in 1887 and the 
Barlow Villa, a replica of the Michelangelo-designed Villa Collazzi, built by 
Neff in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting historical architecture may be a draw, but what residents say they 
love about Sierra Madre is its sense of community. "When we first moved here we 
got involved in some Chamber of Commerce activities and met lots of people," 
said Marlene Borger. "It's great -- people wave to us when we're in town. They 
even know our dog -- Max -- by name." 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Madre has its own volunteer fire department, there's a welcome lady to 
greet new residents with maps and coupons from local businesses, an annual 
Fourth of July Parade, a Huck Finn fishing derby every March and summer 
concerts in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 That community spirit proved solid during two recent natural disasters: the 
earthquake in 1991, in which many structures were damaged and last fall's 
firestorms. Television viewers may remember the image of volunteer firefighters 
at the Mt. Oliva Passionist Fathers Home in the Sierra Madre foothills, poised 
to battle the blaze for the protection of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no loss of life and no homes were destroyed," Chapman said. "We can 
never thank them enough for the kind of effort they put forth to save this 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Tyree, 76, has lived in Sierra Madre all of his life and has memories of 
helping his grandfather in his grocery store, raising chickens and eating 
oranges at the family's ranch. While Tyree went on to become a vice president 
at Lockheed, he chose to remain in his hometown, serving on the planning 
commission and acting as a commentator for parades. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970 he built a 3,000-square-foot house for $30,000 on a lot he owned. He 
estimates the house, which has three bedrooms, three baths and a pool, is worth 
about $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, like Bay Area transplants Casey and Ellen Smiley, safety was a 
factor. They rented in Sierra Madre for nine months before buying a 
three-bedroom, two-bath home for $325,000. The 1,800 square-foot house was 
built in the mid-1960s, has a hot tub and was in move-in condition, said Casey 
Smiley. 
</P>
<P>
 While proximity to their jobs in Glendale and Duarte was a consideration, the 
Smileys felt it was also a good place to raise their son, Michael, 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you drive through town at dusk, you see kids riding bikes and people 
walking," said Casey Smiley. "Even where we came from in Redwood City, people 
spent a lot of time in their homes. I got the feeling that this is a safe 
little community." 
</P>
<P>
 Added realtor Webb-Martin: "I was a single mother here for 13 years and never 
locked my doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents, like Tyree, are so attached to the community that they intend 
to hang around in the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, I decided that I wasn't going to leave town, so I bought a 
plot in our cemetery," he said. "I told several of my friends and immediately 
the place was sold out." 
</P>

REAL ESTATE Q & A: ONE BAD HOUSE CAN BRING DOWN VALUE OF WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: Our home is located in a middle-class neighborhood of nicely 
maintained houses, except for the house across the street from ours. It is a 
rental house. The owner lives out of town and doesn't care what the tenants do 
as long as they pay the mortgage and property taxes. The house is a dump. The 
lawn is never mowed. It looks awful. But no laws are being violated so the city 
says they can't do anything. As we plan to sell our home in a few months, do 
you have any ideas for us as this house will hurt our home's salability? We've 
tried talking nicely to the tenants but they aren't very polite. 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Unfortunately, just one bad house like the type you describe can drag 
neighborhood property values down. Any prospective buyer of your home will 
either not make a purchase offer on your home or will make a low offer to 
compensate for the eyesore across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, I had a similar situation. When I was sure the neighbors 
weren't home, one day a friend and I mowed their lawn and made their place look 
sharp in front. After that, they did a better job of keeping up their house. 
They even painted it. Since they never learned who mowed their lawn, they got 
the message the neighbors really do care. If readers send in any other ideas 
for your problem, I'll run them here so we all can learn how to handle your 
frequently encountered problem. When Is the Right Time to Sell a Home? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You're always writing it's a great time to buy a home. But when is the 
right time to sell? My wife and I have owned our home almost 30 years. We 
raised our two sons here. But the last few years we've noticed more renters 
moving into the neighborhood and the home maintenance seems to be declining. 
Many of our older neighbors have died. The nearby high school is a drug depot. 
Do you think we should sell and get out? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. When you see signs of serious neighborhood decay, that's the time to 
sell your home before it's too late while you can still get a fair price. When 
It's All Right to Accept Quitclaim Deed 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We are trying to buy our first home but it's turning out to be a nightmare. 
The problem is not the house. We love its old-world charm and the location 
couldn't be better for us. The sellers are the troublemakers. It is a probate 
sale. Two sisters and a brother inherited the house. Apparently they hate each 
other and will only speak to each other through their three attorneys. Their 
late mother was very wealthy and each sibling is afraid the estate won't be 
divided equally. But our problem is each one will only sign a quitclaim deed. 
Our attorney says this indicates there is a title problem. Should we go ahead 
or forget about buying this house? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your situation is not uncommon in probate sales. If it's any comfort, 
divorce sales can be even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never been able to understand why probate sales are often so difficult. 
The heirs paid absolutely nothing for the property, yet they act as if they are 
entitled to squeeze every dollar out of the property. Also, their cost basis is 
the market value on the date of the death so they usually have no profit tax to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is nothing wrong with receiving a quitclaim deed from each 
heir. Such a deed conveys whatever legal interest they owned. It could be fee 
simple absolute. Or, if they had no title at all, a quitclaim might convey 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if I give you my quitclaim deed to the Empire State Building, you 
will receive absolutely nothing because I don't own that building. 
</P>
<P>
 Your best protection when receiving a quitclaim deed is to insist on also 
obtaining an owner's title insurance policy. If title proves to be defective on 
the quitclaim deeds, then you have a claim against the "deep pocket" title 
insurance company. Regardless what type of deed you receive, if you also 
receive an owner's title insurance policy you are well-protected. Consider the 
After-Tax Mortgage Interest Rate 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Our credit is not the best. As you often suggest, before making an offer to 
buy a home, we needed a mortgage commitment. With our bad credit, we went to a 
mortgage broker. She found us a lender who will make us a home loan at 9.5% 
fixed interest rate. I realize this is high. However, in our situation should 
we take it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A 9.5% mortgage interest rate is higher than you could obtain if you had 
excellent credit. However, consider your after-tax interest rate. If you are in 
the 28% tax bracket, after considering your income tax savings, that mortgage 
will only cost you 6.84 % interest. That is a bargain. Grab it. Don't Be Afraid 
to Borrow Funds for Fixer 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Each year my wife and I set aside about $25,000 for investment. In the 
past, we bought mutual funds and common stocks. We're doing OK but nothing 
spectacular. This year I think we should follow your advice and buy a run-down 
fixer-upper house. There is one for sale a few doors away from our home. But 
the problem is we will have to borrow almost $100,000 to finance the purchase 
of this house. My brother (a plumber) and I can easily fix-up this house to 
make it worth $175,000. Would I be making a big mistake to borrow $100,000 to 
make a possible $75,000 profit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Don't be afraid to borrow money to earn money. The situation sounds like a 
fantastic fixer-upper house. Unless your fix-up costs will be too high, go for 
it. Being able to hire tradesmen at reduced prices makes your potential profits 
all the more attractive. No Estate Tax Due on Assets Left to Spouse 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My husband is dying of emphysema. His doctor estimates he only has a few 
weeks left. My problem is our house is held in my husband's name alone. He 
owned it before we were married 38 years ago but he never added me to the 
title. It is free and clear. His will leaves everything to me. I estimate the 
house is worth about $250,000. When my husband passes on, how much estate tax 
will I owe on the house? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Zero tax. All assets left to a surviving spouse pass free of federal estate 
tax, regardless of the total amount. However, when you die, Uncle Sam will be 
waiting to collect estate tax if your estate is worth more than $600,000.

PLANNING YOUR MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though moving is stressful, there are ways to make a move as comfortable 
and positive as possible for the entire family. Experts offer these 
suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- When possible, include the entire family in the process of choosing a place 
to live, such as what street, neighborhood, house and which schools.If 
feasible, go as a family to look for a house and then have a meeting to discuss 
the options. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Have children pack their own belongings and let them choose their new rooms 
and how to decorate them. This will give them back a sense of control over 
their environment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stay in the same school district when possible, because changing schools, 
especially during the teen years, can be very traumatic for children. Also 
avoid moving in the middle of a school year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Consider a family session with a therapist to discuss the move and the 
changes that each family member anticipates. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Get children excited about their new home and less afraid to move by giving 
them pictures of the house and neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To comfort young children, bring pictures of their old home and friends to 
their new environment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Adults can make the move easier for themselves by finding a person they can 
connect with in the new place who can serve as an interpreter of local customs 
and direct them to necessary community services. JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS

MOVING ALWAYS STRESSFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether the situation surrounding a move is positive or negative, moving is 
always stressful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving disrupts daily life, and there is comfort in routines," said Irene 
Goldenberg, a family psychologist at UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute in 
Westwood."The farther away you move from a culture you're used to, the more 
difficult moving is." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving is more than changing residences, agrees Newport Beach therapist Joanie 
Heinemann. "Moving is considered a major life stressor, because it represents a 
loss of a particular way of life," she said, noting that a person's state of 
mind also determines how a move will affect him or her. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're satisfied with your life and your outlook is good, it's going to be 
easier to move than if you are going through a rough time emotionally," 
Heinemann said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, adults and children may suffer from adjustment disorder, 
which occurs within three months of a move, says Heinemann. Symptoms of this 
disorder include bed wetting (in children), depression, mood swings, 
nightmares, personality changes and sleeping difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 If any of these symptoms appear and persist after a move, consult with an 
expert. JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS

A DIRT-CHEAP ALTERNATIVE FOR GROUNDING COVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Decomposed granite may be only a step above ordinary dirt, but this humblest 
of paving materials is seen in some very grand gardens -- from the golden 
estates of the 1920s by designers such as Florence Yoch, to the most 
contemporary gardens by designers such as Nancy Goslee Power, currently working 
on the Walt Disney Concert Hall -- which will have decomposed granite paths. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscape professionals love decomposed granite because it looks so indigenous 
to the garden, but can you do it yourself? Can you make your own natural 
looking paths or patios with just a wheelbarrow and the tools in the garage? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is "nothing could be easier," according to the contractors we 
talked to. Or cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 A wheelbarrow, shovel, rake and a lawn roller are all you need (you can rent 
the lawn roller, sometimes even at a local nursery). 
</P>
<P>
 "D.G.," as landscape designers and contractors call decomposed granite, is an 
inexpensive, gritty, crumbly, over-the-hill mineral that tends to stick 
together if it is compressed. They use it for paths and patios, even driveways, 
anywhere the look of a country dirt road or wilderness trail is wanted. It's 
even tough enough to be used for equestrian trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Boswell of Mid City Granite in Los Angeles (a large supplier to 
contractors and building supply yards) tells us that theirs is dug right out of 
the Hollywood Hills on Forest Lawn property so it's no wonder that the soft 
golden color looks right at home in our gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other colors. In the Central Valley, they use a Sierra gray granite 
and there is a redder color that comes from Arizona, but in the L.A. area, most 
of the D.G. is an earthy yellow ocher, the color of our hills. 
</P>
<P>
 You can plant right through it (simply clear a little away) which really gives 
it that country lane look, with plants popping up in paths or the patio, like 
they might in nature. They appear to have simply sprouted there. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeds, on the other hand, are slow to sprout in the compacted D.G. If they do 
simply hoe them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Collins, a grading contractor in Tulare who uses a lot of D.G., says 
"nothing will grow through three to four inches of D.G., except maybe Bermuda 
grass." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Palisades contractor Joan Booke has put many of her paths and patios 
where Bermuda grass lawns used to be, including her own. She doesn't even 
bother to kill the lawn with herbicides (though the very cautious might first 
kill the Bermuda with an herbicide named Roundup), but removes all the turf 
with about four inches of soil and thatch and replaces it with three inches of 
D.G. This usually brings the thatch-fattened soil profile back down to where it 
ought to be. Collins points out another plus: "It's considerably cheaper than 
concrete, or just about anything else." Another contractor suggested that it is 
three to four times cheaper than concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Booke has used it in elegant Brentwood gardens, on Silver Lake terraces and 
for driveways in Topanga (for driveways, it must be thicker). 
</P>
<P>
 She likes it so much she used it in her own garden, a ringing endorsement. The 
natural looking paths wind their way through the garden giving her easy access 
to all the flowering perennials she grows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a permanent hard-scape (referring to the paving part of a 
landscape)," she said. "It does requires refurbishing every few years." 
</P>
<P>
 To do so, you just add a little more. And, the fact that it is not permanent, 
could be seen as another plus. It allows you to change your mind later on. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain and sprinklers cause most of the wear and tear. "Don't ever put a path 
under a downspout or where water can roll off the roof and down the path," she 
said. A hard downpour will leave ruts in D.G. Sprinklers slowly wear it away, 
though in Booke's garden one of the paths in already 5 years old and nearly as 
good as new. 
</P>
<P>
 D.G. is best on flat, level ground, and where it doesn't get watered by the 
sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dry, D.G. tends to stay put. When wet, grains stick to shoes (some kinds are 
worse than others because they have more clay content), but it does not get 
muddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, "You probably won't like D.G. if you have white carpets," Booke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep it out of the house, end the D.G. paving before the house, at a patio, 
for instance, or a landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors can make it very firm with a natural organic soil binder called 
Stabilizer, but usually they don't. A very few building supply yards sell 
Stabilizer by the bag, or sell D.G. already mixed with it (for more 
information, call the manufacturer at (800) 928-2724). 
</P>
<P>
 Booke used Stabilizer on the Topanga Canyon driveway because it wasn't level. 
In her own garden, she used plain D.G. brought in by the wheelbarrow load. 
</P>
<P>
 Paths and patios look best if the D.G. simply "melds" into the garden soil. 
Edgings ruin the effect of a natural path through the garden, though some 
designers use similarly colored stones at the edges of paths. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a lawn rake to tidy it up, or a wispy Japanese broom like Booke uses. 
</P>
<P>
 So how do you do it yourself? Simply remove about three inches of soil, lay 
down three inches of D.G., wet it, roll it with a lawn roller, wet it again and 
roll again. That's all there is to it, according to Booke. 
</P>
<P>
 The rolling compacts the D.G. so it becomes almost like stone again. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractor Collins likes to "crown" the paths so they're a little higher in 
the middle of the path and shed rainfall, and he simply lays it on top of the 
ground after first compacting the soil with a roller and raking it flat. 
</P>
<P>
 You can buy D.G. by the bag (about $3), or the cubic yard (about $30). A cubic 
yard will cover 120 square feet, three inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
 A skip load, dumped into your pickup or delivered, covers about 40 square 
feet, three inches deep, and a skip (which is about 10 cubic feet) costs around 
$10. 
</P>
<P>
 That will fill a large contractors' wheelbarrow at least two or three times, 
and make a path four feet wide by 10 feet long, for 10 bucks. For covering 
ground, there's not much you can buy that is so dirt-cheap.

CONDO Q & A: WHAT ARE ALTERNATIVES TO HIGHER ASSESSMENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I live in a 25-unit condominium building that is about 20 years old. 
The board is considering an increase in the monthly assessment to cover the 
cost of painting and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Our monthly assessment is now $175 a month. I feel that higher assessments 
could scare off potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to raise money some other way. Perhaps we could charge a $3 fee 
for guests who use the pool. We could also charge a yearly maintenance 
assessment based on the number of occupants per unit. For example, two people 
would pay $200 and a couple with child would pay $300. Could these methods be 
used to raise the money for the needed repairs? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sorry, but your creative financing ideas will not fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Your first suggestion would create work for someone because the pool guest fee 
would have to be collected from the owners. I doubt that you are going to want 
to set up a ticket booth at the entrance to the pool. The association does not 
have a way of billing the guests and the honor system probably would not be 
very effective. Owners will not be pleased if they have to start paying for 
their guests when the pool has been a free amenity in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the pool guest fees would create more work for the tax accountant 
because the pool guest fees would be taxable income. The small amount of 
revenue is not worth it. The arguments against the fee would far outweigh the 
arguments in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the yearly maintenance assessment based upon occupancy, I assume 
that you are suggesting that this would be an extra charge in addition to the 
monthly assessment. I am certain that the association's declaration does not 
authorize an extra charge based on occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of operating the building is shared on the basis of the percentage of 
ownership (square footage) or is shared equally among the 25 unit owners. Some 
associations have a more complicated equation that is a combination of the two 
cost-sharing methods. Each owners' share should be clearly explained in the 
governing documents of your association and it probably also is included in the 
deed to your property. Any other method of computing the owners' financial 
obligation is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you think that you could get the owners to vote to change the 
declaration. In my opinion, this type of amendment would require 100% approval 
of the owners, and possibly the lenders, since it is an issue that deals with 
percentage of ownership and each owners' financial obligations. Who Should File 
Claim for Roof Leak Damage? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I own a condominium with a leaky roof. The roof of the complex is the 
maintenance responsibility of the association. The association's board of 
directors is not taking care of the problem. They have instructed me to contact 
the roofer's insurance company to file a claim. Why should this be my 
responsibility? I feel that the board of directors should be pursuing the 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 My personal property was damaged due to the roof leak. Is the association 
responsible for the damage to my personal property that resulted from the roof 
leak? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You have asked some questions that often arise in an association when 
common area components fail. It is not a simple issue because the association's 
maintenance responsibility, contractor liability and insurance coverage can all 
play a part in the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors should notify the roofer that the roof is leaking. The 
roofer should then fix the leak and communicate with you about the procedure to 
file a claim with the roofing company's liability insurance carrier for the 
damaged personal property. Obviously, you will have to personally deal with the 
contractor and his insurer at some point. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys don't always agree on an association's responsibility for paying for 
damage to personal property. In general, owners are responsible for their 
personal property and the owners can obtain insurance to protect themselves 
from loss of their personal property. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys say that when personal property is damaged due to a failure of 
a common area component, then the association is responsible for any resulting 
damage. Other attorneys advise their association clients that the association 
is liable only if the association's board of directors knew that there was a 
problem and they were negligent in performing timely repairs. The association's 
insurance coverage may pay for the damage in either case. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the owner is responsible for damage because the owner failed to 
take reasonable care to protect his or her property. For example, if the owner 
knows that the roof is leaking and he doesn't move or cover an antique walnut 
table that is located directly under the leak, the owner should assume 
responsibility for the resulting damage. 
</P>
<P>
 You didn't mention insurance in your letter, but the association's insurance 
policy may take care of your damaged property if the contractor's insurance 
fails to do so. Some policies are very liberal when it comes to covering damage 
that results from common area failures while others take a very hard line and 
refer the owner to his or her insurance carrier. In some situations, the 
association's insurance claims adjuster and the owner's insurance claims 
adjuster will disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversies are minimized when the association's insurance company or the 
agent discloses to the owners exactly what the association's policy covers and 
the amount of the deductible. The owners are entitled to this information, 
including who has responsibility for payment of the deductible when a loss 
occurs. Owners can then seek their own insurance coverage that will fill in the 
gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Consult an attorney who specializes in community association law if you need 
an explanation of the association's governing documents or if you would like a 
legal opinion of the association's responsibility regarding your damaged 
property. Dispute Reprint

HOME IMPROVEMENT; WHAT TO CHECK WHEN LEAVING YOUR HOME ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Don't worry, it's going to be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 A Southern California family on a skiing vacation in Mammoth one recent winter 
received this advice from a neighbor back home. Someone had noticed water 
flowing from under the front door of their house and called the fire 
department. The firemen found that a water supply pipe under a sink had burst. 
They turned off the water, and swept out what they could. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor told the family it wasn't necessary for them to return home 
immediately. They had already paid for a couple more days of lift tickets so 
they might as well have fun and deal with the damage when they returned. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no one knew that one of the firefighters had turned on the furnace in 
the water-logged house before he locked the door, thinking that the heat would 
help dry out the carpeting. When the unfortunate family finally opened their 
front door three days later, they found their house had the climate of a rain 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fireman was just trying to help out, but by turning on the furnace the 
water was drawn up into the air," said Rod Albright of Albright Plumbing & 
Heating Supply in Los Alamitos. "Water that was originally just in the 
carpeting was soaked up into the paneling causing it to buckle (and the) 
wallpaper was peeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Albright heard the tale of woe from the homeowner, who came to him looking to 
replace the broken $5 water line that caused nearly $30,000 in damage. "What 
made it worse was his insurance would only cover the water damage to the floors 
and furniture, not the damage created when the furnace was turned on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The faulty supply line was made of plastic, which is no longer acceptable 
under present building codes. Stainless steel lines are today's standard, and 
replacing old plastic lines should be a priority to prevent a major headache. 
"You'll be lucky if it breaks while you're home," said Albright. "If you're 
not, you just have to hope someone sees all the water flowing from your front 
door." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, our homes can take care of themselves while we're away. 
Southern California's climate is mild enough for us not to worry about ice 
damage in winter and intense heat in summer. But before leaving on an extended 
vacation, it's probably a good idea to check around your property for any 
problems that could develop while you're gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Water damage is the real nightmare," said Tom Houlihan of Orange County 
Appliance Parts in Garden Grove. "Other systems in your house, such as gas and 
electricity, have some form of protection built in, like safety valves and 
circuit breakers, to prevent catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 When he leaves for his annual two-week fishing trip, Houlihan regularly turns 
off the water to his house after locking the front door. "It's just one of 
those things I do. Nothing is probably going to break while I'm gone, but just 
to be safe, I turn it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the supply lines under your sinks are new, there are other potential 
weak links that can create an expensive mess. "Many people have water 
filtration systems hooked up under the sink that have vinyl connectors," said 
Derek Hanna of Kenny's Plumbing Supply in Burbank. "They're usually under a lot 
of pressure, so make sure there are no leaks underneath." 
</P>
<P>
 Old toilet tanks have been known to crack and flood floors, and rubber water 
lines that are often found in refrigerator ice makers have been known to be 
tasty snacks for rodents. "If your home is quiet for a long time, a hungry 
mouse might get brave enough to chew and break one of those lines, leaving a 
big clean-up job when you get home," Houlihan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while shutting off your water supply may seem like a prudent thing to do 
before going away, it can be a problem for your lawn and garden, especially if 
you have an automatic sprinkler system. "Not many people have a system that 
allows them to turn off the water to their house and not their yard," Hanna 
said. "It's probably worth having a friend turn the water on periodically so 
you'll keep your plants alive." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not experiencing electrical problems while you're home, it's not 
likely that your wiring will fail while you're away. "If nothing is putting a 
load on the system, you're probably not going to see a problem develop," said 
Danny Pelletier of Ever-Ready Discount Electrical Supply in Reseda. "It's when 
you have all the appliances on and the system is stressed that you find 
faults." 
</P>
<P>
 Pelletier advises against turning off electricity at the main circuit breaker 
when leaving for an extended period of time. "You're not going to be saving 
that much in terms of your electrical use and leaving an empty, dark house 
isn't safe for security reasons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One can, however, turn off energy-hungry appliances, and for most people that 
means the refrigerator. "Your refrigerator costs you about $10 a month in 
electricity, and if you're going to be away for awhile, it makes sense to turn 
it off," Houlihan said. "However, it's a good idea to tape the freezer and 
refrigerator doors open to prevent mildew from building up inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Since getting a refrigerator/freezer back to normal operating temperature when 
you get home can take a few hours, you can also turn the temperature control 
down to the lowest setting, in lieu of pulling the plug. 
</P>
<P>
 Most modern gas appliances use an electronic ignition, so turning off the main 
gas line won't save much while you're out of town. "Water heaters usually have 
a low or 'vacation' setting," Albright said. "That keeps it from heating water 
that'll never be used." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who live in the desert or mountains or have vacation homes there must 
prepare for severe weather. "The sustained, dry heat of the desert is not good 
for a house," Albright said. "You could leave your house for the summer and 
come back to find wood floors and furniture cracked and warped." 
</P>
<P>
 To counter the effects of dry heat, many people leave pots and basins of water 
in the rooms of their homes before they leave for an extended period. "As the 
water evaporates, humidity is created that protects your woodwork," Houlihan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain houses and cabins are often equipped with "drain-down valves" for use 
in the winter. "These let you drain the water from the lines in your house 
before you leave," Albright said. "That prevents the threat of a freeze 
bursting your pipes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they may know where to look for trouble spots, that doesn't prevent 
the professionals from finding disaster when they return home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plumbing in our house is up-to-date, so I wouldn't expect a problem," 
Albright said. "But we came home once to find our carpeting soaked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had turned on the washing machine on when we left and a sock had clogged 
the outlet during the drain cycle, causing the tub to overflow. That teaches 
you never to take anything for granted, make sure everything's in good working 
condition."

THE INDOOR GARDENER; HOW TO KEEP 'BABY'S TEARS' PLANT HEALTHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL RAPP, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I recently bought a plant that the nursery person told me was called 
"baby's tears." It was growing in a clump of tiny, round, green leaves it 
looked almost like a leafy moss -- and had delicate little trailing vines all 
around the pot. 
</P>
<P>
 I followed the care instructions -- bright light, lots of water, daily misting 
(it didn't last long enough for the monthly fertilizing!), but the plant just 
dried up and died within a couple of weeks. Was it really a baby's tears plant, 
and were the care instructions correct? If so, what do you think went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: There are two types of "baby's tears" commonly available in Southern 
California nurseries: Helxine soleiroli, which is most likely the type you 
bought, and Pilea depressa, a similar plant except it's a brighter green color, 
its leaves are much larger and more succulent and it looks to me like it should 
be growing in a lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 H. soleiroli is very difficult to maintain indoors and unless you keep it in a 
terrarium where it will get maximum humidity, this baby's tears will have you 
crying the blues. P. depressa, however, should thrive in your home with medium 
light, enough water to keep the soil just damp, and frequent mistings. What 
Hanging Plants Can Handle Hot Sun? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have a very hot, sunny breakfast area where I'd love to hang a plant, but 
everything I've tried there has burned up and died. I've tried pothos, 
philodendron and Boston fern but one of them made it. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are numerous hanging cactus and succulent plants that would do very 
well in those circumstances -- donkey's tail (Sedum morganianum) comes to mind. 
But if you want to stay with a more graceful foliage plant, I'd suggest an 
asparagus fern (Asparagus sprengerii) . Not really a fern, and not actually an 
asparagus, this durable houseplant has long, thin, bright green, fern-like 
stems and feathery, needlelike foliage and thrives in hot, sunny conditions. It 
gets its name because when new fronds appear, they look exactly like little 
asparagus spears. Water when the soil dries out and don't be too concerned 
about occasional falling needles. What Is Bright Red Plant With Pink Veins? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I was at a friend's house the other day and was very impressed by a bright 
red plant in her kitchen. It had small, heart-shaped, dark red leaves with pink 
veins and a pink midrib. I've never seen this plant before at any nursery, and 
my friend didn't know what it's called. Do you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm quite sure you're talking about a bloodleaf plant (Irisine herstii). 
It's the only bright red foliage plant I can think of. Over the years I've had 
several, and despite frequent pinching back they've usually gotten straggly. 
But I've kept some going for months and months, so I'd suggest you get a stem 
cutting from your friend, root it in water, and then pot it up and get as much 
pleasure from it as you can. Will Indoor Banana Tree Produce Fruit? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Could I grow a banana tree indoors? And will it ever produce fruit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes to your first question, probably not to your second. Actually, banana 
trees (Musa spp.) are quite easy to grow indoors, requiring only bright, 
filtered light, enough water to keep the soil moist, monthly feedings with a 
good liquid houseplant food, and most importantly, lots of humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 With its distinctive tropical look, a banana tree is most rewarding as a 
decorative addition to a lanai room or an atrium, and if you do manage to 
provide perfect circumstances, your banana tree will eventually bear fruit.

DESTINATION: NEPAL; CROSSROADS KINGDOM; HIMALAYA TREKKERS GATHER HERE, BUT 
THEY'RE ONLY THE LATEST PILGRIMS TO THIS VALLEY WHERE CULTURES AND RELIGION 
HAVE MINGLED FOR CENTURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD HALLORAN, Halloran, formerly a New York Times correspondent in Asia, 
is a writer based in Honolulu. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a tale of three cities in a green valley astride a Himalayan 
crossroads in the middle of Asia. In ancient times they were known as the 
kingdoms of Kantipur, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur and were the repository of a deep 
Hindu and Buddhist culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, they are called Katmandu, the capital of Nepal; Patan, which now abuts 
the capital to the south across the Bagmati River but maintains its separate 
identity, and Bhaktapur, seven miles to the east. Throughout the Katmandu 
Valley in which they sit are scores of Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas, 
medieval palaces and struggling museums, Tibetan monasteries and craft centers 
in a complex of riches that could take weeks to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular time to be in Nepal begins this month and goes into November. 
The weather is clear and dry; the monsoon rains that sweep up from India have 
passed, and the Himalayan peaks can be seen almost every day in their full 
glory. If the past is any indication, the trekkers are arriving in droves from 
Germany, Britain, France, Japan and the United States. After a day or so to 
meet their guides and pack up their climbing gear in Katmandu, they will fan 
out to the northeast to trek toward Mt. Everest and Kanchenjunga, and to the 
west toward Annapurna and Dhaulagiri, the world's mightiest mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, government reports on tourism 
indicate that most visitors come to Nepal for non-trekking holidays, many to 
delve into the nation's ancient and diverse culture. Indians from next door are 
by far the largest single group of tourists, with the vast majority coming to 
visit cultural sites -- or, a more recent development, to gamble.  
</P>
<P>
 The foundation of Nepal's culture is religion that exerts a pervasive 
influence in everyday life. Everywhere are small shrines at which passersby, 
men going to work and women with children in tow, stop to ring a bell, to touch 
hands or heads to stone, to sprinkle flower petals, to dab a dollop of 
vermilion on the god depicted there. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, it would seem that the Kingdom of Nepal, the only nation in 
which Hinduism is the official religion, is tolerant of Buddhism, once a 
competitive faith. It soon becomes clear, however, that Hindus in Nepal have 
fused into Hinduism elements of Buddhism that have roots in India and Tibet. 
Unlike Christians or Muslims, Nepalis see no contradiction in holding beliefs 
from two religions. 
</P>
<P>
 One Saturday, an elderly Nepali gentleman stopped to chat as my wife and I 
came down the long stairs from Swayambhunath, a Buddhist stupa -- a place of 
worship much like a temple -- just west of Katmandu. During the conversation, I 
asked: "Do you come here often?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes, from time to time. I like this place." 
</P>
<P>
 "You are Buddhist, then?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no," he said with a puzzled look, "I am Hindu, pure Hindu." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, another Nepali explained that Hindus see Buddha as the ninth 
incarnation of Vishnu, one of the trinity of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the 
Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer. 
</P>
<P>
 To most Westerners, Nepal seems a remote land, caught in a vise between Tibet 
and the Himalayan massif along its northern border and a lower range separating 
it from India to the south. The Katmandu Valley itself may be the Shangri-La of 
James Hilton's famous novel, "Lost Horizon," although other sites have been 
named as the inspiration for that storied location. The kaleidoscope of faces 
on the streets, however, shows the impression of remoteness to be mistaken. 
Rather, the valley is an ethnic crossroads. We saw people who could be cousins 
of my ancestors, the Celts, and others who could be cousins of my wife, Fumiko, 
who is Japanese, plus those whose forebears came from northern or southern 
India, from Tibet and Mongolia, from Persia and even Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The valley that is home to these people is said in legend to have once been a 
shallow lake that was drained when the god Manjushri cleaved a gorge with his 
sword and spilled the water into India. Over the centuries, the valley and 
surrounding hills drew Indo-Aryans from around the Volga River in Russia who 
migrated through Central Asia and across Afghanistan and Kashmir. Mongols, 
Manchus and Tibetans seeped through the forbidding but porous Himalayan barrier 
that separates Indian and Sinitic cultures. They were the ancestors of the 
Gurung and Gurkha hill people; for more than a century, the Gurkhas provided 
the British army with valiant soldiers. Indians came to escape the searing heat 
of the Ganges plain; Persians wandered in from the west, and Tamils came from 
the south of India. Greek blood is carried by descendants of Macedonian 
soldiers commanded by Alexander the Great when he invaded northern India in the 
4th Century BC. Recently, Tibetans have come to escape oppressive Chinese 
rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 Let it be said, however, that the Katmandu Valley is not for the squeamish. 
Poverty prevails and many people live in dank hovels. Water is in short supply 
and is polluted; personal hygiene is only for the upper class. The air is 
fouled with black exhaust belching from worn trucks, buses and taxis. Streets 
are covered with piles of garbage, cow dung and dog-do, and the cities need a 
scrub and a coat of paint. Litter has spread to the mountain trekking areas, 
even those around Mt. Everest. Fumiko saw a man behead a goat on a side street 
as she walked to a cultural lecture from our hotel, the Shangri-La, in the 
embassy district of the city. Visitors are accosted by persistent porters at 
the airport, by demanding cab drivers who overcharge, by pestering "guides" at 
cultural sites, and beggars who appear to be as able-bodied as those who work. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that, combined with political dissent against the government in Nepal's 
new-found democracy, strikes by transport workers demanding higher wages, 
floods in Nepal and recessions in the industrial world, explains why Nepal has 
lost some of its magnetism. The number of tourists last year dropped by 17% 
below that of 1992. A senior official at the Ministry of Tourism and Civil 
Aviation, Laxman Upadhaya, acknowledged the problem but said "we don't have 
much money to spend on tourism. Tourism is not on the government's priority 
list." Before we left in mid-June, however, the government cut the visa fee to 
$15 from $40. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, for the adventurous, for incorrigible romantics, and for those with a 
taste for history, the Katmandu Valley is a trove. We are both culture buffs, 
confirmed temple-goers and amateur historians, and we discovered that a good 
place to get a feel for early history is the temple dedicated to Vishnu called 
Changu Narayan. Believed to have been founded in the 4th Century AD, it sits on 
a hill seven miles east of Katmandu, just outside Bhaktapur, and offers a 
breathtaking view of the valley. Maybe Hilton had this in mind when he had the 
adventuresome but other-worldly English diplomat Hugh Conway and his companions 
first see Shangri-La. 
</P>
<P>
 We hired a car and driver to go to Changu Narayan on a Sunday, a working day, 
to find it nearly deserted and thus serene. The main hall is built like a 
pagoda that, to this amateur eye, showed strong Buddhist influences. Wood 
carvings on pillars and over doors, however, depicted Hindu guardians as did 
stone sculptures scattered about the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Changu Narayan's tranquillity, Pashupatinath, on the eastern 
edge of Katmandu and the most sacred Hindu temple in Nepal, was clamorous at 
mid-week. Non-Hindus are not permitted to enter the temple, perhaps because 
priests fear that non-believers may ridicule the object of worship, Shiva's 
lingam (phallus), carved with the god's four faces. From a hillside across the 
narrow, polluted but sacred Bagmati river is a clear view of the sprawling 
compound. The sound of chanting and the scent of incense wafted from the temple 
while pilgrims splashed water on themselves at riverside. Along the riverbank 
are ghats , concrete platforms or steps on which the dead may be cremated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Patan, the temple dedicated to the god of compassion known to Hindus as 
Machhendranath and to Buddhists as Avalokiteshwara is another pagoda in a quiet 
compound just steps from a frenetic street. In the spring, the countenance of 
the god, a red figure painted on a shingle, is slowly taken through the city's 
streets in a swaying, 60-foot tower of poles, flowers, and rope atop a heavy 
cart. Passersby bless themselves by touching any part of the tower and then 
their foreheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most imposing sites are the Buddhist stupas at Swayambhunath just 
west of Katmandu and Bodhnath to the east. They are huge, round, whitewashed 
mounds, the domes of which are crowned with tall, square golden spires, on each 
side of which are painted brooding blue eyes that stare off into the distance 
as they watch for evil. At Swayambhunath, monkeys clambering up the long 
stairway and around the shrines paid little attention to people, and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Swayambhunath was more elaborate in shrines and statues than Bodhnath, which 
is particularly sacred to Tibetan lamas, but the latter seemed more imposing in 
its simplicity. The stupa, which is surrounded by a circular road lined with 
bookshops, souvenir shops, and a Tibetan temple, was founded in the 5th 
Century. By the stairs leading to the stupa is a huge prayer wheel; anyone can 
give it a spin to pray for the well-being of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 We walked through the narrow lanes running north from the stupa to a score of 
Tibetan monasteries constructed by refugees. In the Nenang Pao monastery, we 
met a 19-year-old novice who had fled from Tibet at the age of 13, walking for 
a month through the mountain passes to reach Katmandu. A student of English, he 
explained about the bodhisattvas, that they are beings on the way toward 
enlightenment but who have not quite reached it. They attend the Buddha, who 
was born Siddhartha Gautama in Lumbini, a Nepali town near the Indian border.  
</P>
<P>
 In each of the three cities of the Katmandu Valley is a durbar, or palace, 
from which kings ruled tiny fiefs until the Gurkhas swept out of the hills to 
unify the country in the 18th Century. The squares in front of the durbars are 
both historical sites and hubs of present-day life. Durbar Square in Katmandu 
was clogged with unkempt temples and alive with street vendors hawking food to 
Nepalis and trinkets to tourists. Perhaps the most colorful was the Black 
Bhairab, a stone god carved on an upright slab and dancing on a corpse. We 
watched a woman stretch up to smear vermilion on the chest of the god; legend 
has it that anyone who tells a lie before this god will vomit blood until he 
dies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the smaller Durbar Square in Bhaktapur was well kept and clearly 
a gathering place for men to gossip during the noon hour. The palace has been 
turned into a museum in which a guide explained through the art collection the 
complexities of the Hindu trinity. Shiva appears to get most attention, perhaps 
because he destroys evil, and Vishnu as guardian warrants much consideration. 
Brahma the Creator, however, is barely seen -- but no Nepali with whom we spoke 
could explain why. 
</P>
<P>
 The Durbar Square in Patan is rather more neatly laid out and less confusing 
than the jumbled square in Katmandu. The former king's palace is being 
converted to a museum; splendid wood carvings stand in its courtyard awaiting 
places inside. The museums in Bhaktapur and Patan seemed more inviting than the 
National Museum near Swayambhunath. The National Museum has lovely bas-relief 
carvings in stone that show the variety of Hindu gods, and bronze sculptures 
that display more imaginative ways to achieve sexual intercourse than can be 
described in a family newspaper. It was not well-lit, however, nor did it have 
adequate explanations for English-reading visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposite the palace in Patan is an elaborately carved temple dedicated to both 
Vishnu and Shiva before which the figure of a king kneels in prayer atop a tall 
pillar. Next door is another elaborately carved stone temple dedicated to 
Vishnu in his incarnation as Krishna. 
</P>
<P>
 Across from those temples is a hiti or bath that was built in the 6th Century. 
It is still in use, underscoring the poverty of Nepal; the polluted liquid that 
trickles from its pipes is the only water available to those who come to bathe 
and carry water home. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast is the luxurious, modern palace of the present ruler, King 
Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. Situated near the center of Katmandu, the palace 
grounds cover 15 acres and the main building, built in 1970, has three wings of 
30 rooms each. Visitors are permitted in the Narayanhity Palace in the state 
wing but not the guest wing nor the private wing. The fee for foreigners, who 
may visit on Thursdays only, is 250 rupees, or $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Another insight into the life of the valley comes from the carpet makers, who 
also offer good bargains. The craft was brought to Nepal by Tibetans after 1959 
and is practiced by Tibetan women in Jaulakhel, a Tibetan neighborhood on the 
southeastern edge of Patan. There we saw four women weaving a room-sized carpet 
that would take several months to finish. Nepali women weave carpets at the 
Patan Industrial Estate, in the southern sector of the city, where furniture, 
brassware and woolen sweaters are also made. (We bought a carpet there for 
about $170.) 
</P>
<P>
 The point is that people in Nepal work hard for long hours with little return. 
Life in the valley, and the hills beyond, is really on the edge. Yet through it 
all, we found Nepalis not to have been hardened by poverty but to have a grace 
and charm, perhaps infused by the deep religious culture around them. I spoke 
with a Western diplomat about the grim side in Nepal. "Yes," he agreed, "but 
it's hard not to root for these guys, isn't it?" GUIDEBOOK: Katmandu 
Connections 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Katmandu is around the other side of the world so plan on at 
least two and better three days to get there. The best connections from Los 
Angeles are through Singapore to Katmandu on Singapore Airlines, lowest 
round-trip fare $1,450; and through Bangkok to Katmandu on Thai Airways, lowest 
round-trip $1,575. Connections are available only several days of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: Hotel Yak & Yeti is reputedly Katmandu's finest (off Durbar 
Marg; from U.S. telephones 011-977-413-999, fax 011-977-227-782). About $150 
for a double. Hotel Shangri-La was comfortable and well-run with three good 
restaurants and a lovely garden (Lazimpath, within walking distance of American 
Embassy; tel. 011-977-412-999, fax 011-977-414-184.) About $115 per night.  
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: Bhanchha Ghar (Kalamadi, off Durbar Marg; local telephone 
225-172). The lamb was succulent, the vegetables tasty, the spices mild, and 
the service attentive. A waiter poured raxi (rice wine) from a pewter pitcher 
held head high into a shallow cup without spilling a drop. Katmandu at its 
best. About $30 for two with wine.  
</P>
<P>
 Naachghar, in the Yak & Yeti Hotel. A fun place to dine a la Nepali. About $30 
for two with wine.  
</P>
<P>
 Utse, a Tibetan restaurant in Thamel, the area for young tourists on a budget, 
was good and only about $10 for two.

TRAVEL INSIDER: NEW SAFETY NET FOR TRAVELERS LEFT HOLDING THE BAG; CONSUMERS: 
LANDMARK STATE LAW PROVIDES RESTITUTION IF TOUR OPERATORS AND TRAVEL AGENCIES 
DON'T DELIVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It took years of legislative wrangling in Sacramento -- not to mention an 
unprecedented act of self-regulation among this state's travel industry leaders 
-- but California consumers now have a landmark law aimed at protecting them 
when travel agencies and tour operators skip town or go bust. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill (AB 918), sponsored as by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame), 
was backed by the Legislature in August and signed by Gov. Pete Wilson on Sept. 
29. It establishes a travel restitution fund for consumers, which is expected 
to reach $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of creating and maintaining that fund will be carried by sellers of 
travel -- tour operators and travel agents, principally -- who will pay $325 in 
fees for each of their offices in 1995 and an anticipated $100-$125 in 1996. 
The bill is not aimed at airlines, hotels and cruise companies, but at the 
thousands of intermediary companies that arrange trips, collect money from 
consumers and pass it along to transportation and lodging providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the fund is in place, if a consumer advances money to a registered 
company and the firm fails or vanishes, the consumer may be able to recover his 
or her losses, up to $15,000 per person. (Refunds may be possible in the case 
of U.S. hotel failures if the hotel is part of a tour package; foreign 
companies are essentially uncovered by the law.) 
</P>
<P>
 State and tourism officials expect to spend 1995 collecting fees and setting 
up the new system, with the law to take full effect in January, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry authorities agree that the law is the first of its kind in the 
nation: Basically, after years of criticism over its lack of professionalism, 
the industry is taxing itself to build consumer trust, and ceding oversight of 
the program to government officials. The legislation grew from two years of 
negotiation and compromise between leaders of the California Coalition of 
Travel Organizations (CCTO), an industry group, and the state attorney 
general's office -- talks that followed years of aborted efforts to give 
travelers legal protection from business failures and fly-by-night operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry authorities have estimated that travel scams cost consumers 
nationwide $12 billion a year, and state officials say 30 California-based 
travel businesses and 144 others nationwide have declared bankruptcy or ceased 
operation between January, 1986, and May of this year. The most notorious case 
in this state was the 1989 collapse of Hemphill-Harris Travel in Encino, which 
left hundreds of travelers stranded around the world, and cost the company's 
California customers an estimated $700,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill requires companies selling travel to pay fees and register through 
the state attorney general's office and a new nonprofit agency to be under the 
state's oversight. The companies are then assigned a registration number that 
they must include in advertisements. (Firms that advertise with false 
registration numbers could face felony prosecution by the attorney general.) 
</P>
<P>
 Registration will be required not only of California companies, but also of 
out-of-state tour operators that sell to Californians, even if they don't 
advertise here. (The law is less clear on out-of-state travel agents; if they 
make bookings using credit cards, don't deposit California money into their 
accounts and don't advertise here, they may not be required to register.) 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles travel agency owner and attorney Susan Tanzman Kaplan (a key 
player in talks who serves as president of the CCTO and vice president and 
treasurer for the American Society of Travel Agents) offers this advice to 
consumers: Starting in 1996, if a travel advertisement from a tour operator or 
travel agent doesn't include a state registration number, "don't purchase from 
them. And be wary when you see any (travel) advertisement with an 800 number 
that doesn't have the registration number." 
</P>
<P>
 California law has long required "travel promoters" to maintain trust accounts 
or bonds to protect consumer funds, but industry officials say minimal 
enforcement and uncertainty over the definition of "promoter" made the law 
largely ineffectual; state authorities acknowledge that only about 300 
businesses were registered. 
</P>
<P>
 Past industry efforts at protection funds have yielded mixed results. The U.S. 
Tour Operators Assn., which includes three dozen of the largest companies in 
the business, runs a similar program, requiring each member company to maintain 
a $1 million bond or equivalent. But last year the American Society of Travel 
Agents, unsatisfied with its ability to keep its fund level high to cover the 
cost of a major failure, moved to discontinue a similar program among its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects of the new law say they expect to register 8,000 companies, 
assessing them a $200 fee to start the restitution fund, a $25 fee to cover 
administrative costs and a $100 annual registration fee. In following years, 
annual assessments of $100 will be used to replenish the fund. If it becomes 
necessary, travel sellers could be assessed up to $200 more in a year in order 
to keep the fund balance above $1.2 million. The $25 start-up administrative 
fee may become an annual assessment. The bill also includes a sunset clause 
that requires reauthorization by the governor and Legislature before the end of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide assessments are based on the number of locations maintained by a 
travel seller; hence a mom-and-pop travel agency will owe $325 next year, and 
American Express Travel Services, with more than 70 retail offices statewide, 
will owe $325 for each location.(Fly-by-nite), Illustration by J. D. CROWE

 The Pilgrims looked at the pink blossom and saw the head of a crane. 
"Crane-berry" they called it, and after the first taste, probably added, "It 
needs sugar." 
</P>
<P>
 The tart fruit, a key ingredient on millions of Thanksgiving tables, is the 
star of the annual Cranberry Harvest Weekend, Oct. 14-16, on Nantucket, the 
fishhook-shaped island 30 miles off the Massachusetts coast.

 Visitors can take a shuttle to see the world's largest contiguous cranberry 
bog, where the submerged vines are beaten by the wooden paddles of a water reel 
and harvesters in hip boots sweep the berries together. They can also take in a 
food festival, harvest marketplace and the annual Cranberry Harvest Cookery 
Contest.

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Join 5,000 runners on a 3,000-year-old course" is the slogan of this year's 
Jerusalem Marathon that runs past many of the city's famous religious and 
historic sites. The race is set for Oct. 25. For info, call the Jewish Sports 
Congress, (516) 482-5550. Everybody's Bard at the Barbican 
</P>
<P>
 A German "Romeo and Juliet," a Japanese "King Lear" and "The Merchant of 
Venice," as directed by Peter Sellars and set in Los Angeles, will be among the 
offerings at "Everybody's Shakespeare," an international drama and music 
festival that opens in London Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthlong festival is sponsored by the Royal Shakespeare Company, the 
Barbican Centre and the BBC. It will be at the Barbican Centre and will also 
include readings, lectures and workshops with leading actors and directors, 
films and other plays. A series of concerts will also take place in nearby St. 
Giles' Church, where Shakespeare is known to have worshiped.

of Home on Mt. Everest 
</P>
<P>
 A Scottish company is installing a lulu of a loo at the 20,000-foot mark on 
Mt. Everest. 
</P>
<P>
 Associated Metal of Glasgow designed and built the 320-pound, $11,000 commode 
for a British scientific expedition this month, according to the Times of 
London. The team, which includes doctors and environmentalists, plans to study 
the environmental damage caused to the fragile ecology of the Everest region by 
the relatively large number of climbers -- more than 50 each year -- who now 
reach the summit and who leave their footprints -- and worse -- behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem faced by the designers of the lavatory, made almost 
entirely from stainless steel, was how to cope with the night temperatures on 
Everest, which at this time of year regularly fall below freezing. They believe 
they have averted the danger of skin being welded to metal, a hazard well known 
to polar explorers, by equipping the device with a wooden seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Firmly anchored against expectations of ferocious wind, the cubicle will be 
positioned near the edge of the Everest ice layer. When the expedition is over, 
the lavatory will be moved farther down the mountain, where it will be 
available for use by subsequent expeditions. New Bank Notes in Mexico 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico has put two new bank notes worth 200 and 500 new pesos into 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bills, worth about $60 and $155, will be harder to counterfeit and 
will carry the designation "new pesos" only for a time until the "new" will be 
dropped, according to the Bank of Mexico. The notes were introduced Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 New pesos came into circulation in January, 1993, when Mexico dropped the 
three zeros on currency to make mathematical calculations more manageable. The 
faces will be changed on notes New Museums in Maryland, Missouri 
</P>
<P>
 Two new galleries featuring modern and contemporary art are opening this month 
in Maryland and Missouri.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: CORONADO; THE DEL ALTERNATIVE; FOR THOSE WHO'VE DONE THE HOTEL 
DEL CORONADO, THE NEWISH LOEWS IS A WATER- THEMED RESORT WITH A KID-FRIENDLY 
ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT GERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Gerber, formerly an editor at The Times, 
recently moved to London. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I love the sea, but it doesn't love me. Every time I get on a bobbing object, 
be it a mall-size cruise ship or a single-person sailboat, my stomach 
flip-flops, my head swirls and I turn the color of pea soup. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why my husband, who has an iron stomach and is all too familiar with 
the vagaries of mine, guffawed when I suggested we try the family nautical 
weekend package at Loews Coronado Bay Resort. The package cost ($174 plus tax) 
includes use of a sailboat, paddle boat or kayak on each day of your stay, plus 
box lunches (if you're still hungry after the aquatic escapade) and a double 
bay - view room that, alone, ordinarily goes for $205 plus tax. The room with 
its two queen-size beds was a good setup for the four of us, but in fact, the 
hotel told us they would move in roll - aways and cribs for more children if 
needed.  
</P>
<P>
 A landlubber I may be, but even motion-sick wimps -- and we are legion -- can 
harbor hope of someday, somehow savoring the bite of ocean spray full in the 
face without losing one's cookies. The Loews Coronado turned out to be my grand 
compromise -- sort of like taking a luxury cruise without leaving terra firma. 
</P>
<P>
 The place also turned out to be that rarest of things: a swank setting with a 
kid-friendly attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband, two tykes aged 4 and 8, and I set off on a blustery spring 
Saturday, arriving under skies the color of angry bruises. Riggings on 
teak-trimmed yachts moored in the hotel's 80-slip marina -- yes, guests can 
dock just steps from the main lobby -- clanked in the heavy wind. Visions of 
spending the weekend zonked out on Dramamine rolled through my head. Hang on, 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was steadied by the hotel's setting, which seems like a private island 
community entered through guarded gates. The resort is actually on a sub - 
peninsula -- a 15-acre spit of land attached to the spine of the Coronado 
peninsula, a few miles south of the venerable Hotel Del Coronado and 10 miles 
north of the border. But it gives the appearance of being surrounded by water 
-- on one side is the whitecapped Pacific and Silver Strand beach, on the other 
San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The water line continues within the resort itself, which has three swimming 
pools. And moving farther inward, each room features a huge steeping tub big 
enough to float 100 rubber duckies. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobby is elegant, with overstuffed chairs upholstered in tapestry. A 
double staircase swoops elegantly in a semicircle to the upper floor. I could 
see why the Loews chain was recently ranked by Consumer Reports magazine among 
the top 10 luxury hotel chains in the nation.  
</P>
<P>
 As we headed to our room we passed a Ping-Pong patio with two tables, then a 
game room with a pool table and a group of pint-size pinball wizards fixated by 
the blinking lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth, our 8-year-old who competes on a swim team and who, I suspect, is 
part fish, wasted no time unpacking and practically dove into her swimsuit. 
With the 4-year-old in hand, we trailed after her toward the pools and set up 
camp on one of a multitude of lounge chairs. We read while she and Emma 
navigated the waters. 
</P>
<P>
 As the afternoon waned the air turned brisk, but the sun -- peeping in and out 
of gliding clouds -- stayed hot. We were almost tempted to order a drink from 
the poolside bar, but decided instead to save ourselves for dinner at the 
hotel's Azzura Point Restaurant. Oh, were we glad we did. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, to make sure we enjoyed what was billed as a sophisticated meal, we 
signed the shorter members of our group up for the Commodore Kids Club. Oh, 
were we really glad we did. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is a parental version of having your cake and eating it too -- enjoy 
the kids but also cut some time out for adult pursuits, even a bit of romance. 
Because the club is held in a large playroom on the first floor of one of the 
building's guest wings, the children are never more than five minutes away. The 
service can be booked hourly or daily and can include meals. (It's basically 
$30 per child aged 4-12 for all day; $12 for the first child, $6 for the second 
for an evening -- and the hotel is offering free Commodore Kids Club baby - 
sitting Friday and Saturday nights Nov. 20-Dec. 30.) 
</P>
<P>
 We dropped Emma and Elizabeth off to a roomful of giggling kids, pizza and an 
"Aladdin" video. We blew a kiss goodby, but the phantom smooch fell into 
oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Azzura Point, the tonier of the hotel's two restaurants, is a light, airy 
affair up the grand staircase and above the main lobby on the second floor. It 
commands a panoramic view of San Diego Bay and the Coronado bridge. The menu is 
Pacific Rim, which means it features lots of fish and some beef.  
</P>
<P>
 We chose a crisp Sauvignon blanc from a list that read like the best and the 
brightest of boutique wineries in the Sonoma and Napa valleys. My red and 
yellow tomato salad with grilled asparagus in a basil vinaigrette was a 
delightful eye-opener. My husband "ooohhhhed" and "ahhhhhhhed" through crispy 
bites of lobster spring rolls in a sweet and sour Thai sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 I savored my grilled yellow-fin tuna with tomato black olive caponata without 
once offering a taste to my dining companion -- some things are too good to 
share. To his credit, he did offer me a taste of the abundant shellfish that 
accompanied his grilled Pacific swordfish -- but just a taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 10 p.m. and the kids' joint was still jumpin' when we returned to pick 
up Emma and Elizabeth, who each had made several new friends. Only promises of 
sea-faring adventures pulled them away from their party. 
</P>
<P>
 We awoke the next morning to a steady drizzle -- the angry storm clouds from 
the day before had turned into a sullen blanket that blocked out the sunshine. 
The crestfallen children revved up a serious chorus of whining. "Whhhhhat dooo 
we doooo noooooooowwwwww?" 
</P>
<P>
 I did what any parent in my situation, and with the same resources, would have 
done -- ordered room service. They were thrilled, especially when the busboy 
showed up with the silver-plated service. 
</P>
<P>
 So there we sat huddled as it drizzled, munching and slurping with the sliding 
glass doors open, peering beyond the balcony to a grand vista of San Diego Bay, 
the Coronado Bridge and the occasional boat that motored by right outside our 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 By late morning a strong breeze had blown all the clouds away, so we put on 
our windbreakers and, bobbing against the breeze like a bunch of drunken 
sailors, headed for the dock. 
</P>
<P>
 The wind that had brought a crystalline beauty to the day unfortunately had 
its dark side -- unless we were experienced sailors, the weather was too rough 
for taking out the small boats, the hotel boat keeper explained.  
</P>
<P>
 Serious whining threatened to return until the young man suggested we try 
playing around in the neighboring protected cays with the two-man paddle boats. 
Sign us up, we said, and he did, outfitting us all with life jackets, then 
giving us a quick lesson in navigation. We mastered the essentials really 
quickly and headed out to the cays, a parent and child in each paddle boat.  
</P>
<P>
 The wind kicked up sprays of salt water in our faces, the sun was burnishing 
our skin to a golden tan, we were all having a good laugh and it felt grand to 
be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 So this is what people mean when they talk about the romance of the sea, I 
thought. OK, so my boat is a wimpy paddle boat, but I was keeping down 
breakfast and looking forward to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, it was a grand start, launched by an elegant resort. And if things 
started to get woozy, I could be comforted by the reassurance of one thing:

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: TRAVEL INSURANCE YOU MAY NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two recent disasters, the pneumonic plague outbreak in India and the 
shigellosis outbreak aboard the Viking Serenade cruise ship, are sad reminders 
that travel insurance, including evacuation insurance, can be an essential tool 
for travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the worst case scenarios: A traveler falls ill in a remote area of the 
world, cannot get medical treatment and needs an air ambulance out. Later, he 
or she receives another nasty surprise: a $20,000 evacuation bill that is not 
covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that travel health insurance and evacuation coverage are 
offered by numerous companies and rates have remained fairly stable for the 
past few years. However, travelers should carefully examine language on 
policies being considered: Exclusions and exceptions are common. Some policies, 
for example, specifically exclude coverage for injuries from mountain climbing 
and other adventure activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Before considering coverage, it's a good idea for travelers to call their own 
health insurance carriers to find out exactly what is and isn't covered during 
both domestic and foreign travel, experts said. (Many health care plans cover 
medical expenses during both, but it's best to check ahead of time. Emergency 
evacuation, whether domestic or foreign, can be excluded from coverage or have 
restrictions.) Then find a policy that fills in the gaps of the existing policy 
without duplicating coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Many traditional health care plans cover medical emergencies and "urgent 
health matters" overseas. Older travelers are more likely to buy special travel 
coverage, partly because Medicare generally does not pay for hospital or 
medical services outside the United States. "Most of our clientele are 55 to 
70" years old, said Chad Emery, spokesman for Access America, a travel health 
insurance provider. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to providing health-care and evacuation coverage, some companies 
offer help in finding a physician or hospital away from home and will even 
contact a personal physician at home. Some will provide a hospital deposit and 
offer pre-trip medical referral information. (They also offer insurance 
packages to ensure against baggage delay, trip cancellation and flight 
insurance for accidental death or dismemberment.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider travel health insurance a supplement to the health policy 
travelers already have," said Jenny Van Soelen, a spokeswoman for Travel 
Assure, one company that offers travel health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance experts recommend shopping around to find a policy that best 
complements your existing health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try to compare features," said Harvie Raymond, a spokesman for the Health 
Insurance Assn. of America, a Washington-based trade group representing 
commercial health insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important, too, to ask about the payment arrangement. Some plans pay for 
services as they occur; others reimburse travelers after arrival home. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying for travel health and evacuation insurance is easy. "There are no 
medical questions," said Van Soelen. "It's basically filling out an 
application." 
</P>
<P>
 This does not mean that every health care expense will be covered. Coverage 
with Travel Assure, for example, excludes benefits for injuries resulting from 
participation in races, speed or endurance contests, mountain climbing or 
organized sporting competitions. Before buying a policy, look for what is 
generally referred to as a general exclusions provision. It tells travelers 
what conditions are not covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay special attention, too, to the explanation of medical benefits paid. With 
the Travel Assure plan, for example, the sickness expense benefit is only 
payable for illness when "no medical advice, consultation or treatment 
(excluding prescription drugs) has been given for 60 days (30 in Illinois)" 
before travel. When a claim is filed, a common policy is to research the 
client's medical history to determine if the expense was related to a 
pre-existing condition. Benefits may not be payable for travel to certain 
locations. Access America, for example, denies coverage for travel to Nigeria, 
Vietnam and numerous other destinations "recognized by the State Department as 
being unsafe," according to a company representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs vary. One company, International SOS Assistance, offers a $40 membership 
for a trip of up to 14 days. Included are medical assistance, a hospital 
deposit guarantee, the cost of dispatching a doctor, emergency evacuation and a 
host of other services. There are discounted packages for frequent travelers, 
couples and families. 
</P>
<P>
 HealthCare Abroad, another plan, costs $3 a day for trips ranging from 10 to 
120 days. Coverage includes up to $100,000 in benefits after a deductible of 
$100. Benefits can be used for doctors' fees, hospital charges, prescription 
medicine, evacuation and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last-minute sign-ups are usually accepted, company representatives say. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information: Access America, (800) 284-8300; HealthCare Abroad, (800) 
237-6615; International SOS Assistance (800) 523-8930; Travel Assure (800) 
228-9792.

TASTE OF TRAVEL: CALIFORNIA: LIFE IN THE FEAST LANE; PIGGING OUT ALONG HIGHWAY 
99 MEANS SLICING THROUGH THE STATE'S MANY CULTURES AND CUISINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KITTY MORSE, Morse is a free-lance writer based in Vista. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I plan a trip up north to Sacramento or the Bay Area, I try to allow an 
extra day for travel. That way I can abandon the gray infinity of Interstate 5 
in favor of the more leisurely drive up my favorite highway: California 99. 
</P>
<P>
 But my real reason for choosing 99 over I-5 is connected with my interest in 
food, for the historic road links a string of ethnic groups, each steeped in 
the flavors of its country of origin. With a little advance preparation and a 
few extra hours, the trip along the four-lane highway turns into a wonderful 
eating experience. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time my husband and I reached our final destination in Lodi, our 
gastronomic adventure included an authentic Basque lunch, a Swedish 
smorgasbord, a superb grilled lamb kebab sandwich, a towering ice cream sundae, 
spicy Portuguese-style linguica sausage and a taste of fragrant olive oils 
topped off with French country-style sausages and pates.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus it was that on a hazy morning last January we left the interstate behind 
and headed off on California 99 north toward Bakersfield. To the right and left 
of us, fields of cotton extended as far as the eye could see, interrupted here 
and there by emerald fields of alfalfa. Dozens of oil pumps bobbed up and down 
hypnotically, permanent reminders of Bakersfield's economic origins in the 
discovery of oil. On several occasions, however, strategically placed signs 
facing the freeway announced: "Farm plus water equals jobs" or, "1 in 10 jobs 
in the state are derived from agriculture" -- facts urban dwellers tend to 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to petroleum and agriculture, the Bakersfield area is also a 
leader in California's sheep industry. This is thanks to the first Basque 
sheepherders who saw in the rolling hills stretching toward the snow-covered 
Sierras a New World version of their native Pyrenees. To this day, Basques of 
French and Spanish extraction make up a thriving community that perpetuates its 
culinary traditions by operating several family-run restaurants. Led by the 
recommendation of a local expert, we made our way to the somewhat seedy 
industrial area of town for an authentic Basque lunch at the Wool Growers 
Restaurant. The small neon sign bearing a sheep hanging over the front door was 
the only way to distinguish the restaurant from its drab surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, however, an entirely different scene unfolded. When we arrived at 
about 11:30 a.m., hardly a space was left in the restaurant's front section. We 
were invited to sit facing each other on either side of narrow tables set 
end-to-end across the room. From our central vantage point, we could take in 
the crowded booths and the quaint flowered wallpaper, as well as the front door 
that opened and closed incessantly on groups of patrons, many of whom greeted 
the staff by name. By noon, it was standing room only at the Wool Grower's 
impressive bar, and the huge banquet hall at the back was quickly filling up. 
</P>
<P>
 Our waitress, Jovita, immediately presented us with a basket of freshly baked 
bread and a steaming bowl of soup, all served family-style. When we asked if it 
was homemade, she assured us, in the softest of Castillan accents, that 
everything served was made in the restaurant. One spoonful of the hearty 
vegetable soup was enough to win us over. She then placed before us a bowl of 
Basque-style beans with a side of picante fresh salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the main course arrived we had turned into fans of Basque cuisine. 
While I savored two succulent, inch-thick lamb chops ($9) slathered in fresh 
garlic and some of the tastiest French fries this side of the Atlantic, my 
husband relished every bite of his red wine-flavored oxtail stew ($6.50). A 
bowl of crisp iceberg lettuce tossed in vinaigrette rounded off the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 What better way to follow a Basque luncheon than with a visit to a Basque 
bakery? That was our plan as we dropped by the Pyrenees French Bakery -- open 
50 years and still going strong. The small storefront, fragrant with the scent 
of baking bread, represents merely a fraction of the extensive on-site 
operation that supplies most area grocers and restaurants with plump loaves of 
French sourdough ($1.89). 
</P>
<P>
 Munching on the crusty heel of a warm baguette, we looked in on the Noriega 
Hotel, a local landmark since 1893. The long, dark bar at the front of the 
family-run restaurant seemed lifted straight out of Basque country, complete 
with small groups of Spanish-speaking men in black berets whiling away the time 
drinking picon, a local punch made of brandy, grenadine and a few secret 
ingredients. The hotel also boasts its own private jai alai court. In the early 
afternoon, the tables in its refectory-like dining room were being covered with 
red and white checkered tablecloths in preparation for the evening meal. At 
Noriega's, meals are served family-style at a single seating at noon ($8) and 
again at 7 p.m. ($15). Since on this occasion our schedule precluded another 
Basque feast, we hit the road in search of dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Our destination was Superior Dairy Products in Hanford, a little more than an 
hour to the north. San Joaquin's South Valley has long been known as 
California's dairy land and has overtaken Wisconsin as the nation's leader in 
the number of dairy cattle. Superior Dairy Products has been making bountiful 
use of local milk and cream products since 1929. Located across from Hanford's 
lovely renovated Courthouse Square, the landmark ice cream parlor/diner is 
still the gathering spot of choice for local ice cream lovers. On the afternoon 
we dropped by, a handful of retirees seated at the counter were chatting over 
mugs of steaming coffee, while the pink plastic booths provided a nostalgic 
haven for those savoring the dairy's creamy delights. We opted for a scoop of 
pecan crisp ($1.60) and the S.O.S. (Superior Oversize Sundae, $6.80) -- a 
mini-Mt. Everest fashioned from seven scoops of vanilla ice cream and sherbet, 
covered in an avalanche of fruit, nuts and whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to dairy farmers -- many of them Dutch -- Hanford once also 
sheltered our country's largest settlement of Chinese immigrants, who were 
brought in from San Francisco to work on railroads around the state. The 
renovated, half-block-long China Alley (a former Chinese neighborhood) remains 
a historic legacy to those people, as does the 19th-Century Taoist temple, 
which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Occupying most of what is 
left of China Alley, the famous Imperial Dynasty is an elegant restaurant that 
is celebrated for its fine continental cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 From Hanford, we needed only to drive a little farther up 99 to sample the 
flavors of Sweden. Swedish immigrants from Michigan settled in the quaint town 
of Kingsburg in the early 1880s after the railroad came through, and the town 
commemorates the event with a Swedish Festival each May. (The town also 
celebrates its heritage with the Santa Lucia Day, this year Dec. 10.) Draper 
Street, the town's main artery, is lined with quaint renovated shops, including 
Juen Olsson Hess' Svensk Butik. The Olsson family is counted among the city's 
pioneers, and Hess presides in full Swedish regalia over a store filled floor 
to ceiling with Swedish souvenirs and foods. During the annual May festival, 
Hess and compatriots serve up steaming bowls of traditional yellow pea soup and 
Swedish pancakes, and host a smorgasbord (a traditional Swedish buffet) in the 
park next to the town's Coffee Pot water tower. 
</P>
<P>
 When they are not personally introducing visitors to the intricacies of 
Swedish cuisine, the residents of Kingsburg patronize the Swedish Mill 
Restaurant and Gift Shop (look for the windmill at the Conejo off-ramp). Every 
day at lunch and dinner the restaurant unfolds a smorgasbord with salads, 
roasted meats and special dishes, such as meatloaf baked in a golden pie crust, 
and thin pancakes smothered in whipped cream and berries (lunch $6.95 and 
dinner $8.85 per person). 
</P>
<P>
 On the outskirts of Kingsburg, acres of vines surrounding the town are visual 
proof of the importance of the grape to the local economy. One place to sample 
the dried end product is at the Sun-Maid Growers Store. The cheery 
establishment stands among warehouses and hangars that make up the Sun-Maid 
compound. This is one of the best places along 99 to purchase raisins, prunes, 
almonds and walnuts in bulk or pre-packaged. Whenever I drop in, I like to 
sample chocolate-covered raisins or newly developed (and delicious) lemon- or 
orange-flavored prunes, while pondering the purchase of an apron, a license 
plate or a thermometer, all bearing the familiar Sun-Maid logo of the young 
girl in her bonnet. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes up the road, the town of Fresno is home to a large population 
of Armenians. Like their Basque neighbors to the south, they are especially 
conscious of their culinary heritage and offer it for all to sample in a number 
of eating places. 
</P>
<P>
 At George's Shish Kebob Restaurant in the Galleria Shopping Center, behind the 
Fresno Convention Center, Armenian, American and Middle Eastern foods are daily 
features on the menu. At lunchtime this busy Armenian bistro is packed with 
county workers and businessmen sinking their teeth into enormous sandwiches 
bulging with grilled meat or roast chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner George Koroyan often mans the stove, and those who sit at the counter 
facing the open kitchen can engage him in conversation. On my most recent 
visit, I feasted on what was possibly one of the best sandwiches I have ever 
eaten: meltingly tender chunks of marinated and grilled lamb stuffed inside a 
freshly baked pita as airy as a cloud ($6.50). Enough was left of the sandwich, 
the accompanying rice pilaf and the green salad to make lunch the next day. My 
husband, similarly, made two meals out of another of George's specialties, an 
oversized lamb shank, cooked to such moist tenderness that it made use of a 
knife quite unnecessary ($7.75.) 
</P>
<P>
 Along with ethnic foods, stone fruits and nuts are part of Fresno County's 
bounty. If I happen to travel up 99 in early spring, I like to follow the 
"Fresno Blossom Trail" map through the flowering almond trees on the outskirts 
of Fresno. (The map is distributed by the Fresno Visitors' Bureau.) That way I 
can view at close range acres of orchards awash in a sea of fluttering pink and 
white petals. In season, there is also ripe fruit -- peaches, plums, apples -- 
available in abundance at any number of fruit stands, or at stores such as the 
pretty Valley Pistachio, a stone's throw off 99 in Madera. It carries many of 
the locally grown nuts, as well as jellies and preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign for one of those country farm stands recently lured us off the freeway 
in Merced, right into the parking lot of the Merced County Agricultural Museum, 
a few miles east of Highway 99 on California 140. The small museum, a 
reconverted warehouse, is the brainchild of private collector Charlie Parish 
who has gathered an eclectic collection of old farm machinery and hog oilers, 
among many other items. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing northward, it would be easy to blink past the hamlet of Livingston 
were it not for the stop light that halts traffic at the corner of Highway 99 
and Livingston Cressey Road. The busy corner holds the Yamato Colony Farmers' 
Market, a stand renowned throughout the valley for its local produce, and 
behind it, the Foster Farms Livingston Cafe, which is owned by Foster Farms, 
one of the state's largest poultry producers. If I feel like a snack in 
Livingston, I stop at the cafe to purchase a box of tasty chicken nuggets, (5 
for $2.19, 10 for $3.89) to dunk in the restaurant's honey mustard or barbecue 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 When time permits, in Turlock I stop by Latif's, the town's landmark coffee 
shop, for a linguica sausage sandwich and a mound of golden fries ($4.95). A 
large population of Portuguese immigrants from the Azores have long had a 
presence in Turlock, leaving their culinary imprint on the local scene. Latif's 
has been part of the Turlock landscape since 1947, although it has been under 
the ownership of Shirley and Robert Stevens for the past 20 years. The 
restaurant enjoys such repute that George Bush made a campaign stop here in 
1988 -- a fact commemorated on the back of a stool at the horseshoe-shaped 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Turlock melts into the suburbs of Modesto, its immediate neighbor to the 
north. To this area the Italians brought with them a tradition for making fine 
wines and olive oil. For me, the locally produced product from Sciabica Olive 
Oil holds special appeal. Sciabica's oil has been produced in Modesto since 
1936. The Sciabicas grow their own olives organically in their orchard near 
Sacramento and their Marsala Olive Fruit oil has won a number of culinary 
awards. Five miles north of downtown Modesto, a newly expanded warehouse and 
gift store are open to the public during business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oakdale, a few miles outside town, fall apple season provides ample excuse 
to drop by the Bloomingcamp Ranch nestled among rolling acres of apple trees. 
Joy Bloomingcamp and her husband, Bill, grow more than two dozen varieties and 
sell them from their apple-filled gift shop. Their in-store bakery specializes 
in huge apple dumplings, and what may well be the tallest apple pies in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 A French-owned operation, the Country Sausage Kitchen in Lodi is a mandatory 
stop on my Highway 99 gourmet itinerary. The small manufacturing plant is the 
domain of sausage-maker Gus Foucher and his family who emigrated from France to 
Canada before settling in Lodi. Gus, his wife, Berthe, and several of their 
eight children all help in the running of the company. The Fouchers produce a 
line of sausages, pates and other exquisite deli items such as linguica, a 
delicious and lean chicken apple sausage, tasty Cajun andouille and a personal 
favorite, curly links of merguez, a cumin-scented sausage from North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Country Sausage Kitchen and all its counterparts along the road epitomize 
the unique food purveyors scattered along Highway 99 -- all artisans who to me 
represent the true "soul food" of California. GUIDEBOOK

HIKING: CALIFORNIA: A TOP-10 LIST OF PLACES WHERE PATHS LEAD TO CENTURY-OLD 
BUILDINGS, AND THE PAST COMES ALIVE

 When Californians think of state parks, most picture the natural treasures 
those parks preserve: ancient redwoods, dramatic mountains, warm sandy beaches 
from San Clemente to Refugio. Fewer travelers know that some parks also 
interpret California history. These State Historic Parks, as they're called 
officially, offer great walks, as well as learning experiences for young and 
old. They beckon us from our state's well-traveled highways to the remote 
byways where many are located. 
</P>
<P>
 Some historic parks consist of a single building in a remote locale; others 
include blocks of significant structures surrounded by cities such as Sonoma, 
Sacramento, Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to see them is on foot. From Old Town San Diego to the Old Custom 
House in Monterey, from the Santa Barbara Presidio to the Shasta County 
Courthouse, the walking is easy -- a few blocks, a half-mile, a mile at most. 
And all are fascinating hikes into history. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission charges vary from park to park. Like their nature park cousins, some 
of our state's 40 historic parks charge a $5 per vehicle entry fee. Others let 
you park your car free but charge a couple of dollars per person to visit a 
historic building or museum. Some parks charge for guided tours, some do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is my top-10 list of walks, from south to north. It's admittedly 
subjective and, uncharacteristically for me, with history celebrated first and 
the walks themselves taking second place. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Town San Diego State Historic Park, built around a central plaza, offers a 
six-block stroll through California history during the latter part of Mexican 
control, and later, during our early American days. Walkers can view La Casa de 
Bandini, built in 1829 as a hotel and stagecoach station and now a restaurant; 
La Casa de Estudillo, a mansion with a lovely courtyard -- among the finest of 
the original adobe buildings; Casa de Altamirano, Old Town's first frame 
building, restored as it was in 1868, when it housed the San Diego Union 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Other historic buildings include a schoolhouse and a stable with a carriage 
collection. Shoppers can explore specialty shops, while diners can select from 
several Mexican restaurants or an Italian or Greek eatery. Old Town San Diego 
is located near the junction of Interstate 5 and Interstate 8; 4002 Wallace 
St., San Diego, 92110; tel. (619) 220-5422. 
</P>
<P>
 El Presidio de Santa Barbara State Historic Park, located in downtown Santa 
Barbara on Canon Perdido Street a block east of the chief thoroughfare, State 
Street, preserves a part of the old military fortress built by the Spanish in 
1782 to guard the central coast. A walking tour (pamphlet available from Santa 
Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation) can visit El Cuartel, the old 
guardhouse and Santa Barbara's oldest adobe. A must-see is the recently 
restored Presidio Chapel, a re-creation of the city's first church. The Spanish 
artifacts on the altar and colorful wall paintings provide an interesting 
contrast to the building's simple exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Park headquarters, located in a historic adobe on Canon Perdido Street, 
displays artifacts found on the presidio. Several nearby adobes and historical 
buildings, as well as the beautiful Santa Barbara Courthouse and the Santa 
Barbara Historical Museum, entice the walker to further explore what is one of 
the West Coast's most walkable cities; Santa Barbara Trust for Historic 
Preservation, P.O. Box 388, Santa Barbara, 93102; tel. (805) 965-0093. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument (Hearst Castle) offers four 
fabulous walking tours of the palatial estate of the late newspaper tycoon 
William Randolph Hearst. More than 1 million visitors a year view the 
collection of world treasures on display in the 130-room home. Tour No. 1, 
recommended for first-time visitors, includes the major rooms of the mansion, 
swimming pools and gardens. Other tours, restricted to much smaller groups (12 
to 15 people) cover the upper levels of the castle, the castle's guest wing, 
gardens, pools, wine cellar and guest house. Tour tickets are $14 for adults; 
$8 for children 6 through 12. After the tour, enjoy a picnic at William R. 
Hearst Memorial State Beach on San Simeon Road, east of California 1. Nearby 
Sebastian General Store, established in 1873, sells food and snacks; P.O. Box 
8, San Simeon, 94352, tel. for recorded information (805) 927-2000; tel. MISTIX 
for tour reservations (800) 444-4445. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey State Historic Park beckons California history enthusiasts, 
architects and city strollers to spend a day walking Monterey's "Path of 
History." Guide maps and pamphlets are available at park headquarters next to 
the Old Custom House, the oldest government building on the Pacific Coast. The 
building now houses a collection of clothing, leather goods and china -- items 
typical of what was imported through the port of Old Monterey. After Mexico 
obtained its independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican flag flew over 
Monterey. It is this era and the early American era that followed that is 
emphasized by the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robert Louis Stevenson House, Pacific House (where there's a museum of 
California history), California's first theater (which is still in use), plus 
other old adobes are part of the park. A walking path leads a few blocks south 
to Fisherman's Wharf and a few blocks north to Cannery Row and the Monterey Bay 
Aquarium. Family hint: Most kids are lots more interested in watching barking 
sea lions near the wharf than, say, tracing the origins of Monterey-style 
architecture. Tour the historic park before visiting Monterey's livelier 
attractions; Monterey State Historic Park, 20 Custom House Plaza, Monterey, 
93940; tel. (408) 649-7118. 
</P>
<P>
 San Juan Bautista State Historic Park in central California preserves the 
original town plaza, the old Plaza Hotel and the Mexican-era home of leading 
citizen Jose Castro. The park is located in San Juan Bautista, a few miles off 
U.S. 101 between Salinas and Gilroy. During the last century, the town was an 
important stop on the stage route between Northern and Southern California. 
Drowsy but intriguing San Juan Bautista is well worth the short detour today -- 
a nice rest stop for the Bay-bound traveler. Visit the well-preserved carriage 
and coach collection on display at the old stable. Further beckoning the walker 
is the modest Mission San Juan Bautista, founded in 1797 and now a parish 
church where Mass is still celebrated. Next to the church is a small history 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Inviting shops and restaurants adjacent to the park suggest further 
exploration. Those who really want to get off the beaten track will drive 11 
miles out of town on San Juan Canyon Road and Fremont Peak State Park. A 
half-mile hike to the top of 3,169-foot Fremont Peak rewards the walker with a 
tremendous panorama of San Benito Valley, Monterey Bay and the rugged Santa 
Lucia Mountains of Big Sur; P.O. Box 1110, San Juan Bautista, 95045; tel. (408) 
623-4881. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonoma State Historic Parks in downtown Sonoma, preserves Mission San 
Francisco Solano, last of the Franciscan missions built. The mission, founded 
in 1823, is now a museum. A self-guided walking tour (pick up a map at 
visitor's center at the mission or at the barracks) winds through the streets 
surrounding the town's central plaza and visits more than a dozen buildings 
constructed between 1823 and 1855. 
</P>
<P>
 The parks include the home of Mexican Gen. Mariano Vallejo on Third Street, 
the mission, the soldier's barracks and the Casa Grande area (servants quarters 
for Vallejo). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1834, Vallejo arrived in Sonoma with instructions to secularize the mission 
and lay out a town. On the north side of the town plaza is the site of the 
general's first home, Casa Grande. Vallejo's home, his 1852 residence, is a 
half-mile from the plaza on Third Street. After admiring all that adobe 
architecture around Sonoma Plaza, you're surprised to find that Vallejo's home 
is built in New England-style. Vallejo's storehouse is now a museum on the 
general, who after California became American territory, served as mayor of 
Sonoma and later as a state senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonoma's shady, open, Mediterranean-style plaza is a good spot for picnics or 
relaxation. Near the plaza are numerous shops and restaurants; 20 E. Spain St., 
Sonoma, 95476; tel. (707) 938-1519. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodie State Historic Park, between Nevada and Yosemite National Park, 
preserves a one-time gold mining boom town during the 1870s-'80s. A park 
brochure details a lengthy 69-stop walking tour of Bodie, which has a 
remarkably diverse collection of buildings in various states of decrepitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodie is a step back in time; a curious, isolated world that at first glance 
appears to be far removed from the present. But there is also a perceptible 
sense of peace; a comfortable familiarity about a place that was once home to 
nearly 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to the abandoned town, southeast of the small town of Bridgeport, can 
be tricky. Only one of the roads leading in is paved and even that ends up as 
three miles of dirt and rock. But the rugged, time-consuming drive is quite 
fitting, considering the town's rough-and-rowdy heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the park is open year-round, once the winter snows hit, the roads are 
not plowed, leaving Bodie virtually inaccessible during the notoriously long 
and brutal winters. Intrepid souls still manage to get through -- on mountain 
bikes, cross-country skis and four-wheel drives. Yet the vast majority of 
visitors to Bodie arrive during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The remote location, the ramshackle buildings, the cemetery at the edge of 
town -- the entire place gives the appearance of a Hollywood film set. But 
there's no fakery here. Part of Bodie's appeal is the dignity with which it's 
been allowed to age without insensitive restoration or commercialism. The old 
Miners' Union Hall is today the park museum for Bodie, which is considered by 
many to be the best ghost town in the West; P.O. Box 515, Bridgeport, 93517; 
tel. (619) 647-6445. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia State Historic Park, on California 49 north of Sonora, southeast of 
Sacramento, offers an excellent self-guided walk through one of the best 
preserved of California's gold rush towns. 
</P>
<P>
 When gold was discovered here in 1850, the hamlet of Hildreth's Diggins 
mushroomed into the metropolis of Columbia (population 6,000), making it, for a 
short time, the second-largest city in California. Columbia boomed for 20 years 
as more than a billion dollars in gold was mined from the surrounding Sierra 
foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-block, self-guided tour explores what is now a booming tourist town, 
complete with blacksmith shop, hotel, bakery, theater, shops, restaurants and 
saloons. Visitors can ride a stagecoach or pan for gold. A mile-long nature 
trail introduces visitors to Western Sierra flora; P.O. Box 151, Columbia, 
95310; tel. (209) 532-0150. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Sacramento State Historic Park offers a wonderful self-guided walking 
tour, which begins at the visitor center on Front Street (pick up a map there). 
Stroll along the balcony-covered boardwalk and relive the early days of 
California's state capital while simultaneously enjoying the shops and 
restaurants in the historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Four Building (an operating replica of the 1880s hardware store that 
once stood there), the building that was the western terminus of the Pony 
Express in 1860 and the first meeting place of the California Supreme Court are 
among the landmarks along the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Another highlight is the California State Railroad Museum, the largest 
interpreted railroad museum in North America. You'll view some lovingly 
restored steam engines, including the 1863 C.P. Huntington, as well as a 
variety of other rolling stock in impressive settings. More cars and 
locomotives are on display at a restored 1867 freight depot a block from the 
museum.

 Old Sacramento State Historic Park is easy to find via an Interstate 5 exit 
and a well-signed route along the city's one-way streets; 101 J St., 
Sacramento, 95814; tel. (916) 445-7387. 
</P>
<P>
 Shasta State Historic Park, in the Klamath Mountains of northwest California, 
preserves the business district of Shasta, known in the 1850s as the capital of 
our state's northern gold mines. Many of the buildings are in ruins, but the 
park preserves two major structures: the Shasta County Courthouse and Litsch 
General Store, now both museums. A self-guided walk (brochure available from 
the park visitor center) takes in the historic business district and the ruins 
of "Brick Row" which, during the prosperous 1850s, was once one of California's 
largest communities. Footpaths lead to a pioneer cemetery and to various ruins 
scattered about the park; P.O. Box 2430, Shasta, 96087; tel. (916) 243-8194.

DESTINATION: NEPAL; A FAR-AWAY VEGAS; CASINOS GIVE KATMANDU A NEW SPIN ON THE 
TERM LONG SHOT  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Dahlburg is The Times' bureau chief 
in New Dehli. Dhruba H. Adhikary, a Katmandu-based journalist, contributed to 
this report. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Walk out the entrance of the Soaltee Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, turn right, 
stroll past the burly man with the mustache and piercing gaze, plunge 
downstairs, and prepare for a unique Nepali experience. 
</P>
<P>
 There, gleaming with lights of the same multicolored hues as a roll of 
LifeSavers, the shiny imported machines line the walls, their unfamiliar 
foreign names positively glowing with temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 There's King Lotus. Pinnacle Jackpot. Bally Quarters. And keno. 
</P>
<P>
 If fatigued from hoofing it over the Himalayas with strong-backed Sherpas or 
pondering the intricacies of Tantrism, a tourist can dwell here on other 
mysteries: For instance, how those five slot machines in the corner labeled 
"McCarran Airport" got here from Las Vegas, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
 Four casinos, each attached to a luxury hotel, are now operating in the 
capital of Nepal, 4,500 feet above sea level, in what must be one of the most 
bizarre gambling environments anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Nepalis, who live in one of the world's poorest countries, are not allowed 
inside, except as croupiers or service personnel. Most wouldn't be able to bet 
much anyway. The annual income in this landlocked mountain kingdom averages 
less than $200. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the casinos' clientele -- about two thirds -- are visiting 
Indians, who contribute 90% of the revenue. Pakistani tourists, who are equally 
deprived of legalized gambling at home, make up the second largest contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically for fun," Santosh Tater, 36, of New Delhi, said one evening 
this summer as he made his second visit to Casino Nepal. "I do not come to earn 
a windfall profit. All I do is to throw away a couple of hundred rupees." 
</P>
<P>
 Others fare better -- like an Indian driver who was playing the slots and hit 
a jackpot of 1.7 million rupees, or $34,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although decidedly down-market by world standards -- some clients come shod in 
bath clogs -- Katmandu's gaming parlors hold a ritzy and unmistakable James 
Bond-like allure for people who have never set foot in a casino before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not here to play, or gamble," Kailash Khurana, 45, said as he wandered 
through the pillared and mirrored premises of Casino Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
 Awe-struck, the Bombay resident said he just wanted to take it all in with his 
senses. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hindi, Urdu and Western pop music plays, employees in white shirts and bow 
ties take customers' bets at three roulette wheels, four baccarat tables, a 
pair of blackjack tables and two stations devoted to a British derivative of 
blackjack called pontoon. Regional games like flush and poplu are also offered. 
</P>
<P>
 For the novice or the downright intimidated, printed guides on how to gamble 
are available. Guest relations officers are on hand to provide explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 By flashing an airline ticket within a week of arriving here, a visitor to 
Casino Nepal is delivered coupons that entitle him or her to about $13 worth of 
free chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Win or lose, if the traveler sticks around until 10 p.m., there's a free 
dinner. Transportation to and from most hotels is provided at no charge. Such 
freebies draw patrons -- such as C.K. Aggrawal, 55, owner of a Calcutta 
chemical factory -- in droves. Aggrawal and his wife came to Nepal a few weeks 
ago to visit a celebrated Hindu temple at Pashupatinath, about three miles 
northeast of Katmandu, and willingly gambled away their free chips when they 
made a stop at Casino Nepal. But they refused to bet their own money. 
</P>
<P>
 Such low-rolling visitors are on the increase, Narayan Gurung, a member of the 
casino staff, grumbled a few weeks ago. "Most of the visitors turn out to be 
people looking for free coupons and free meals," he complained. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Not far from the action, in an air-conditioned, windowless office, sits the 
American responsible for bringing keno to Katmandu. R.D. Tuttle, a 
straight-talking and engaging Oregonian, is the uncrowned king of casinos in 
Nepal. A former serviceman and ex-civil contract employee in Vietnam who left 
the United States in 1959 when he was 19, Tuttle now manages all four Katmandu 
casinos under a joint venture and operating arrangement with a Hong Kong-based 
company, Continental Resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived here in 1976, eight years after Casino Nepal opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came here, the government was ready to close the casino due to 
negative reaction over Nepalis playing," Tuttle recalls. "But we were able to 
convince them it could be a source of tourism and not contaminate Nepali 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 To enforce the government ban on locals that was enacted the year after 
Tuttle's arrival, the tall and portly P.B. Khatry stands guard nightly at 
Casino Nepal's doorway. The job of the mustachioed, laconic man in his 50s is 
to filter out Nepalis from the tourists, but no one is sure how -- or if -- he 
manages. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Nepal's first democratically elected government in three decades took 
office, and its more liberal economic policies provided leeway for increased 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992-93, three more casinos opened: the Anna at the Hotel de l'Annapurna, 
the Everest at the hotel of the same name, and Casino Royale at the Hotel Yak & 
Yeti. 
</P>
<P>
 The four casinos now employ 2,300 people, with three open around the clock and 
the fourth, Casino Royale, operating from 2 p.m. to 6 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have more employees than all five-star hotels in Nepal," boasts Tuttle, 
who imported the slot machines (including the transplants from Las Vegas' 
McCarran Airport) that now grace Casino Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, his company paid 3 million rupees, or $61,000, in royalties to 
the Nepalese government for the right to operate the casinos, he says. That fee 
has now shot up 16 times, to nearly $1 million, but Tuttle says considering the 
increased turnover and the casinos' enormous profit potential, the high cost is 
"normal."  
</P>
<P>
 As he sits at his desk, does the casino king dream of turning his domain into 
the Las Vegas of the Indian subcontinent? Yes and no. First, he says, people 
flying all the way to Nepal from Germany or California are probably not 
interested in keno or blackjack.  
</P>
<P>
 "The normal tourist coming up here is not the Vegas type," Tuttle observes. 
"They come because they enjoy trekking and hiking in a remote area." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, his establishments simply can't compete for the global carriage 
trade, Tuttle says. 
</P>
<P>
 If you come to Casino Nepal, you won't see a show with a headline act such as 
Frank Sinatra or Lena Horne. Instead, one recent evening, a singer crooned 
melancholy Urdu songs known as ghazals.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're a Class C horse, and as anybody can tell you, you don't run a Class C 
horse in a Class A race," Tuttle said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What Tuttle has his eye on is the huge customer pool much closer to home -- 
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the other countries in a region whose 
population tops 1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a couple of hours of flying time," he muses, "there's 25% of the 
world's population." 
</P>
<P>
 Contradicting some of his employees, Tuttle says plenty of guests are willing 
to bet their own money. The typical Indian, he estimates, is willing to gamble 
$50 or so per visit to Katmandu. And on an average night, he notes, 1,000 
Indians and guests from other countries troop through each of the four casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one hitch in Tuttle's grand design. Although eight cities of more 
than 8 million people each lie within two hours' flying time of Katmandu, 
Tuttle calculates, there are not enough flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nepalis, he says, are happy to get 300,000 tourists a year. In contrast, 
he reports, on a single day, the Portuguese colony of Macau, another gaming 
center, moves 50,000 people in and out aboard jet hydrofoils from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the ball on a rotating roulette wheel, the future of Nepal's casinos is 
riding on independent forces, foremost among them whether Royal Nepal Airlines, 
Indian Airlines and other regional carriers will decide to expand service to 
Katmandu.  
</P>
<P>
 "The growth potential here is greater than most places, but it depends on the 
airlines," Katmandu's casino king concludes. "There's nothing we can do about 
it." GUIDEBOOK: Katmandu Casinos

BACKPACK & BUDGET: WHAT'S IN IN INNSBRUCK 
</P>

 Innsbruck, Austria, was practically built for youth and sports. It's been a 
university town since 1669, and played host to the Winter Olympics in 1964 and 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Backpacking travelers who want to add a few days of skiing to their European 
adventure will find that it's easier now to take advantage of this city's 
special free ski services. 
</P>
<P>
 Innsbruck's tourism publication, High Mountains, Terrific Town, says travelers 
are eligible for free Club Innsbruck cards after staying just one night in this 
charming Alpine city. The cards are valid for free travel on Alpine and 
cross-country ski buses in the Innsbruck area, which operate between Dec. 19 
and April 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The cards, issued at hotels and hostels, are also valid for discounts on ski 
passes, mountain railways, museums, the Alpine Zoo, and are valid for a free 
introductory cross-country ski course in the suburban village of Igls. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpine skiers can use the free ski bus service to reach the six Innsbruck ski 
areas. If there is insufficient snow for skiing, free transport will be 
arranged to the Stubai Glacier, where skiing is available 365 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Inexpensive shared accommodations are available at several hostels affiliated 
with the Hostelling International network. Don't expect self-catering 
facilities at Austrian hostels.  
</P>
<P>
 Youth hostels scheduled to be open through the winter are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jugendherberge Glockenhaus, at Weiherburggasse 3. It has 28 beds. The fee 
per bed is $9; breakfast is $4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jugendherberge Innsbruck; Reichenauerstrasse 147. It has 178 beds. The price 
for bed and breakfast is $11.60. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jugendherberge St. Nikolaus, Innstrasse 95. There are 100 beds for $9 each. 
Breakfast is $4. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-day ski passes for individual ski areas range from $20 on a weekday at 
Glungezer to $36.50 at the Stubai Glacier. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also two new ski passes for this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Innsbruck Super Ski Pass covers all Innsbruck areas, the Stubai Glacier, 
Kitzbuhel and Arlberg. This gives skiers access to more than 300 miles of ski 
runs and 200 ski lifts. Ski bus transportation is included. An adult pass valid 
for four days within a six-day period is $140. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glacier Ski Pass covers all Innsbruck areas and the Stubai Glacier. Skiers 
have access to 75 miles of ski runs and 52 lifts. Free ski bus transportation 
is also included. The rates for Club Card holders are: three days for $80; six 
days for $150; a pass valid for three days within a four-day period is $88; 
three days within a six-day period cost $94. 
</P>
<P>
 Ski passes are not transferable. They can be purchased at all ski lift bottom 
stations and at the Innsbruck Information Office at Burggraben 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Ski rentals range from $22.25 for skis, boots and poles for one day to $92.50 
for six days.

VIDEOS: EVERYWHERE, SPECTACULAR ALASKA 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 THE COMPLETE ALASKA ( Finlay-Holiday Film Corp., 60 minutes, 1993 ).  
</P>
<P>
 Photographers in Alaska can point their cameras in almost any direction and be 
confident of capturing spectacular scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 This tour takes viewers up the Inside Passage by ferry with stops at Ketchikan 
with its totem pole centers and remote Misty Fiords National Park. The next 
stops are at the islands of Wrangell and Petersburg; Sitka, once the capital of 
Russian Alaska, and Juneau, today's capital, where a tour includes the 
Mendenhall Glacier and a helicopter ride over the ice fields. 
</P>
<P>
 From Juneau the ferry follows the Lynn Canal to Skagway with a stop at Haines 
for scenes of Tlingit Indian craftsmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading northwest, viewers cross the scenic Wrangell and St. Elias mountains 
on the way to Valdez, terminus of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. A tour includes 
the scenery of Mineral Creek Canyon and the Columbia Glacier before reaching 
Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
 On the visit to Denali National Park, the video captures mighty Mt. McKinley, 
whose 20,320-foot peak is often fog shrouded. 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to Fairbanks includes scenes of the university and a stern-wheeler 
cruise on the Chena River. Continuing north the video crosses the Arctic Circle 
and the Brooks Range to the polar desolation of the north slope tundra. This is 
Inuit land, the home of caribou, polar bears, and dog sleds. Reaching at Barrow 
there are scenes of whale hunting and other native festivities. Final scenes 
compare the stark winter beauty of Alaska with the glory of spring's rushing 
streams and wild flowers.  
</P>
<P>
 Tapes are available from Finley-Holiday Film Corp., P.O. Box 619, Whittier, 
Calif. 90608, (800) 345-6707. Price: $24.95 (plus tax and postage). 
</P>
<P>
 RIO DE JANEIRO ( Kodak Video Trip, 35 minutes, 1993 ). 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers get a colorful tour of Rio, as well as side trips.  
</P>
<P>
 Aerial and ground views show some of the incredibly crowded beaches at Ipanema 
and Copacabana, and spectacular vistas of the city from the top of Sugar Loaf 
Mountain and from the imposing statue of Christ on Corcovado Peak. Natural 
beauty is featured on a drive through the city's botanical gardens and lush 
Tijuca Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 A different perspective of this onetime capital of Brazil is gained from a 
schooner cruise of the island-studded harbor. Side trips take in the town of 
Petropolis with the summer palace of Dom Pedro II; Teresopolis, a beautiful 
area of mountains, lakes and waterfalls; the lovely Nova Friburgo Park, and the 
north shore resorts of Cabo Frio and Buzios. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapes are available from Wood Knapp Video, 5900 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 2700, 
Los Angeles, Calif. 90036; tel. (800) 456-0079. Price: $19.98 (plus tax and 
postage).  
</P>
<P>
 RIVERS OF FRANCE ( Clay Francisco Films, 80 minutes, 1993 ). 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction on this video tour of northwestern France begins with 
cruising on the Seine in Paris. As the boat passes landmarks, Clay Francisco 
provides informative narration of Normandy, Brittany, Loire Valley chateaux and 
Burgundy's canals. The first views of the Loire Valley, its river and chateaux, 
are from a hot-air balloon. Also visited are the Angers fortress and the town 
of Blois. Land tours of chateaux include Chambord, Cheverney, Chaumont and 
Chenceaux. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel through Burgundy is by barge and includes stops to tour Dijon and 
Beaune, where there is a visit to the Hotel-Dieu, founded as a hospital in 
1443. 
</P>
<P>
 On the return to Paris from this leg of the tour, viewers are shown some of 
the night life of the city and make a side trip to Giverny, Claude Monet's home 
and lovely gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Touring Brittany, the video visits the walled port city of St.-Malo; the 
medieval town of Dinan; the mysterious ruins of Carnac; the coastal town of 
Quimper noted for its pottery; the island-hotel Mont Saint-Michel, and the 
World War II landing sites of Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, viewers visit the Chateau of Versailles and watch the colorful 
celebration of France's independence day, July 14. 
</P>

MORE SCHINDLER'S TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Count me as one who considers travel broadening. Yet in reading the Sept. 11 
letter to the editor (about "The Schindler's List Tour," which appeared Aug. 
21) by Artur Zygmont, I was astounded you would print such a misstatement of 
the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Zygmont states: "There are hundreds of thousands of Jews in Poland. . . . 
" If anyone cares to verify this they will find that 6,000 Jews remain in 
Poland today (out of a community that numbered 3.1 million in 1940!) For Mr. 
Zygmont to add that "they are in the mainstream of Polish life" is sheer 
fantasy. Mind you, the population of Poland is 40,000,000. He follows up with 
an inference that you can't spot Jews in Poland because, ". . . they don't wear 
yarmulkes and they don't observe the Sabbath." 
</P>
<P>
 Gee whiz. How did the Poles find 3.1 million Jews to turn over to and assist 
the Nazis in systematic murdering? Will miracles ever cease in Mr. Zygmont's 
Poland? 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 I was born in Poland and lived there during World War II. Obviously, neither 
Artur Zygmont nor (second letter writer) Isabelle Sander is familiar with the 
facts nor is comfortable with acknowledging the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 I am Jewish and survived the Holocaust only because I had no Semitic features. 
My parents and my whole family (over 25 people) perished. My father, who spoke 
fluent German and looked like a Tirolean German, died because a Pole recognized 
him on the street and reported him to a passing German policeman. He was 
arrested on the spot, never to be seen again. That Pole committed an act of 
sheer hatred, which is better known as anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been back to Poland several times in the last 25 years. I am sad to say 
that anti-Semitism still exists, especially in the cities. Even today, no Jew 
would dare to settle in a village. Mr. Zygmont states that there are "hundreds 
of thousands of Jews living in Poland" in the mainstream Polish life. 
</P>
<P>
 On my recent trip to Poland a few months ago, I encountered anti-Semitic signs 
and posters plastered on the walls. I took a picture of one of these posters. 
Hasn't there been enough blood shed of innocent people in Poland? Do not the 
Poles have enough problems in governing their country without concentrating so 
much energy on anti-Semitism? 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to stop the pretending. Facts are facts.

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * AFFORDABLE HOUSING: Authorized the Housing Department to loan $2.6 million 
to the nonprofit Proyecto Esperanza for development of Evergreen Village 
Apartments, a 54-unit low-income apartment complex to be located at the corner 
of Cesar E. Chavez and Evergreen avenues in East Los Angeles. Currently 
situated on part of the site is a 4,500-square-foot building housing a liquor 
store and small retail shops. That building will be converted into a youth 
activity and community center. 
</P>
<P>
 * NUISANCE STORES: Approved a resolution declaring Lucky Liquor at 1401 W. 
Jefferson Blvd. and Skip's Liquor at 3801 S. Vermont Ave. public nuisances as a 
result of numerous complaints about drug dealing, drunkenness, loitering and 
panhandling near both stores. The liquor stores have 100 days to act on 21 
corrective measures recommended by the Board of Zoning Appeals. The measures 
include having a state-licensed uniformed security guard on duty during 
operating hours, removing graffiti and trash, and prohibiting video games and 
loitering. 
</P>
<P>
 * COUNCIL TV: Instructed the city clerk to prepare written summaries of City 
Council agendas to be shown on Channel 35 before meetings are televised. Also 
instructed the city clerk to prepare a small glossary of City Council terms to 
be shown occasionally during meeting broadcasts. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * FIRST STREET PLAZA: Terminated plans to build the First Street North 
Project, also known as First Street Plaza. The development included a 26-story 
city-owned office tower, a 15-story hotel and a 12-story office building. 
Opponents of the plan, including Mayor Richard Riordan's office, argued that 
the project may have seemed like a good idea when it was planned in 1988 but is 
now too costly. Councilman Richard Alatorre, who strongly defended the plan, 
called for a 90-day delay in the vote to see if the mayor's office could come 
up with a better plan. That motion was defeated. A Riordan aide said there are 
no alternative plans. Expansion of the Japanese American National Museum, a 
part of the original plan, was approved in a separate motion. Passed 11-2. 
Voting yes: Mike Hernandez, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Nate Holden, Jackie Goldberg, 
Rudy Svorinich Jr. Voting no: Alatorre. Absent: Rita Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 * TAXICAB SERVICES: Approved an ordinance extending for five years the 
operating authority for several taxi services -- Checker Cab, Bell Cab, L.A. 
Taxi, Independent Cab and United Independent Cab -- to operate in specific 
areas of the city. The Board of Transportation Commissioners had recommended a 
10-year renewal, but the council limited the renewal to five years. Passed 
14-0. Voting yes: Alatorre, Hernandez, Ridley-Thomas, Holden, Goldberg, 
Svorinich Jr. Absent: Walters. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

U.S., IRAQ MOVE MORE TROOPS TOWARD KUWAIT; MILITARY: BAGHDAD MOBILIZES FORCE OF 
64,000. TENSION UP AS AMERICAN SHIPS, PLANES, 4,000 SOLDIERS CONVERGE ON GULF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The standoff between Iraq and the United States intensified Saturday as 
Baghdad moved more troops close to the Kuwaiti border, and the Clinton 
Administration dispatched 4,000 soldiers to join U.S. ships and planes 
converging on the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials reported Saturday that more than 14,000 troops from two 
mechanized divisions of Iraq's elite Republican Guard had joined other forces 
within 12 1/2 miles of the Kuwaiti border -- bringing the number of Iraqi 
forces in the border area to up to 64,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon said it was sending 4,000 soldiers from the Army's 24th 
Mechanized Division at Ft. Stewart, Ga., near Savannah, to Kuwait this morning, 
and it had placed the remainder of the unit, along with the 1st Marine 
Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.S. Tripoli, an amphibious ship with 2,000 Marines from Camp Pendleton 
and the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station, arrived off the coast of Kuwait on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department also deployed two more Patriot air-defense missile 
batteries to Saudi Arabia, and placed additional U.S. combat aircraft in Europe 
on alert, but officials declined to provide the names of the units or the 
number of planes involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The escalation by both sides represented a significant deterioration of the 
situation from only 24 hours earlier, when the United States first announced 
that it was sending forces in an attempt to deter the Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Baghdad's massed forces, analysts said an incursion may not be 
planned, and Iraq may simply be trying to pressure the United Nations into 
lifting its economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, however, a grim-faced Marine Corps Lt. Gen. John Sheehan, 
operations director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that, although 
there still was no firm indication that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein planned 
to invade immediately, the forces he has deployed so far "clearly represent a 
threat" to Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who went to the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., 
for the weekend, reiterated his earlier warnings that it would be a "grave 
error" for Baghdad to underestimate U.S. resolve in preventing Iraq from 
invading Kuwait again. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stopped in Florida en route home from Haiti on 
Saturday to confer with Gen. J.H. Binford Peay III, head of the U.S. Central 
Command, which oversees operations in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheehan said orders for the Ft. Stewart and Camp Pendleton forces to deploy 
could come imminently, depending upon those discussions and others late 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The size and makeup of the well-equipped, heavily armed Iraqi force is 
"similar to previous deployments we saw (in 1990) when they did go into 
Kuwait," Sheehan said. "They clearly have the capability to attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheehan noted pointedly that the United States now has enough warships in the 
region to fire 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "We clearly have the capacity to go to downtown Baghdad," he said. "That's one 
of the lessons I hope Saddam learned the last time we did this." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Clinton and other top presidential policy-makers spent 
part of the day on the telephone conferring with their counterparts in Britain, 
France and other countries that had been part of the allied coalition that 
defeated Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. concern was echoed by other powers with interests in the region. Both 
Britain and Russia issued stern warnings to Baghdad, and Britain sent a frigate 
to bolster its naval force in the Gulf. Kuwait dispatched 50 tanks to its 
border with Iraq and placed its armed forces on high alert. Saudi Arabia 
pledged to support U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the U.N. Security Council, in an unusual Saturday session, 
expressed grave concern over Iraq's actions and warned that the United Nations 
is still committed to protecting Kuwait's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came after the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine 
Albright, unveiled satellite photographs showing Iraqi troop movements. 
Officials said France and Russia had obtained similar photographs from their 
own spy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Western analysts continued to be flabbergasted by Iraq's boldness in provoking 
the West, particularly since it is substantially weaker militarily than it was 
before its defeat in the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequently voiced theory is that Baghdad is trying to bully the U.N. 
Security Council into lifting sanctions imposed during the Gulf crisis of 1990. 
One of the curbs Iraq objects to most is the sanction prohibiting Baghdad from 
selling its oil on world markets except under a tight U.N. supervision in which 
all of the revenue would be devoted to humanitarian relief within Iraq and to 
payment of war reparations to Kuwait. Iraq has denounced the restrictions as a 
violation of its sovereignty and has refused to sell its oil under those 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council had been set to vote Monday on Iraq's request that the 
sanctions be lifted. Washington had opposed easing the embargo, saying the 
Iraqis have not complied with all aspects of the resolution, such as officially 
recognizing Kuwait or accepting the border demarcation. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said the latest confrontation, however, had all but ended any hope 
that the council might override U.S. objections, and restored Baghdad's status 
as a pariah in the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Iraq on Saturday denied that its troops were preparing for 
another invasion of Kuwait, such as the one in August, 1990, that sparked the 
Persian Gulf War. But it threatened to end cooperation with the United Nations 
unless economic sanctions were lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry told reporters that the Iraqi troops positioned near the Kuwaiti border 
are "too close for comfort." He said Iraqi mechanized units were "less than an 
hour" from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot afford to assume that this is just a bluff, and that is why we are 
taking the actions that we are taking," he said. "If Saddam Hussein tries to 
send any military forces into Kuwait today, then we will be prepared to meet 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, leaving Washington on a 
trip to the Middle East to bolster the Arab-Israeli peace process, said he will 
visit Kuwait during the trip -- probably on Wednesday -- to "provide a very 
strong expression of our resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement at Andrews Air Force Base just before leaving, Christopher said 
Iraq "must not be allowed to intimidate" either its neighbors or the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Baghdad's latest provocations "underscore the importance of 
maintaining U.N. sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) voiced support for Clinton's action, 
adding: "The message the U.S. and the world needs to send is clear: If Saddam 
acts against Kuwait, the world will respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said the U.S. forces that Clinton ordered to the region on 
Friday were continuing their journey. The aircraft carrier George Washington 
and the guided-missile cruiser San Jacinto were en route to the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The ships and the 4,000 U.S. troops that left Ft. Stewart on Saturday night 
will join an array of U.S. ships, aircraft, supplies and Patriot missile 
batteries already in the region -- in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, some 
positioned by the United States after the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Navy warships -- including the cruiser Leyte Gulf and the destroyer 
Hewitt and an unidentified submarine are already in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 By itself, a 50,000-member Iraqi contingent would not be regarded as unusually 
formidable. However, officials said the addition of the two Republican Guard 
units, which are well-equipped and mechanized, clearly made it a serious threat 
to Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Army Maj. Gen. Patrick Hughes, intelligence director for the Joint Chiefs, 
said the Iraqi force included a "substantial" array of self-propelled cannon, 
T-72 tanks and fighting vehicles and is "the best-trained, best-led, 
best-equipped" force Iraq has.

O.C.'S CAPIZZI TAKES HIT FROM BUSTS-GONE-BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With 269,104 votes against no opponent in the June primary, Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi commanded more support than any other Orange County 
officeholder, while some prosecutors elsewhere in California were either losing 
their offices or barely holding onto them. 
</P>
<P>
 As he endorsed "three-strikes" legislation and issued tough-on-crime 
statements during press conferences called to announce arrests in high-profile 
cases, Capizzi has looked the part of the invincible lawman in a society 
growing ever more fearful of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past 10 days, Capizzi's office has suffered the biggest public 
embarrassments of his five-year reign -- prosecutorial missteps that many say 
were inevitable for an office so intent on cultivating a crime-busting image 
that its staff sometimes cuts corners. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago Friday, amid much public fanfare, his office charged an arson 
suspect with setting the most devastating fire in county history, only to drop 
the charges five days later when the Mexico-born "transient" turned out to have 
family in Fullerton who provided him an ironclad alibi. The family claimed, and 
red-faced prosecutors subsequently confirmed, that the man was serving time in 
a Mexican prison at the time of the Oct. 27, 1993, Laguna Beach firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day those charges were dropped, a deputy district attorney agreed to 
release another man from custody whose arrest was among those announced at yet 
another press conference -- one called to trumpet the crackdown on Santa Ana's 
6th Street gang and the arrest of more than 100 alleged drug-dealing gangsters. 
This time, the arrested gangster turned out to have been in a Texas prison at 
the time he was supposedly selling drugs to an undercover agent in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 And just two days ago came news that two more of those arrested during the 
Santa Ana crackdown may have been wrongly accused. One was apparently in a 
California prison at the time he was accused of dealing drugs in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 With three high-profile cases coming unraveled in the same number of days, 
Capizzi and his top administrators say they are reviewing the rest of the 
100-plus arrests in the gang sweep. Though they do not like to file charges 
that later have to be dropped, officials from the district attorney's office 
say they don't hesitate to do the right thing when mistakes are brought to 
their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, on occasion, someone will be charged with a crime and, later, 
evidence will show they did not commit that crime," said Maurice Evans, chief 
assistant district attorney. "This is an office that has high integrity. And we 
are willing to stand up if we make a mistake. On these cases where someone has 
an alibi, we will stand up and be counted and take responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi's office has suffered other public relations setbacks in the past 
year, not only for what it has done, but once for what it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mutilation slaying last May of 23-year-old Leanora Annette Wong -- 
another highly publicized case -- it was revealed that Capizzi's office decided 
not to prosecute Wong's accused killer in 1993, when he was accused of rape for 
a fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of aggressively prosecuting the fourth rape charge, which could have 
landed him in prison for 12 years, Orange County prosecutors elected instead to 
let him be returned to prison for no more than 12 months as a parole violator. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that the rape case had too many holes to charge the suspect, 
Edward Patrick Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after his release, prosecutors now charge that Morgan sexually 
mutilated the 23-year-old Huntington Beach woman and strangled her. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, a state appeals court threw out the hard-won assault conviction 
of Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, the estranged husband of actor John Wayne's daughter. 
The reversal was based in part on prosecutor misconduct, and Capizzi's office 
is appealing the decision, which overturned the outcome of a lengthy second 
jury trial, the first one ending in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the tragic Christmas Day shooting last year of one sheriff's deputy by 
another, some community leaders questioned the impartiality of Capizzi's office 
in handling the case while others criticized him for taking the case before the 
county grand jury, which chose not to issue an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, prosecutors say they recommended that charges be filed, but the 
grand jury refused. One retired deputy district attorney suggested that 
Capizzi's office "was able to have its cake and eat it too" by passing the 
blame for a controversial non-prosecution to a grand jury, whose deliberations 
are forever kept secret when no charges result. District attorney's officials 
said they made the right call by taking the case to the grand jury, even though 
they could have simply filed the charges directly, as they do 99% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say it's been a particularly good year for him," Public Defender 
Ronald Y. Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 In both the Laguna arson case and that of the gang sweep -- dubbed Operation 
Roundup -- Capizzi stood before television cameras and made bold pronouncements 
about their import and impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Soto Martinez, the accused Laguna arsonist, "willfully and maliciously" 
set the fire, Capizzi said, adding that there was no doubt that he was the man 
responsible for the disastrous firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the gang sweep press conference, at which Capizzi was flanked by Gov. Pete 
Wilson -- the candidate he has endorsed for reelection -- the district attorney 
said that the 6th Street gang, believed responsible for much of the crime in 
the targeted area, had been "busted in every sense of the word." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, too, there was praise for clever and dedicated police work against 
suspected criminals portrayed as both brazen and inept. But recent revelations 
that several had solid alibis and could not have been where police said they 
were has cast doubt on the thoroughness of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of thing (dropping charges) happens quite a bit, but most of the 
time they get dropped quietly in a Municipal Court someplace, and they don't 
create publicity. Nobody hears about them," Butler said. "It just happens that 
these are some highly visible situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said the "reality" of Operation Roundup "pales in comparison to the 
hype at the press conference. I'm against drugs, but comparing the severity of 
the (crimes alleged) to the impact on the general drug caseload, it makes no 
substantial difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Successful prosecution of criminal charges is largely dependent on good police 
work, and in the short-lived case against the Laguna arson suspect, the 
Fullerton Police Department acknowledges that it bungled one part of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was arrested on charges of setting three small fires in that city, 
and a procedural failure by Fullerton police prevented investigators for 
establishing his true identity, which would have provided his alibi before he 
was wrongfully charged in the Laguna case. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's mother filed a missing-persons report at the Fullerton department 
while he was still in the department's lockup. 
</P>
<P>
 Had they entered the missing man's name in the department's computer, they 
would have discovered he was sitting in their jail. 
</P>
<P>
 But many believe that prosecutors -- who must weigh the evidence in any case 
in order to prove the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt -- must ensure 
that an investigation is as thorough as possible before filing criminal 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average Joe out there wants the police to be as aggressive as possible. 
But the D.A. is the filter, the gatekeeper who guards against weak evidence," 
said Jennifer Keller, an Orange County defense attorney. "You don't want your 
D.A. to be a rubber stamp for the police." 
</P>
<P>
 But Capizzi and other district attorneys who must stand for reelection every 
four years worry that not being viewed as totally tough on crime essentially 
means giving opponents an easy target in the next contest, some say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law enforcement is so driven by politics these days, and politicians have 
seized upon crime as a way to exploit the public's fear that there are murders 
and rapes on every street corner," Keller said. "I don't like Mike Capizzi and 
he is the opposite of everything I stand for. But I think he is being affected 
by forces greater than himself, just like every other D.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, she said, worry they will be criticized for not filing the 
toughest possible charge on a suspect or seeking the harshest punishment, which 
could make them vulnerable in the eyes of political opponents and the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of re-examining their policies over there, they are asking, 'How does 
it look in the media, and what will the political fallout be?' " Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi was unavailable for comment Saturday, but Evans, his 
second-in-command, said his boss runs the office in much the same hard-charging 
way Capizzi's predecessors have operated it for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an awful lot more work now, but we continue to be responsible to the 
taxpayers," Evans said. "There is no question that citizens are concerned about 
crime, and we will be aggressive with everyone, no matter their standing in 
society, rich or poor." 
</P>
<P>
 But others believe it is easy for Capizzi to prosecute individuals like Jose 
Martinez, a mentally unstable supposed transient who talks of demons, or the 
barrio residents busted in Operation Roundup. They see his office as less 
aggressive when it comes to prosecuting political corruption or white-collar 
criminals, who often have friends in high places. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is interesting about our D.A. is is what he decides to go after and what 
he doesn't decide to go after," said Mark P. Petracca, an associate professor 
of social science at UC Irvine. "In essence, it is easier to take on those 
people who can't fight back. I would rather that he take some risks, now that 
he's been reelected, but I don't see him doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 In calling press conferences to announce gang busts and the arrest of arson 
suspects, Petracca said, Capizzi cannot lose with the public, despite the 
occasional embarrassment of having to drop charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being overzealous in this climate buys you nothing but sympathy," Petracca 
said. "People are whipped into hysteria over crime even though the indicators 
are that crime is going down. So what if he has to release a few suspects? He 
can always say, 'Who can fault me for being overzealous when it's all for the 
protection of our citizens?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For Evans and others in Capizzi's office, however, the bottom line has always 
been overall performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying more jury trials in the office than ever before. Our conviction 
rate is high, and the overall crime rate is down," Evans said. "I think that in 
any large organization, you strive to improve. We can always do better. But 
overall, I feel very good about what's been going on here."

 For the band of traders who peddle souvenirs to tourists taking in the 
sweeping view of the Russian capital near Moscow State University, there is one 
preferred currency for doing business: the U.S. dollar. Even the local police 
like their bribes in greenbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a world away in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, foreigners entering 
the country must pay for an entry visa, a hotel taxi and the hotel itself in a 
single currency: the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hamburg, Germany, a local trader buys oil from a Dutch company and ships it 
to Switzerland. The transaction is completed in a single currency: the U.S. 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the global currency," says Peter Stroink, a spokesman for Royal Dutch 
Shell in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. "That's the tradition, that's the 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 And to a far greater extent than most Americans appreciate, that simple fact 
is responsible for much of their current prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the rest of the world is helping Americans go on a global shopping 
binge. It is a benefit no one else has -- one the late French President Charles 
de Gaulle called the "exorbitant privilege" of the country with the leading 
international currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Exorbitant indeed. As recently as 1980, the United States had a credit of $400 
billion with the rest of the world -- in effect, a positive balance of $400 
billion on its global credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 But so profligate has America been since then that the United States today is 
easily the world's biggest debtor country, with a negative credit balance of a 
staggering $550 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 What if dollars suddenly fell out of fashion around the world? What if other 
countries were no longer eager to get their hands on American greenbacks? 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, America would be disciplined, much as a youth whose parents take 
away his credit card. But in this case the mechanism would be the law of supply 
and demand: The dollar's new global unpopularity would drive its price down, as 
surely as unpopular cars cost less than desirable ones. 
</P>
<P>
 While the cheaper dollar would have some advantages for Americans, the bad 
news would be that the dollar's buying power overseas would shrivel. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Americans would find that they could afford fewer Sony video 
recorders and BMW sedans and less Chanel perfume than now. Their standard of 
living would take a turn for the worse -- a sharp turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the dollar is showing signs of losing some of its global magic. It has 
taken a beating against the Japanese currency; in June, for the first time 
since World War II, it bought fewer than 100 yen. It once bought 360. 
</P>
<P>
 But the shopping spree goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the most recent government figures show that in July, Americans 
registered an $11-billion deficit in their trade in goods with the rest of the 
world, the second-largest monthly figure ever. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Americans added another $11 billion to the supply of dollars 
floating around outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 They could do that only because the preferred currency, whether in Moscow, 
Mogadishu or Montevideo, remains the U.S. dollar. Foreign governments, banks, 
businesses and individuals still cannot get enough of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * Trade. Although the United States accounts for only 12.5% of international 
trade, slightly more than half of the $3.7 trillion in goods and services sold 
across international borders last year were priced and paid for in U.S. 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Every drop of crude oil, no matter where produced or where consumed, is bought 
and sold in dollars. The same is true of many other commodities, such as sugar, 
wheat, coffee, cotton, natural gas, gold, silver, zinc, lead and copper. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise for many other products that will never have anything directly to do 
with the United States: cotton shirts made in India and sold to Tanzania, 
Argentine beef exported to Mexico, Polish ham packaged in Denmark and shipped 
to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Japan, where there is a national allergy to foreign-made goods, the 
greenback is an exception. Nearly half of Japan's exports are sold for U.S. 
dollars, according to the Ministry for International Trade and Industry, and 
Tokyo pays for nearly three-quarters of its imports in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reserves. The dollar remains the preferred currency for global reserves -- 
money socked away in government central banks to guarantee a nation's financial 
stability and well-being in much the same way a savings account provides 
security for a family. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $1.1 trillion in official reserves held by central banks throughout the 
world, just over 60% is held in U.S. dollars, according to the International 
Monetary Fund. Led by the new economic powers of the Asian Pacific region, 
developing nations alone added $250 billion to their reserves from 1988 to 
1993. Among the world's largest holders of U.S. dollars, with $51 billion, is 
little Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foreign exchange. A study by the Bank for International Settlements in 
Basel, Switzerland, found that of the $880 billion worth of currency traded 
daily on global foreign exchange markets in April, 1992, the U.S. dollar was 
involved in no less than 83% of all deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone in Tokyo wanting to trade yen for German marks must first sell the yen 
for dollars. Only with dollars is it possible to buy the marks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cash. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has found a steady increase in demand 
for cash dollars abroad since the early 1960s. In 1991, the latest year for 
which the Fed has figures, there were nearly twice as many greenbacks floating 
around outside the United States as there were within the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of every 10 $100 bills in circulation were estimated to be physically 
outside the United States in 1991, and Fed officials believe the share is 
higher today. "There's a large potential market out there, with the Russian 
appetite for dollars unslaked and the Chinese looming over the horizon," said 
Richard Porter, a Fed economist. Battered Bucks 
</P>
<P>
 But even all this has not been enough to stem a sharp decline of the dollar 
against the world's strongest currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with 20 years ago, it now takes nearly three times as many dollars to 
buy a Japanese television set or a Swiss watch whose price in the local 
currency has not changed. On a similar basis, the cost of a German car has more 
than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, the dollar has gained strength against the currencies of 
some of America's biggest trading partners. The dollar's power to buy Canadian 
lumber, British marmalade and Brazilian coffee has actually increased since 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides sustaining a comfortable lifestyle, the dollar's global popularity 
provides Americans other, more subtle, benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar is a symbol of power worldwide," noted an international economist. 
"It's part of what makes other countries look up to the United States as the 
world's preeminent economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Norbert Walter, chief economist at Germany's largest financial institution, 
the Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, added: "The dollar is not just a strong 
currency. It is the reflection of a strong continent which comprises military, 
political and economic power." 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar emerged as an international currency in the years after World War I 
as nations sought an alternative to the British pound when Britain abandoned 
the gold standard. The greenback's rise helped signal that the era of Pax 
Britannia was ending and that the American Century was at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II the dollar became the global currency, reflecting America's 
dominance at a time when Germans survived in bombed-out ruins, Parisians limped 
along on four hours of electricity a day, the Japanese reeled from nuclear 
destruction and even the victorious British were forced to grub for coal to 
keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Unchallenged in the Pacific, dominant in Europe, the United States held 
two-thirds of the world's gold reserves, half of its manufacturing production 
and half of its shipping capacity. It supplied one-third of total global 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as English quickly became the Western world's lingua franca, so too did 
the dollar become its accepted medium for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Today America's relative power in the world has diminished. Europe 
collectively outproduces the United States by a wide margin. Japan's trading 
power seems to mock American efforts to control it. The U.S. share of global 
exports is less than half of what it was in the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the dollar holds its monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistanis and Thais, Kenyans and Filipinos, Canadians and Chileans -- people 
everywhere have grown accustomed to communicating in English and conducting 
their trade in U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a common denominator," said Miron Mushkat, chief economist for Asia at 
Lehman Bros. in Tokyo. "If you have multiple parties engaged in trade, they 
need . . . a common language. It's very difficult to trade with hundreds of 
countries in their own currency. If I have to deal with China in Mandarin, with 
Malaysia in Malaysian and with the Philippines in Tagalog, this is very costly. 
Over time, one language, one currency dominates international trade and 
commerce." Easy to Use 
</P>
<P>
 While America's position as the world's leading trading nation certainly helps 
keep the dollar popular, the American currency is also easy to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a bottle of Coke or a pair of Levi's, the dollar is instantly 
recognizable. Unlike those of other major currencies such as the yen, the mark 
and the Swiss franc, all dollar denominations are the same size, shape and 
color. What's more, U.S. paper money has not changed in more than half a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to know the presidents," noted Sasha Ivanov, a 27-year-old 
Muscovite whose street-side table in the city's Sparrow Hills tourist area is 
stacked with nesting dolls, amber jewelry and other trinkets he hopes to sell 
for dollars. "I know them all in order: It goes Washington, Lincoln, Hamilton. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "No, you're wrong," interrupted another trader, Dmitri Turkin, triumphantly. 
"It goes Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Jackson, Grant, Franklin. 
You forgot the $2 bill." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian language probably has more words for the dollar than for the 
ruble: baksi (bucks), zelyonyiye (green), kapusta (cabbage), krop (dill), zelon 
(green herbs) and even just green in accented English. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no currency here more widely accepted than American dollars," said 
Igor Doronin, chief adviser of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange. "Just 
try to use Swiss francs or Japanese yen here. No one will take them. No one 
knows what they are." 
</P>
<P>
 The story is similar almost everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rio de Janeiro: "When people come from Europe or Asia or other countries, 
they don't bring their money; they bring dollars because they know they can get 
a better exchange rate," said Fabio Mamedio, whose downtown Rio travel agencies 
have changed money for years. "If they bring yen or francs, I charge them an 
extra 10% because there's just no demand for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the local currency; the British Broadcasting Corp.'s World Service 
programs routinely note business dealings in U.S. dollars. Despite their 
multinational membership, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development invariably express 
statistics in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, anyone managing to get 
hold of a few dollars could go to special hard-currency stores to buy goods 
impossible to purchase with local money. 
</P>
<P>
 A standing joke in Warsaw holds that the only similarity between the United 
States and Communist-era Poland was that a dollar could buy anything in either 
country, while the Polish zloty was worthless in both. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the post-Communist zloty has become a currency of genuine value, the 
dollar remains king in Poland. Buy a foreign car in Warsaw and the price is in 
dollars. Renting property to foreigners for dollars may be technically illegal, 
but many Polish landlords do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar is the hedge against inflation," one Warsaw resident said. "It's 
the basis people compare everything to." 
</P>
<P>
 In Latin America, where national currencies have been historically vulnerable 
to bouts of hyper-inflation that make them all but worthless, citizens have 
frequently turned to the dollar. Brazil is the latest example. 
</P>
<P>
 With an inflation rate reaching thousands of percentage points per year, many 
Brazilians used the dollar as a measuring stick for what things really cost. 
"It was the reference point," said Clarice Pechman, executive director of the 
Brazilian Assn. of Exchange Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the business community, merchants routinely asked that long-term agreements 
and payments on consignment be made in dollars, even though this was 
technically illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had to do it," said Antonio Gomes, a furniture maker. "Otherwise, by the 
time you got your money in cruzeiros, it could be half or even one-third of the 
original selling price." 
</P>
<P>
 A black market quickly developed to supply dollars to those who wanted to hold 
more than the government allowed. Newscasts routinely broadcast not only the 
dollar's official exchange rate but the black market rate. So many dollars were 
circulating by 1988 that the central bank began legalizing some dollar outlets 
and buying dollars itself from what was once the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Brazil introduced a new currency, the real, and pegged its value to 
that of the U.S. dollar. That brought inflation down to about 2% in August from 
the 50% rate in June, the last month of the cruzeiro. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public remains understandably jittery. Rosanna Gois, an administrative 
assistant at a Sao Paulo architectural firm, is just one of many Brazilians who 
are not quite ready to declare the government's new economic plan a success and 
give up their caches of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "These plans come and go," she said. "But I know that the dollar is always 
going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Argentina experienced a similar crisis and tried a similar 
solution. As inflation reached 100% a month in the late 1980s, supermarkets had 
teams of employees whose only job was to go through shelves and mark up prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Argentina did what Brazil would do a few years later -- it 
"dollarized" the economy by fixing the Argentine peso's value to the dollar and 
committing the central bank to offering dollars at a guaranteed rate to anyone 
who wanted them. Now inflation has dropped to U.S. levels and the economy is 
growing, but new strains are also apparent that make economists worry whether 
keeping pace with the dollar might be too much to ask of Argentina's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only in the past decade that other currencies -- namely the mark and the 
yen -- have grown in importance in global finance. And it is only recently that 
they have begun cutting into the dollar's preeminence. The Competition 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the cases of Brazil and Argentina, the number of foreign countries 
that peg their currencies' values directly to the dollar has dropped from 36 in 
1988 to 20 today. Industrialized nations have reduced the percentage of their 
central bank reserves held in dollars. Even the greenback's presence in 83% of 
all foreign exchange dealings represents a drop from 90% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Jozef Van't Dack, an economist with the Bank for International Settlements, 
also sees evidence that the mark, yen and ecu -- an artificial, weighted 
mixture of several European currencies -- have begun to erode the dollar as an 
invoicing currency and medium of exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "International investors don't like the dollar," he maintained. "You can see 
it in the latest figures. Over the last 20 years, the mark and yen have become 
much more important." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Smith, a currency specialist at the London-based securities firm UBS 
Ltd., calls this part of a "measured decay" of the dollar, an inevitable 
consequence of chronic, massive U.S. trade deficits. "It's the same thing that 
happened to the pound," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, few see an immediate threat to the dollar's worldwide dominance. "These 
are tectonic shifts that will take decades to play out," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors have blocked the yen and mark from playing roles commensurate 
with their strength: 
</P>
<P>
 * The attraction of a nation's currency is more than simply a reflection of 
its economic might. It is a measure of a country's power -- military and 
political as well as economic. Nearly half a century after the end of World War 
II, both Germany and Japan remain military midgets that play only marginal 
roles in shaping major global political decisions. Only the United States is 
giant in all three departments. 
</P>
<P>
 * For many years, both the German and Japanese central banks actively opposed 
the use of their currencies as global reserves, fearing that large foreign 
holdings would sap their ability to manage their own economies. 
</P>
<P>
 "A deutsche mark in foreign hands meant that something unexpected could 
happen," explained Walter, the Deutsche Bank chief economist. "The Bundesbank 
feared earthquakes, landslides. Only when they realized they could not prevent 
the mark being used as a reserve currency did they grudgingly accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Bank of Japan, it was the mid-1980s before resistance to foreign 
holdings of yen turned to reluctant acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 * A lingering antipathy toward Germany in Europe and toward Japan in East Asia 
has dampened enthusiasm for holdings of both currencies in the regions where 
they would naturally be the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of these and other factors, many currency specialists find it hard to 
see how the dollar could ever be completely eclipsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar's importance will decline gradually over time, but it will still 
keep the dominant position it has had in the past," said Van't Dack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Demand for the dollar will remain," argued Walter. "You would need massive 
mistakes like another Vietnam and a weak, vacillating (Jimmy) Carter presidency 
with all the costs and political errors associated with them to change this." 
</P>
<P>
 New technology and sophisticated new currency markets have helped blunt any 
perceived need to switch from a sagging dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much a question of dollar strength; it's more the growing 
irrelevance of denomination," said Bank of International Settlements economist 
Gavin Bingham. "It's now much easier to protect against a currency exposure 
than in the past, so there's no pressure to move away from the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar is the premier currency and will remain so. The weight of history 
will keep it there." 
</P>

'PEOPLE POWER' IN HAITI STIRS CIVIL WAR FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They appeared before dawn Saturday with pickaxes and machetes in hand. And 
with pebbles and sticks, they staked their claims. 
</P>
<P>
 There were dozens of them, impoverished slum dwellers from an urban hell 
called Cite Soleil -- City of the Sun -- and they worked all day carving new 
subdivisions into a rich man's land: a prime, verdant hillside adjacent to 
Port-au-Prince's international airport. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a land seizure, plain and simple. People power, Haitian-style. The 
worst nightmare of Haiti's rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my land now, the people's land," declared one of the occupiers, a 
barefoot, toothless man in an undershirt, pausing to explain. "I have no house. 
I have no money. And now this is mine. Now, we simply will wait for our 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to come, and he will give us the papers to 
make it legally ours. Then he will give cement for our houses; sewers; lights, 
and roads." 
</P>
<P>
 But as they illegally toiled away just a few hundred feet from the airport 
terminal, where U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry was declaring Haiti a 
new zone of peace, the capital's poor also were sowing the seeds for what the 
rich fear will be civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Port-au-Prince was, in fact, a city at peace Saturday. In the three weeks 
since the first U.S. troops arrived, an evolving, ad-hoc U.S. military strategy 
finally appeared to have checkmated the brutal Haitian regime and its 
paramilitary thugs, at least in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports of continuing attacks in the countryside. A bus filled with 
paramilitary agents reportedly rammed a pro-democracy demonstration, with the 
agents firing into the crowd and killing at least seven Friday night in the 
town of Peris, 50 miles north of Port-au-Prince, where similar demonstrations 
passed peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the capital, the poor continued a massive, voluntary cleanup campaign 
in advance of Aristide's expected arrival next Saturday. Working barefoot and 
in ragged clothes, makeshift street crews shoveled mountains of human waste and 
rotting garbage from main boulevards and side streets and carted it all away. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic snarled. The price of gasoline has plummeted in anticipation of an end 
to the international trade embargo, and many in the capital could afford to 
drive their battered old cars and jeeps for the first time in months. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was on the several hilly acres near the airport, off a street named 
Delmas 33, that the imagery shocked Haiti's small but powerful rich elite. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the real meaning of Aristide," said a manager at one of the Caribbean 
nation's faded five-star hotels, as he watched the peasants carving up land. 
"You Americans don't realize what you're doing bringing back Aristide. He wants 
everyone to eat corn. There will be no ice cream. If you liked Fidel Castro, 
you're gonna love this little priest." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of those fears are Aristide's long-stated policies to divvy up 
Haiti's riches. In a land where the overwhelming majority of the population 
lives in crushing poverty while a tiny minority controls the economy and 
luxuriates in sprawling villas far from the slums, a formal, gradual 
redistribution of wealth is the only way to avert civil war, according to 
Aristide's aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Those policies, twinned with murmured threats of retribution, are fuel for the 
fears of the rich, whose future is as uncertain as that of the impoverished and 
unemployed toiling away off Delmas 33. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if we'll be able to keep these plots," the barefoot land-seizer 
said with a smile. "First, we make the occupation, and then we wait and see. If 
the land is owned by a private person, maybe the new government will tell us to 
move. If it is owned by the government, then they will have to give us cement 
for the houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any case, if they move us, they will have to give us a place somewhere 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 The man, missing a little finger he said was chopped off by paramilitary thugs 
last February, asked not to be identified by name. He was still afraid, he 
said, because Aristide has yet to return. But his mere presence, along with 
that of dozens of others usurping land in broad daylight Saturday, showed how 
emboldened the city's poor have become with the presence of 20,000 American 
troops who they believe are on their side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I could get killed for this," the man said, referring to Haiti's 
police and army, which brutally enforced the law against the nation's poor. 
"But I just woke up this morning and saw everyone else taking the land. I have 
no job, no shelter. I live on the floor in the house of a friend. So I decided 
to join in. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way it will be done now. Everybody is going to take land like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 But the atmosphere was not without hope that peaceful change still can come. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will stay here only until President Aristide comes home," the man 
concluded. "And if the president tells us to move, I assure you everyone is 
going to leave."

U.S. TROOPS TAKE HANDS-ON TACK IN HAITI'S NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The man with a reputation for murder and two-bit shakedowns on behalf of 
Haiti's military regime lay in a fetal position on a banana-bark mat on the 
floor of the five-cell army prison. Hauled in by crowds celebrating the future 
return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, he grimaced in pain from a 
hideous gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door, Paul Jacob, a member of the political movement that supports 
Aristide, grasped the bars on a tiny window in the cell where he stood accused 
of shooting a man and refusing to give up his weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 And in between Haiti's two extremes stood the U.S. Special Forces, sorting 
through the complicated confusion of Haitian politics and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a change, these Haitian enemies would not be allowed to kill each 
other: The wounded man, a notorious attache , was whisked off for medical 
treatment and is under arrest. Jacob, after his weapons were captured, would be 
freed. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in this center of resistance to the first American occupation of Haiti 80 
years ago, U.S. troops have had an unexpected impact that has begun to 
transform parts of the northern countryside. They have taken over more than a 
dozen towns, rounded up bad guys and unleashed a buoyant optimism among people 
who lived for years under brutal repression. 
</P>
<P>
 "The north was the cradle of Haitian civilization, and its people were very 
proud. But that pride was crumpled, crushed and stamped out by dictatorship," 
said Grande Riviere's Roman Catholic priest, Father Joachin Roboam Anantua. 
"Now the people see there is hope, there is a new wind blowing. They feel 
things are going to change." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to their strategy in the capital, Port-au-Prince, the U.S. 
military in northern Haiti from the start has assumed a police role, as local 
military and civilian authority evaporated. Especially through Special Forces 
teams that fanned out through the countryside, GIs have been highly visible, on 
the ground and in the streets; they have taken a hands-on approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission in this part of rural Haiti has focused on hearts and minds -- 
winning over the trust of the people here by filling in the void left by the 
hasty flight of local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 With anarchy always looming on the horizon, the Special Forces have found 
themselves engaged in everything from arresting criminals to settling disputes 
and installing small-town mayors who were in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 The results, so far, have been mixed, but they contrast sharply with the chaos 
the capital has seen in the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 While demonstrators were being gunned down and killed in Port-au-Prince, 
Haitians in town after town in this region marched freely. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the most bitter complaint in the capital was about the Americans' 
failure to protect pro-Aristide Haitians, here the U.S. presence has given new 
confidence to opponents of the regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions have improved somewhat in Port-au-Prince. But at least for the time 
being, Haiti has become two countries -- the north, showing some promise, and 
the capital, which is still very much in flux. 
</P>
<P>
 "Northern Haiti is the success story compared to Port-au-Prince," said a 
non-American foreign military expert close to the occupation mission. "The 
Americans have come in here and laid a good foundation. I think this area may 
be the testing ground for tactics that will be used later." 
</P>
<P>
 There are obvious differences that make the mission in the north easier, such 
as the size and remoteness of the towns involved. Cap Haitien, for example, 
Haiti's second-largest city and the metropolis of the north, has a population 
of only 55,000 or so. On the other hand, Port-au-Prince, population 800,000 or 
so, is where the powerful regime of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and its wealthy 
backers are based. 
</P>
<P>
 And it clearly eased the Americans' mission when U.S. Marines on Sept. 24 shot 
and killed 10 Haitian policemen in Cap Haitien. The skirmish sent hundreds of 
Haitian police, army officers and paramilitary attaches running for the hills 
and probably the neighboring Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite about 2,000 U.S. Army troops in the northern theater, tensions have by 
no means subsided. Some parts of the north have yet to see a GI -- and may not 
want to. As the American intervention in Somalia showed, pacifying the less 
densely populated countryside can be a futile exercise if the country's major 
city is in havoc. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on the northern part of the island that the 16th-Century Spanish and 
later the French first arrived in search of gold and riches. An uprising by 
slaves near Cap Haitien in 1791 launched Haiti's movement to gain independence 
from France. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded during the French colonization, Grande Riviere du Nord, an almost 
picturesque town in almost lush hills covered with coffee trees, was a 
stronghold of the Haitian guerrilla resistance, known as the cacos , during the 
first part of the century. The caco guerrillas fought U.S. armed forces who 
occupied Haiti in 1915, and Grande Riviere came under attack numerous times. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, nine men from a Special Forces team essentially run the place. Landing 
in helicopters on Sept. 26, they immediately occupied the 70-man Haitian army 
garrison and seized a cache of weapons, including mortars and automatic 
weapons, that filled the bed of a pickup truck to overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
 The applause from thousands of townsfolk who poured from their homes to watch 
was thunderous as the weapons were taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 As has happened now in town after town, the people of Grande Riviere, where 
the mention of Aristide's name had been tantamount to a crime, launched into 
boisterous chants honoring the exiled president. And on every night that 
followed, huge demonstrations were held in the sloping, mimosa-shaded plaza 
that faces the army garrison and the church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Special Forces were on hand to provide a buffer in front of the army, 
which the crowd delighted in taunting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian forces here turned out to be a tougher nut to crack than in many 
northern towns. Yvon Jean-Jacques, the hard-line army captain, openly defied 
the Americans, hoarded weapons and lied about it, according to Special Forces 
Capt. Trent Suko, commander of Grande Riviere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have ways of killing people, without guns," Jean-Jacques told the 
Americans, Suko said. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point came last week. Under cloak of darkness, about 80 Haitian 
army officers from all over the country rendezvoused in a back room of the 
garrison. Some arrived in civilian clothing and had been given scarcely 48 
hours' notice of the secret meeting. U.S. officers believe the gathering was 
convened by a senior Haitian officer to plot ways to attack Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after Jean-Jacques began the meeting, Special Forces, backed by a 
platoon of Army Rangers brought in for the operation, crashed through the 
doors, slapped handcuffs on the men and carted about half of them -- all those 
who came from other garrisons, plus Jean-Jacques -- to Port-au-Prince for 
interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things quieted down after that," said Sgt. Harold King. "Everyone (among the 
Haitian officers) is real cooperative now. They're friendly, saying, 'Hi, how 
are you?' They're scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Special Forces in towns like Grande Riviere, Ouanaminthe and Fort 
Liberte -- also near the Dominican border -- have sought out community leaders 
or anyone else whom they can recruit to help. The practice raises questions 
about how the U.S. forces decide whom to trust, since these people can end up 
having great influence. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ouanaminthe, two Haitians who speak good English -- the proprietor of the 
only restaurant in town and a friend who identifies himself as an agronomist -- 
have emerged as key mediators between the Special Forces and the Haitians. Both 
said they simply wanted to volunteer to help their community. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is chaos and no authority, then I am threatened and everybody is 
threatened," said the restaurateur, Jean Frederic Theodore, 31. "We are trying 
to avoid that there be any kind of spontaneous reaction that leads to mob 
rule." 
</P>
<P>
 He and the agronomist, Nemours Vincent, 51, have been called upon several 
times to talk crowds out of looting and burning homes of people they didn't 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people it's against their own interest," Vincent said. "We want the 
intervention to be successful, and if you allow a lawless society the Americans 
will send in tough guys."

U.S., IRAQ MOVE MORE TROOPS TOWARD KUWAIT; MILITARY: BAGHDAD MOBILIZES FORCE OF 
64,000. TENSION UP AS AMERICAN SHIPS, PLANES, 4,000 SOLDIERS CONVERGE ON GULF. 
</P>

<P>
 The standoff between Iraq and the United States intensified Saturday as 
Baghdad moved more troops close to the Kuwaiti border, and the Clinton 
Administration dispatched 4,000 soldiers to join U.S. ships and planes 
converging on the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials reported Saturday that more than 14,000 troops from two 
mechanized divisions of Iraq's elite Republican Guard had joined other forces 
within 12 1/2 miles of the Kuwaiti border -- bringing the number of Iraqi 
forces in the border area to up to 64,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon said it was sending 4,000 soldiers from the Army's 24th 
Mechanized Division at Ft. Stewart, Ga., near Savannah, to Kuwait this morning, 
and it had placed the remainder of the unit, along with the 1st Marine 
Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton, Calif., on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department also deployed two more Patriot air-defense missile 
batteries to Saudi Arabia, and placed additional U.S. combat aircraft in Europe 
on alert, but officials declined to provide the names of the units or the 
number of planes involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The escalation by both sides represented a significant deterioration of the 
situation from only 24 hours earlier, when the United States first announced 
that it was sending forces in an attempt to deter the Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Baghdad's massed forces, analysts said an incursion may not be 
planned, and Iraq may simply be trying to pressure the United Nations into 
lifting its economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, however, a grim-faced Marine Corps Lt. Gen. John Sheehan, 
operations director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that, although 
there still was no firm indication that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein planned 
to invade immediately, the forces he has deployed so far "clearly represent a 
threat" to Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who went to the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., 
for the weekend, reiterated his earlier warnings that it would be a "grave 
error" for Baghdad to underestimate U.S. resolve in preventing Iraq from 
invading Kuwait again. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stopped in Florida en route home from Haiti on 
Saturday to confer with Gen. J.H. Binford Peay III, head of the U.S. Central 
Command, which oversees operations in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheehan said orders for the Ft. Stewart and Camp Pendleton forces to deploy 
could come imminently, depending upon those discussions and others late 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The size and makeup of the well-equipped, heavily armed Iraqi force is 
"similar to previous deployments we saw (in 1990) when they did go into 
Kuwait," Sheehan said. "They clearly have the capability to attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheehan noted pointedly that the United States now has enough warships in the 
region to fire 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "We clearly have the capacity to go to downtown Baghdad," he said. "That's one 
of the lessons I hope Saddam learned the last time we did this." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Clinton and other top presidential policy-makers spent 
part of the day on the telephone conferring with their counterparts in Britain, 
France and other countries that had been part of the allied coalition that 
defeated Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. concern was echoed by other powers with interests in the region. Both 
Britain and Russia issued stern warnings to Baghdad, and Britain sent a frigate 
to bolster its naval force in the Gulf. Kuwait dispatched 50 tanks to its 
border with Iraq and placed its armed forces on high alert. Saudi Arabia 
pledged to support U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the U.N. Security Council, in an unusual Saturday session, 
expressed grave concern over Iraq's actions and warned that the United Nations 
is still committed to protecting Kuwait's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came after the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine 
Albright, unveiled satellite photographs showing Iraqi troop movements. 
Officials said France and Russia had obtained similar photographs from their 
own spy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Western analysts continued to be flabbergasted by Iraq's boldness in provoking 
the West, particularly since it is substantially weaker militarily than it was 
before its defeat in the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequently voiced theory is that Baghdad is trying to bully the U.N. 
Security Council into lifting sanctions imposed during the Gulf crisis of 1990. 
One of the curbs Iraq objects to most is the sanction prohibiting Baghdad from 
selling its oil on world markets except under a tight U.N. supervision in which 
all of the revenue would be devoted to humanitarian relief within Iraq and to 
payment of war reparations to Kuwait. Iraq has denounced the restrictions as a 
violation of its sovereignty and has refused to sell its oil under those 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council had been set to vote Monday on Iraq's request that the 
sanctions be lifted. Washington had opposed easing the embargo, saying the 
Iraqis have not complied with all aspects of the resolution, such as officially 
recognizing Kuwait or accepting the border demarcation. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said the latest confrontation, however, had all but ended any hope 
that the council might override U.S. objections, and restored Baghdad's status 
as a pariah in the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Iraq on Saturday denied that its troops were preparing for 
another invasion of Kuwait, such as the one in August, 1990, that sparked the 
Persian Gulf War. But it threatened to end cooperation with the United Nations 
unless economic sanctions were lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry told reporters that the Iraqi troops positioned near the Kuwaiti border 
are "too close for comfort." He said Iraqi mechanized units were "less than an 
hour" from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot afford to assume that this is just a bluff, and that is why we are 
taking the actions that we are taking," he said. "If Saddam Hussein tries to 
send any military forces into Kuwait today, then we will be prepared to meet 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, leaving Washington on a 
trip to the Middle East to bolster the Arab-Israeli peace process, said he will 
visit Kuwait during the trip -- probably on Wednesday -- to "provide a very 
strong expression of our resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement at Andrews Air Force Base just before leaving, Christopher said 
Iraq "must not be allowed to intimidate" either its neighbors or the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Baghdad's latest provocations "underscore the importance of 
maintaining U.N. sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) voiced support for Clinton's action, 
adding: "The message the U.S. and the world needs to send is clear: If Saddam 
acts against Kuwait, the world will respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said the U.S. forces that Clinton ordered to the region on 
Friday were continuing their journey. The aircraft carrier George Washington 
and the guided-missile cruiser San Jacinto were en route to the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The ships and the 4,000 U.S. troops that left Ft. Stewart on Saturday night 
will join an array of U.S. ships, aircraft, supplies and Patriot missile 
batteries already in the region -- in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, some 
positioned by the United States after the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Navy warships -- including the cruiser Leyte Gulf and the destroyer 
Hewitt and an unidentified submarine, all armed with Tomahawk missiles, are 
already in the Persian Gulf. An amphibious group with 2,000 Marines arrived off 
the coast of Kuwait on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 By itself, a 50,000-member Iraqi contingent would not be regarded as unusually 
formidable. However, officials said the addition of the two Republican Guard 
units, which are well-equipped and mechanized, clearly made it a serious threat 
to Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Army Maj. Gen. Patrick Hughes, intelligence director for the Joint Chiefs, 
said the Iraqi force included a "substantial" array of self-propelled cannon, 
T-72 tanks and fighting vehicles and is "the best-trained, best-led, 
best-equipped" force Iraq has.

POLICE, PROSECUTORS UNEASY PARTNERS IN SIMPSON CASE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
LONGSTANDING TENSIONS HAVE BEEN AGGRAVATED. NEWS LEAKS, EVIDENCE HANDLING ARE 
SORE POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 As partners in one of the most closely scrutinized murder trials of all time, 
the Los Angeles Police Department and the district attorney's office share a 
mission: finding and convicting the killer of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they tackle the historic case, sources in and around both agencies say 
Los Angeles' largest law enforcement institutions are moving in opposition as 
well as in conjunction, blaming each other for leaks, failing to communicate 
about evidence and even at times undermining each other's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, some police officers have grumbled about the performance of 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, Police Chief Willie L. Williams has appeared 
on television and reopened a dispute about which agency is to blame for the 
release of controversial 911 tapes, and detectives have complained that 
prosecutors failed to back them in the face of a defense request for samples of 
their hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Such disputes are just the latest to arise since June 13, when the bodies of 
Nicole Simpson and Goldman were found slashed and stabbed to death outside her 
Brentwood townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Top officials at each agency concede that there have been some differences but 
say the working relationship between the LAPD and the district attorney's 
office is fundamentally solid. Williams and his top staff have praised 
prosecutors, and Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has likewise offered public 
compliments about the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, there's going to be times when you don't like something that 
someone may say," Williams said in an interview Friday. But "the overall 
relationship between the district attorney's (office) and the LAPD is very, 
very sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti agreed. "Anytime there's a long, protracted situation, there's going 
to be issues," he said. "I think we have probably the best working professional 
relationship that we have ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Simpson case has triggered a series of pointed disagreements 
-- perhaps the most serious of which involve news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 At the district attorney's office, sources say prosecutors blame police for 
putting out an erroneous report about DNA test results, which some believe was 
leaked to retaliate for a tongue-lashing that a police detective took from 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito that same day; at Parker Center, meanwhile, 
some police believe that the district attorney's office leaked the same story 
in an effort to bolster its motion to sequester the jury. Both agencies deny 
any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other disputes have erupted over the way detectives conducted searches in 
their quest to build a case against O.J. Simpson, who has proclaimed his 
innocence in the face of charges that he committed the double homicide. And 
despite their public proclamations, high-level officials from the two agencies 
and the city attorney's office continue to dispute how the tapes of dramatic 
911 calls placed by Nicole Simpson in 1989 managed to be publicly released. 
</P>
<P>
 The slip-ups and finger-pointing in the Simpson case are far from the first 
time that the LAPD and district attorney's office have been at odds. In fact, 
the relationship is rife with discord, and several recent cases have deepened 
the animosity: Many police officers were furious at prosecutors' refusal to 
bring charges against entertainer Michael Jackson; others were angry about a 
prolonged and aggressive investigation of a police shooting that left a woman 
dead atop a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been tension in the relationship, and given a case like this 
where everyone is watching, it's only gotten worse," said former Dist. Atty. 
Ira Reiner, who blames the LAPD for most of the tension. "Historically, the 
LAPD has not really been up to the standards that the D.A. would like." 
</P>
<P>
 Police vehemently reject that characterization and tend to belittle the 
district attorney's office as a political creature, contrasting that with their 
perception of the LAPD as a professional institution largely immune to the 
whims of public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of historical tensions and new feuding means that a sometimes 
divided law enforcement team has been handed the challenge of defeating 
Simpson's battery of investigators and lawyers. Eager to sow discord and to 
uncover the sources of news reports, Simpson's lawyers have wasted few chances 
to encourage mistrust among their adversaries, calling for the attorney general 
to investigate leaks and suggesting that police cannot be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of Simpson's lead attorneys, said his side is not 
averse to raising issues that divide the opposition. "In our position, 
sometimes you have to be confrontational," Cochran said. "You have to put the 
other side on the defensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams acknowledged that the defense efforts have produced some results. "I 
think some of the differences have been exacerbated by the defense team," the 
chief said. "They have half a dozen of the best defense attorneys in the 
country. . . . The defense team is doing a very skillful and in some respects 
successful job of exploiting the differences." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's other lead lawyer, declined to venture a guess 
about the inner workings of the police and prosecution teams, but he crowed 
about a recent appearance by Williams on a talk show where the 911 tapes were 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 On one of the tapes, Nicole Simpson sobs as a man she identifies as her 
ex-husband shouts angrily in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti had previously blamed the Police Department and the city attorney for 
making public the explosive tapes, which he said were released without his 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, however, cast the release in a far different light, suggesting that 
the prosecutorial agencies favored making the tapes public while police were 
trying to exercise restraint. In an interview last week, Williams said he had 
expressed reservations about making public the 911 tape but that officials from 
the city attorney's office and from the district attorney's office "felt that 
it was appropriate to release" them in response to media requests for the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chief of police came out and basically called Garcetti a liar," Shapiro 
said of Williams' remarks. "That certainly suggests some disagreements." 
</P>
<P>
 The squabbling over how the tape was released remains a sore point between the 
agencies, and Williams said he believes better protocols may be needed to 
clarify departmental responsibilities in high-profile cases such as the Simpson 
investigation. Although the top brass of the agencies are working to smooth 
over differences, potentially serious miscommunications in the Simpson case 
have occurred over the collection and testing of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 During a hearing last month, government lawyers were stunned when a package 
was opened in court and they learned for the first time of a note from Nicole 
Simpson to her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer who seized the note said he had taken it because he believed it 
may have hinted at a possible motive for O.J. Simpson to have committed the 
murders. But the letter's impact on the prosecution case was ambiguous at best, 
and government attorneys were forced to publicly admit that they had never 
before seen the document. Although prosecutor Clark tried to downplay the 
importance of that new evidence, law enforcement sources say members of the 
district attorney's office were furious to learn of the note's contents months 
after it was seized. 
</P>
<P>
 Other mistakes have surrounded blood samples: Scores were collected, and 
prosecutors were forced to concede at one point that samples had been sent to a 
lab by the LAPD without their knowledge. Although Ito found that no subterfuge 
was intended, the judge icily described the efforts of police and prosecutors 
as "a picture of confusion, miscommunication and non-communication." 
</P>
<P>
 Some gripes are more personal. Within the LAPD, some officers make sexist 
comments about Clark's temperament and say that she is not the right person to 
handle such an important case. 
</P>
<P>
 "She flies off the handle," one police officer said. "That's a problem they 
have in that office with the women prosecutors." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has consistently declined to discuss the case outside court. She did not 
respond to a request for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, some prosecutors see LAPD detectives as sloppy investigators 
whose work has deteriorated in recent years in the face of cutbacks and 
plummeting Police Department morale. Others like and respect their LAPD 
counterparts but nevertheless complain about the quality of work that the 
department is producing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality and crime-fighting relevance of felonies submitted to us for 
filing has substantially decreased," Donald N. Eastman, a high-ranking official 
in the office, wrote in a memo to Garcetti last year. "Our line lawyers feel 
that LAPD officers are compelled by current circumstances to go through the 
motions, push paper, work their shift and go home." 
</P>
<P>
 Such complaints, Reiner said, are nothing new: "The expression that has been 
used for years in the D.A.'s office to describe the LAPD is: 'Just enough is 
enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It is that attitude, say sources close to the Simpson case, that has helped 
contribute to some of the Police Department's miscues. Among others, the 
failure to log the contents of the Nicole Simpson note and the careless 
safeguarding of Simpson's Ford Bronco while it was in police custody have 
irritated prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although personality conflicts, longstanding animosities and confusion about 
evidence have contributed to the unease between the agencies in the Simpson 
case, it is the continuing stream of leaks that has most bitterly divided the 
two organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening days of the investigation, police and prosecutors have blamed 
each other for numerous news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on in the case, The Times and some other news organizations carried 
reports disclosing that a pair of bloody gloves -- one at Simpson's home and 
one at the murder scene -- had been recovered. Law enforcement sources provided 
that information, and Simpson's lawyer at the time, Howard Weitzman, denied it 
up until the day he left the case. That report later was borne out in 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Other reports disclosed that blood drops from the scene matched some of the 
characteristics of Simpson's blood; the first stories dealt with conventional 
blood analysis, and subsequent articles have detailed far more sophisticated 
DNA test results. Other stories revealed that Simpson had cuts and scratches 
when interviewed by police, that an off-duty Los Angeles police sergeant 
provided security for Simpson while he was under investigation, and that a hair 
recovered from Goldman's body resembles hair samples taken from Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both sides have complained that the information in those reports was 
improperly released, neither police nor prosecutors nor defense attorneys have 
challenged the veracity of any of those stories -- all of which were reported 
first by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, however, feuding over leaks has gained intensity because of 
television reports that inaccurately portrayed the status of scientific testing 
in the case. Those stories, which were aired first by KNBC Channel 4 and were 
echoed by CNN, reported that DNA tests of blood on a pair of socks discovered 
in Simpson's bedroom genetically matched Nicole Simpson's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 During court discussions about those reports, defense attorneys and 
prosecutors formed an unusual alliance and requested an investigation to ferret 
out the source of the leaks. Denying all responsibility themselves, the 
attorneys together attacked the LAPD as the likely source of the erroneous 
disclosures. Cochran called for the LAPD to launch an Internal Affairs 
investigation, and, in a rare point of agreement with her adversary, Clark 
seconded that notion. 
</P>
<P>
 For police officers, it was one thing to be attacked by the Simpson defense 
team, but quite another to have the district attorney's office join in. 
</P>
<P>
 "How nice for them," one police officer said sarcastically. "All the lawyers 
get together and decide that none of them said anything. The one thing they all 
agree on is that we get blamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran court watchers, even those sensitive to the long rivalry between 
police and prosecutors, were surprised to see Clark so directly blame the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty undiplomatic to dump it on the Police Department," said Harland 
W. Braun, a noted criminal defense lawyer and former deputy district attorney. 
"I can see why it burns them." 
</P>
<P>
 Reiner agreed. "The LAPD has a legitimate beef on this one," he said. "The 
D.A.'s office is a big office, with lawyers, investigators, secretaries. . . . 
Anybody who would bet $2 that this information didn't come out of the D.A.'s 
office is just a gambler." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD has initiated an internal investigation to determine whether one of 
its officers was the source of that report. Prosecutors have not launched any 
comparable inquiry, but the defense has recently stepped up the pressure, 
trying again to drive a wedge between police and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a motion filed under seal last week, Simpson's lawyers asked for a hearing 
to search for the source of that report and possibly others. No matter what the 
outcome, the mere challenge may help further divide their adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's the case," Cochran said, "so be it."

FILIBUSTER BROKEN, SENATE OKS CALIF. DESERT PROTECTION; LEGISLATION: MILLIONS 
OF ACRES AFFECTED. DEATH VALLEY, JOSHUA TREE TO BE NATIONAL PARKS; VAST 
WILDERNESS AREAS WITHIN THEM ARE CREATED. STORMY 103RD CONGRESS ADJOURNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate, breaking an impasse stretching back nearly a decade, voted 
Saturday to approve the California Desert Protection Act, creating two new 
national parks and carving out millions of acres of federally protected 
wilderness areas in Southern and eastern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which for years was bogged down in a dispute between former 
California senators, was adopted handily -- but only after its supporters broke 
a Republican filibuster that threatened to add the measure to the long list of 
legislation doomed by partisan discord in the final days of the 103rd Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the vote, the Senate adjourned for the year. But like the House, 
which adjourned at 12:05 a.m. Saturday, the upper chamber will reconvene in 
seven weeks for a special session to consider a global trade measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration and environmental groups described the desert bill, 
which now awaits the President's signature, as an epic triumph. Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt called it "America's most significant environmental 
victory in more than a decade." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released by the White House, President Clinton called the 
bill's passage "a clear-cut victory for the people of California and everyone 
across America who cares about this nation's great natural heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a success for Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who vowed during 
her campaign two years ago to make the legislation a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something I ran to do," a beaming Feinstein said as she prepared to 
return to California to resume her tight reelection race against Rep. Mike 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara.) "It was a promise I made in my campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill designates 69 new Bureau of Land Management parcels totaling 3.5 
million acres as wilderness, elevates the Death Valley and Joshua Tree national 
monuments to national parks -- which affords greater protection -- and creates 
4 million more acres of wilderness in those parks and a new national preserve 
in the East Mojave. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the land already belongs to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The terrain is filled with ecological diversity, including several mountain 
ranges, huge sand dunes, some 2,000 plant and 600 animal species, more than 
100,000 archeological sites and even dinosaur tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, described the legislation as 
"the fruition of two decades of activism on behalf of desert protection." 
</P>
<P>
 For supporters, however, elation was preceded by some tense moments when, even 
after voting began on the Senate floor, key backers of the measure were nowhere 
in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Democrats had been home campaigning and attempted to fly back to 
Washington in the nick of time -- some aboard private charters hastily arranged 
by an unlikely travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wee hours of Saturday morning, Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) could be seen in a cloakroom just off the Senate floor, 
carrying on conversations over two phones. On one, Mitchell had a senator who 
was campaigning in his home state; on the other was a private aircraft company. 
Mitchell was making arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who returned with barely time to spare was Sen. Jim Sasser 
(D-Tenn.). He landed at National Airport in Washington only minutes before the 
vote to cut off the filibuster began. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun (D-Ill.) was even later, delayed by a mechanized 
garage door that would not open as she was leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
 When she finally burst into the Senate chamber, a broad grin on her face, a 
collective sigh of relief was heard from Democrats. Then Moseley-Braun and 
Feinstein happily embraced in the middle of the chamber as an insouciant clerk 
continued calling the roll. 
</P>
<P>
 The final vote to end debate was 68 to 23, eight votes more than needed. All 
23 opponents were Republicans, though another 14 GOP senators broke ranks to 
join with the Democratic majority. Immediately afterward, the Senate gave the 
bill final approval on a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to develop coherent California desert management policies date to the 
1970s. Once the issue reached Congress in 1986, however, it became mired in 
disputes between two former California senators: Democrat Alan Cranston, who 
first introduced the legislation, and Republican Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, with California's senators both Democrats, the measure seemed a 
shoo-in. The Senate approved its initial bill by a 69-29 vote and the House 
approved a somewhat different measure, 298 to 128. A conference report that 
reconciled the two versions was approved by the House on a voice vote Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) and several other Western senators mounted a 
filibuster, hoping to kill the measure as time was running out on this 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted Feinstein and her allies to accuse the Republicans of seeking to 
deny her a legislative victory that she could tout in her reelection campaign. 
Just before the votes Saturday morning, for instance, Sen. J. Bennett Johnston 
(D-La.), labeled the GOP filibuster "raw politics." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-Ida.), a former rancher, denied such charges. "It 
is not about politics. It is about how we will manage a very large chunk of 
federal property." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Wallop, who is retiring, said the creation of parks would severely 
strain the ability of the National Park Service to maintain the quality of 
existing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 They also argued that the bill was another example of the federal government's 
"war on the West" and individual property rights. "What we're doing is taking a 
vast piece of land off the map," Craig complained. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein countered that she had made numerous accommodations to protect 
private property, grazing, continuation of existing mining operations and other 
measures to get broad support. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the floor minutes before the Senate voted to end his filibuster, Wallop 
agreed with Feinstein that the bill had become embroiled in partisan politics. 
But he said it was Feinstein who had "made it political." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Democrats wasted little time after the vote to lavish praise on 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, appeared 
with Feinstein at a press conference and said: "Some people chose to make it a 
referendum on the effectiveness of Dianne Feinstein. And we have seen the 
results. It is the most remarkable one-senator bill I've seen up here in 22 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, as the debate focused on the merits of the measure, Craig challenged 
Johnston's assertion that the bill would prevent commercialization of 
wilderness areas -- specifically a proliferation of "hamburger palaces." 
</P>
<P>
 Quite the contrary, Craig predicted, the conversion of Death Valley and Joshua 
Tree into national parks would draw even more tourists and with them, 
"hamburger palaces." 
</P>
<P>
 In the final hour of debate on Saturday morning, the Senate chamber also 
echoed with florid, even rapturous, descriptions of the beauty of California's 
deserts as members on both sides of the debate sought to outdo one another in 
professing their love -- and determination to protect -- the state's 
wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston called it "a feeling akin to love of family." Craig, who said he had 
spent countless hours in California's wilderness, confessed, "I've learned to 
love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many compromises along the way was one involving the status of the 
East Mojave National Scenic Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate had upgraded the land to national park status, which would forbid 
hunting. But the House, pressured by hunters and the National Rifle Assn., made 
the land simply a preserve, where hunting would be allowed to continue. The 
final bill contained the House language. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed," said Norbert Riedy, a Wilderness Society official. 
"But, given the huge amount of land that is now protected under this bill, we 
are ecstatic. . . . It is the most significant land protection bill since the 
Alaska Lands Act of 1980." 
</P>
<P>
 The desert bill was the last major piece of legislation to clear Congress. But 
the Senate, still struggling toward adjournment, had to overcome one final GOP 
filibuster before weary and surly senators could follow their House colleagues 
out of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its final actions, the Senate approved a compromise measure to require 
the makers of dietary supplements to put disclaimers on the labels of products 
for which they have made unsubstantiated health claims. 
</P>
<P>
 It also approved the installation of new equipment to allow the FBI to monitor 
calls made over digitalized public- and cellular-phone systems. And the "nanny 
tax" bill was approved, which exempts household employers from having to pay 
the Social Security and Medicare taxes of their domestic workers, unless the 
workers are paid more than $1,000 per year. All three measures were passed 
earlier by the House. 
</P>
<P>
 But adjournment still would not come for several more hours as Sen. Charles E. 
Grassley (R-Iowa) insisted on speaking at length against the promotions of 
several senior Air Force officers implicated in mismanagement scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Under immense pressure from his antsy colleagues, Grassley finally agreed to 
drop his threatened filibuster and allow the promotions to pass, whereupon the 
exhausted senators went home.

UPBEAT MESSAGES WON'T DO, POLITICAL CANDIDATES FIND; CAMPAIGNS: WITH PUBLIC SO 
FRUSTRATED AND CYNICAL, OFFICE SEEKERS EXPLOIT LURE OF TRADITIONAL VALUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Not long ago, people trying to reelect Gov. Pete Wilson tested two versions of 
a TV commercial about immigration. One was a mostly positive spot about 
Wilson's goals. The other was mostly an attack on his opponent, Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess which one the test audience loved? 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw the negative spot and said . . . 'Oh, powerful.' It seemed more 
honest," said one of the campaign officials involved. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that kind of year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the war for hearts and minds on television in this strange and possibly 
pivotal political season, the public has become so frustrated and cynical that 
politicians who want to run positive messages find they don't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't believe anything good about politicians, and they are ready to 
believe almost anything bad," said Republican media consultant Eddie Mahe. 
</P>
<P>
 From Philadelphia to Phoenix and Boston to San Francisco, "the percentage of 
negative advertising . . . is the highest it's ever been," Mahe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets worse every year, but it's never been like this," agreed Democratic 
political consultant Jim Margolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is significant on at least two levels: 
</P>
<P>
 Because the ads contain messages tested and honed by campaign professionals, 
they may well serve as a reflection of the electorate's mood. Poll after poll 
have found that voters are even more sour on politicians this year than in 1992 
-- when incumbents were swept from office coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone of the ads also means that the image most people have of candidates 
this year is a negative one, which raises disturbing questions about the 
likelihood that voters will regain confidence in their political leaders 
anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of dozens of ads and interviews with political professionals provide 
the following topography of the 1994 campaign: 
</P>
<P>
 * The star of most Republican advertising in federal races is President 
Clinton, and in these ads, the No. 1 reason for voting Republican seems to be 
to avoid sending more people to Washington who think like he does. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most Democrats don't mention their party, don't mention their President and 
instead run by comparing themselves to their Republican opponents, an approach 
that is personal rather than ideological -- and also highly negative. 
</P>
<P>
 * Party identification doesn't mean much except in local races. Being a 
Republican incumbent is almost as scandalous as being a Democratic one. 
</P>
<P>
 * After Clinton, the No. 2 issue is crime -- partly, say consultants, because 
the subtext is morality. Crime strikes people as being about right and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 * Republicans still find welfare reform is an issue with great resonance among 
conservatives. Abortion and the death penalty, however, have faded as issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * While negative ads are on the rise, they are rarely straight-out attacks. 
Instead, they are usually "comparative," meaning they involve information about 
both candidates and contrast their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the negative Wilson ad on immigration preferred by the test 
audience began with Wilson's position that illegal immigrants should not 
receive state benefits. "Kathleen Brown thinks differently," it said. "She 
supports continuing state services to illegals and says illegal immigration is 
not a cause of problems in California." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no appeal to the straight attack," said Republican consultant Mike 
Murphy, whose clients include Gov. John Engler in Michigan and Virginia Senate 
candidate Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate research has found that three words above all evoke the most meaning 
for voters this year, said Murphy: "Washington," "new" and "liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 Most candidates around the country running for federal office suggest that 
they know what's wrong in Washington, that they possess something new and that 
the other guy is liberal -- or, in the case of Democratic candidates, that they 
themselves are moderate, rather than liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 And what messages are working best for Democrats? 
</P>
<P>
 "Zero," Margolis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still looking," said another consultant. "But don't use my name." 
</P>
<P>
 After several seconds of rueful laughter, Democratic consultant Don Sweitzer 
answered, "None." 
</P>
<P>
 The best approach many Democrats have found is to suggest that the Republican 
opponent is simply unacceptable. "If you can make the race a choice between two 
individuals, then you have a shot to hang on," Sweitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few Democratic campaign professionals who seems upbeat is Frank 
Greer, whose firm still expects to win about half of its races, all of them 
incumbents. Many of Greer's campaigns are geared to defining his Democratic 
clients as moderate and their Republican rivals as extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles is using testimonials from 
Republicans who favor abortion rights to depict opponent Jeb Bush as 
politically extreme and interested in intruding government into people's 
private lives because of his desire to ban abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Maryland, Democrat Parris Glendening is running for governor as a 
"mainstream moderate," depicting Republican Ellen Sauerbrey as an extremist 
because she opposed banning assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a formula to stop the right-wing," Greer said. "A lot of 
these conservative candidates say they're for cutting taxes and spending, but 
their real agenda is social -- banning abortion and ruining public education in 
favor of private schools." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hands of some Democrats, this effort to carve out the political 
mainstream can get awfully harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Democratic Rep. Mike Kreidler of Washington state has a new ad about 
his Republican challenger, Randy Tate: "In Randy Tate's world, women will have 
no reproductive choices, worse health care security, no protection from fanatic 
murderers like (anti-abortion activist) Paul Hill, fewer options when they are 
battered or raped, less help when they are pregnant and less help with raising 
their children." 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Republicans have an easy job, Democratic operatives moan. Hang 
Bill Clinton around the Democrat's neck. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in Wyoming's Senate race, Republican Rep. Craig Thomas attacks 
Gov. Mike Sullivan by having former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney offer this 
testimonial on camera: "Bill Clinton's proposals . . . have been a disaster for 
our nation. We simply cannot afford to send another friend of Bill Clinton's to 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular techniques in TV ads has been to "morph" a Democratic 
rival into Clinton -- employing special effects to have the rival candidate's 
face change into the President's. 
</P>
<P>
 In Alabama, Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman is morphed into Clinton. In Michigan, 
Democratic Rep. Bob Carr is morphed into Democratic Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., 
and then linked to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in both parties are running ads about values and morality and a 
sense of lost social moorings. In California, Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara), the GOP's Senate candidate, has an ad in which he holds up "The Book 
of Virtues," former Education Secretary William J. Bennett's best-seller. 
Democratic Sen. Jim Sasser in Tennessee talks about lost values in America with 
voters standing around a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 But most candidates are more subtle, seeking out issues in which morality is a 
subtext. 
</P>
<P>
 In Virginia, North talks about how he knows "what's wrong with Washington and 
what's right with Virginia." It is word for word what Republican Dirk 
Kempthorne said to get elected to the Senate from Idaho in 1992, using the same 
consultant, Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 George W. Bush's ads in the Texas governor's race end with the tagline, "Take 
a stand for Texas values. Bush for governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democratic officeholders are suffering the most this year, Republican 
lawmakers also find themselves forced to address the backlash against 
incumbency. Mahe says he tells his clients to write him a speech as if they 
were running as a challenger. It becomes the basis of the advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 For Democrats like Sweitzer, the difficulty Republican incumbents are having 
suggests that the resentment is not so much party oriented or even strictly 
ideological. The problem instead is incumbency and status quo. "It is amazing 
how for challengers, the Democratic drag isn't as deep." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've mentioned party at all in any campaign," said Don Sipple, 
a consultant whose clients often occupy the Republican center, like Wilson in 
California or Gov. Jim Edgar in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 In federal races in particular, Sipple said, a lot of standard Republican 
issues of the past are gone. "One that has lost a lot of power is taxes and 
spending. They are just washed out by over-promising and under-performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some Democrats think that Republicans may have made a mistake with 
their "contract with America" plan unveiled recently, which promised to cut 
taxes and balance the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if the year is adding up to trouble for sitting lawmakers, incumbency 
still has one advantage, consultants believe: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have five races with incumbents, and I should lose all of them," said a 
Democratic consultant. "But I am going to win two of them, just because the 
challengers are new and are making a lot of mistakes. In one, the other guy is 
wasting all his money on biographical ads, which don't work any more. In the 
other one, the guy has promised not to run any attack ads."

U.S. LINKS WITH CHINA'S MILITARY RAISE CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last two months, the Pentagon has moved quietly but rapidly to develop 
military ties with the Chinese People's Liberation Army, raising questions in 
the United States and among Asian governments about what the new relationship 
means and where it is headed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, in a private ceremony, a top Chinese general received the same 
sort of honor cordon at the Pentagon that Haitian President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide recently received on nationwide television. Last month, Gen. Merrill 
A. McPeak, U.S. Air Force chief of staff, visited Beijing for talks and a 
banquet with the Chinese army's air force commander. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ties bear the personal imprimatur of Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry, who has been active in promoting cooperation between the U.S. and 
Chinese defense industries since his days as a senior Pentagon official in the 
Jimmy Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, who has maintained personal ties with some senior Chinese military 
leaders, will cement the new relationship with the Chinese army next week, when 
he pays his own visit to Beijing and establishes a U.S.-China commission to 
discuss possible cooperation between the two countries' defense industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is important for our government to have a good working 
relationship with a country as important as China. I think that should include 
a defense-to-defense relationship," Perry said in an interview with The Times 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his ties with Chinese leaders "will be an asset in developing a good 
relationship. The Chinese are very strong . . . for what they call old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some hard problems to work out with them," the defense secretary 
said, citing China's sales of missiles to Pakistan and other countries and the 
U.S. effort to secure more Chinese help in stopping North Korea's nuclear 
program. And on Friday, China conducted its second nuclear test this year, 
defying pressure to join an international nuclear-testing moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of observers, including some U.S. government officials, believe that 
the new links will pave the way for the sale of military-related technology 
from American companies to China. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inevitably going to lead to that," one U.S. government official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael D. Swaine, a RAND Corp. specialist on the Chinese army, observed of 
U.S. policy-makers: "They seem to be trying to find a way to create some kind 
of sales without raising all kinds of reactions from Congress. The logic of the 
situation . . . is that the Clinton Administration is going to want to provide 
further assistance to U.S. businesses in China, including in areas that are 
defense-related." 
</P>
<P>
 But Perry categorically denied that there will be any discussion of arms 
sales, American technology or any other American help for China's military 
during his trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing that I will be doing (in China) will be designed to enhance China's 
military capability," he said. "It may be that the Chinese Defense Ministry 
will make proposals to us that could involve a strengthening of their military 
activity. That's not what we're there to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pentagon officials say they have no intention of opening the way for 
direct government-to-government arms sales, they leave open the possibility of 
American sales of civilian technology with military applications -- such as 
computers, radar and advanced electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry acknowledged that the United States might someday -- but not on his 
forthcoming trip -- seek to establish a military cooperation program with 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never say never," he said, "but I don't now conceive of the circumstances 
in which I would see it as in our security interests to be taking actions to 
deliberately plan to strengthen the military capability of China. That's not 
what we're there to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials also portray the new effort as a way of trying to deal with 
China as a future military superpower. They say they want to find out what the 
Chinese military is doing and to reassure its leaders, through direct contact, 
that the Pentagon does not view China as an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the military links between the United States and China have begun to raise 
eyebrows in places such as Russia, India, Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries, 
all of which are wary of China's growing military power and loath to have the 
United States do anything that would make China any stronger than it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said that top leaders of other Asian countries "have all urged me to 
form a strong relationship with China, and have been at times critical of our 
government for not working more closely with China." 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that none of the other Asian leaders "would propose today 
that we be involved today in arms sales to China or cooperative weapons 
development programs with China." 
</P>
<P>
 The ties are controversial in Washington, where critics worry about the moral 
implications and the impact inside China of dealing with its army. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, although apparently with some reluctance, top military leaders 
carried out the orders of China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, to remove 
pro-democracy demonstrators from the streets of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always say this (relationship) doesn't give credibility to the PLA. But 
you've got to be realistic about it," said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, the 
Colorado Democrat and a member of the House Armed Services Committee. "They 
(Chinese army leaders) are going to say at home, 'The Americans come here 
because we're such a great power.' " 
</P>
<P>
 William C. Triplett, former chief counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee and author of a forthcoming book about the Chinese military, said the 
Pentagon should have "the same kind of relationship (with China's army) that we 
would have had with Hitler's general staff in 1938. Correct, yes, but the idea 
of cooperation with them is insane. . . . This is not France or Belgium here. 
We're talking about a government which has used its military to enforce 
totalitarian rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1989, the Pentagon and the Chinese army had extensive military links, 
based on their shared interest in counteracting Soviet military power in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The ties included high-level visits, technology transfers, arms sales and 
strategic cooperation on issues such as Afghanistan and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the bloody Tian An Men Square crackdown, then-President George Bush 
suspended all official contacts with the Chinese army and all U.S. military 
sales to China. To China's irritation, not only were new American sales 
prohibited, arms transfers already in process were held up for nearly four 
years. For both the Pentagon and the Chinese, the events of 1989 were a 
watershed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no intention to go back to pre-1989 days," one Pentagon official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 China, however, is now lobbying hard to have the Clinton Administration lift 
the 1989 ban on direct arms sales to China and to open the way for transfers of 
technology with military applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban on arms sales "shows there is still a shadow over our relations," 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told a news conference here last week. "If 
we want to remove this shadow, we must work to lift these sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 He urged the Administration to open the way for sales of military equipment, 
including spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other governments believe that, whatever the Pentagon says publicly, it is 
maneuvering to become a supplier of military technology to China. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two countries' interests converge," one European intelligence source 
observed. "The United States has defense industries that need new sales, and 
China wants Western technology, because it doesn't want to rely entirely on 
what it can buy from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are also some difficulties," the source added. "The Americans want 
to sell off-the-shelf systems for quick income, and the Chinese want transfers 
of technology so that they can be able to make things on their own over the 
long term." 
</P>
<P>
 On Perry's trip to China, he will hold the first official meeting of what will 
be called the U.S.-China Commission on Defense Conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the panel is supposed to talk about ways of helping defense 
industries change over to civilian production. But Perry's new panel will also 
open the way for broader exchanges between the U.S. and Chinese defense 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials on the panel will include representatives of the State and 
Defense departments, the National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
and, of particular note, the Commerce Department -- the lead agency in 
promoting U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said he hoped the commission will help to establish "business 
partnerships" between U.S. companies and the Chinese defense industry. One 
possibility, he said, is that U.S. companies can help supply designs and 
marketing for low-technology products made by Chinese enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry served as undersecretary of defense in the Jimmy Carter Administration, 
when the United States was just opening the way for transfers of 
military-related technology to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was closely involved in making more sophisticated technology available to 
the Chinese," said one career U.S. official, recalling Perry's efforts then. 
"He was in the vanguard of liberalizing U.S. export controls for China." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Perry led the way in changing the export rules so China would 
be treated more leniently than other Communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said he is proud of the work he did in trying to help China's military 
in 1980, but he is not trying to revive those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of history that has changed in the past 14 years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the friends Perry made on that 1980 trip was Gen. Liu Huaqing, who is 
now one of China's top military leaders. And in the early 1990s, while teaching 
at Stanford University, he met Gen. Ding Henggao, who is now minister of the 
State Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. The 
commission supervises the Chinese defense industry, and Ding will be China's 
top leader on the joint commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials say one of the main purposes of the high-level 
contact with the Chinese army is to avoid having the two sides drift into some 
sort of new Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think of them as an enemy, and they shouldn't think of us as an 
enemy," one Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald N. Montaperto, a China expert at the National Defense University who 
escorted four Chinese military officials on a recent trip to the United States, 
said he found leaders of China's army to be "much less trustful, much more 
suspicious than they were two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 "The PLA senior leadership is very taken by the notion that this 
Administration sees China as a future hostile peer competitor, and that U.S. 
policies reflect an attempt to prevent China from completing its program of 
economic development. They need to be disabused of this incorrect notion," 
Montaperto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Pentagon officials argue that the Chinese army will get stronger with or 
without help from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two years, for example, China has made big buys of military 
technology from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a military you can keep down on the farm," one Defense Department 
official observed. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of the new links say the United States should do as little as 
possible to help China's army. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we doing?" asked Jeff Fiedler, who works on China issues for the 
AFL-CIO. "Why do we want to strengthen the Chinese military? It could change 
the balance of power in Asia, to the detriment of the Japanese, who are a 
democracy without a large army." 
</P>
<P>
 "I get nervous when we trade items with high technology," Schroeder added. 
"How far will this go? I don't know. I find it really kind of dangerous."

NEWS ANALYSIS; FEINSTEIN, HUFFINGTON SPLIT ON ROLE OF GOVERNMENT; POLITICS: 
SENATOR BELIEVES IN ACTIVELY PURSUING LEGISLATIVE AGENDA; CHALLENGER USES HIS 
VOTE AGAINST BIG SPENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First-term Sen. Dianne Feinstein quickly established herself as a player in a 
tradition-bound institution that expects newcomers to sit on the sidelines. She 
labored intensely on two high-octane committees and latched onto hundreds of 
millions of new federal dollars for California. 
</P>
<P>
 First-term Rep. Mike Huffington is widely regarded by his colleagues as a 
phantom. He attended committee hearings and cast votes, but demonstrated little 
interest in the craft of legislating, in using his clout to help his Santa 
Barbara district or even in following through on promises to shake up Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 California voters could not ask for a more stark contrast between the two 
major candidates for U.S. Senate this year, at least based on a review of their 
performances on Capitol Hill over the past 21 months. Feinstein and Huffington 
hold such contrary views about the role of government in today's world -- and 
pursue their lawmaking roles so differently -- that they seem to be operating 
in separate universes. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, both candidates agree to a large extent on their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, a career Democratic politician, boasts of her ability to work the 
layers of government bureaucracy, and unapologetically goes after every crumb 
of the federal pie for California. 
</P>
<P>
 "My record has been that of a real senator, with hands-on impact in 
constituent service as well as legislation," Feinstein said in an interview. 
"I'm there at every turn to fight for California's interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, a Republican oil and gas tycoon, rails against federal 
intervention and backs that up with his record as a legislative naysayer. He 
regularly voted against multibillion-dollar spending bills, even though their 
defeat would deny funding for programs he supports. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will not find me producing a lot of new laws and regulations, that's for 
certain," said Huffington, speaking proudly of his legislative record. "My 
point is that I want to try to remove the federal government's intrusiveness 
from people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their different approaches, their disagreement on the role of 
government and on many economic issues, the 47-year-old Huffington and 
61-year-old Feinstein agree to a surprising extent on a range of social issues. 
They both favor abortion rights, the death penalty, inclusion of gays in the 
military, stricter handgun registration provisions and laws requiring 
businesses to grant their employees unpaid family and medical leave. They also 
support a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget and a 
presidential line-item veto. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, voting studies show that Feinstein is nearly the political clone of 
President Clinton and liberal Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). Both California 
senators cast more than 90% of their votes in line with the President's 
positions last year, according to an analysis by Congressional Quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who bills himself as an "independent Republican," voted with his 
party 86% of the time. But he was one of only two California Republicans to 
support Feinstein's assault weapons ban and the only one to oppose a GOP 
alternative to the Clinton tax plan that would have reduced the deficit by $352 
billion over five years. Huffington said the Republican measure did not go far 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington attacks Feinstein's critical vote last year that provided the 
margin of victory in the Senate for the Clinton Administration's economic plan. 
He claims the budget package, by some measures the largest federal tax increase 
in history, saddled Californians with a $37-billion tax hike. Feinstein 
contends that only the wealthiest Californians were affected and the Clinton 
economic plan is projected to reduce the federal deficit by $691 billion 
through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, Huffington consistently opposed huge appropriations bills that 
pay for individual programs he supports. He is a hawk on defense, but voted 
five times against the Pentagon budget. He favors increased funding for an 
additional 1,300 Border Patrol agents to fight illegal immigration -- a measure 
Feinstein helped get through the Senate -- but voted three times against the 
necessary spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington explained that he supports the financing of specific programs, but 
often opposes huge spending bills because they simply cost too much. He said 
his voting record demonstrates that, if elected to the Senate, he would be an 
extreme fiscal conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be voting for income tax increases. I will be voting against a lot of 
spending," he said. "Whereas Feinstein has been gobbling up 8 million acres (in 
her California desert bill) and taking away guns, and she interferes in other 
people's lives, I'll be the opposite. In the Senate, I can probably get rid of 
a lot of that junk." 
</P>
<P>
 On the campaign trail, Huffington portrays himself as part of a new generation 
of citizen lawmakers committed to overhauling Congress. He calls Feinstein an 
out-of-touch, career politician who revels in the perquisites of office. 
</P>
<P>
 On this point, their actions paint a less clear picture than Huffington 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 A comparison of their respective records during the 103rd Congress shows that 
Huffington played an insignificant role in shaping any kind of reform 
legislation, a mainstay of his campaign, while Feinstein succeeded in making 
reform-minded changes that she pledged to carry out during her 1992 Senate 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 When Huffington ran for the House, he vowed to repeal all perks and gratuities 
enjoyed by members of Congress, slash the congressional staff payroll and 
eliminate the franking privilege that allows lawmakers to send 
taxpayer-financed mail to their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond donating his salary to charity and paying the cost of his government 
air fare, Huffington has not participated in shaping legislation that would 
prevent lawmakers from accepting free travel, entertainment, meals and other 
gifts from lobbyists. A list of reform accomplishments released by Huffington's 
House office includes a floor statement endorsing term limits, an appearance 
with Ross Perot and a press release hailing a change in Republican Party rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's House office and payroll expenses through June 30 amounted to 
$981,204 -- only 8% less than his predecessor. And Huffington spent $57,097 in 
mass mailings to his Santa Barbara district, ranking him fourth-lowest among 
California freshmen House members but far above Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Feinstein has spent only $3,593 on mass mailings to date and 
cut her Senate payroll and office expenditures 25%, as she promised during the 
1992 campaign. Moreover, Feinstein, like Huffington, has accepted no travel 
junkets or gifts from lobbyists, according to financial disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman who belongs to the minority party in the 435-member House of 
Representatives, Huffington seldom gets an opportunity to shape the outcome of 
legislation. This frustration, Huffington says, motivated him to run for the 
100-member Senate because lawmakers there have much more influence in passing 
-- and thwarting -- legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, based on his brief tenure in the House, it is unclear what kind 
of senator Huffington would make. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ordinarily, someone has made a record of sorts that would give you some basis 
for inferring what kind of senator they would be," said Thomas E. Mann, 
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. "But in this 
case, he just hasn't left a trace." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann said Huffington did not set out like most new members of Congress in 
pursuing an area of specialty such as serving his constituents back home or 
engaging in serious legislative activity on a specific issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Huffington has introduced only three bills in the 103rd Congress and 
all three will expire without progressing to the stage of an initial hearing. 
Of the more than 700 pieces of legislation submitted to the House Banking 
Committee on which he sits, Huffington has not offered a single bill or 
amendment. By comparison, Feinstein has submitted 28 bills and 15 amendments in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he has no intention of joining his colleagues in the "charade" 
of building a phony legislative record for reelection purposes. In this 
Congress alone, Huffington points out, the House has introduced more than 6,000 
legislative measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the seriousness of the crises facing our nation, most of this 
legislative activity amounts to little more than reshuffling the deck chairs on 
the Titanic," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 The central theme of Huffington's campaign involves a proposal to replace 
government welfare with private philanthropy. Yet, as a House member, he has 
largely ignored the ongoing congressional debate over welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Sinclair, a congressional scholar and UC Riverside political 
scientist, said: "It's taking the Reagan model to the nth degree: government is 
the problem and (it) should just stay the hell out of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Even fellow Republicans in the California congressional delegation privately 
acknowledge their dismay that Huffington, a multimillionaire political novice, 
opted to run for the Senate after serving only eight months in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one takes him very seriously," said one Southern California Republican, 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has had no such problem with her Senate colleagues. To be sure, she 
has been helped along by Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and the 
Democratic leadership, which wants her to succeed and retain the California 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said she fought for a spot as one of the first two women on the 
Judiciary Committee to address her top legislative priority -- reducing crime 
and violence. She added several amendments to the $30-billion crime bill: a ban 
on the future manufacture, sale and possession of 19 military-style assault 
weapons; stiffer penalties for criminals convicted of hate crimes; $1.8 billion 
to reimburse states for the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrant felons, and 
putting carjacking homicides on the list of federal death penalty offenses. She 
also successfully steered the sweeping California Desert Protection Act through 
the Senate and has become a leading proponent for overhauling the nation's 
immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's success, particularly passage of an assault weapons ban that had 
been bottled up in the Senate, "gave her a level of credibility right from the 
beginning that was unusual," said Norman J. Ornstein, resident scholar at the 
American Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first Californian to sit on the Senate Appropriations Committee in 24 
years, Feinstein waged hard-fought battles to secure $8.6 billon in earthquake 
relief assistance, continued funding for the B-2 bomber and other military 
aircraft that support more than 50,000 California jobs, $615 million in 
education funds for poor students and an additional $83 million this year for 
California agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked on agriculture appropriations to help farmers," Feinstein said. 
"(Huffington) says he's got a great uncle who has a farm, a Stetson and a belt 
buckle and he votes against every farm program. He says he is for more defense. 
He has done nothing." Candidate Records 
</P>
<P>
 Studies of votes cast by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) and Rep. Mike 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) reveal distinct differences between the two 
candidates. The following ratings, compiled by a dozen interest groups, are 
based on major votes during the 103rd Congress. A perfect score of 100 means 
the legislator voted in agreement with the particular interest group on all

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 49TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; 'GROUND ZERO' OF DEMOCRAT, 
GOP BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a surfer and a politician, Brian Bilbray prides himself on being able to 
catch a wave at precisely the opportune moment. 
</P>
<P>
 These days Bilbray, a three-term county supervisor, thinks he has grabbed the 
biggest wave of his career: a tubular monster he can ride all the way to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a Republican, an unrestrained basher of President Clinton, a hard-liner 
on illegal immigration, and a joyful signatory to the GOP candidates' pledge to 
cut taxes and slash spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilbray is confident he can topple first-term Rep. Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego) 
in an economically diverse district where voter registration is split nearly 
evenly between Republicans and Democrats and where Clinton's approval rating 
has plunged 20 points recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilbray, 43, even has a campaign slogan he figures is a killer: "If you like 
Clinton, you'll love Schenk." 
</P>
<P>
 Schenk, 49, an attorney with two decades of local political connections and a 
fund-raising ability that is nonpareil, refuses to concede an inch of political 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Bilbray signed the Republican pledge -- in a ceremony in San Diego 
with House Speaker-in-waiting Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) -- Schenk had a gibe of her 
own, aimed at the fact the pledge is redolent of early Reaganism. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you like voodoo economics, you'll love Brian Bilbray," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to politics 1994 in the 49th Congressional District, where the 
competing stratagems of the national political parties are on display in their 
purest form. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican challenger hopes to capitalize on Clinton's falling popularity 
and to appeal to voters who are angry and want to "send a message" to 
Washington. The Democratic incumbent insists that Clinton has gotten a bum rap 
and, besides, the race is a local affair, not a national referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, Republican leaders are predicting the capture of two dozen or more 
seats held by Democrats in the House of Representatives. A shift of 40 would 
give Republicans control of the House for the first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Schenk, Republicans are also optimistic about defeating three other 
first-term House Democrats by tying them to Clinton: Anna Eshoo of Atherton, 
Dan Hamburg of Ukiah and Jane Harman of Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an outreach to Latinos, the GOP is putting money and expertise 
behind Mary Alice Acevedo in her uphill fight against first-term Rep. Bob 
Filner of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 And sensing a Republican landslide, party faithful are dreaming of beating one 
or more of four longtime Democratic incumbents: Anthony C. Beilenson of 
Woodland Hills, George E. Brown Jr. of Colton, Vic Fazio of West Sacramento and 
Richard H. Lehman of North Fork in Madera County. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the President's approval problems, California Republicans are counting 
on the historical trend of the party in power to lose seats in midterm 
elections and also the coattail effect of believing they have a strong 
Republican candidate at the top of the ticket, Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Republican candidates were damaged when President George Bush 
abandoned California as a lost cause and concentrated the party's resources 
elsewhere, Republicans say. 
</P>
<P>
 "That hurt us very badly in several very close congressional races," said 
Jeannie Austin, co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee as she began 
a trip through California last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49th Congressional District, more than any other in California, has been 
picked by Republicans as one where the anti-Clinton, anti-incumbency mood can 
spell a Republican takeover. Gingrich, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), Jack Kemp, and 
Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour have all visited the 
district to help Bilbray. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just targeted," Bilbray said, "we're ground zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, strictly from the numbers, the district, which includes Imperial 
Beach, Coronado and the northern half of San Diego, looks like a prime spot for 
a Republican challenger. By voter registration, the district is 42% Republican, 
39% Democrat and 19% other affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics, however, is more than numbers. "Anyone who looks at registration and 
thinks this is a Republican district doesn't know anything about San Diego 
County," said John Kern, a Republican political consultant in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Schenk is expected to outspend Bilbray by at least 2 to 1. Bilbray describes 
his underfunded campaign as "guts versus bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, competing for an open seat in a newly redrawn district, Schenk 
outspent her Republican opponent Judy Jarvis, a political unknown, by 7 to 1 
and won by 51% to 43%. Political professionals found the race surprisingly 
close, given Schenk's lopsided advantage in money, name identification and 
political savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 As she fights for a second term, Schenk rejects any suggestion that she is 
running away from the President. And like the President, she blames the media, 
particularly the talk show firebrands, for "creating a climate of discontent." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the only reference to the President in Schenk's two television ads is 
not a positive one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lynn Schenk stood up to the President and sponsored the balanced budget 
amendment," the narrator says in one of the commercials. "Lynn Schenk: doing 
what's right for San Diego. " 
</P>
<P>
 And when Hillary Rodham Clinton came to San Diego on Sept. 9 for a fund-raiser 
in La Jolla, Schenk was nowhere to be seen. Schenk, who lives in La Jolla, said 
that she was in Washington on legislative business. 
</P>
<P>
 Schenk insists that her fortunes are not tied to Clinton's. "I beat the 
President by 9% to 10% last time," she said, a reference to the fact that 
Clinton gathered only 43% of the vote in the 49th District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bilbray campaign hopes to pummel Schenk with her vote in favor of the 
Clinton budget that raised taxes on couples earning more than $180,000 and her 
vote against an ethics investigation of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
 Of course being a member of the party in power also has its advantages, and 
Schenk is quick to cite the grants and contracts she has delivered, a list that 
has won praise from even rock-ribbed members of the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "No first-term congressperson has ever delivered as much for San Diego, or 
tackled such difficult issues, as Lynn Schenk," said business leader Mel Katz, 
a Republican and major supporter of Wilson's. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Organization for Women has Schenk at the top of its list for 
contributions and assistance in getting out the vote. On crime, both candidates 
boast of being tough as nails. But Bilbray may have an edge on the district's 
newest hot-button issue: illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Bilbray, then a lifeguard-turned-councilman in Imperial Beach, 
commandeered a skip-loader and, in defiance of federal environmental officials, 
built a berm to keep the Tijuana River from spewing sewage onto San Diego 
beaches. The episode made him a local celebrity, and Bilbray has made the 
skip-loader an emblem for his damn-the-bureaucrats style of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Schenk is convinced that Bilbray's fiery rhetoric about illegal immigration 
and government spending does not fit the district. "This is a moderate-centrist 
district," she said, "and I'm a moderate-centrist person. Brian Bilbray is much 
more extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 Bilbray finds a beachy metaphor to explain Schenk's situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She came in with the Clinton tide," Bilbray said, "and she's going out with 
the Clinton tide."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / SECRETARY OF STATE; CANDIDATES DIFFER SHARPLY ON EXTENT 
OF VOTER FRAUD; REPUBLICAN BILL JONES SAYS UP TO 15% OF THOSE ON CALIFORNIA 
ROLLS DO NOT BELONG THERE. DEMOCRAT MILLER SAYS THOSE CHARGES ARE EXAGGERATED. 
BOTH MEN STRUGGLE TO ATTRACT ATTENTION TO THEIR CAMPAIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, the two leading candidates for secretary of state in the Nov. 
8 election have much in common: Both are political unknowns in their mid-40s 
from the Central Valley who are scrambling for scarce campaign dollars and name 
recognition. Both even attend Baptist churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Look closer and the similarities vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Tony Miller, 46, the acting secretary of state, is a sophisticated 
Berkeley-trained lawyer, a career administrator and the first openly gay 
candidate to run for a statewide office anywhere in the country. After 18 years 
as legal counsel and top deputy in the secretary of state's office, he is in 
his first run for elected office. Claiming a lack of political experience, he 
describes himself as a non-politician and the best- qualified candidate for the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Bill Jones, 44, is a 12-year assemblyman and onetime GOP leader who 
speaks with a slight drawl and spends weekends helping run his family's farming 
business in Fresno County. As a legislator, he has been one of agriculture's 
best friends and a staunch opponent of environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 More important to his campaign, he is also the author of the "three strikes" 
criminal sentencing measure that was signed into law this year, increasing 
penalties for a third felony to 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates clash most over the issue of election fraud. If you listen 
to Jones, the voting rolls have been tainted by the inclusion of untold numbers 
of illegal immigrants and deceased voters. Nothing short of an overhaul in 
registration and voting procedures -- even requiring voters to present photo 
identification at the polls -- can prevent elections theft in California. But 
Miller scoffs at Jones' charges as exaggerated and his solutions as excessive. 
If there is fraud, Miller says, it should be rooted out, but he finds no 
evidence that it is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is mainly an argument going on in a vacuum. With little money for 
advertising, both candidates face the daunting task of attracting voters' 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise his visibility, Jones relies heavily on his claim to "three strikes" 
fame. On the campaign trail, he brings it up at every opportunity. Miller has 
tried to neutralize the issue by reminding voters that he is a recent crime 
victim -- he was robbed at gunpoint at a fast-food restaurant in Los Angeles in 
January -- and by endorsing the "three strikes" initiative on the November 
ballot, which is identical to the Jones' bill. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the job that the two are fighting for has little to do with prison 
terms meted out to repeat criminals. California's secretary of state 
coordinates elections, maintains campaign and lobbyist filings, publishes the 
statewide ballot pamphlet, files a variety of corporate records and is a member 
of the state's World Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones says the "three strikes" measure is relevant because it shows that he 
can get things done if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his genial, down-home demeanor, Jones is proving to be an aggressive 
campaigner, aiming his voter fraud charges squarely at Miller and Miller's 
former boss, longtime Secretary of State March Fong Eu. He contends that as 
many as 15% of all voters on the rolls in the state do not belong there -- that 
they are duplicate filings, non-citizens or dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller responds: "There just hasn't been wholesale fraud (in California). You 
can find abuses and use them to try to prove the whole system has been 
corrupted. That's simply not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones likes to point out that Mario Aburto Martinez, a Mexican citizen and the 
accused killer of Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, was 
registered to vote in San Pedro. What Jones does not volunteer is that Martinez 
never voted and was dropped from the Los Angeles County voter rolls as part of 
a routine address check, before the assassination. However, local election 
officials do confirm several examples of non-citizens registering and casting 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller asserts that many of these instances are the result of misinformation 
on the part of non-citizens who are encouraged to sign up by bounty hunters who 
are paid according to the number of people they register. Miller also notes 
that Jones voted for a 1992 measure that allows welfare applicants to use voter 
registration records as proof of residence to qualify for grants -- an 
incentive for non-citizens to register. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most effective thing is an effective anti-voter fraud unit," Miller said, 
referring to a small team of investigators he formed this year. Jones counters 
that the unit was long overdue and put in place as a result of his raising the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates advocate limits on campaign contributions. Jones supports 
reimposing contribution limits imposed by voters in 1988 when they approved 
Proposition 73, which was struck down in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller goes further. He also wants to put caps on what candidates and their 
committees are allowed to spend. And he has called for an end to the common 
practice of soliciting lobbyists for political contributions. Miller has 
voluntarily signed a California Common Cause pledge not to ask lobbyists for 
campaign money. Jones has refused to do so -- and several Capitol lobbyists 
showed up at a recent Jones fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Democrats, Miller is an enthusiastic supporter of the federal "motor 
voter" statute, which requires states to begin registering voters when they 
apply for driver's licenses or other state services. Jones pledges to implement 
the new law, but his fellow Republican, Gov. Pete Wilson, has ordered state 
officials not to start up the new registration system Jan. 1 unless the federal 
government provides the money to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller leaves no doubt what he will do if Wilson is reelected and refuses to 
comply: "If Pete Wilson is governor, on Jan. 2 of 1995 . . . if I am secretary 
of state, he will find himself in court on that afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has attacked his rival for reducing or forgiving millions of dollars in 
fines for those late in filing campaign and lobbyist disclosure statements. 
Miller says he has been evenhanded, forgiving and reducing fines regardless of 
party affiliation except where violations are shown to be willful. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was raised in the Northern California lumber town of Chester, where his 
father worked at the sawmill. The candidate lives on a small farm in the 
Central Valley, where he and his partner raise nuts and other crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller went off to UC Davis and then Boalt Hall, the law school at UC 
Berkeley. He was one of the original members of the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission. In 1976, he went to work for Eu as chief counsel in the 
secretary of state's office, later becoming her top deputy. Eu's campaign 
treasury is Miller's biggest contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was born on his father's ranch near Coalinga, Calif. He graduated from 
Cal State Fresno, where he was student body president. He lost in his first run 
for the Assembly in 1976. But he says he learned a lesson: When he ran again 
six years later, he hired the winner's campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he became the Assembly's Republican leader in a revolt against the 
"cavemen," conservative legislators who had run the GOP caucus for seven years. 
He stepped down the next year after Republicans lost two Assembly seats under 
his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the race are third-party candidates Peggy Christensen, Libertarian; 
Israel Feuer, Peace and Freedom; Margaret Garcia, Green, and Dorothy Kreiss 
Robbins, American Independent.

A REMARKABLE BOY IS LAID TO REST; MEMORIAL: FAMILY AND FRIENDS RECALL NICHOLAS 
GREEN, WHOSE ORGANS WERE DONATED TO OTHER CHILDREN AFTER HE WAS SLAIN BY 
ITALIAN BANDITS.

 A 7-year-old boy whose violent death on a European vacation helped bring life 
to five young Italians was buried Saturday, his brief but meaningful existence 
recalled by relatives, friends and classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has already helped save the lives of other children and indirectly perhaps 
many more in the future," Nicholas Green's father, Reginald, told relatives and 
friends at a reception after the funeral at St. Teresa Avila Catholic Church on 
the outskirts of this coastal community 50 miles north of San Francisco."He 
could have lived to 100 and done less. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also has struck a spark of love in the hearts of millions of parents and 
children around the world," Green added. "If this isn't immortality, it must 
surely come close." 
</P>
<P>
 The family donated the boy's organs for transplant, an act viewed in Italy as 
an outstanding example of generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas was asleep in the back seat of a car beside his 4-year-old sister, 
Eleanor, when gunmen shot him in an attempted highway robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Eleanor peered over the side of the grave and waved goodby as her 
brother's casket was lowered into the hillside cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 About 135 people, including representatives of the Italian government and 
members of the Italian media, squeezed into the tiny church near Bodega Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers said Nicholas was a remarkable child whose hero was Julius Caesar. 
The vacation in Italy had followed a summer of reading ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know it, but this quiet little boy was an angel and obviously a 
very effective one because he got his job done in seven years," a teacher said.

NATURE AND INDUSTRY LEARN COEXISTENCE; ENVIRONMENT: AGREEMENT THAT SET UP A 
6,000-ACRE WILDLIFE PRESERVE IN EXCHANGE FOR LAND USE RIGHTS IS HAILED BY SOME 
AS A PROTOTYPE. BUT OTHERS SAY IT IS A FLAWED DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ARAX, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwestern Kern County is not the kind of land that inspires poets, at least 
not during the day at the end of a dry summer. It is flatland scrub with 
six-foot-tall saltbushes and stunted grass. The mighty Kern River, far from its 
source, is dry bed. About the only thing moving is the water in the concrete 
sluice of the nearby California Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
 But within this region lies a 6,000-acre patch between Interstate 5 and Elk 
Hills that is prime habitat for wildlife, including several endangered species. 
Moreover, it is the site of a unique example of how endangered species and 
business -- in this case the oil industry -- can coexist and even flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 In a landmark 1992 agreement with the state, Arco Western Energy agreed to set 
aside the land and create a wildlife area, called Coles Levee Ecosystem 
Preserve. In exchange, the company received the right to explore for oil and 
gas on other land. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco and the state have been highly praised for the arrangement. Last week, 
the Coles Levee preserve received a 1994 Innovations in State and Local 
Government Award from the Ford Foundation and Harvard University -- one of the 
nation's most prestigious public service prizes. And the project has been 
singled out by the Clinton Administration as a novel approach to implementing a 
law that has become increasingly controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, including some environmentalists, have criticized it as a 
flawed deal that may set a bad precedent for future environmental efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kern County is no stranger to the Endangered Species Act. This is, after all, 
the place where a Chinese-bamboo farmer got his $50,000 tractor seized by the 
U.S. government for killing five kangaroo rats. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the same rat -- the Tipton kangaroo rat -- as well as the blunt-nosed 
leopard lizard, San Joaquin kit fox and a dozen other endangered animals and 
plants that figure to benefit from the state's deal with Arco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither the state nor the feds have the resources to police all the 
activities of Arco and other companies when it comes to endangered species," 
said Ron Rempel, a conservation planner with the state Department of Fish and 
Game. "So we've come up with a framework that meets the needs of both the 
environment and business." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Coles Levee preserve is a welcome end, environmental groups say, 
the state cut a weak deal with Arco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time land is set aside for wildlife we're pleased," said Mark Palmer, of 
the Mountain Lion Foundation, an environmental group. "But as far as Arco is 
concerned, it's business as usual on that land." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a New York transplant who was instrumental in getting the state and 
Arco to move on the idea of a preserve back in 1987. Alison Sheehey Cunningham 
said her activism was spawned one night while fishing in the Coles Levee area 
with her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had gone out there to clear my mind and all of a sudden there were these 
kangaroo rats with big bushy tails and big eyes hopping all over my feet. Then 
an opossum came up and stared right at me and then a raccoon came up and leaned 
on me. It was a magical experience." 
</P>
<P>
 During one of her daytime visits, Cunningham stumbled upon two hawks shot 
dead. Over the next month, she found more than two dozen dead or wounded raptor 
birds. The handiwork of humans was everywhere, she said. The dry stream beds 
had been damaged by off-road motorcyclists. Mesquite and cottonwood trees had 
been felled, one with a great blue heron nest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I got to know the land, the madder and madder I became," Cunningham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined the local Audubon Society and organized a meeting between state and 
federal regulators. Then she called Arco. "I told them they've got this great 
land here and they've got to save it. They were open and receptive to the 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Rempel, a 22-year veteran with the state Fish and Game, took over negotiations 
from there. He reminded Arco officials that their oil and gas production 
activities likely violated state and federal endangered species laws. At the 
same time, Rempel realized that his department -- lacking policing resources -- 
was hardly in a position to guarantee that future harm was not going to be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 To reconcile these two realities, Rempel came up with the idea of a 
"mitigation bank" or credit system, a staple of air pollution regulation. Arco 
would assign its 6,000-acre Coles Levee land to the state and establish a 
wildlife preserve, which the company would be in charge of monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the company would be allowed to continue existing operations on 
the land as long as it remained sensitive to the environment. In addition, Arco 
would receive 6,600 acres of mitigation credits, which could be applied to 
habitat elsewhere in the region that the company wanted to drill, bypassing the 
usual red tape. And if it wanted, Arco could sell the credits to builders or 
developers whose projects in the region would result in the destruction of 
endangered species habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists argue that too much was given to Arco and that the deal sets 
an unhealthy precedent for Chevron USA and others negotiating their own 
mitigation deals with the government. And they worry that the credits could be 
sold to a developer wanting to take land rich in another species. Each habitat, 
they point out, is unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid this is the government's easy way of getting out of the endangered 
species business," said Mary Griffen of the Kern County Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Wheeler, head of the state resources agency, disagrees. "This is a 
pioneering effort that integrates environmental and economic interests. It's 
been so well received that we're looking to apply the model statewide."

RISING LEGAL BATTLES TARNISH NORPLANT'S BRIGHT PROMISE; BIRTH CONTROL: 
CLASS-ACTION CLAIMS CHARGE SEVERE HEALTH PROBLEMS. PROPONENTS OF THE DEVICE 
BLAME MANY PROBLEMS ON ILL-TRAINED DOCTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was anticipated for decades and arrived with great fanfare in 1990. But now 
Norplant -- the first new birth control method offered to American women since 
oral contraceptives were introduced 25 years ago -- is the target of an 
expanding pool of lawsuits alleging serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 Southern California women have joined a class-action lawsuit 
charging that the implanted hormone contraceptive -- with a failure rate of 
only 0.04% when properly used -- has caused them severe side effects and 
complications they were not warned about. 
</P>
<P>
 The women are among several hundred others nationwide who have filed more than 
a dozen lawsuits in recent months against Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, the 
Philadelphia-based U.S. distributor of Norplant. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits -- which charge such adverse side effects as depression and heavy 
bleeding as well as excessive scarring and pain from removal of the device -- 
are a disappointing development for family planning experts who had heralded 
Norplant's arrival. Since the lawsuits began, the number of women who have 
asked that the device be removed has risen dramatically while requests for 
Norplant have fallen, family planning clinics nationwide report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the women who have joined in these lawsuits have good reason to do 
so, but I feel like it will have a chilling effect on other companies which 
might want to get into contraceptives research," said Lisa Kaeser, a public 
policy analyst with the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research and 
policy organization in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the thousands of lawsuits over silicone breast implants, which led 
to that product's demise, many health experts predict that Norplant will 
survive the scrutiny over its safety and efficacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most women who have Norplant are happy with the method, and most who have had 
them removed have had no problem with removals. It's unfortunate that some 
women have had problems, but I think they are in the minority," said Sandra 
Waldman, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit Population Council, which developed 
Norplant after 20 years of testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very well-researched method," she said. "We conducted numerous studies 
in many countries with thousands of women participating in the trials. And 
hundreds of scientific articles have been written about Norplant. So we stand 
by the safety of the method." 
</P>
<P>
 Government health officials also appear unworried by the lawsuits thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, the Food and Drug Administration is not seeing any (problems) 
that were not reported in clinical trials and are not above the rates found in 
clinical trials," FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government did approve revised product labeling submitted by Wyeth in July 
to alert consumers to possible side effects that were not seen before marketing 
of the device, including rare instances of stroke, phlebitis and birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Cruzan said: "That doesn't necessarily mean there is a cause-and-effect 
relationship" between those ailments and Norplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs paint a much different picture of the risks. Norplant consists of 
six matchstick-size silicone rods that are implanted in the upper left arm, 
just under the skin. The synthetic hormone progestin, an ingredient in many 
birth control pills, is slowly released from the rods to prevent pregnancy. The 
implant can be left in place for up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major complaints -- severe side effects and removal problems -- have 
emerged in the lawsuits filed in Minneapolis, Miami, Chicago, Dallas and other 
cities, plaintiffs' attorneys say. Dozens of potential side effects are listed 
in the product labeling by Wyeth, but some of those have been more severe than 
anticipated in some women, according to the lawsuits. A second common grievance 
focuses on the difficulty of removing the rods, which some women charge is much 
more painful, time-consuming and costly than Wyeth suggests in its product 
information brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (product labeling) gives considerable warnings, but you can only go so 
far in how warnings are communicated to recipients," said Arthur Sherman of 
Sherman, Dan & Portugal, a Beverly Hills firm representing the California 
women. "Most women didn't realize the severity of the menstrual changes and 
length of the changes. The severity is really difficult for these women to 
handle." 
</P>
<P>
 Although removal of the implant is described in informational brochures as a 
simple, 20-minute procedure that requires only local anesthesia and no 
stitches, Sherman says some women have conveyed horrendous experiences that 
require several surgeries and general anesthesia, leaving them with residual 
scarring and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the women who have filed suit is Cindy, a Los Angeles flight attendant 
who is in her 20s and asked not to be identified. She received Norplant three 
months ago and said she began having severe headaches and anxiety about a month 
later. She was also dismayed at her irregular menstrual cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The severity has been a tremendous surprise in that I didn't expect daily 
symptoms," she said in an interview. "The side effects have disrupted my 
personal life. I just don't enjoy all the activities I once did." 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy said she would like to have Norplant removed, but after hearing reports 
of difficult removals, she is afraid to go through with it. She said she feels 
betrayed by her doctor and Wyeth. "'I was looking into a long-term method, 
something safe and effective," she said. "I thought Norplant would be the ideal 
method. I wish I had known then what I know now." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed in California's Central District Court charges that Wyeth 
failed to warn women of the potential severity of side effects and removal 
problems. The suit also alleges a failure to adequately test the implant before 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of Norplant say the problem is not the device but the training of 
health professionals inserting Norplant and the counseling and education 
provided to patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaeser, of the Guttmacher Institute, said: "Wyeth did do an extensive training 
(program) nationwide" on proper use of the device. "But there never has been 
anything to force a doctor or nurse practitioner to take the training before 
they do an insertion. A lot of the problems may be due to physician training." 
</P>
<P>
 About 28,000 professionals have completed Wyeth's training program, according 
to a company official. It is not known how many medical practitioners insert or 
remove Norplant devices without having undergone training. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldman, of the Population Council, said "usually when a removal is difficult, 
it's because the insertion has not been done properly," such as inserting the 
device too deeply in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wyeth, more than 1 million U.S. women have received Norplant and 
about 15% have had the device removed. Complications in removal -- usually the 
inability to remove all six rods in one surgery -- occurred in 6% of cases, 
according to the premarketing clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Wyeth officials contend that class-action litigation "is 
inappropriate because Norplant removal is an individual procedure that is 
affected by a number of variables." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the statement asserted that the rate of removal complications 
continues to be below the rate anticipated before marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although problems with removing the device might be smoothed out as more 
practitioners gain experience, the controversy over Norplant's side effects 
promises to be contentious. According to product labeling, women are warned of 
numerous possible side effects, including irregular bleeding, headaches, 
vomiting, dizziness, acne, weight gain and anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Some health experts are especially concerned that patient counseling prior to 
Norplant insertion may be inadequate because many users are very young, poor, 
uneducated or speak little English. Nationwide, about half of all Norplant 
recipients obtain the device through Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing on Norplant began in 1975, and the device was first approved for use 
in Finland in 1983, according to the Population Council. Norplant is now 
approved in 39 countries, where few concerns over the method's safety have 
arisen, said JoAnn Lewis, vice president for reproductive health at Family 
Health International, which has sponsored much of the research on Norplant in 
developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things other countries may have done better . . . is to train 
(health professionals) and provide counseling so that potential users know what 
to expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Some health experts say clinics and private practitioners will redouble their 
efforts to seek proper training and provide extensive counseling to potential 
Norplant users. Local clinics are not expected to abandon the method, said 
Margie Fites Seigle, chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Regional Family 
Planning Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had an increase in calls in our centers from women expressing concern 
about Norplant. It became almost a panicked reaction," Seigle said. "But I do 
not anticipate that clinics would stop using it. I still truly believe that 
Norplant is a good method for those women who have been appropriately counseled 
and educated as to what to expect, and they go to a medical provider who has 
experience with it."

ON CALIFORNIA: 'OZZIE AND HARRIET' -- AN EPILOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harriet Nelson had died, and somehow it seemed appropriate last week to visit 
the house. Across 14 television seasons, this graceful Cape Cod Colonial had 
served both as the Nelson family home and as an exterior prop for "The 
Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet." It was painted white then. Today, the wood 
siding is blue. There were white picket fences in the show. Today, the house is 
surrounded by a barrier of black iron. Signs hung from the fence deliver a 
warning: "Armed Response." 
</P>
<P>
 Ozzie Nelson passed away some 20 years ago in an upstairs room, and the new 
owner has been told the patriarch of "America's Favorite Family" haunts the 
place today. The evidence is an ice cream dipper that moves mysteriously from 
drawer to drawer. Ozzie loved ice cream. Harriet sold the home in the late 
1970s. A plastic surgeon owned it for a time. The new owner is a record company 
executive. He and his wife are deep into a loving restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our home now," the young man says, standing in the freshly painted 
kitchen where Harriet Nelson once reigned as matriarch of a new American 
lifestyle. "We want to have our own Ozzie and Harriet life take place in this 
home. Everybody wants that, don't they? 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't that the dream?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Suburbia was not invented in California, although no other state so feverishly 
championed the form. Television, too, was a transplanted creation. What 
California, what Hollywood -- what, in fact, Ozzie Nelson -- did create was a 
genre of television show, the family sitcom, and it in turn nurtured what the 
new owner of the Nelson home calls, quite accurately, "the dream." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a dream of white picket fences and square green yards and a bedroom for 
every well-mannered child. It was a dream of safe neighborhoods where boys 
named Rick and Bud and Beav could roam happy and free. Dads wore suits and kept 
short hours in jobs that never were quite defined. Moms could be found in the 
new, all-electric kitchen, with milk and cookies and enough wisdom and guile to 
make everything all right by episode's end. Everyone was white. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, these were training films. "Ozzie and Harriet" and the programs it 
inspired offered instruction in how to live in the postwar suburbs just 
beginning to flood out from American cities. Episodes were built around such 
dilemmas as how to persuade a neighbor to bring back a borrowed garden rake. 
The new life brought new tools, and the new tools took some adaptation. In one 
episode, Harriet can be seen in a commercial break carefully demonstrating how 
to load dishes into a dishwasher. "I always say," she tells the audience, 
"there is nothing like a dishwasher to keep a home a happy one." 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, "The Fifties," David Halberstam examined the role of the Nelsons, 
Cleavers and the rest: "These families were living the new social contract as 
created by . . . suburban developers. The American dream was now located in the 
suburbs, and for millions of Americans, still living in urban apartments . . . 
these shows often seemed to be beamed from a foreign country, but one that the 
viewers longed to be a part of. These families were optimistic. There was a 
conviction, unstated but always there, that life was good and was going to get 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed today, these banal sitcoms produce an almost opposite effect: They mock 
the dreams they once planted. Too much has gone down behind the white picket 
fence. Moms no longer are confined to the kitchen, and any dad who keeps Ozzie 
hours in this corporate world is headed for the layoff list. Optimism is in 
short supply, replaced by restlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 New suburbs, of course, still get built willy-nilly, but only to replace older 
ones already gone to seed. One unintended message of "Ozzie and Harriet" -- "If 
you want a message," Ozzie is said to have once told David, the eldest son, 
"call Western Union" -- was that it was possible to run. Then the suburbs 
seemed far enough. Today those who take flight head for Idaho, and it's 
doubtful even that gets the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Which returns us to the house. It is located, ironically enough, not in 
suburbia at all, but in the Hollywood Hills, on a cul-de-sac of a half-dozen 
fine old homes. At the bottom of the block sits dread Hollywood -- apartments, 
crime, gangs, the works. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owner stands outside in the darkness and contemplates this potential 
intrusion upon his "Ozzie and Harriet life." If it gets too bad, he muses, they 
might need to throw up a fence down at the corner, to turn the block where the 
Nelsons once lived into one of those gated communities. And thus is the old 
dream remodeled.

REBELS MACHINE-GUN TRAMS IN SARAJEVO; BALKANS: ONE MAN IS KILLED, SIX OTHER 
PEOPLE ARE WOUNDED IN ATTACK. MOTIVE IS APPARENTLY VENGEANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Bosnian Serbs raked three Sarajevo trams with machine-gun fire Saturday, 
killing one man and seriously wounding six other people, including children, in 
an apparent revenge attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting followed a warning by hard-line Bosnian Serb leader Momcilo 
Krajisnik that Serbs would avenge the killing of 20 Serbian soldiers and nurses 
in a commando raid by the Muslim-led Bosnian army. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses Saturday saw some victims hit several times during a 12-minute 
fusillade aimed at Sarajevo's notorious "sniper alley." It forced U.N. 
peacekeepers to deploy armored cars as a shield against the attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital doctors treated six badly wounded, included boys aged 14 and 16. Five 
other children were less seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst Serbian attack on Sarajevo's civilian population since a 
bombardment last month that killed two people and wounded 18. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesmen said the firing came from Bosnian Serb army positions in 
Sarajevo's Jewish cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. special envoy for the former Yugoslav federation, 
condemned "this flagrant and deliberate attack on civilians." 
</P>
<P>
 Krajisnik had told the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA on Friday night that 
"Serbs cannot be passive" after the killing of 20 soldiers and nurses the 
previous day. The victims were buried Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations described the attack on the Serbs, at a Bosnian Serb army 
command post outside Sarajevo, as a military operation by the Muslim-led 
Bosnian army, whereas the Serbian targets Saturday were civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian revenge attacks on Muslim civilians for military reverses have been 
characteristic of their tactics during 30 months of fighting in which 10,000 
people have died in Sarajevo alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Saturday, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees halted 
aid flights to Sarajevo after two U.N. military planes were hit on the runway 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport had reopened only Friday after being shut since Sept. 22 because 
of Serbian threats to shoot at aircraft in retaliation for a NATO air strike. A 
spokesman said the flights will resume today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian blockade severely disrupted efforts to keep Sarajevo's 380,000 
people supplied with food. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. official Kris Janowski said bakeries and warehouses in Sarajevo had 
stocks for only a few days.

WAR OF WORDS TURNS FATAL IN INDIA; VIOLENCE: DISPUTE OVER URDU LANGUAGE BEING 
USED ON A 10-MINUTE TV BROADCAST LEADS TO RIOTS, 17 DEATHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In India's latest collision of the sadly familiar and the new, a dispute 
between Hindus and Muslims over language has led to riots, arson and the deaths 
of 17 people in the country's fast-growing capital of high tech, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spark for two days of turmoil in Bangalore, India's version of Silicon 
Valley and home to branch offices of many U.S. computer and software companies, 
was a new 10-minute daily television broadcast in Urdu, the idiom of the Mogul 
empire, which today is spoken by 130 million Muslims in India and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in the south-central Karnataka 
state accused the ruling Congress-I Party of launching the Urdu newscast to 
pander to Muslim voters in Karnataka before state elections next month. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, organizations defending Karnataka's own dominant local language, 
Kannada, angrily protested that the 7:45 p.m. program cut into air time for 
their own tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes a day might not seem objectionable, since 9% of Karnataka's 45 
million people classify themselves as Urdu-speakers, but language has often 
been the stuff of divisive, violent politics in India. In fact, it was the 
reason Karnataka, known then as Mysore, was created in 1956 from the 
Kannada-speaking areas of five states. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, activists in the state have forced the government to cut back on 
the use of English, the language of India's old colonial masters. And they 
remain militantly opposed to the penetration of Hindi, the Indo-European 
language that the constitution enshrines as India's official lingua franca. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Muslim holy day, more than 3,000 Kannada activists opposing the 
Urdu newscast clashed with Muslims in Bangalore's streets. Reports said the 
unrest broke out after Muslims threw stones and bottles at protesters who set 
up a roadblock near a mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Police tried to halt the brawling with tear gas and batons, and opened fire 
when those measures failed. They used their guns again Saturday, when 300 
people tried to attack police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Bangalore, violence continued throughout the 
night Friday and early Saturday as Kannada activists attempted to set fire to 
mosques, and Muslims defended them with lengths of chain and firebombs, police 
reported. Shops, warehouses and more than 100 vehicles were torched. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Saturday evening, eight people were reported shot dead by police, and 
nine others were stabbed to death in street brawls. 
</P>
<P>
 Karnataka Chief Minister M. Veerappa Moily estimated 150 people had been 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial Urdu TV broadcast, Moily also announced to reporters, will 
be suspended until a time slot can be found that does not disrupt programming 
in Kannada. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over Urdu was just one of several signs of India's social, 
economic and geographical strains. 
</P>
<P>
 In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, the most populous in India, 
upper-caste but poor residents of the hills have violently objected to a state 
government that they say is run by and for lower-caste residents of the Ganges 
River plain. In Kashmir, India's only state with a Muslim majority, a 
separatist insurgency continues. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, frustrated commuters in Bombay -- stranded at morning rush hour by 
a derailed train -- went on a rampage in five suburban stations, beating 
railway workers, burning stocks of tickets and putting the torch to two trains. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a development that spread dread throughout the world, an estimated 
300,000 to 400,000 people fled Surat near the Arabian Sea last month when their 
neighbors began to die of plague. The official death toll from the disease is 
56, but the exodus showed how little confidence factory workers, artisans and 
even municipal officials and physicians put in authorities' ability to treat 
victims and arrest the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hindu militants, the status of Urdu is as much a hot-button issue as 
abortion is in the United States. To give the language special treatment is to 
favor Muslims, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the language that became the chosen idiom of Muslim India and the 
national language of Pakistan -- and is renowned for its beauty and sweetness 
of sound -- is a close cousin of Hindi. 
</P>
<P>
 Moily said the decision to begin the newscasts in Karnataka was made in New 
Delhi and that his government was not involved at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Street protests by Hindu militants began when the Urdu news bulletin went on 
the air for the first time a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (was) not a political decision taken in view of the elections," Moily 
contended.

former U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Lima Mayor Ricardo 
Belmont and even his wife, Susana Higuchi. Fujimori can stand for reelection 
under a new constitution approved last year to replace the one he scrapped in 
April, 1992, when he closed Congress and the courts with military backing and 
began ruling by fiat. Four Cabinet ministers resigned, amid speculation that 
they will run for Parliament. Those resigning were Absalon Vasquez

 U.S. defense officials said Saturday that American forces will probably stay 
in Haiti for at least two more months. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the 
United States is unlikely to hand over its mission to U.N. peacekeepers until 
after legislative elections scheduled for December. "I don't think we should 
look for that (hand-over) certainly not until after the parliamentary 
election," Shalikashvili said at a news conference at the international airport 
here. He was on a one-day visit with Defense Secretary William J. Perry.

 In Washington, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said no deadline for

DESPITE RUMORS, MILITARY RULER'S FATE LOOKS SETTLED; HAITI: LT. GEN. RAOUL 
CEDRAS' RESIGNATION APPEARS UNAVOIDABLE. CHIEF OF STAFF'S BEHAVIOR IS LESS 
PREDICTABLE. 
</P>

 Where is Raoul Cedras? One report had the Haitian army commander at the 
airport, leaving for exile in Spain. No, said another source, he left his house 
at 2 a.m. for the Dominican Republic. All wrong, went another account, the 
general and his wife were at their beach house. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the dashes from airport to border crossing by reporters, there was 
no credible evidence that Cedras had gone anywhere, nor that he intended to, at 
least for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Cedras, who had not been seen in public for more than 24 hours, 
turned up Saturday afternoon for his regular meeting with U.S. Ambassador 
William L. Swing and Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, commander of the 20,000 American 
troops here. 
</P>
<P>
 The whereabouts of Cedras, who has led a brutal military regime here since the 
army overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Sept. 30, 1991, had been the 
subject of intense speculation for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the long run, the fate of Haiti's ruling general appears settled. Under 
an agreement he signed with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Cedras and his 
chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, have to leave the military upon 
parliamentary approval of a general amnesty or by Oct. 15, next Saturday, 
whichever comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators on Friday passed a measure giving Aristide the power to grant 
limited amnesties, but some U.S. diplomats said it is unlikely the new bill 
will be used to force Cedras to resign immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the betting is that he will be left alone at least until Wednesday, 
when his formal three-year appointment as commander in chief expires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carter agreement required that Cedras, Biamby and Police Chief 
Michel-Joseph Francois resign from the army but said nothing about their 
leaving Haiti. However, Francois resigned Monday and fled to the Dominican 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, diplomats and Haitian sources, including some close to Cedras, 
think he will choose exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras, who received advanced military training in Spain, owns a house in 
Barcelona and recently purchased an apartment in Madrid -- and he has enough 
money after three corrupt years in Haiti to live there in luxury as long as he 
wants, said a friend who has known him since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Biamby, a close Cedras associate, is said to be far less willing to resign or 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Biamby is an odd one," said a U.S. official here. "He sees himself as a 
soldier's soldier and thinks he would betray his troops if he leaves and they 
are left behind." 
</P>
<P>
 American officials said they believe Biamby is mentally unstable, and they 
have been conducting a series of covert activities aimed at driving him from 
the country one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likely scenario is that Biamby will quietly resign when Cedras does and 
then go home and wait to see what happens. . . ," a boyhood friend of Biamby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he hates the United States and will not be driven from the country by 
Americans."

Saturday to urge Americans to invest in South Africa and to hold out that 
nation's democratic reforms as an inspiration for people in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the "miracle of the new South Africa" as an example, Clinton said: 
"Haitians have a chance to do what South Africans have done -- to bring 
together a country where there have been deep and bloody divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, winding up a weeklong visit to the United States, said he came away 
"reinforced that we are poised to build a new and enduring partnership."

ROILING MARKETS ARE THE FINAL ARBITER OF VALUE FOR WORLD'S CURRENCIES; FINANCE: 
$880 BILLION IS TRADED DAILY IN THE FRENZIED REALM OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE -- AND 
ALWAYS AT WARP SPEED.

 It was over in seconds. Faster than you could say "$10 million," the young 
foreign-exchange dealer had bought that much cash from a large London-based 
bank in return for 15,595,000 German marks. Like a school kid calling friends 
off a fly ball headed his way, he had pounced on the bank's offer with a single 
word: "Mine!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was not his for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten seconds of telephone time later, he had a buyer willing to pay 15,600,000 
marks for his $10 million, and it was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 He had 5,000 more marks (about $3,200) in his pocket than he had when he 
started. Not a bad profit for 10 seconds' work. 
</P>
<P>
 By foreign-exchange standards, the deal was modest -- little more than pocket 
change in a global market that at last count traded a staggering $880 billion 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed was also routine. "It's a fast-moving market," noted David Sumners, 
who heads a foreign-exchange trading team of 36 professionals at Morgan Stanley 
& Co. International Ltd. "Positions can change in seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 The American-owned securities firm and investment bank is one of several 
global players that buy and sell the world's leading currencies each day. They 
do so either for their customers (mainly major international companies and 
other banks), for their own needs or simply for profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although currency movements generally reflect the market's judgment of 
government policy, they can also be spooked by rumor or intangibles such as the 
health or popularity of a national leader. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or for worse, it is the battalions of dealers deployed mainly in 
London, Tokyo and New York, but also in several other cities from Hong Kong to 
Zurich, who decide how much an American tourist will get for dollars in Paris, 
whether the Italian lira will recover its value and whether the Japanese yen 
will continue to increase in worth against all comers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the markets, not governments, decide. Their sheer size makes them the 
final arbiter of a currency's value. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always so. It was only in the 1970s, when revolutions in computer, 
communication and information technologies coincided with the end of 
foreign-exchange controls in many countries, that the market took off in its 
present form. 
</P>
<P>
 Those forces propelled the business of changing money from a sleepy bank 
window service for travelers and world traders to an intense, high-tech, 
24-hour operation in which dealers often decide in seconds whether to buy, sell 
or hold massive amounts of foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical trader's desk at Morgan Stanley looks more like an aircraft 
cockpit than a banker's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Viveash, the bank's chief spot trader in London, is surrounded by five TV 
monitors, four phone banks (each with 10 lines), two computer keyboards and a 
microphone. Bolted to the ceiling a few feet away, a large video screen 
displays current prices of Spanish, German, French and Italian government bonds 
plus the 11 latest major news flashes from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Primed with this up-to-the-minute market information and an endless supply of 
more in-depth market analyses, Viveash and his team make the choices that can 
make or lose barrels of money in practically no time at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers here freely admit that their lives border on the obsessive. Long, 
relentless weeks that begin late Sunday (when the Far Eastern markets open 
Monday morning local time) and end late Friday (when New York finally closes) 
often make for short careers. 
</P>
<P>
 At 45, Viveash defies the stereotype of the brash young dealer who lives on 
adrenaline, deals on instinct and burns out at 35. As the market becomes 
increasingly sophisticated, daring alone is not enough. The best mix for a 
dealer, he says, is a bright, analytical mind, enough knowledge and confidence 
to know when to strike and the discipline to know when to let go of a tactic 
that's not working. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trick is anticipation," Viveash said. "When the market turns, it turns 
quickly."

KUWAITIS PREPARE FOR THE WORST BY STOCKING UP ON CASH AND GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lines stretched behind cash machines and gasoline stations Saturday as 
thousands of Iraqi troops massed across the border in a buildup like that 
presaging the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were few other signs of anxiety after the Cabinet called on Kuwaitis 
to refrain from hoarding food and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic at the border with Saudi Arabia was reported normal, and no 
significant increase in flight reservations was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason to fear; we have agreements with the superpowers," Haidar 
Mulla Jumaa, an oil company employee, said as he stood in a grocery store 
checkout line with about a dozen items in his shopping cart. 
</P>
<P>
 Since liberation from the Iraqi occupation, Kuwait has sought to ensure its 
safety by signing 10-year defense pacts with four of the five permanent 
Security Council members -- the United States, France, Russia and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some Kuwaitis seemed reluctant to take any chances given 
Hussein's unpredictability. 
</P>
<P>
 They headed to gas stations to fill up their tanks in case they had to flee 
again. Others queued at cash machines to withdraw money.

SANCTIONS PUT SQUEEZE ON IRAQ ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's latest act of military bluster lies the 
harsh reality of an economy imploding under the weight of international 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and economists said Saturday that Baghdad's complaints about the 
sanctions reflect the very real hardships that four years of restrictions have 
placed on the country's oil-driven economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq's top diplomat, Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz, said in a U.N. speech 
Friday that the sanctions are leading to malnutrition, inadequate medical care 
and widespread suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions appear to have reached a critical level in recent months, analysts 
said, which may explain Hussein's decision to move now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is no doubt the sanctions have had an impact on the general 
population of Iraq," said James Placke, a Middle East analyst with Cambridge 
Energy Research, an oil industry consulting firm. "The regime has taken steps 
to protect its security apparatus and to a lesser extent its military from the 
brunt of the sanctions, but it is clear there has been some impact there as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq's inflation rate is now more than 1,000% annually, and its currency is 
virtually worthless. Government-imposed monthly rations for rice, sugar, 
cooking oil and flour have been halved in the last few weeks, and hunger and 
starvation are now said to be commonplace, according to international observers 
who have visited Iraq recently. 
</P>
<P>
 There are reports that as many as 500 Iraqi soldiers are deserting from Iraq's 
400,000-strong military each month, and there are signs that much of the 
country's remaining military equipment is only marginally serviceable, Iraqi 
dissidents have said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military is finding it very difficult to obtain spare parts for its 
equipment, and it is clear that its readiness is nowhere near the levels it 
achieved" before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Placke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, every industry in the country faces critical shortages of parts and 
equipment, and the average Iraqi household is being forced to make do despite 
shortages of almost every necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 The deprivation has led to a rising tide of violent crime, much of which is 
reportedly being committed by members of Hussein's ruling clique, desperate to 
survive the crisis, say dissidents and Western journalists reporting from 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 The deterioration can be traced, in large measure, to Iraq's loss of its main 
source of foreign revenue: oil exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Persian Gulf War, Iraq was producing as much as 3.3 million barrels 
of oil per day, the bulk of which went for export. Today, analysts believe that 
only a small trickle of Iraqi oil is making its way out of the country through 
cracks in the U.N. embargo, mostly to neighboring Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein is reportedly so desperate that he has invited foreign oil companies 
to open potentially lucrative negotiations for future drilling and exploration, 
hoping to get the industry poised for rebirth after the sanctions are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sanctions bite into Iraqi society, they offer one of the few instances 
in recent history when international economic restrictions have had a 
significant impact on an aggressor nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent efforts to use economic sanctions against Haiti and the rump 
Yugoslavia, for example, did not bring about U.S. or U.N. policy objectives. 
The sanctions' failure in Haiti to force out a military junta created 
conditions that led the U.S. to intervene to reinstate exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 But the impact of sanctions on Iraq shows that "it is dangerous to generalize 
about the effectiveness of sanctions," noted Jeffrey Sachs, an international 
economist at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. It all depends on the context, on 
the commitment of the international community to adhere to them and on what you 
are trying to accomplish with the sanctions," Sachs said. "But just because 
they were unsuccessful in Haiti doesn't mean you will see the same result in 
Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the sanctions against Iraq certainly would not have struck 
so deep if they had not been preceded by the devastating 1991 military defeat 
of Hussein's army. 
</P>
<P>
 And even with that war as a backdrop, the sanctions have still not yet 
achieved their primary purpose of forcing Hussein's regime to alter its 
behavior and comply with all of the U.N. resolutions imposed after the war.

SHUTTLE ENDEAVOUR RETRACES ORBIT TO MAP EARTH IN 3-D 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The space shuttle Endeavour retraced its orbital steps Saturday, following the 
same path taken 24 hours earlier to produce the most detailed radar maps ever 
made of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-D images will reveal changes in terrain as small as half an inch and 
possibly help scientists predict earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Saturday, a shuttle had never repeated its orbital path from one day to 
the next. Endeavour's pilots periodically fired their steering jets to put the 
shuttle on a course duplicating all 16 orbits of the previous day; the same 
thing was planned for today. 
</P>
<P>
 That's three days of traveling over the same spot at the same time at the same 
altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be 'Groundhog Day.' Remember that movie?" said Mike Sander, 
project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1993 film, comic Bill Murray portrays a caustic TV weatherman who 
awakens to the same day -- Groundhog Day -- again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 Endeavour soared over western Canada, across the Great Lakes and out over the 
Chesapeake Bay on Saturday afternoon, just as it did Friday. The radar 
instruments surveyed the same swath of land from 127 miles up, but from a 
slightly different angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sander said he was thrilled with the results: Endeavour came within 30 feet of 
where it was Friday over Pennsylvania and 300 feet over northern Canada. Before 
the flight, scientists were hoping to be within 800 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Other repeat targets include Africa, the Middle East, Ukraine and Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists will combine these radar carbon copies to create topographic maps 
of extraordinarily high resolution -- accurate in elevation to six yards or 
less -- that will enable them to detect minute surface changes. This will be 
especially useful in Africa, a continent for which few good topographic maps 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Endeavour's six astronauts continued taking turns photographing the radar 
targets. They had snapped nearly 10,000 pictures as of Saturday and had film 
for 4,000 more; their 11-day flight is scheduled to end Tuesday.

CIA REPORTEDLY PAID MILLIONS TO JAPAN'S LDP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The CIA supported the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the conservative party 
that dominated Japanese politics, with millions of dollars in a major Cold War 
covert operation during the 1950s and 1960s, the New York Times reported in 
today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Intelligence Agency gave money, at the request of the LDP, to make 
the country a bulwark against communism in Asia and undermine the Japanese 
left, the paper said, quoting former intelligence officials and diplomats from 
the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA did not respond to the allegations about the Liberal Democrats, whose 
38 years of one-party rule ended last year after a series of corruption cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in part to the CIA funding, the LDP thwarted its Socialist opponents, 
held one-party rule, and fought off public opposition to creating U.S. military 
bases in Japan, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper also cited U.S. government records from the 1960s, declassified in 
accordance with a law that opens records relating to foreign policy after 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principle was certainly acceptable to me," the paper quoted U. Alexis 
Johnson, U.S. ambassador to Japan from 1966 to 1969, as saying. "We were 
financing a party on our side." 
</P>
<P>
 The covert aid apparently ended in the early 1970s, the paper said, amid 
growing trade friction.

BILL TO AID AILING VETERANS OF GULF WAR IS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before adjourning Saturday, the Senate approved and sent to President Clinton 
legislation to compensate Persian Gulf War veterans who are found to suffer 
from undiagnosed and unknown illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The law is aimed at ensuring "that (these) veterans will receive the benefits 
they have earned," said Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), chairman 
of the Veterans Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional aides said there are at least 10,000 veterans who have 
complained about mysterious illnesses after returning from the Persian Gulf. 
The legislation had been requested by Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill provides no specific funding levels but requires that adequate money 
be found within the Veterans Affairs budget. The Congressional Budget Office 
has estimated the cost at between $35 million and $40 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the Senate: 
</P>
<P>
 * Approved and sent to the President legislation to help states explore 
possible rail corridors for high-speed passenger trains. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, cleared by a voice vote, authorizes $184 million over three 
years for preliminary planning and technological development of high-speed rail 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Killed legislation that would have allowed governors to control the amount 
of interstate garbage flowing into their states. 
</P>
<P>
 The House had passed the bill, but an attempt to get it through the upper 
chamber failed when Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) objected to the 
legislation passing by unanimous consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Harris Wofford (D-Pa.) said an agreement had been reached on a compromise 
bill that passed the House on Friday night. But he said Sen. John H. Chafee 
(R-R.I.) had put a "hold" on the legislation, keeping the Senate from approving 
it by unanimous consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the compromise, governors would have been able to freeze garbage imports 
at 1993 levels or at a single landfill or incinerator. A governor could also 
have restricted the amount of garbage from a particular state. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bills killed by last-minute GOP objections voiced by Dole included a 
minority health bill to authorize about $1 billion for several government 
programs and agencies, a bill to facilitate the conversion of the former 
Presidio military base in San Francisco to a national park, and a bill 
establishing a Whaling National Historical Park in New Bedford, Mass.

 The Senate gave final congressional approval early Saturday to legislation

<P>
 Under the five-year program, which passed on a voice vote, the Interior 
Department would make grants to foreign governments and nonprofit groups that 
develop rhinoceros and tiger conservation programs. 
</P>

 The bill also requires the department to identify which countries engage in 
activities that abuse international accords protecting the two animals, and to 
notify the President.

<P>
 The door to the courtroom was still locked, and outside, Nathan Speer was 
fidgety. His former landlord was suing him for $257.21. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Patton was murmuring with the key witness he brought to back up his 
story. Patton stood a safe distance away from Robert M. Reidenbach, who would 
try to persuade the judge that Patton had aggressively grabbed his throat. 
</P>
<P>
 And Delisa Ford was hoping the court would order the moving company that 
dropped her old refrigerator to pay for a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the beginning of another day in small claims court, where justice comes 
quickly and cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 In this age of multiyear, multimillion-dollar lawsuits, the Small Claims 
Division of the Ventura County Municipal Court offers a striking difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are relatively small -- $5,000 is the largest amount that qualifies 
as a small claim. The filing fee is a mere $15. There is no jury, and the judge 
may be a part-time volunteer. Cases are usually resolved within six weeks of 
being filed. Lawyers are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony N. Margott, co-owner of Excalibur Window Coverings in Thousand Oaks, said 
the beauty of small claims court is in its simplicity. "Put your proof on the 
table . . . and let the judge decide what's right and what's wrong," Margott 
said. In the higher courts, he complains, loose rules give slackers too many 
chances to waste time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 For Margott, the small claims system has worked. In 12 years of going to 
court, the vertical blind manufacturer and wholesaler has yet to lose. And the 
judgments he has received made it easier for him to collect money from 
customers refusing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, even the relatively simple procedures of small claims court can be 
mystifying. "It's a little confusing. It's a little frightening to people who 
haven't been to court before," said Sandra Rose, manager of small claims for 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The county can help you with the paperwork, said Gregory Brose, the deputy 
district attorney who supervises the consumer and environmental protection 
divisions. Two small claims advisers within the district attorney's office 
provide free advice, explaining to plaintiffs and defendants how best to 
present and organize their side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 10,512 small claims cases were filed in 1993, and court officials 
expect just about as many cases to be filed this year, said Susan Boyd, a 
courthouse official. The number of cases has dropped since the high in 1992, 
when the court raised the maximum claim to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of those cases filed last year, 8,822 ended up before a judge. The rest were 
dropped by plaintiffs or settled after being directed into alternative venues 
such as the district attorney's Consumer Mediation Services or the nonprofit 
Ventura Center for Dispute Settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But for cases that defied settlement, the participants were directed back to 
Courtroom 20 to get their day in court. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was for Fred E. Comer, landlord to 18-year-old Nathan Speer. After roll 
call in the courtroom of Municipal Court Judge Thomas J. Hutchins, a portion of 
the nervous crowd was assigned to Courtroom 23. There, Municipal Court Judge 
Pro Tempore Creighton A. Stephens was ready to hear their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's this all about?" the judge asked. Comer complained that Speer had not 
done the yard work that he was supposed to do in return for a discount in the 
rent. When Speer moved out of Comer's Oxnard house in August, Comer sued him 
for the extra rent, a phone bill, the price of a key Speer had lost, and the 
wages Comer lost because of his time in court -- a total of $257.21. 
</P>
<P>
 Speer said that he had done the weeding and lawn-mowing he was supposed to do 
and that Comer was suing because Speer refused to help Comer plant some cactus. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge thanked Comer and Speer for their time and instructed them they 
would be notified of his decision by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The next case was more dramatic. It began with Reidenbach accusing Patton of 
attacking him in a Santa Paula trailer park clubhouse and grabbing his neck. 
Reidenbach also produced for the judge glossy 8-by-10 color photographs of what 
he described as his scratched and bruised throat.  
</P>
<P>
 Waving a photocopied page of a lawbook definition of battery, Reidenbach 
demanded that Patton be ordered to pay him the maximum $5,000 allowed in small 
claims court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patton, for his part, played every bit the model senior citizen. "My wife and 
I were sitting at the table in the clubhouse. He came in there angry, in my 
opinion to start something," said Patton, the manager of the mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
 Reidenbach was using bad language, Patton said. "I told him, 'Please don't use 
that kind of language in here. My wife's in here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Patton said Reidenbach's fists were clenched, as if he were about to attack. 
"The only thing I did was grab his arms," Patton said. "I'm a very calm, cool, 
collected individual. I don't jump on people. I haven't drank any alcohol in 12 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Patton then introduced his star witness: Jess Frutos, a contractor who did odd 
jobs for both Patton and Reidenbach's mother, who lives in the park. Frutos 
said he did not see Patton grab Reidenbach by the neck; he only saw Patton grab 
Reidenbach by the arms.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge again thanked both parties, telling them he would send them his 
decision in the mail. "It could go either way," Reidenbach said after the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 At last, it was time for the case of the broken refrigerator. Delisa Ford was 
suing Lord Moving & Storage for $725 -- the price of a new refrigerator, 
including tax and delivery, to replace the old one that the movers dropped down 
the stairs in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The moving company had already paid Ford $180 in March. The company's contract 
with her promised that she would be reimbursed for damages at 60 cents a pound, 
and the company estimated that the refrigerator weighed 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ford said that $180 was not enough to replace her fridge. "I'm on a very 
tight budget and I can't afford to buy a new refrigerator," she told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens was not persuaded. He decided this case from the bench, ruling that 
Lord had fulfilled its obligation by paying the $180. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford accepted the defeat calmly. "I'd rather hear it from the judge than hear 
it from Lord Moving," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the courtroom had cleared, Stephens issued his rulings in 
the other two cases, dictating the terms to the courtroom clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the delay was not to give him time to consult his law books or 
ponder the evidence in the cases before deciding. Instead, it was simply 
because, in a courtroom without a bailiff, it is safer to issue verdicts by 
mail.

LOW-TECH WEATHER FORECASTER HITS THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rough seas can sink Frank Bechtolt's dredging rig or drive it into the rocks. 
So when Bechtolt anchored his dredge outside the safety of Channel Islands 
Harbor last week, he turned to a man who had provided him trustworthy wind and 
wave forecasts for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Surf shop owner Roger Nance relies on the same weatherman to cut through the 
mysteries of the Pacific and predict the arrival of big waves. Unlike other 
surfing competitions plagued by poor surf, Nance's 14 annual contests at Rincon 
Point are distinguished by a remarkable run of towering waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men swear by forecaster Rea Strange, their oracle of ocean weather. So do 
the hundreds of other clients who entrust their livelihood, and sometimes their 
lives, to his marine weather predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't leave home without him, or at least without his forecasts," said 
Sue Benech, a Ventura-based marine biologist who surveys the bottom of the 
ocean. "He's been a lifesaver, an absolute wonder at predicting the weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Predicting the weather is an imprecise business, with forecasts often thwarted 
by the shifting, swirling confluence of natural forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for all the unpredictable elements, Rea (pronounced Ray) Strange manages 
remarkable consistency in his forecasts, his clients and colleagues say. His 
secret: Drawing upon 37 years of watching weather patterns, he makes 
unequivocal predictions and then meticulously checks on what actually happens 
so he can refine his methodology. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a better feeling for meteorology than any other meteorologist I've 
ever met," said Nick Graham, a research meteorologist at Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography in La Jolla. "In addition to his technical skills, his incredible 
memory makes him a genius in his field. He can remember what day of the week 
his birthday was when he was 12." 
</P>
<P>
 At age 63, Strange remains one of the technological holdouts, plotting weather 
patterns the old-fashioned way -- by hand. While most meteorologists count on 
satellite pictures and fancy computer programs, Strange spends his days drawing 
weather maps in his home office in Montecito. 
</P>
<P>
 He pores over data relayed from weather stations, ships at sea and buoys 
bobbing in the ocean to help him pencil in isobars -- those squiggly, 
concentric lines that encircle high- and low-pressure areas. His drafting table 
is covered with hand-drawn maps. Hundreds of them hang from clips on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strange acknowledges that technology is catching up with him: Sophisticated 
computers are improving forecasts every year. Still, he said, he's unlikely to 
change his ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'd get any better results," Strange said, stretching his 
lanky, athletic frame from the stool in his office. "I'm perfectly happy with 
the way I learned forecasting." 
</P>
<P>
 Trained in meteorology by the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey in the 
mid-1950s, Strange moved to the area in late 1959 to advise oil companies of 
wind, waves and weather that could endanger crews and equipment drilling for 
oil beneath the waters of the Santa Barbara Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 He launched his own business, Pacific Weather Analysis, in 1977, and his 
clientele consists primarily of oil companies, shipping firms, dredging outfits 
and other businesses that ply their trade in the ocean. He also provides 
weather forecasts to county flood control agencies, the America's Cup 
contenders and movie production crews. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On weekday mornings, he telephones KVEN-AM as "Mr. Weather," the station's 
forecaster and straight man on the Dave & Bob Show. He uses the pseudonym Erich 
Wright, a name he and the station manager came up with over lunch a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted anonymity, and we wanted another name than the 'Strange Weather 
Report,' " said David Loe, president and general manager of the Ventura 
station. Strange likes to keep a low profile to avoid calls from the public 
that take time away from his paying customers -- something particularly 
troublesome during heavy weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Loe said Strange offers a unique service. "We couldn't get that kind of 
specific forecast anywhere else, even with the new National Weather Service 
office in Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service dominates the forecasting industry. But, of 
necessity, most of its forecasts cover broad areas and are of marginal use in 
predicting local weather. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where Strange has carved out his niche, pinpointing the weather 
forecast for a specific location. His most loyal clients are those who need to 
know what looms just over the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's saved my bacon more than once," said Tony Carter, the semi-retired owner 
of a tugboat company. For more than 30 years, he has relied on Strange to guide 
his tugs through calm seas while towing huge, tippy, oil construction rigs 
along the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Bechtolt, the dredging project manager at Oxnard's Channel Islands Harbor, 
calls on Strange to help him keep his equipment operating as long as it is 
safe. "The longer I keep dredging, the more money I can make," Bechtolt said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he anchored his dredge outside the harbor's protective seawalls to 
begin siphoning sand from near the entrance. As the project progressed , 
Bechtolt kept in close contact with Strange to monitor any approaching swells 
or other hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's about 99% right, compared to the reports on the news, which are 50% 
correct," Bechtolt said. "I could have something sink or get washed up on the 
beach. He'll tell me when I should pull my butt into a safe harbor." 
</P>
<P>
 The clients of Strange have stories about his wizardry that helps them keep 
one step ahead of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Nance, the surf shop owner, recalls seeking Strange's advice before setting 
the date of one of his first surfing contests. The day before the event, the 
ocean was as flat as a lake on a windless day. Local surfers flooded his shop 
with calls to postpone the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2 a.m., as his guru foretold, the big swell arrived. Nance remembers it 
well. He lived in a beach house at the time and was awakened by the thunderous 
crash of the breakers. "Every year at my contests, people come up to me and 
say, 'How did you ever know?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Strange has been elevated to something of a mystical seer in some 
circles of surfers who are constantly on the prowl for big, peeling waves. His 
legendary status is reinforced by stories of his pinpointing the precise time a 
swell would hit the beach. Strange's daughter, Marianne, is familiar with her 
father's reputation among veteran watermen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the first sets of waves arrive, they say, 'Here come the Strange sets,' 
" she said. "I've never minded it, but when I introduce myself to fishermen or 
surfers, they say, 'Are you Rea Strange's daughter?' They want to know all 
about him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Vogel, a longtime friend and big-wave surfer, said he has watched Strange 
perfect his wave forecasting over the years with empirical data that allowed 
him to revise the textbooks on the subject for his own use. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1970s, Strange would be as much as eight hours off on his predicted 
arrival of a swell, Vogel said. The gap has narrowed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've kept written records of all of the swells he's forecasted and he nails 
18 out of 20," Vogel said. "Anytime his forecast broke down, he would be ticked 
off about it. It usually translated into a gap in his data. With the right 
data, the guy's flawless." 
</P>
<P>
 A framed color picture hangs in Strange's office of Vogel surfing a thunderous 
30-foot wave on Feb. 13, 1983, in northwestern Santa Barbara County. Strange 
had predicted the enormous swell. 
</P>
<P>
 As for himself, Strange has carved out a niche not only as marine weather 
forecaster but as a man who has simplified his personal life to its most 
important elements. He lives in the Montecito foothills in a modest house with 
his wife of 38 years, Juliana, and a menagerie of dogs, cats and exotic birds 
always underfoot or flapping about. 
</P>
<P>
 He finds order in the chaos by driving down the hill to a beach for a 
three-fourths-mile ocean swim each afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange takes pride in his professional reputation, but he says his friends 
and clients have overblown the precision of his forecasts.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many damned ways you can be wrong," he said, "and so few ways 
you can be right." 
</P>
<P>
 His clients say his protests are characteristic of the thoughtful, reserved 
weatherman with extraordinary high standards, whom they have grown to trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about every marine contractor relies very heavily on his information," 
said Chuck Ebner, Ventura operations manager of Oceaneering International Inc., 
an underwater construction and services company. "He is he closest guy to God 
that I know of as far as predicting the weather."

ELECTIONS / 2ND SUPERVISORIAL SEAT; LANDFILL JUST 1 ISSUE THAT DIVIDES LOH AND 
SCHILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Ventura County supervisorial candidate Frank Schillo, building a landfill 
at Weldon Canyon near Ojai is essential to keeping a lid on trash rates. 
</P>
<P>
 However, to his opponent, Trudi Loh, a landfill in Weldon Canyon would lead to 
caravans of garbage trucks bulging with Los Angeles trash rolling across 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the two candidates have sharply different views on just about every 
major issue in the race, clashing over proposals ranging from training county 
firefighters as paramedics to extending a controversial development agreement 
with the Ahmanson Land Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo and Loh are competing in the November election for the 2nd 
Supervisorial District seat being vacated by Maria VanderKolk, who represents 
most of the Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of their differences stem from their opposing philosophies on 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, a Thousand Oaks Democrat who is running on a pro-environment platform, 
believes the county and its cities should strictly adhere to their development 
and zoning guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that we don't overdevelop," said Loh, 38. "What I am favoring 
is adherence to our General Plan and the preservation of the quality of life in 
Ventura County, which is why we chose to live here. And that means protecting 
our greenbelts and agricultural land." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, a Thousand Oaks councilman who has come under attack for his support 
of some city projects over the years, said government needs to be more flexible 
when it comes to development and individual property rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have such a rigid position in government, you're going to have a hard 
time," the 60-year-old Republican said. "There are very few black-and-white 
situations. You might be against something that is going to benefit the whole 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates have repeatedly sparred over the contentious issue of 
building a dump in Weldon Canyon, situated between Ventura and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh opposes development of a new landfill because, she said, there is nothing 
to stop the operator from turning it into a regional facility, which could 
eventually import trash from sites such as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "By siting a landfill at Weldon Canyon we're letting ourselves in for a world 
of trouble," said Loh, adding that she prefers to explore other ways to dispose 
of county trash, possibly even shipping it elsewhere by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo strongly supports a new west county landfill, saying the cost of 
shipping trash out of the county would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do that, it's going to double our trash rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the high cost, Schillo said what is more likely to happen is that 
the Simi Valley Landfill will end up having to take trash from cities in the 
western part of the county. This, he said, would also result in hundreds of 
trash trucks running up and down freeways that cut through Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I challenge anybody to say this is environmentally sensitive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another point of debate between Schillo and Loh is over who is best qualified 
to serve as a county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, who owns a financial consulting business, has been a city councilman 
for 10 years, something he has played up in campaign ads and political mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the time for a learn-as-you-go county supervisor," Schillo 
declared in one newspaper ad in June. "This is the time for experience and 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Loh, an attorney who gave up her practice five years ago to raise 
her children, has no government experience. But she trumpets this as an asset, 
not a liability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think being a career politician is necessarily something that people 
hold very highly," she said, adding that she would bring 13 years' experience 
as a business lawyer to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Her legal skills aside, Loh's mailers tend to emphasize her outsider status. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trudi Loh: The Only One for Today's Ventura County," reads a recent flyer, 
which lists her endorsements from such environmental groups as the Sierra Club 
and Save Open Space. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter group played a key role in helping VanderKolk, who had no prior 
political experience, unseat Supervisor Madge Schaefer in 1990. But Save Open 
Space dropped its support for VanderKolk when she voted in favor of the giant 
Ahmanson Ranch housing project planned for eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is now backing Loh in large part because she opposes a proposal to 
give the Ahmanson Land Co. an extension on its development agreement with the 
county. In return for the right to develop a golf-course community in the Simi 
Hills, Ahmanson agreed to turn over thousands of acres of privately owned 
mountain land to park agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal has been stalled by lawsuits filed against the developer, which 
initially had until 1995 to complete the land transactions. Ahmanson is now 
asking that the deadline for acquiring two ranch properties owned by Bob Hope 
be extended by three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh said she opposes the extension because she believes the developer will 
eventually try to back out of its deal with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it increases the likelihood that we're never going to get what we 
bargained for," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, however, said the developer is not to blame for the lawsuits holding 
up the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be willing to give them a 10-year extension if necessary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a few issues, the two candidates find common ground. 
</P>
<P>
 They both support a proposed commercial airport at the Point Mugu Navy base. 
The Navy has offered to share its runway with the county in exchange for 
sharing operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates agree that a commercial airport would help attract new 
businesses, while providing the county's agricultural industry another way to 
ship its products out of state or overseas. Because most flights would land and 
take off over the ocean, there would be little noise impact on the nearby city 
of Camarillo, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Loh said she is concerned that a commercial airport could spark 
development in some agricultural areas surrounding the Navy base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would want to see the environmental impact report" before making any final 
decision on the airport, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the public debates, the candidates have sparred over the need to train 
firefighters as paramedics. The county is now served by three private ambulance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, who has received donations from the county firefighters' union, said a 
firefighter paramedic program could help improve emergency response times in 
some areas. She said she believed such a program could be phased in and would 
eventually pay for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not be in favor of putting public paramedics anywhere where the 
private sector is doing a good job," she said. "But certainly there are some 
areas, especially in the east county, where response times could be improved." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, who has received campaign contributions from Pruner Health Services, 
which serves eastern Ventura County, said he is not convinced county paramedic 
service is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would take two years to get everybody trained," he said. "Where is the 
money going to come from to train all the firefighters?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, both candidates have been taking extra steps to demonstrate their 
desire to make a difference in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 As a county supervisor, Loh pledged to use her annual car allowance -- about 
$5,000 -- if necessary to extend the operating hours of the county's Prueter 
Library in Port Hueneme. The library's hours have been reduced from 61 hours a 
week to 24 hours in the past two years because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a business attorney and a taxpayer, I understand that government has to 
cut waste, bureaucracy and political perks in order to provide these services," 
Loh said in announcing her plan. "As the supervisor for the 2nd District, I 
will be committed to doing just that." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo has also been busy trying to drum up support outside the Thousand Oaks 
city limits, his home political turf. 
</P>
<P>
 One proposal he is working on would allow Oak Park and Lake Sherwood residents 
to join with Thousand Oaks in contracting with Los Angeles County for animal 
control services in nearby Agoura. Those residents now have to travel to 
Camarillo to claim lost animals or other pet services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, Schillo proposed opening a tattoo-removal clinic in Port 
Hueneme that would remove gang insignia or other tattoos on teen-agers free of 
charge. Removing tattoos, he said, could help severe gang ties and help break 
down barriers that prevent many young people from getting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will reduce crime, but it will help get the criminal out of 
the crime scene," he said. "If it works in Port Hueneme, then we could have 
other locations around the entire county." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he is also working on lining up services for residents of the 2nd 
Supervisorial District, such as a traffic light in Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting things done now, even before I'm elected," Schillo said. "Now do 
you want somebody that will do that, or somebody that's just going to talk?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Loh dismissed Schillo's actions as nothing more than political 
grandstanding, saying all of the projects he is working on have yet to be 
completed or proven successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he's trying to do," she said, "is create the appearance that he's 
getting things done." 2nd Supervisorial District

EXPERTS SPLIT ON OUTCOME OF BATTLE TO BEAT MEDFLY; INFESTATION: MOST 
SPECIALISTS APPROVE OF THE COUNTY'S ATTACK SO FAR. THEY DIFFER SHARPLY, 
HOWEVER, WHEN IT COMES TO PREDICTING RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fruit will be quarantined. Fields will be sprayed. Flies will be trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 But will Ventura County ever be rid of the dreaded Medfly? 
</P>
<P>
 That question has sent bug experts from across the state buzzing to their file 
cabinets as they root through case histories from the past 15 years in search 
of battle plans and clues about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Medfly specialists approve of the county's attack so far -- the intensive 
trapping efforts, the quarantine on fruit grown near the infestation, the plans 
for aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion. They differ sharply, however, 
when it comes to predicting results. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimists believe Ventura County will slide out of the crisis quickly, with 
minimal damage, by killing every last Mediterranean fruit fly in the next half 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident that we (can) achieve eradication," said Douglas Hendrix, 
spokesman for a joint state and federal task force charged with battling the 
Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 With prompt action, "Ventura County will be in and out of this infestation 
rather quickly," agreed Greg Van Wassenhove, agricultural commissioner for 
Santa Clara County, who said he has seen eradication programs "work very well 
here. The Medfly is something we can deal with."  
</P>
<P>
 Bleakly, other experts dismiss such bullish assurances. 
</P>
<P>
 In their grim view, Ventura County is doomed to suffer wave after wave of 
infestation during the next few decades. This devastating cycle could 
ultimately crush the county's agricultural industry, worth $848 million in crop 
sales alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the counties that have been infested, there has never, never, never 
been one that was dis-infested," warns Jim Carey, a professor of entomology at 
the University of California at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a creeping fungus that continually moves to expand its range, yard by 
yard, property by property," Carey said. "It's a cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers, scientists, environmentalists and bureaucrats have all studied the 
Medfly since its first appearance in Southern California in 1975. They have 
tracked the blue-eyed pests from feast to feast, battling the fruit-gobbling 
insects along a trail stretching from Santa Clara to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all their research, they have failed to reach consensus on three key 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 How does the Medfly flit from county to county? 
</P>
<P>
 How well do eradication programs work? 
</P>
<P>
 And how can bug zappers vanquish the voracious insects without harming the 
people who live nearby? 
</P>
<P>
 Spot eradication programs have won praise in half a dozen counties. A 
combination of quarantines, aerial and ground spraying, and the release of 
sterilized Medflies winnows the pest population dramatically -- for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 But as soon as state officials declare, triumphantly, that they have achieved 
"eradication," the Medfly crops up again elsewhere. Like the plastic gophers in 
county fair games, which sink under a hammer blow to the head and then pop up 
grinning in an adjacent hole, the Medfly seems invincible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1990, for example, officials said they had succeeded in 
banishing the voracious pest from Southern California. Just one year later, a 
pregnant Medfly was discovered in a peach tree near Koreatown in Los Angeles. 
An intensive trapping effort uncovered 200 more Medflies in the area by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medfly's uncanny survival skill taunts activists like Lisabeth Hush, who 
suffered eye irritation, accelerated heartbeat and other symptoms during the 
1989 malathion spraying over the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Hush believes that the government's Medfly policies do not work. And she 
considers the ballyhooed eradication plans more show than substance. The 
spraying may prove to Japanese trading partners that California is tough on 
pests, she says, but it does not conquer the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no entomology in California," Hush said. "It's all based on 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal officials bristle at such charges. They insist that they can 
-- and do -- eradicate the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, they say, is that the Medfly is constantly reintroduced, despite 
the strict quarantines. Tourists may smuggle in maggot-ridden tomatoes from 
Central America. Hawaiians may send fly-infested papayas to their relatives in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's all it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, the fast-breeding critters can produce enough offspring to 
spark another Medfly crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing makes me madder than people bringing fruit back from Hawaii," said 
Deena Gerry, whose family has tended a citrus grove near Camarillo since the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Will Gerry, added: "People pick up mangoes in Hawaii, stuff them into 
their suitcases, and then when they get home and open them they say, 'Eeew, 
look at these bugs!' and throw them in the trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless infested produce is double-bagged, sealed and placed in covered 
containers, the maggots can crawl out and begin breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the state and the federal governments try to prevent such accidental 
infestations by policing quarantine boundaries to be sure no one illegally 
transports fruit from a Medfly zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruit-sniffing beagles at Los Angeles International Airport and the Port of 
Long Beach inspect baggage in an effort to root out contraband and enforce the 
1,500-square-mile quarantine zone that spans four counties in the Los Angeles 
Basin. In the past, federal officials have even launched sting operations at 
local post offices to check for fruit smuggled in parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Far from such traditional ports of entry, Ventura County's quarantine covers 
86 square miles surrounding "ground zero" -- the low-slung fig tree on the 
grounds of St. John's Seminary in Camarillo where the first two Medflies were 
discovered Sept. 29. Most crops within the zone, including citrus and avocados, 
must be treated before shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar quarantine, combined with aggressive aerial spraying, squashed the 
Medfly threat in just six months in Riverside County earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the quarantine caused some penny-pinching, farmers bounced back 
remarkably well. Drawing on their experiences, they now seek to reassure 
Ventura County's growers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were much more concerned than we needed to be," Riverside County farmer 
Charles Colladay said. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of Colladay's 2,000-acre ranch landed in the quarantine zone, which 
radiated from the city of Corona. He was able to treat the quarantined produce 
with malathion for about $60 an acre -- a price tag which covered five 
applications of the pesticide, timed to kill each emerging generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a scary thing when we went into it . . . but things just went like 
clockwork," Colladay said. A firm believer that Medflies can be conquered, 
Colladay praised the state's eradication program with a simple endorsement: "It 
works."  
</P>
<P>
 But the Riverside method -- eight aerial sprays, separated by six to 10 days 
-- remains highly controversial. Environmentalists and city officials raised a 
ruckus in Corona, even going to court in an unsuccessful attempt to block the 
malathion sprays. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Noel Otten, research director for the Burbank-based anti-spraying group Action 
Now, said he believes bureaucrats "have an agenda to falsely reassure the 
public about malathion." 
</P>
<P>
 A brace of scientific studies, though, backs the official word that malathion 
is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 A common back-yard pesticide, malathion does not cause cancer or birth defects 
and poses "no significant health hazard," according to the state Department of 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
 It does, however, carry a significant price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cooperative Medfly Project, a task force funded by state and federal tax 
dollars, spent $100 million from 1980 to 1982 to wipe out the Medfly in Santa 
Clara County. The group revived the same strategy seven years later to battle 
Medflies in the Los Angeles Basin, at a cost of $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the aerial spraying was declared effective in 1990, the Medflies 
popped up again just a year later. This time, political opposition blocked the 
aerial application of malathion bait, a potent substance that tricks adult 
insects into drinking poison by lacing the pesticide with sweet corn syrup  
</P>
<P>
 Without aerial sprays, the latest Los Angeles Basin eradication effort relies 
on the release of more than 400 million sterile Medflies each week. Officials 
hope the sterile insects will mate with fertile Medflies in fruitless couplings 
that will thin the ranks of future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The sterile fly program, plus routine trapping and quarantine enforcement, 
cost $26 million last year. And it seems to be working -- the number of flies 
found in the Los Angeles Basin has plummeted, from about 400 last year to just 
seven so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything seems to have calmed down a lot because of the sterile fly 
releases," said Bob Wyatt, legislative director for the Orange County Farm 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 But sterile fly labs in Hawaii and Guatemala are working at full capacity to 
meet demands for the Los Angeles Basin. And state officials have expressed 
doubt that any sterile flies will be available for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by such roadblocks, entomologist Carey has called for an "AIDS-like 
research program to come up with a long-term approach to dealing with the 
Medfly problem." 
</P>
<P>
 While most agricultural officials continue to hope that the Medfly can be 
wiped out with spot eradication efforts, Carey insists that the pest has become 
firmly established in Southern California. He forecasts continual, costly 
battles against the pest -- battles that could sink some farmers and trigger a 
much-feared Asian boycott of California produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Ventura County find is absolutely predictable," he said. "We're lurching 
from outbreak to outbreak here. . . . We have got to develop and implement a 
major research program to supplement our brush-fire approach. 
</P>
<P>

-- we have to go after the disease itself." Southern California Invasion

DOES SIMI HAVE A SENSE OF PLACE? OPINIONS DIFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask Simi Valley planner Wolf Ascher to highlight some of his city's 
outstanding features and he will enthuse over carefully preserved vistas, 
intensely coordinated architecture and meticulously landscaped subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Put the same question to Bill Fulton and the independent, Ventura-based 
planner ticks off a litany of faults, boiling them all down to bland, bland, 
bland. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on whom you talk to, Simi Valley is either a welcome refuge of green 
lawns, rolling hills and a deep-rooted community or 39 square miles of soulless 
strip malls and sprawling subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
 For Fulton, the problem is simple to identify, but difficult to remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have a criticism of Simi Valley it is that you don't get the impression 
that it is really a place," Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think about the places you like to be, more than anywhere else, those 
places are distinctive," he continued. "In Simi Valley, you may be able to get 
a sense of place in your back yard looking at the hills, but you don't get a 
sense of place in one of those endless strip malls." 
</P>
<P>
 Ascher, who has worked as a planner for the city for 21 years, insists that 
the city does provide a sense of place. In fact, he says, it is full of 
meaningful places, which he calls focal points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have an obvious center like the European cities with the castle on 
the hill," Ascher said. "But if you open your eyes you can see these focal 
points, these centers of community activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the centers Ascher lists are the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, the 
Wood Ranch housing development and the city's government center, which is home 
to City Hall, a library, senior center, county courthouse and an office of the 
Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, Ascher said, is the city's attention to aesthetics 
throughout the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad rap some critics give the city has more to do with the way it looked 
25 years ago, when billboards abounded, planning was scorned and malls and 
tract housing appeared seemingly overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Ascher points with pride to billboard-free Los Angeles Avenue, a result of 
decades of careful planning. Although strip malls still dominate much of the 
city's main drag, thousands of trees now line the sidewalks, rooftop signs and 
unsightly swamp coolers are prohibited and most of the power poles are out of 
sight, buried deep underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Development aside, for a real sense of Simi Valley, Ascher said, look beyond 
the city limits to the mountains that surround it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the west is cross-topped Mt. McCoy; to the north, the stark, looming walls 
of Whiteface Mountain; in the east the craggy outcroppings of the Santa Susana 
Mountains, and to the south, the softly rolling Simi Valley Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 With the valley floor almost entirely built out and pressure strong to allow 
development in the highly desirable hillsides, the city strives for 
selectivity, restricting construction to slopes of less than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the city has held fast to that credo, granting exceptions for 
carefully selected housing developments, an industrial park at the west end of 
town, a long-sought regional mall and occasional water tanks, plopped like 
beige birthday cakes atop hills east of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Water tanks and housing tracts aside, "it's the hills that give Simi Valley 
its distinctive flavor," Ascher said. "It's quite a spectacular setting." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say Simi Valley suffers from sameness syndrome, designed 
intentionally to blend in rather than stimulate or inspire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simi Valley is such a young city, it's really in the larval or nymphal stage 
of city-dom," said Joel Garreau , author of "Edge City," a book chronicling the 
evolution of suburbs into thriving urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about Simi Valley is that at one time it was pristine and quite 
beautiful and people moved out there seeking Eden," Garreau said. "Now that the 
rural element is diminishing, people have to develop a new aesthetic, and that 
takes time." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he holds fast to the conviction that Simi Valley is a model of suburban 
success, Ascher acknowledged that in both personality and appearance, his city 
is still in the early stages of its evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have here is an ongoing process," Ascher said. "We work on it and 
improve on it bit by bit."

CITY NAME A TRIBUTE TO THE CHUMASH TRIBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's in a name? 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, it represents a victory for longtime residents who 25 years 
ago fought to preserve it as one of the last vestiges of the Native American 
Chumash tribe that once lived in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't always clear that our city was going to be called Simi," historian 
Patricia Havens said. "But for those of us who have lived in this valley for a 
long time, we always believed that was what it should be called." 
</P>
<P>
 The word Simi is taken from the Chumash "shimiji" which means, possibly, 
"clouds" or "wind" or "little white clouds that dance on the wind." 
</P>
<P>
 An early developer tried to lure prospective residents to "Simiopolis."  
</P>
<P>
 "Back then everything was supposed to sound grand, like Minneapolis," Havens 
said. "It didn't really fit in with what things were really like out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents seemed to agree, and the name didn't stick. 
</P>
<P>
 At incorporation, voters were given a choice between Santa Susana, the name of 
a small community at the east end of the valley, and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course Santa Susana sounds much prettier, but I'll take historical value 
over a pretty name any day," Havens said. "We were all thrilled when Simi 
Valley won." 
</P>
<P>
 Little did they know the trouble lurking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We soon discovered," Havens said, "that people for some reason just refuse to 
say it (Simi) properly." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi, old-timers and sticklers for history insist, must be pronounced suh-MEE. 
They cringe when they hear the less correct SEE-me or SIM-ee. Those widespread 
mispronunciations, Havens said, sound a little too much like derogatory names 
the city has been called, like "Seamy Valley."  
</P>
<P>
 "When you want your city to project a positive image, the last thing you need 
is people saying the name wrong," Havens said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; ORPHANED CATS HUNT FOR NEW HOMES AT SHOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The hard sell was on, and Pete Siudara of Camarillo was succumbing to the 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say -- I'm a sucker for cats," he said with a shrug. Oscar, a 
large 5-year-old abandoned cat, was burrowing into his lap, and Siudara was 
almost ready to give in. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Stewart, a volunteer with the Animal Shelter Assistance Program in Santa 
Barbara, brought Oscar and about two dozen other cats to the Ventura County 
Fairgrounds on Saturday for the 28th annual Cat Fanciers Assn. Championship and 
Orphaned Cat Adoption Show. 
</P>
<P>
 Their hope was to match potential owners and animals -- and Siudara and Oscar 
seemed to be warming to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The cat competition drew more than 200 feline competitors of different breeds. 
The event continues today from 9 a.m to 5 p.m. Part of the proceeds will 
benefit California State Humane Officers Inc., which operates an "Adopt & Save 
a Cat Rescue." The money will also go toward a spaying and neutering program.

 While Oscar the cat nuzzled, a Ventura couple mused about just which cat they 
wanted to bring home. Craig Smith and his friend Linda Root went by each caged 
animal and peeked in. They picked up a few of the cats and stroked them behind 
the ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Becky," said Smith, pointing to a small gray cat curled comfortably in 
a corner. "But (Linda) wants one that's been de-clawed." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so hard to decide," Root said. "They all are so adorable." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite finding only two homes for the cats by midafternoon Saturday, Stewart 
said the volunteers were upbeat and hoping all the cats would be adopted by the 
end of the show Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 She said one of the two lucky felines to find a home was Woody, a hard-luck 
shelter favorite with a thyroid condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so happy when he was adopted," Stewart said. "I mean, who would think 
that someone would adopt a 14-year-old cat that has to have two pills every 
day?" SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY TO STUDY SAFETY MEASURES FOR SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to complaints over speeding near Juanamaria School, a Ventura city 
committee has ordered city traffic engineers to investigate posting speed 
limits and installing a stop light near the elementary campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Billie Olmstead told council members on the committee that she had 
gathered nearly 400 signatures on a petition calling for increased traffic 
safety measures in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Olmstead began the petition drive after a 12-year-old neighborhood boy was 
killed in a bicycling accident near the school last month. The accident was not 
related to the area's speeding problems -- authorities said the boy swerved 
into a passing car, which was moving below the speed limit. But Olmstead said 
the incident seemed an opportunity to get the community to focus on traffic 
problems that have long troubled her. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the council committee agreed. City staff members say they will begin 
studying the intersection at Petit Avenue and Telegraph Road to determine 
whether it warrants a traffic signal. They will also look into the possibility 
of posting a "school zone" sign on westbound Telegraph Avenue, and erecting 
speed limit signs on Petit Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have also requested a four-way stop sign at Petit Avenue and Balboa 
Street, which now has one stop sign on Balboa Street. But city engineers say 
the law allows them to post a stop sign on Petit Avenue only if both streets 
generate about the same amount of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 70% of the traffic is on Petit Avenue, so it would be illegal to 
make cars on that street come to a stop at the intersection, officials said.

20-ACRE ARSON BLAZE THREATENS HOMES AND HOSPITAL IN SANTA PAULA; EMERGENCY: 
HIGH TEMPERATURES AND WINDS OF 25 M.P.H. FAN THE FLAMES BEFORE FIREFIGHTERS 
GAIN CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nearly a year after devastating brush fires raged across Southern California, 
an arson fire fueled by Santa Ana winds and high temperatures was set Saturday 
in Santa Paula, blackening 20 acres and threatening homes and a hospital before 
it was contained, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures in the 90s, 25-m.p.h. winds and the fire's proximity to the site 
of last October's 26,500-acre Steckel fire initially fanned fears among 
firefighters and residents that the fire would be difficult to control. The 
flames came within 200 feet of Santa Paula Memorial Hospital and nearby houses, 
sending homeowners to rooftops armed with fire hoses. 
</P>
<P>
 But firefighters brought the blaze within 90% containment about an hour after 
the fire was reported just before 1 p.m. The fire was contained by 3 p.m. No 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found an incendiary device amid the burned-out brush, leading 
authorities to conclude that the blaze was deliberately set in a vacant field 
across the street from the hospital at 825 N. 10th St. Fire officials declined 
to give details about the device, however, citing an ongoing investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said they were poised to evacuate the 18 patients in the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We implemented our disaster plan and were ready to evacuate everyone," said 
nursing supervisor Linda Simmons. "We had only two patients who needed to be in 
(intensive care) facilities, and Community Memorial Hospital (in Ventura) said 
they could take them." 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons said she and other hospital staff reported the fire to authorities at 
1 p.m., after a visitor to the hospital informed her that he had seen smoke and 
flames in chaparral below a hospital parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes after the fire was reported, about 60 Santa Paula and Ventura 
County firefighters were on the scene and two helicopters were showering water 
on the burning chaparral. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire traveled west from 10th Street toward Fagan Canyon, threatening 
nearby avocado orchards and hillside homes near Montclair and Monte Vista 
drives, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the weather conditions, the fire could had been much worse, said Santa 
Paula Fire Capt. Steven Lazenby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were lucky that the winds were not as strong" as during last year's fire, 
Lazenby said. "Had the winds been stronger, this fire would be all over (the 
area) and we probably would have had to evacuate residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Fujii, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Oxnard, said 
the hot, windy conditions will continue through today, but would probably die 
down by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Doll, a resident of Monte Vista Drive, said she began hosing down her 
roof as soon as she saw the flames  
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," she said. "My primarily concern was to get out alive and take my 
three dogs and two cats with me."

RESIDENTS OF PESTICIDE SPRAY ZONE GET FLYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Conservation Corps on Saturday finished distributing thousands 
of flyers notifying residents of the Medfly eradication zone that their homes 
will soon be sprayed with pesticide, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 14,000 official notices of aerial malathion spraying were distributed 
Friday to households and businesses in the eastern Camarillo and Somis areas, 
said Larry Hawkins of the Cooperative Medfly Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Corps members doled out additional flyers Saturday at Camarillo Public Library 
and to people in recreational vehicles, targeting those who may be in the 
eradication zone temporarily but who do not have permanent homes in the area, 
Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 29,000 people live in the 16-square-mile aerial spraying zone, according 
to estimates from Ventura County planning officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Saturday, Medfly Project workers answered phone calls from residents with 
questions about the infestation and the spraying campaign scheduled to begin at 
9 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins said more than 100 people called the hot line number Saturday morning. 
"A lot of them want to know if they are in the treatment area or outside," 
Hawkins said. "We tell them, if you didn't get a treatment notice, you are not 
in the treatment area." 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line number, listed on the spraying notification flyers, is 
800-491-1899. 
</P>
<P>
 Librarian Mary Goldberg said informational booklets and videotapes about the 
Medfly and the spraying program were in high demand Saturday at the Camarillo 
Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are interested," Goldberg said. "It's all around town." What to Do 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial spraying of malathion is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal agencies report that malathion has been studied extensively, 
and that there is no evidence it causes cancer, birth defects, nerve damage, 
eye damage or cumulative injury. But residents are cautioned to avoid exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also recommend that the following precautions be taken during and 
after spraying: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remain indoors if possible while spraying is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 * If outdoors, avoid looking up at the falling droplets. 
</P>
<P>
 * If in contact with spray, wash residues from skin and clothing with soap and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not leave laundry outdoors when spraying is scheduled. If laundry is 
soiled, rewash before wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put your car in a garage or carport, or cover it with a plastic tarp to 
prevent paint damage when spraying is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your car is outside during spraying, wash it the next day to prevent 
paint damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse plastic skylights and awnings the day after spraying to prevent 
permanent stains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cover fish ponds before spraying and uncover shortly after to minimize water 
contamination while avoiding oxygen depletion. 
</P>
<P>
 * After an area has been sprayed, wash outdoor eating areas, playground 
equipment and objects such as toys and pet food dishes that may have been 
outside during spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid harvesting home-grown fruits and vegetables for three days after 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse all fresh fruits and vegetables with water before cooking or eating 
them, just as you should with store-bought items. 
</P>

THE HIGH ROAD; TOLLWAY WOULD LET DRIVERS CRUISE ABOVE SANTA ANA CHANNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mel Placilla looks at the Santa Ana River and sees a road running through it. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran engineer is the manager of a unique project -- perhaps the only 
one like it in the nation -- to build an elevated toll road down the middle of 
the cemented, mostly dry river. When completed, the tollway would stretch 11 
miles from near Anaheim Stadium to the Corona del Mar Freeway, near John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately built road would be a southern extension of the heavily traveled 
Orange Freeway. The extension, which state planners originally intended to link 
with Pacific Coast Highway, has been on Caltrans' drawing board for almost 
three decades, but a shortage of funds has prevented the state from building 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The still unnamed road is unofficially called the Santa Ana Viaduct 
Expressway, but some proponents are also calling it the Duke to Ducks Freeway. 
That is a reference to the airport and The Pond of Anaheim, home of the Mighty 
Ducks hockey team, near Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Financing for the $650-million thoroughfare will be arranged by a group of 
private investors led by H. Ross Perot Jr. The project has been in the talking 
stage for two years, but the tollway will clear the first bureaucratic hurdle 
this week, when the National Transportation Authority -- a joint venture 
between Greiner Engineering Inc. and The Perot Group -- is expected to sign a 
right-of-way agreement with the Orange County Flood Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the project will be funded through the sale of bonds to private 
investors, but the Orange County Transportation Authority has agreed to 
contribute $12 million for an environmental study. The state will assume 
ownership of the thoroughfare when it is completed and eventually get a share 
of the revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 If built, the Santa Ana River toll road would be the fifth in Orange County. 
Privately built tollways designed to ease traffic congestion are becoming 
increasingly common, especially in Southern California, where crowded freeways 
are a commuter's daily nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Public reaction to the tollway has been nonexistent so far, mainly because the 
project is still in the design phase and government agencies have not scheduled 
public hearings. The cities affected by the project include Orange, Anaheim, 
Santa Ana, Fountain Valley and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County director of public works William L. Zaun, who is negotiating a 
right-of-use agreement with Placilla's company, said "we have not had any 
discussions with neighboring cities about this project." 
</P>
<P>
 "The cities' input will take place during the environmental review process, 
when the community at large is given an opportunity to comment," Zaun added. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaun and others familiar with the project insist the tollway can be built, but 
only if Placilla's company can secure the financing. Placilla acknowledged 
there is a shortage of investors for the project at the moment and said he is 
in a "mini 'Catch-22' situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't go to the investment community to get the money until the 
environmental report is approved. And we can't begin the environmental review 
until we sign a right-of-way agreement with the (flood control) district," 
Placilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubert Himes, the Caltrans official in Santa Ana overseeing the project for 
the state, said it is believed to be the first road designed to be constructed 
above an inactive river in the United States. He and other government officials 
expressed warm, if not enthusiastic support for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Himes, the National Transportation Authority was one of four 
companies awarded franchises from among 500 international applicants who 
responded to a 1990 Caltrans request to submit proposals for privately financed 
transportation projects in the state. Of all the companies that applied, 10 
were invited to submit plans and four projects were selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans awarded a franchise for the Santa Ana River tollway to Placillas' 
company on Jan. 11, 1991. The other three franchises were given for the toll 
road project currently under construction in the middle of the Riverside 
Freeway, between the Costa Mesa Freeway and the Riverside County line, and 
tollways in San Diego and the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Himes said Caltrans will assume ownership of the tollway on the day it opens, 
but the builders will be permitted to collect tolls for 35 years to pay for the 
project. During that time, Placillas' company will also be responsible for all 
operational costs, including paying Caltrans to help maintain the roadway and 
the California Highway Patrol to police it. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, our franchise agreement includes a 20% limit on the profit they can 
make, above the construction cost," Himes said. "Any profit they make after 
reaching the cap would go directly to the state. When we drew up the agreement, 
it seemed like there was a potential for paying it off in a few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Himes and Placilla said motorists would pay a reduced toll or use the 
road for free once the project is paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime within the next 14 days, Placilla expects to sign a right-of-use 
agreement with the county flood control district. Zaun said county officials 
are trying to decide how much Placilla's company will pay for an easement 200 
yards wide extending on each side from the middle of the river. In addition to 
the toll road, the company will also build bicycle and equestrian trails along 
the banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're supposed to get together late this week or next to discuss the 
agreement and finalize our discussion. I hope we can finish with the 
compensation (to the county) issue, so the Board of Supervisors will give their 
agreement on the right-of-way agreement," Zaun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the agreement with the flood control district is signed, the Orange 
County Transportation Authority will begin talks with the Placilla on an 
agreement for joint funding of an environmental study, said Dave Elbaum, 
director of planning for the transportation agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency has authorized $12 million for the study, and Placilla's 
group is expected to contribute an additional $13 million for the environmental 
report, Elbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they still have to negotiate their deal with (Orange County) before we 
can act. We feel comfortable with project," Elbaum added. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of project an engineer looks for. It's not so much that it's 
technologically challenging," Placilla said. "Rather, it's an organizational 
challenge that when completed will bring you some recognition. Building the 
road will be relatively easy. Organizing the project and then getting approval 
from the local, state and federal agencies will probably be the most demanding 
task." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, to hear Placilla explain it, the road could almost be designed by an 
engineering 101 student. It is as easy as driving concrete columns down the 
middle of the river at equal intervals and then laying a concrete deck over 
them. Well, almost as easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The tollway will rise four feet to 20 feet above the levee, built on concrete 
columns that will be 10 feet wide, spaced at intervals of 100 feet or 150 feet 
and anchored up to 20 feet into the river bottom, Placilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will have two lanes running in each direction, with each lane capable of 
carrying up to 1,700 cars per hour with a maximum speed of 60 m.p.h. Barring 
unforeseen obstacles in the permit and environmental review process, 
construction on the project is scheduled to begin in 1998 and be completed by 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
 The tollway will follow the Santa Ana River to the San Diego Freeway (405) and 
then swing south to link with the Corona del Mar Freeway (73). 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the toll to cost $4 during peak hours, $1.50 during non-peak day 
hours and 50 cents at night," Placilla said. "But as usage increases and the 
road begins to get congested, we will raise the toll to maintain a steady level 
of service and encourage commuters to ride-share." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most officials who have reviewed plans for the tollway have given it their 
approval. Zaun and Bruce Henderson, an official with the Army Corps of 
Engineers, said there are no apparent environmental obstacles to hamper the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, how many endangered species of birds or animals can be found living 
on the river's cement bottom, Zaun said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we'll have a bugs and bunnies issue here," agreed Placilla. 
"Our environmental issues will be more human related. The project will 
certainly affect people who live near the river. I expect air quality and noise 
to be the major issues affecting construction." 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson said the Corps' main concerns are that the columns used to support 
the road not affect the hydrology of the river, and the oil and gas leaked by 
cars not pollute the river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the river's capacity can be maintained and the structures do not 
impinge the flow of the water, I don't see anything that the Corps would not 
permit at this point," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that federal law also requires the Corps to review the project and 
determine if another, less intrusive, alternative can be substituted for a road 
slicing through the middle of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it doesn't sound like it's a horrible project. It's a big, wide river. 
You would think they can design structures that can withstand the flow of the 
river and still allow traffic on the facility," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaun said the tollway is designed to withstand a powerful flood, of the kind 
that occurs once in 200 years. As an example, Zaun said the road would be 
passable even in flooding like that of February, 1969, when torrential rains 
caused local creeks to overflow their banks and turned the Santa Ana River into 
a raging torrent. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we're concerned, beginning the environmental study as early as this 
fall is a possibility, provided they (Placilla's company) conclude financial 
arrangements with the Orange County Transportation Authority," he said. 
Riverbed Express 
</P>
<P>
 Under a franchise granted by Caltrans, elevated toll road may be built from 
Anaheim to Costa Mesa above the bed of the Santa Ana River. The expected cost 
of $650 million would be put up by private investors. Work on the Orange 
Freeway extension could begin in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Trails: Existing bike and horse trails at the riverbed ridges would remain 
intact with access from surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Capacity: Up to 1,700 cars per lane per hour, with an expected 60 m.p.h. 
average. No trucks would be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Future transit: Gap would allow development of mass transit, including 
electric trains or monorails. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverbed: Carries runoff down a gully to the ocean. The road is designed to 
withstand the force of a 200-year flood. Fast-Lane Facts

DANA PARSONS: AFTER LEARNING HISTORY, HE'S A JOHN WAYNE IN NAME ONLY

<P>
 The way the story got handed down through the family, the newborn's sister 
turned to their father and said, "Dad, I think we should name him John Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
 If you were living in Orange County in the mid-60s, the heroes didn't come 
much bigger than the Duke -- a local resident and already a living legend. So 
on that day in 1966, the boy became John Wayne Haug.  
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Orange County, Haug was proud of his namesake. "I loved watching 
his movies," he told me last week in the small office he uses while finishing 
his graduate studies at Cal State Fullerton. "My dad and I used to impersonate 
him. My mother called me John Wayne all the time. I was proud of it and I told 
people it made me feel special. My father gave me two paintings of him; one was 
the Newport Beach John Wayne and the other was the cowboy John Wayne. I had 
them up in my room for years."

 Haug grew up a patriot and a war buff who loved American history. Learning 
that he was perhaps one-sixteenth Cherokee only spiced his love of history; 
when his boyhood friends played "cowboys and Indians," Haug obligingly played 
the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 28, those days seem now long, long past. In the last few years, while 
combining dual undergraduate majors in photography and anthropology, Haug has 
been on a journey, of sorts. It began as a scholastic pursuit but became a 
personal odyssey that tapped into what he had thought was but a distant part of 
his heritage: his Native American ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 For his graduate degree thesis, Haug prepared a 30-minute film on the life of 
a Tiwa Pueblan named Felix Montoya, now living in Los Angeles. Through 
Montoya's life and through contacts with other Native American historians, Haug 
found himself immersed in its culture and belief system. Along the way, he 
says, he became virtually overwhelmed with his sense of connection to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to use the word 'religion,' because it is not," Haug says. "I 
have a connection with the earth. I see the earth as my mother, because that is 
where all life comes from." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he realized the personal impact his studies were having on him, Haug 
says he labored to keep that separate from the scholastic part of his work. But 
even as his spiritual connection with Indian heritage soothed him, his academic 
pursuits angered him. 
</P>
<P>
 He began to see, he says, that everything he learned in school about Native 
Americans was fraudulent. He had been taught, he says, that "the Spanish 
missions were these great wonderful things and part of our history, when in 
reality they are to me the equivalent of the Japanese internment camps. They 
(the Spaniards) enslaved them and, particularly in the 1500s when the 
conquistadors came into the Southwest, the Indians were given the option of 
being Christianized or being killed. I said, I have to learn the truth for 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 His search, Haug says, inevitably forced him to come to grips with the man for 
whom he was named. After all, he asked himself, how could he continue being 
proud of the man who forged much of his Hollywood celebrity as an Indian 
fighter? 
</P>
<P>
 As it has turned out, Haug couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The "flash point," Haug says, was a column I wrote several months ago in which 
I longed for what John Wayne seemed to represent -- open, honest simplicity and 
personal toughness. 
</P>
<P>
 That column prompted Haug to write a letter to me that, he said as we talked 
last week, "just flowed from me without having to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, Haug wrote: "The films Wayne made were based in part upon true 
historical events, which Hollywood then twisted into a nasty stereotype that 
persists today. . . . There are 'white folk' in this country to this day that 
still believe 'the only good Indian is a dead Indian,' a phrase which The Duke 
helped to perpetuate." 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to write: "The genocide continues today. Maybe not with guns and 
horses, but with pollution, desecration of sacred burial sites and thought 
(advertising and teaching of European history in our schools). So long as 
people like John Wayne and Columbus are recognized as heroes for their good 
deeds and discoveries, the killing of Indian people and their culture will 
continue in one form or another." 
</P>
<P>
 During Columbus Day observances this week, Haug will wear a purple armband. If 
anyone asks why, he says, he will politely give them his view on Indian history 
in America. "I'll say I'm glad you asked and take the time to teach them what 
I've been taught and encourage them to go out and learn." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Haug if he has been able to make peace with his namesake. An 
acquaintance of Wayne's, he said, told him that the "real" John Wayne was a 
good-hearted sort. "The way I look at him now is just that," Haug says. "I say, 
'OK, maybe as a person I didn't know him, I don't know much about him, maybe I 
should read a book about him. I won't judge him as a person. As a character he 
played, I judge him just about as destructive as any Adolf Hitler or any 
government that takes the original inhabitants of that country and slowly kills 
them off."

VIETNAM TRADE TRIP A SUCCESS, DELEGATION SAYS; ASIA: THE HANOI GOVERNMENT IS ON 
THE ROAD TO A MARKET ECONOMY, A MISSION FROM ORANGE COUNTY ANNOUNCES. THE VISIT 
SURPASSES EXPECTATIONS, ITS MEMBERS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Members of an Orange County trade delegation, concluding an eight-day mission 
to Vietnam on Saturday, said the results of the trip surpassed expectations and 
reinforced their beliefs that the Hanoi government is on the road to a market 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese American delegates who were among the 27 members of the trade 
mission sponsored by the Orange County Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce said they 
were pleased by government officials' support for expatriates seeking to invest 
in their native country. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest example raised by Vietnamese trade officials is a law enacted in 
July that allows foreigners who move to Vietnam to buy homes there, a right 
previously reserved for Vietnam's citizens. The law takes effect in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of that decree is to encourage overseas Vietnamese to come back 
and invest in the country," trade official Le Cong Giau told the delegation in 
a meeting Friday. Giau chairs the Foreign Trade and Investment Development 
Center in Ho Chi Minh City, a group that advises foreign investors in southern 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Co Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, told Giau the law 
"would be a real breakthrough for the overseas Vietnamese," adding that it 
would be construed as a "real conciliatory gesture" from the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County delegation left Southern California Sept. 30 after angry 
protests from conservative Vietnamese Americans long opposed to overtures to 
the Communist government that took over South Vietnam in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 After a whirlwind trip highlighted by meetings with Vietnam's vice president 
and deputy foreign minister in Hanoi, the delegates left Ho Chi Minh City on 
Saturday pleased with the fact-finding mission's outcome. They are scheduled to 
arrive at Los Angeles International Airport today. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Co Pham, other prominent delegation members included Kenneth 
Moore, president of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce, and Robert Yasui, 
president of the Los Angeles-based Asian Business League. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the delegation's important meetings with government officials and 
industry counterparts took place during their five days in Hanoi. During their 
final three days here, the delegation met with officials from the People's 
Committee of Ho Chi Minh City -- formerly known as Saigon -- and leaders in the 
trade and planning departments here. 
</P>
<P>
 Group members also forged a number of connections they said may lead to future 
business deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Huynh Nguyen, an account manager at Technical Industries Corp., in Apple 
Valley, Calif., which produces feed for livestock, left Vietnam with a written 
memorandum from a Hanoi animal and poultry import and export company expressing 
interest in his company's products.  
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen said government officials told him that "95% of Vietnam's livestock and 
poultry are raised by families and not farms. This is an agricultural country, 
but their farmers are the poorest of the poor. A trade mission such as this is 
one of the many things that will help Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Huynh Willis, who teaches at West Coast University in Los Angeles, came on 
a fact-finding visit to Vietnam with no expectation beyond meeting some of her 
peers. But after meeting with officials from the Ministry of Education, she 
left Hanoi with a verbal commitment from educators at the National Economics 
University to participate in an exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have to define the details and work out the logistics , but I expect 
that we will send people here within the next three months," Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
 While few delegates left with anything as concrete as the agreement Nguyen 
worked out, many said they were pleased simply to make business contacts and 
begin to understand the needs and opportunities in Vietnam. Many said they 
understood the voyage might not yield immediate results, but they believed the 
effort was worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the discussions with officials, I see that there is a need for 
better infrastructure, legal services, medical equipment and centers and 
telecommunications," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am going to go back to the business people in Orange County who specialize 
in these things and say now is the right time to get involved, and I know some 
of the people who can help you." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the controversy he has generated in recent years by advocating a 
business relationship with Vietnam, Pham has deliberately remained coy when 
officials here asked if he was interested in doing business in the country. But 
on a few occasions when officials in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City asked if 
there was a possibility that he could help with the building and design of a 
medical facility like his Westminster offices on Bolsa Avenue, he said he would 
consider their request. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing I need right now is for Vietnamese Americans in Orange County 
to say I'm only interested in making money in Vietnam," Pham said later. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the group's last day in Vietnam, the delegates were invited to a 
lunch hosted in their honor by officials of the Irvine based Fluor Daniel 
Corp., which has an office in Ho Chi Minh City. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very productive trip, but we are ready to go home," Pham said. 
"We still have a lot of work to do. We have to convince people there are mutual 
benefits and personal gratification in the betterment of Vietnam."

EMPOWERING WOMEN INFECTED WITH HIV; HEALTH: EXPERTS AT IRVINE CONFERENCE SAY 
EDUCATION ABOUT PREVENTION AND TREATMENT IS NEEDED, ALONG WITH A BETTER SUPPORT 
SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The rapidly growing number of women who are testing positive for HIV lack the 
support systems, medical understanding and practical information that gay men 
with the same diagnosis are given, speakers said Saturday at the third annual 
Women and HIV Conference at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women with HIV are in a very different situation than a gay man or even HIV 
drug users," AIDS researcher Alexandra Levine said during her keynote address. 
"Gay men have a society that is organized to help them through this, but if you 
are a woman, you are alone." 
</P>
<P>
 The all-day conference, organized by the South Coast Medical Center Foundation 
and the UCI Health Education Program, drew more than 400 people, including 
HIV-positive women, educators, activists, health-care workers, and students. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, women account for 6% of the 3,400 reported cases of the 
virus, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Norman, executive director for the California AIDS Intervention Training 
Center in San Francisco, challenged women at the conference to "empower 
themselves" by demanding that more education about prevention and treatment be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many women must die from this disease . . . before their loss will be 
considered important enough to make a concerted effort to stop the spread of 
the virus in this population?" Norman asked during her speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the topics discussed during a series of seminars was the impact the 
disease has on children who are either infected or have a parent who is. 
</P>
<P>
 One 34-year-old HIV-positive woman said during the session that she felt 
forced to retreat from her visible role as an AIDS activist because her 
13-year-old son was being taunted by classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "People aren't nice," said the woman, who said she was infected by her former 
husband two years ago. "Sometimes I regret coming out and speaking. You want to 
save people, but when you go out and speak, they dump on you. Your neighbors 
don't want to touch the same vegetables you touched in the supermarket. It's 
like a big tattoo across your head." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jennifer Lee, a 23-year-old woman with HIV, said she is determined to 
continue to speak out and fight against such discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are ignorant," she said. "It doesn't matter where AIDS came from. It's 
not about blame. It's about working together to find a cure." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee found out six months ago that she was infected with the virus. She was a 
new mother when she took the HIV test during a routine medical examination and 
was stunned by the results. Lee believes she was infected by her first sexual 
partner six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in Irvine and graduated from high school with honors, but no one 
ever taught me about HIV," Lee said tearfully. "I would never want anyone to be 
in the position that I'm in now." 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of listening to AIDS specialists and meeting each other, 
conference-goers were given some comic relief by Suzanne Wilson, an 
HIV-positive comedian from Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much sadness and sorrow," Wilson said before her presentation. 
"Laughter helps us get through all of this together."

BRIDE IS TRULY BORING; GROOM WILL CARY ON

 She considers herself the life of any party, but everyone knows she is Truly 
Boring. 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't always. But on Sept. 17, Truly Gold, 24, of Huntington Beach tied 
the knot with Cary S. Boring, 27, of Balboa Island and legally took his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, people are already coming up with names for children we could have," the 
new bride said, adding that the most suggested monikers include "Really, Very 
and Totally." 
</P>
<P>
 Although her family thinks the union of names is "hysterical," Truly is having 
a little trouble getting used to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The young retail merchandise coordinator, who prefers to go by Truly Gold 
Boring, said she once considered changing her new last name or even adding a 
strategically placed accent to avoid some embarrassment. Mr. Boring, Truly 
says, has never even considered a name change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can just imagine what our kids' friends might say years from now: 'Do we 
have to go to the Boring house?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Long before last month's wedding, Truly truly had some time to consider the 
possibilities. In fact, on the couple's first date five years ago, when both 
were students at Cal State Chico, they joked about how a marriage could make 
her identity a lifetime of laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two began dating seriously, jokes about a possible marriage became 
the subjects of whispered jokes on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be standing right there, and people would be laughing about the 
names," she said. "It really was a small campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really not boring," said Truly Boring. "I can be the life of any party."

FIRE SCORCHES 1,021 ACRES OF BRUSH IN AGUA DULCE; BLAZE: THE WIND'S CHANGING 
DIRECTION AND BREAKS CUT BY FIREFIGHTERS SPARE A MOBILE HOME PARK AND OTHER 
BUILDINGS. NO INJURIES ARE REPORTED. 
</P>

<P>
 As temperatures soared after a week of milder weather, a fast-moving brush 
fire engulfed 1,021 acres Saturday and for a time threatened a mobile home park 
and several other structures in the north county rural community of Agua Dulce. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured, and no structures were damaged by the blaze. But about 350 
county and U.S. Forest Service firefighters were needed to contain the fire as 
winds in excess of 20 m.p.h. helped spread the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the L.A. County Fire Department said a downed power line had 
been found at the site, but that the cause of the fire had not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters kept the blaze from reaching homes in Bee Canyon and a mobile 
home park after clearing away brush by hand and with bulldozers. Nature played 
a hand too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winds are kind of squirrelly here," said Capt. Steve Valenzuela.  
</P>
<P>
 "They can change in either direction. In this case, they helped us by blowing 
the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 By 7 p.m., the fire was 80% contained, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong Santa Ana winds are expected to continue today, which is typical for 
this time of the year, although they will be calmer than they were Saturday, 
said Kris Farnsworth, a meteorologist at Weather Data Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were notified of the fire at 10:08 a.m. Saturday. It started near 
Agua Dulce Canyon Road, about one mile south of the Antelope Valley Freeway -- 
and headed west toward Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway was closed from Via Princessa to Red Rover Mine Road for several 
hours, backing up traffic for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the brush-covered, sparsely populated canyons handled the crisis 
calmly, even as the blaze roared down the west side of Agua Dulce Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Kurich saw the fire coming his way and prepared for an exit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a couple bags packed and had my dog ready to leave," Kurich said. But 
the firefighters' actions reassured him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lit some backfires and when it got down to here, they had all kinds of 
equipment on it," Kurich said. 
</P>
<P>
 His closest neighbor, Stewart East, who lives about a mile down the road, was 
in town having his poodle groomed when the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
 East, an 81-year-old retired movie stand-in, was caught for two hours in the 
tie-up caused by the freeway closure. He reached home about 1 p.m., just as 
fire crews were preparing to defend his property. 
</P>
<P>
 "They assured me that if it did get over the hill, they would come and 
backfire, which they did," East said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really worried that much." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the day's most dramatic incidents involved a county Fire Department 
bulldozer that crawled up and down the rugged ridges east of the freeway 
cutting fire breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the foot of one slope, operator Steve Oldaker came upon a nearly vertical 
slope and couldn't back away from it.  
</P>
<P>
 For the next 20 minutes, with a rapt audience of Fire Department brass, 
sheriff's deputies, camp crews and reporters looking down from the otherwise 
empty freeway, Oldaker used every trick in the bulldozer's repertory to ease 
the giant machine down safely. 
</P>
<P>
 First planting the blade in the dirt, he repeatedly lifted the whole tractor 
into a horizontal position on the blade's hydraulic arms, and then spun the 
steel tracks to cut dirt away from behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Little by little, the loose dirt filled in under the front of the rig, 
building a pad from which to launch the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, asked how steep a grade the tractor can descend, Oldaker said, "That 
was too steep."

SCOTT HARRIS: AT PHIL'S REAL-RETRO DINER, NOSHING AN IDIOT'S MISH MOSH 
</P>

<P>
 "First time here?" the waitress said. "Everybody likes this." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Hong speaks in an accent thick with her native Korea. She pointed at an 
item on the menu called "mish mosh." Here at Phil's Diner, $3.95 will get you 
"home fried potatoes, diced ham, salami, bologna, pastrami, American and Swiss 
cheese, 2 eggs, all scrambled together." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounded tasty, but so did the "idiots' mish mosh." For just 40 cents more, I 
could get a mish mosh "with fresh spinach and fresh mushroom." Now, that's 
health food. As Popeye put it: "I'm strong to de finish, cuz I eat me spinach." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty cents, I figured, was a small price to counteract the cholesterol and 
make my Olive Oyl happy. Now, such reasoning may not survive analysis, but 
clear thinking is difficult when your stomach's grumbling. And it is only now, 
in retrospect, that I understand how this dish got its name. The sound of 
Wendy's voice, calling out the order to her husband, the cook, echoes like an 
insult: 
</P>
<P>
 " Idiot! " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps I should have told Wendy, "Go to hell." But then, she would have just 
served me the "go-to-hell omelet." The go-to-hell might be good, but the idiot 
was downright delectable. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked away in a semi-industrial section of North Hollywood, Phil's Diner is a 
semi-famous semi-secret among the eateries of Los Angeles. In this age of faux 
retro, Phil's doesn't have a phony bone in its body. You'll find it on Chandler 
just east of Lankershim beneath a weather-beaten sign that lost its neon years 
ago. It's a long, narrow, pink place that was built in the 1920s to resemble a 
railroad dining car. 
</P>
<P>
 The history is a little murky, but according to a 14-year-old newspaper 
article displayed on the wall, Phil's first opened for business near the corner 
of Ventura Boulevard and Lankershim before it was relocated for freeway 
construction. Although the location may not be original, just about everything 
else is, from the arched oak-paneled ceiling to the French tile floors. The 
newest thing here might be the late '60s vintage pinball machine that occupies 
a corner, out of order. It's been suggested that the decor was "preserved" by a 
succession of owners. Then again, maybe they were just too cheap to remodel. 
Cracks and cuts in the green vinyl stools have been sutured with masking tape. 
Phil's just reeks of authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood discovered this diner long ago. The morning I dropped by, movie 
makers were scheduled to shoot here in the afternoon. Charles (Phil) Hong, 
whose accent is every bit as thick as his wife's, takes it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of movies made here. 'Hart to Hart,' 'White Shadow,' 'Friday the 13th,' 
'Lou Grant.' " Then he paused and furrowed his brow. "Lou Grant was the actor. 
I don't know the title." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Everly went solo with this diner. On the yellow wall is a framed gatefold 
album cover for the LP "Phil's Diner." The front shows the singer posed 
outside; the back shows him inside the diner. "Customer gave that to me," 
Charles said. "That was before we came." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many little landmarks of commerce, Phil's sells its own T-shirts. The 
slogan seems a bit off. "Extra ordinarily fine food," it says. Do you think 
they meant extraordinarily ? 
</P>
<P>
 Charles acquired his business and his nickname 18 years ago, shortly after he 
and his wife immigrated to Los Angeles. Every Monday through Saturday, they 
rise and buy fresh vegetables on their way from their West Hills home to the 
diner, serving a loyal following of customers who live and work nearby. They 
also get a steady stream of first-timers like me, who've been intrigued by word 
of mouth or Phil's occasional press clippings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friendliest Heartburn" is how the L.A. Weekly summed up Phil's in its annual 
"Best of L.A." issue. "The signs -- and even the window shades -- hark back to 
the '40s, and are seasoned with a fine patina of grime," the Weekly wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 "Phil's remains the well-kept secret of truckers, plumbers, auto mechanics and 
movie-studio techs. . . . The minute regulars walk through the door, 
ingredients for their usual orders hit the stove . . . all without anyone 
saying a word. It's that kind of place." 
</P>
<P>
 David George, 26, and Kris Olin, 22, vouched for that. For six months, they'd 
been coming two or three times a week from their lunch break in their computer 
accounting classes at Singer Business College. "We only have 25 minutes for 
lunch, and the food's excellent. It's fast food, but it's like home food," Olin 
explained. "He knows what all his customers want." 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Weekly captured the spirit, but there was one problem. Determined to 
chronicle L.A.'s best over a 24-hour time period, the Weekly recommended the 
diner for the 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. time slot. Actually, Phil's doesn't open until 9 
a.m. It closes at 3 p.m. And it's been that way for a long, long time. 
</P>
<P>
 The quirkiness of the hours serves the Hongs' lifestyle. When they took over 
Phil's, its hours were 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., but, as Wendy explained, they couldn't 
get the kids ready for school and buy fresh vegetables at the same time. Now 
the kids are grown, but the Hongs, after 28 years of marriage, seem set in 
their ways. Located just a few blocks from the theaters and coffeehouses of 
North Hollywood's touted NoHo Art District, Phil's could probably do decent 
business over longer hours, but the Hongs seem content with the way things are. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles, who'll turn 60 in a few months, figures he'll keep at it a few more 
years. But if the right person walks through the door . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to imagine Bohemian night crawlers lined up in the wee hours 
waiting for seats at the counter. After all, you can't get Phil's steak 
sandwich at Eagles or Insomnia or the Boom Boom Room. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not hard to imagine Phil's getting too hip for its own good. 
Popularity ruins a lot of good things. 
</P>
<P>
 I was finishing my second cup of coffee when another customer walked in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, long time no see," Charles called out. "Idiot?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was right.

LOOK WHAT WIND BLEW IN: SUMMER; WEATHER: SANTA ANAS SEND TEMPERATURES INTO THE 
MID- TO HIGH 90S. HEAT, BLUSTERY CONDITIONS SHOULD ABATE BY TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Santa Ana winds blanketed the region with oven-like heat Saturday, Orange 
County lifeguards reported crowds rivaling summer weekdays, while people at an 
inland carnival sweated in the sizzling sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The high temperature in Santa Ana, 96, tied the city's record high set in 
1951. Lake Forest was the hottest spot in the county with a high of 98. 
Elsewhere, the mercury reached 93 in San Juan Capistrano, and lifeguards in 
Newport Beach reported temperatures in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have the Santa Ana winds blowing, that's what's causing the heat," said 
meteorologist Kris Farnsworth of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times. Farnsworth said a high-pressure system over Nevada and Utah was 
causing northeast winds blowing through the deserts and over the mountains to 
the Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Farnsworth predicted more of the same today. Tuesday will probably bring the 
first real relief from the hot wind and sun, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, beach-goers enjoyed a summer-like day, with crowds of about 75,000 
in Newport Beach and 20,000 in Huntington Beach, lifeguards said. The water 
temperature was about 70 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Inland, the warm winds were causing some annoyance for the Orange Police 
Department, where officers investigated more than 30 alarms from home-security 
systems that officers said were triggered by high winds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the annual Tustin Tiller Days festival, the miniature ponies had 
to stop their merry-go-round duties for a long afternoon break because of the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, all the farm animals -- a couple of goats and sheep, a rooster, geese 
and a potbellied pig -- lay on their sides, spent, as a trickle of visitors 
entered the small petting zoo.  
</P>
<P>
 Everyone was sweating at the carnival fund-raiser, where dozens of nonprofit 
groups, most from schools, hawked food, drink and other goods to a jovial 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the theme of the festival was intended to hark back to the community's 
farming roots, it was a typical '90s harvest: burgers, hot dogs, nachos, fries, 
cotton candy and plenty of soft drinks. The only remnants of the city's actual 
"tiller days" were farm animals, a pumpkin patch and the bales of hay that 
teen-agers squatted on to watch the live entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a farming community -- believe it or not, it was. This is our 
heritage," fair organizer Linda Andrews said.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I first moved here in 1972 I'd come from my parents house on 17th street 
and I'd pass five orange groves. Now it's six traffic lights. It's amazing what 
happened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Incorporated in 1868, Tustin was full of farms until a few decades ago. Now, 
59,750 people live among the housing tracts and office buildings, but a 
small-town feel remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came when our kids were smaller. Now we're coming with our grandkids," 
said Dennis Mallon, 60, who stood near the petting zoo while his wife visited 
the palm reader and his 12-year-old grandson rode the rides.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On one stage at the fair, girls in pink and white lace and leotards danced to 
soft music, while a sextet of young men sang a cappella on the other side of 
the park.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, throngs of cheering teen-agers from local high schools collected 
trophies for their performance in the morning parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Range, a 15-year-old who performed in the parade, sipped a frozen drink 
as she toted a massive white and purple stuffed animal that she won for her 
brother by tossing a dime onto a plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning," Range said when asked what she likes best about the fair.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like winning -- it's great. Whether it's winning a trophy (in the parade) 
or winning a bear for your little brother. Winning."

<P>
 Tern trek--Take a guided walk on the wild side of the San Joaquin Wildlife 
Sanctuary today at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Sea & Sage Audubon Society of Orange County, the tour will 
wind around five freshwater ponds at the sanctuary. A naturalist will be on 
hand to identify wildlife and plants of the area and answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary is among the finest bird-watching sites in 
the county. Likely sightings include a variety of herons, egrets and other 
waterfowl, and at this time of year migrant species are also likely to be 
wintering in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Since birds are also in various stages of plumage, this tour will be 
especially helpful for beginning and intermediate birders who would like 
assistance in identifying different species. 
</P>
<P>
 During the tour, participants will also learn about marshland flora and fauna, 
how the marsh was formed and how it continues to exist in the middle of 
urbanized Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations are not necessary. Beginning to advanced bird-watchers are 
welcome, but the program is open to adults only. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the Audubon House, where the walk will start, take the San Diego 
Freeway to the Jamboree Road exit and head south. Turn left at Michelson Drive, 
and then make a right at the second signal onto Irvine Ranch Water District 
property. Follow the paved road and "Duck Club" signs to the house. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the Sea & Sage chapter office at (714) 261-7963.

VALLEY BRIEFING: AUTUMN LEAVES; THE VALLEY VERSION OF FALL'S COLOR SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley may not look like New England in the fall, but it has 
enough to satisfy leaf peepers. Fall color is the result of ample city planting 
of deciduous trees (those that shed leaves) and the existence of a few native 
species in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The region isn't cold or wet enough to harbor a large variety, but the trees 
that are here thrive along streams in mountain canyons and sunny neighborhood 
parkways. Triggered by cool weather and less sunlight, native trees such as 
sycamores and cottonwoods and ornamentals such as liquidambar trees and Modesto 
ash light up in fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is no need to worry about loss of these trees after last year's 
firestorms. Because the deciduous variety prefers stream-side habitat, not many 
were lost. Most had shed their leaves by November, so the fires inflicted only 
superficial damage. Why Leaves Change Color 
</P>
<P>
 All leaves contain pigments that cause yellow, orange and red colors. For much 
of the year these are masked by chlorophyll, the primary light-catching pigment 
that accounts for the green color of plants. With shorter days and cooler 
nights, chlorophyll breaks down and these "accessory" pigments take over. 
</P>
<P>
 Pigments and the colors they cause: 
</P>
<P>
 * Green: From chlorophyll 
</P>
<P>
 * Yellow: From xanthophyll 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange-red: From carotene 
</P>
<P>
 * Red and purple: From anthocyanin What Triggers the Change? 
</P>
<P>
 1. Phytochrome is a light-detecting pigment that cues the leaf when the days 
get shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Chlorophyll begins to break down and the leaf loses its food-making 
capability. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Accessory pigments take over, helping to trap light and funnel it to 
chlorophyll. 
</P>
<P>
 4. As leaves change color, nutrients are pumped back into the tree trunk and 
roots, where they are stored until spring. Food-Making Leaf 
</P>
<P>
 Through photosynthesis, the leaf captures energy from sunlight and turns it 
into food. 
</P>
<P>
 * Blade has green food-making cells and is where photosynthesis occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Veins carry food and water, as well as support the blade. 
</P>
<P>
 * Petiole contains tubes that carry water to the leaf and carry away food made 
by the leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 ** A leaf can no longer make food after chlorophyll breaks down. The leaf 
falls from the tree when a corky layer forms across the leaf stalk. Local Color 
</P>
<P>
 Opportunities to see deciduous trees changing color around the Valley are best 
where trees have been plante. Some colorful areas: 
</P>
<P>
 * West Valley: Warner Center poplars turn yellow. Brilliant red liquidambar 
(sweet gum) trees can be found on Lindley Avenue from Reseda into Northridge. 
Modesto ash turns yellow along Winnetka Avenue from Oxnard Street to Victory 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * East Valley: A mix of older trees, mostly maples but also liquidambar, ash 
and sycamores, predominate. North Hollywood is home to colorful red and silver 
maples. A two-block stretch of Killion Street, from Tilden east, has many 
liquidambar trees. Colorful Natives 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few tree species that turn bright exist in the area. Best places to see 
autumn displays are in the Santa Monica Mountains, especially Malibu Creek, 
Tapia Park, Sycamore Canyon and Solstice Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cottonwood 
</P>
<P>
 "Fremont" type prefers wet soil along streams, turns bright yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sycamore 
</P>
<P>
 "Western" or "California" type is found along streams in foothills and 
mountains. Its leaves are large and turn gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley oak 
</P>
<P>
 Reaches its southern extent in rolling hilly areas of the Santa Monicas. Its 
large, lobed leaves turn light golden brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Big-leaf maple 
</P>
<P>
 Fairly uncommon, found in Santa Monicas along streams. Its leaves turn yellow 
and orange.

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; EL 
TORO AIRPORT BACKERS SURE NOT USING AIR MAIL FOR CAMPAIGN DISCLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dollar politics: Want to know how much the proponents of an airport at El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station have spent on their campaign? Or better yet, how far 
they have gone into debt? 
</P>
<P>
 You won't be able to find out until Tuesday. Campaign treasurer Dana Reed said 
backers of Measure A on the Nov. 8 ballot purposely mailed their latest 
campaign finance report at 5 p.m. last Wednesday--the filing deadline--hoping 
that it wouldn't arrive at the registrar of voters' office until Tuesday. 
(County offices have a four-day weekend.) "We would rather not have stories 
about the money," Reed said, adding that he would prefer to read reports about 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Measure A, meanwhile, continued to rely heavily on South County 
retirees to finance their campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A asks voters to amend the county's General Plan to designate El Toro 
for civil aviation and other related purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 More dizzy dollars: Other highlights from campaign finance reports that did 
arrive: 
</P>
<P>
 * More than half of the $183,796 raised by the Orange County GOP between July 
1 and Sept. 30 came from Texas: $83,000 from Houston businessman Roy M. 
Huffington, the father of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Huffington; and 
$25,000 from Contran Corp., which is controlled by Dallas financier Harold C. 
Simmons. The Lincoln Club of Orange County also gave $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jim Morrissey, the Republican candidate in the 69th Assembly District race, 
listed among his largest donors: the conservative Allied Business PAC, which 
gave $50,000; the Lincoln Club, which contributed $40,000; and the business 
owned by state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove), which contributed a phone bank 
operation valued at $27,500. 
</P>
<P>
 * Morrissey's Democratic opponent, Mike Metzler, isn't too far behind in the 
fund-raising race. Major donors include: the Assn. of California School 
Administrators, which gave $5,000; and the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee, which donated $2,500. Major contributors since the start of the 
campaign include former Orange County Democratic Party Chairman Howard Adler, 
who gave $16,562; and the California Teachers Assn., which donated a total of 
$12,500. 
</P>
<P>
 * Votes on Waste 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's congressmen don't always agree on what's wasteful spending. 
According to the nonpartisan Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, in 
37 key votes from Sept. 1, 1993, to Aug. 21, 1994, the local delegation made 
several choices deemed by the organization to be against the interests of 
taxpayers. Still, two had ratings better than 80%, making them eligible for a 
"Taxpayers' Hero" award. How they rated: 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Royce (R-Fullerton): 86.1% 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach): 83.8% 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach): 75.0% 
</P>
<P>
 Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove): 74.3% 
</P>
<P>
 Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar): 70.3% 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Packard (R-Oceanside): 62.2.%

 Tails from the trail: It was bound to happen sooner or later, and it did--to 
Westminster Municipal Judge Daniel C. Dutcher. While out campaigning, he 
knocked on the door of a Huntington Beach home and a dog--an American 
terrier--bolted through the screen door's metal grille. Dutcher was knocked 
down and bitten on the leg. It was a bloody sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The folks were so contrite about the whole thing that they swore they were 
going to vote for me," Dutcher said. "I don't know if I have enough blood to 
get elected that way." UPCOMING EVENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday: Last day to register to vote in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday: A $150-per-person fund-raiser for Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden 
Grove) will take place at the Hyatt Regency in Irvine, 17900 Jamboree Road, 
beginning at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday: "Women for (Jim) Silva," in the 2nd Supervisorial District race, 
hosts a reception at the Waterfront Hilton, Huntington Beach, from 5:30 to 7:30 
p.m. Admission is $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday: Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Huffington is the featured 
speaker at the Orange County Forum at noon, Le Meridien Hotel, 4500 MacArthur 
Blvd., Newport Beach. Tickets are $35 at the door. 
</P>
<P>

FIRE AT CAMP PENDLETON BLACKENS 150 ACRES BEFORE BEING CONTAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fanned by hot Santa Ana winds, a fire that broke out in a rural canyon near 
Fallbrook raced across the Marine base Saturday afternoon, burning 150 acres of 
mostly dry brush, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke from the fire, thought to be sparked by an electrical wire in Duluth 
Canyon, could be seen across South County in skies that had been blown clear by 
strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire started about 1:30 p.m. outside the base and quickly consumed about 
50 acres, California Department of Forestry Capt. Jack McKee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fanned by the Santa Ana winds, the flames leaped onto the base, blackening 
another 100 acres before the fire was contained about 6 p.m., McKee said. No 
structures were burned. 
</P>
<P>
 At the fire's height, six air tankers, four helicopters, 15 engines and more 
than 200 firefighters from the California Department of Forestry, Camp 
Pendleton and five local agencies fought the blaze, McKee said. No injuries 
were reported.

2 DIE IN SEPARATE TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two people were killed Saturday in separate traffic accidents in Valencia and 
Saugus, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 3 p.m. in Valencia, a 40-year-old woman died when the car in 
which she was a passenger was rear-ended by another vehicle and burst into 
flames on the northbound Golden State Freeway near Valencia Boulevard, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was identified as Barbara Moore of Pacoima. The driver, Edward 
Clayton, 44, apparently noticed he had a flat tire and was trying to pull onto 
the right shoulder at 2 m.p.h. when the vehicle was hit, a CHP spokeswoman 
said. Clayton and the driver of the second car were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour later in Saugus, motorist Michael Murphy, 18, of Saugus was 
killed after speeding his car through a red light at Seco Canyon Road and 
Decoro Drive, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's vehicle collided head-on with a second car, struck a telephone pole 
and flipped over, sheriff's deputies said. The driver of the second car, Kari 
Liekkio, 56, of Aqua Dulce suffered bruises and passenger Marcia Liekko, 54, 
suffered a possible injured neck, authorities said. Both were also taken to 
Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital.

4 KILLED, 7 HURT IN SERIES OF CAR CRASHES; ACCIDENTS: THREE SEPARATE INCIDENTS 
ON SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FREEWAYS OCCUR WITHIN 15 MINUTES EARLY SATURDAY MORNING.

 Four people died and seven people were injured in a series of accidents that 
happened within minutes of each other on San Fernando Valley freeways early 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bad morning," said Brian Humphrey, spokesman for the Los Angeles 
Fire Department. "There was no rhyme or reason" to the accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious of the three accidents occurred at 1:23 a.m. Three people 
were killed on the eastbound Ventura Freeway east of Cahuenga Boulevard in 
Toluca Lake when their 1991 Honda Accord slammed into a dump truck parked in 
the fast lane, according to Sgt. Michael Lincoln of the California Highway 
Patrol. The victims, all residents of Pasadena, were identified as Kevork 
Yeghiayan, 23, his sister Izabella Yeghiayan, 21, and Kristine Balikian, 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP said Kevork Yeghiayan was driving at speeds of 75 to 90 m.p.h. Lincoln 
said he did not know what caused the vehicle to veer off course into a coned 
construction area in the two left lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact tore off the roof and the left front portion of the vehicle, 
Lincoln said. The car breached the cone line and caromed off the center divider 
into the dump truck, Lincoln said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three minutes later in Sylmar, on the transition from the eastbound Simi 
Valley Freeway to the westbound Foothill Freeway, a carload of teen-agers went 
off the road, up an embankment and into a light pole, killing one youth and 
injuring six. 
</P>
<P>
 Driver Javier Perez, 16, of Pacoima, died in the accident, while his six 
passengers, all 15 to 16 years old, suffered minor to moderate injuries, 
according to Lincoln. The three male and three female passengers, who were not 
identified, were from Pacoima, Sylmar, Arleta and North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver had the odor of alcohol," Lincoln said. The injured teen-agers, 
who suffered cuts and bruises, were treated at area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lastly, at 1:38 a.m., a 22-year-old man was critically injured after his 
pickup truck rear-ended a tractor-trailer on the southbound Golden State 
Freeway, south of Van Nuys Boulevard. The victim, whose name was not available, 
was trapped in the wreckage. It took 20 firefighters using the "Jaws of Life" 
nearly 15 minutes to extricate the man, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the crash is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department arrived before the CHP, which was delayed in getting to 
the scene because of the unusual confluence of accidents, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who suffered massive multiple trauma injuries, was taken to Holy 
Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where he was listed in critical 
condition on Saturday afternoon. Health supervisor Chris Marsh said his 
condition deteriorated during the day.

6,000 VOLUNTEERS TURN OUT TO MAKE VALLEY 'SPARKLE'; POLICE: ANNUAL 
ANTI-GRAFFITI EFFORT EXPANDS WITH HOUSECLEANING FOR THE SICK, ELDERLY. OTHER 
LAPD BUREAUS JOIN IN THE DRIVE.

 Armed with brooms and paint rollers, a battalion of volunteers launched a 
full-scale assault on graffiti in the San Fernando Valley on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northridge, children wearing "Operation Sparkle" T-shirts swept the 
streets, painted out graffiti and picked up garbage as part of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's fifth annual campaign to clean up the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidence of graffiti has decreased by 50% in the Valley during the past 
several years, thanks to Operation Sparkle and other LAPD anti-graffiti 
programs, according to Senior Lead Officer Sally Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make a tremendous difference," said Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy, 
commanding officer of the Valley Bureau. "There are many city streets that you 
drive through that used to be covered in graffiti that are now graffiti-free." 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department estimated that more than 6,000 residents turned out to 
volunteer to clean up at locations throughout the Valley. Last year, Pomeroy 
said, workers collected 220 tons of trash and painted over tens of thousands of 
square feet of graffiti. This year, for the first time, volunteers cleaned the 
homes of the elderly or infirm. 
</P>
<P>
 This is also the first year that the program, which began in the Valley, has 
gone citywide. The LAPD's South Bureau held its cleanup last Saturday, and the 
West and Central bureaus will have theirs Saturday and Oct. 22, respectively. 
All Operation Sparkle volunteers are invited to a crime prevention and safety 
festival Oct. 29, when the Police Department will celebrate the conclusion of 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members Richard Alarcon, Laura Chick, Joel Wachs and Zev 
Yaroslavsky donned Operation Sparkle T-shirts and pitched in for the cleanup. 
At a news conference, they thanked the volunteers for coming out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Operation Sparkle has become more than an effort to clean the community," 
Yaroslavsky said. "It's also been an exciting vehicle to involve people in 
their communities." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an educational process for our kids," said Alarcon. "It's teaching 
them to be better community participants." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Kids who swept and picked up trash near the news conference site, near the 
corner of Malden Street and Canby Avenue in Northridge, said they were glad to 
lend a hand in beautifying their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a real nice time helping and stuff," said Laurel Hamer, 12. "Since 
everybody got together to help, it was more fun."

EXPERTS DIVIDED OVER OUTCOME OF BATTLE TO BEAT MEDFLY; INFESTATION: MOST 
SPECIALISTS APPROVE OF VENTURA COUNTY'S ATTACK ON THE MENACE SO FAR. THEY 
DIFFER SHARPLY, HOWEVER, WHEN IT COMES TO PREDICTING RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fruit will be quarantined. Fields will be sprayed. Flies will be trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 But will Ventura County ever be rid of the dreaded Medfly? 
</P>
<P>
 That question has sent bug experts from across the state buzzing to their file 
cabinets as they root through case histories from the past 15 years in search 
of battle plans and crystal balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Medfly specialists approve of the county's attack so far -- the intensive 
trapping efforts, the quarantine on fruit grown near the infestation, the plans 
for aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion. They differ sharply, however, 
when it comes to predicting results. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimists believe Ventura County will slide out of the crisis quickly, with 
minimal damage, by killing every last Mediterranean fruit fly in the next half 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident that we (can) achieve eradication," said Douglas Hendrix, 
spokesman for a joint state and federal task force charged with battling the 
Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 With prompt action, "Ventura County will be in and out of this infestation 
rather quickly," agreed Greg Van Wassenhove, agricultural commissioner for 
Santa Clara County, who said he has seen eradication programs "work very well 
here. The Medfly is something we can deal with."  
</P>
<P>
 Bleakly, other experts dismiss such bullish assurances. 
</P>
<P>
 In their grim view, Ventura County is doomed to suffer wave after wave of 
infestation during the next few decades. This devastating cycle could 
ultimately crush the county's agricultural industry, worth $848 million in crop 
sales alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the counties that have been infested, there has never, never, never 
been one that was dis-infested," warns Jim Carey, a professor of entomology at 
the University of California at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a creeping fungus that continually moves to expand its range, yard by 
yard, property by property," Carey said. "It's a cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers, scientists, environmentalists and bureaucrats have all studied the 
Medfly since its first appearance in Southern California in 1975. They have 
tracked the blue-eyed pests from feast to feast, battling the fruit-gobbling 
insects along a trail stretching from Santa Clara to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all their research, they have failed to reach consensus on three key 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 How does the Medfly flit from county to county? 
</P>
<P>
 How well do eradication programs work? 
</P>
<P>
 And how can bug zappers vanquish the voracious insects without harming the 
people who live nearby? 
</P>
<P>
 Spot eradication programs have won praise in half a dozen counties. A 
combination of quarantines, aerial and ground spraying, and the release of 
sterilized Medflies winnows the pest population dramatically -- for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 But as soon as state officials declare, triumphantly, that they have achieved 
"eradication," the Medfly crops up again elsewhere. Like the plastic gophers in 
county fair games, which sink under a hammer blow to the head and then pop up 
grinning in an adjacent hole, the Medfly seems invincible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1990, for example, officials said they had succeeded in 
banishing the voracious pest from Southern California. Just one year later, a 
pregnant Medfly was discovered in a peach tree near Koreatown in Los Angeles. 
An intensive trapping effort uncovered 200 more Medflies in the area by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medfly's uncanny survival skill taunts activists like Lisabeth Hush, who 
suffered eye irritation, accelerated heartbeat and other symptoms during the 
1989 malathion spraying over the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Hush believes that the government's Medfly policies do not work. And she 
considers the ballyhooed eradication plans more show than substance. The 
spraying may prove to Japanese trading partners that California is tough on 
pests, she says, but it does not conquer the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no entomology in California," Hush said. "It's all based on 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal officials bristle at such charges. They insist that they can 
-- and do -- eradicate the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, they say, is that the Medfly is constantly reintroduced, despite 
the strict quarantines. Tourists may smuggle in maggot-ridden tomatoes from 
Central America. Hawaiians may send fly-infested papayas to their relatives in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's all it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, the fast-breeding critters can produce enough offspring to 
spark another Medfly crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing makes me madder than people bringing fruit back from Hawaii," said 
Deena Gerry, whose family has tended a citrus grove near Camarillo since the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Will Gerry, added: "People pick up mangoes in Hawaii, stuff them into 
their suitcases, and then when they get home and open them they say, 'Eeew, 
look at these bugs' and throw them in the trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless infested produce is double-bagged, sealed and placed in covered 
containers, the maggots can crawl out and begin breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the state and the federal governments try to prevent such accidental 
infestations by policing quarantine boundaries to be sure no one illegally 
transports fruit from a Medfly zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruit-sniffing beagles at Los Angeles International Airport and the Port of 
Long Beach inspect baggage in an effort to root out contraband and enforce the 
1,500-square-mile quarantine zone that spans four counties in the Los Angeles 
Basin. In the past, federal officials have even launched sting operations at 
local post offices to check for fruit smuggled in parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Far from such traditional ports of entry, Ventura County's quarantine covers 
86 square miles surrounding "ground zero" -- the low-slung fig tree on the 
grounds of St. John's Seminary in Camarillo where the first two Medflies were 
discovered Sept. 29. Most crops within the zone, including citrus and avocados, 
must be treated before shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar quarantine, combined with aggressive aerial spraying, squashed the 
Medfly threat in just six months in Riverside County earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the quarantine caused some penny-pinching, farmers bounced back 
remarkably well. Drawing on their experiences, they now seek to reassure 
Ventura County's growers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were much more concerned than we needed to be," Riverside County farmer 
Charles Colladay said. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of Colladay's 2,000-acre ranch landed in the quarantine zone, which 
radiated from the city of Corona. He was able to treat the quarantined produce 
with malathion for about $60 an acre -- a price tag which covered five 
applications of the pesticide, timed to kill each emerging generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a scary thing when we went into it . . . but things just went like 
clockwork," Colladay said. A firm believer that Medflies can be conquered, 
Colladay praised the state's eradication program with a simple endorsement: "It 
works."  
</P>
<P>
 But the Riverside method -- eight aerial sprays, separated by six to 10 days 
-- remains highly controversial. Environmentalists and city officials raised a 
ruckus in Corona, even going to court in an unsuccessful attempt to block the 
malathion sprays. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Noel Otten, research director for the Burbank-based anti-spraying group Action 
Now, said he believes bureaucrats "have an agenda to falsely reassure the 
public about malathion." 
</P>
<P>
 A brace of scientific studies, though, backs the official word that malathion 
is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 A common back-yard pesticide, malathion does not cause cancer or birth defects 
and poses "no significant health hazard," according to the state Department of 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
 It does, however, carry a significant price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cooperative Medfly Project, a task force funded by state and federal tax 
dollars, spent $100 million from 1980 to 1982 to wipe out the Medfly in Santa 
Clara County. The group revived the same strategy seven years later to battle 
Medflies in the Los Angeles Basin, at a cost of $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the aerial spraying was declared effective in 1990, the Medflies 
popped up again just a year later. This time, political opposition blocked the 
aerial application of malathion bait, a potent substance that tricks adult 
insects into drinking poison by lacing the pesticide with sweet corn syrup  
</P>
<P>
 Without aerial sprays, the latest Los Angeles Basin eradication effort relies 
on the release of more than 400 million sterile Medflies each week. Officials 
hope the sterile insects will mate with fertile Medflies in fruitless couplings 
that will thin the ranks of future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The sterile fly program, plus routine trapping and quarantine enforcement, 
cost $26 million last year. And it seems to be working -- the number of flies 
found in the Los Angeles Basin has plummeted, from about 400 last year to just 
seven so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything seems to have calmed down a lot because of the sterile fly 
releases," said Bob Wyatt, legislative director for the Orange County Farm 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 But sterile fly labs in Hawaii and Guatemala are working at full capacity to 
meet demands for the Los Angeles Basin. And state officials have expressed 
doubt that any sterile flies will be available for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by such roadblocks, entomologist Carey has called for an "AIDS-like 
research program to come up with a long-term approach to dealing with the 
Medfly problem." 
</P>
<P>
 While most agricultural officials continue to hope that the Medfly can be 
wiped out with spot eradication efforts, Carey insists that the pest has become 
firmly established in Southern California. He forecasts continual, costly 
battles against the pest -- battles that could sink some farmers and trigger a 
much-feared Asian boycott of California produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Ventura County find is absolutely predictable," he said. "We're lurching 
from outbreak to outbreak here. . . . We have got to develop and implement a 
major research program to supplement our brush-fire approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing isn't the flu; it's a cancer. So we can't just treat the symptoms 
-- we have to go after the disease itself." Increasing Numbers

MAN KILLED WHEN VAN HITS VEHICLE ON FAIRVIEW STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One man was killed late Friday when a van collided with another vehicle as the 
van's driver tried to change lanes on South Fairview Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The van's driver, 28-year-old Antonio Camacho of Santa Ana, was arrested on 
suspicion of felony drunk driving and suspicion of manslaughter, Sgt. Eric 
Vedborg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who had not been identified Saturday, was riding in a 1974 Ford 
van that was traveling north when Camacho tried to change lanes in the 1300 
block of South Fairview shortly before midnight, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The van struck the other vehicle, which was traveling in the same direction, 
and then crashed into a light pole, Vedborg said. No one in the other vehicle 
was injured.

MAN DIES OF SMOKE, FIREFIGHTER INJURED IN COSTA MESA BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 44-year-old man died of smoke inhalation and a local firefighter was injured 
early Saturday when a fire, sparked by an apparent electrical short, destroyed 
a single-family home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the house at 3032 Killybrooke Lane might have been burning 
for some time in the pre-dawn hours before neighbors awoke and alerted 
authorities at 5:06 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose identity was not released pending notification of relatives, 
was found near the entrance to one of the bedrooms, away from the suspected 
flash point of the blaze.He died shortly after arriving at Hoag Memorial 
Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Mark Brown said the fire might have been started by a malfunctioning 
living room lamp. It spread to the dining room and kitchen before racing 
through the rest of the three-bedroom structure. 
</P>
<P>
 When firefighters arrived, they found 50% of the home fully engulfed in flames 
and heavy smoke pouring from the windows. Brown said the fire burned so 
intensely that one firefighter suffered second-degree burns on his wrists and 
legs without ever being touched by flames. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze was brought under control in 12 minutes. But Brown said the fire 
might have gone unnoticed by neighbors because it broke out before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't too many people walking around at that hour," Brown said, adding 
that damage to the home was estimated at $200,000.

NATURE, INDUSTRY TRY TO COEXIST; ENVIRONMENT: PACT THAT SET UP A WILDLIFE 
PRESERVE IN EXCHANGE FOR LAND USE RIGHTS IS HAILED BY SOME AS A PROTOTYPE. BUT 
OTHERS CALL IT A FLAWED DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Southwestern Kern County is not the kind of land that inspires poets, at least 
not during the day at the end of a dry summer. It is flatland scrub with 
six-foot-tall saltbushes and stunted grass. The mighty Kern River, far from its 
source, is dry bed. About the only thing moving is the water in the concrete 
sluice of the nearby California Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
 But within this region lies a 6,000-acre patch between Interstate 5 and Elk 
Hills that is prime habitat for wildlife, including several endangered species. 
Moreover, it is the site of a unique example of how endangered species and 
business -- in this case the oil industry -- can coexist and even flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 In a landmark 1992 agreement with the state, Arco Western Energy agreed to set 
aside the land and create a wildlife area, called Coles Levee Ecosystem 
Preserve. In exchange, the company received the right to explore for oil and 
gas on other land. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco and the state have been highly praised for the arrangement. Last week, 
the Coles Levee preserve received a 1994 Innovations in State and Local 
Government Award from the Ford Foundation and Harvard University -- one of the 
nation's most prestigious public service prizes. And the project has been 
singled out by the Clinton Administration as a novel approach to implementing a 
law that has become increasingly controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, including some environmentalists, have criticized it as a 
flawed deal that may set a bad precedent for future environmental efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kern County is no stranger to the Endangered Species Act. This is, after all, 
the place where a Chinese-bamboo farmer got his $50,000 tractor seized by the 
U.S. government for killing five kangaroo rats. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the same rat -- the Tipton kangaroo rat -- as well as the blunt-nosed 
leopard lizard, San Joaquin kit fox and a dozen other endangered animals and 
plants that figure to benefit from the state's deal with Arco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither the state nor the feds have the resources to police all the 
activities of Arco and other companies when it comes to endangered species," 
said Ron Rempel, a conservation planner with the state Department of Fish and 
Game. "So we've come up with a framework that meets the needs of both the 
environment and business." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Coles Levee preserve is a welcome end, environmental groups say, 
the state cut a weak deal with Arco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time land is set aside for wildlife we're pleased," said Mark Palmer, of 
the Mountain Lion Foundation, an environmental group. "But as far as Arco is 
concerned, it's business as usual on that land." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a New York transplant who was instrumental in getting the state and 
Arco to move on the idea of a preserve back in 1987. Alison Sheehey Cunningham 
said her activism was spawned one night while fishing in the Coles Levee area 
with her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had gone out there to clear my mind and all of a sudden there were these 
kangaroo rats with big bushy tails and big eyes hopping all over my feet. Then 
an opossum came up and stared right at me and then a raccoon came up and leaned 
on me. It was a magical experience." 
</P>
<P>
 During one of her daytime visits, Cunningham stumbled upon two hawks shot 
dead. Over the next month, she found more than two dozen dead or wounded raptor 
birds. The handiwork of humans was everywhere, she said. The dry stream beds 
had been damaged by off-road motorcyclists. Mesquite and cottonwood trees had 
been felled, one with a great blue heron nest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I got to know the land, the madder and madder I became," Cunningham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined the local Audubon Society and organized a meeting between state and 
federal regulators. Then she called Arco. "I told them they've got this great 
land here and they've got to save it. They were open and receptive to the 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Rempel, a 22-year veteran with the state Fish and Game, took over negotiations 
from there. He reminded Arco officials that their oil and gas production 
activities likely violated state and federal endangered species laws. At the 
same time, Rempel realized that his department -- lacking policing resources -- 
was hardly in a position to guarantee that future harm was not going to be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 To reconcile these two realities, Rempel came up with the idea of a 
"mitigation bank" or credit system, a staple of air pollution regulation. Arco 
would assign its 6,000-acre Coles Levee land to the state and establish a 
wildlife preserve, which the company would be in charge of monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the company would be allowed to continue existing operations on 
the land as long as it remained sensitive to the environment. In addition, Arco 
would receive 6,600 acres of mitigation credits, which could be applied to 
habitat elsewhere in the region that the company wanted to drill, bypassing the 
usual red tape. And if it wanted, Arco could sell the credits to builders or 
developers whose projects in the region would result in the destruction of 
endangered species habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists argue that too much was given to Arco and that the deal sets 
an unhealthy precedent for Chevron USA and others negotiating their own 
mitigation deals with the government. And they worry that the credits could be 
sold to a developer wanting to take land rich in another species. Each habitat, 
they point out, is unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid this is the government's easy way of getting out of the endangered 
species business," said Mary Griffen of the Kern County Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Wheeler, head of the state resources agency, disagrees. "This is a 
pioneering effort that integrates environmental and economic interests. It's 
been so well received that we're looking to apply the model statewide."

BIOLOGIST DEFIES EXPECTATIONS; ACADEMIA: CALTECH ASSISTANT PROFESSOR'S AGE, 31, 
AND AREA OF EXPERTISE, NEUROSCIENCE, HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO SURPRISE SOME PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The ticket agent at Los Angeles International Airport looked skeptically at 
Erin Margaret Schuman. Schuman's tickets had her title as Dr. and standing 
before the agent was a woman much younger than the average college professor. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old assistant professor at Caltech is used to that look, used to 
people thinking that someone so young, especially if that someone is a woman, 
couldn't possibly hold a doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one ever believes I'm a professor," said Schuman, who teaches biology and 
was on her way to a neurobiology conference in Israel. "They'll see the word 
doctor, look at me and think it's a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 But all Schuman has to do is turn to her microscope and describe how the 
transference of nitric oxide between neurons in a rat's brain affects memory to 
persuade nonbelievers that she is, indeed, Dr. Schuman. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuman received her Ph.D. in neuroscience from Princeton University in 1990 
and joined Caltech last year as the biology department's youngest faculty 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with teaching introductory neurobiology this fall, Schuman is 
researching a number of ways in which information is processed and stored in 
the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of eight assistants and five grants, ranging from $30,000 to 
$350,000, Schuman will continue to explore the human body's most mysterious 
organ. 
</P>
<P>
 By studying live tissue from the hippocampus region of the brain, where memory 
activity takes place, Schuman is trying to learn more about illnesses such as 
Alzheimer's disease and attention deficit disorder, which hinder a person's 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Schuman is tracking how far nitric oxide can travel between 
neurons before it is metabolized by other chemicals and what effect that 
relationship -- between the gas and surrounding neurons -- has on long-term 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-proclaimed perfectionist, Schuman is intent on understanding the 
elusive nature of memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being an artist; I'm consumed by my work. I think and dream about 
my experiments all the time," she said. "My mood is completely determined by 
what happened in the lab that day." 
</P>
<P>
 Schuman did not explore her interest in biology until graduate school but was 
always an intense student. She used to get migraine headaches from the 
self-imposed pressure to achieve perfect grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuman's mother, Susan, who lives in Fullerton, called her daughter "a 
compulsive learner. I was concerned about her, because anything less than an A 
devastated her. I just wanted her to relax," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuman's office windowsill is lined with papers about such topics as 
farnesyltransferase inhibitors, while a pink and black Mickey Mouse hat sits 
conspicuously on the shelves behind her desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a young, successful scientist has had its disadvantages, Schuman says. 
"I didn't get to do the Europe thing," she said about the common post-college 
adventure. At this point, she said, she often feels lucky just to get a weekend 
away from the lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "But someday, when people ask me why they always lose their car keys, I'll 
have an answer for them," she said. "That will feel good."

JIM MURRAY: ARE SPORTS MISSING? NOT HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Listen! Had it up to here with the O.J. Simpson story? Tired of drive-by 
shootings, sirens in the night? Angry because there's no World Series, the Rams 
are packing, hockey's in jeopardy? Clinton and Haiti getting tiresome? 
</P>
<P>
 Do what I did. Get yourself on a plane and fly over the rainbow to a Land of 
Oz where the trade winds blow and the land is so sweet it grows sugar and 
pineapple and the mountains glow at night and rivers of fire run down their 
sides liquefying rock and fossilizing trees and reminding us again we live on a 
ball of fire that will one day incinerate all who live on it and it will 
disappear in the same cosmic, cataclysmic explosion that brought it here in the 
first place. The Bible is right. The world will die in its own furnace, the 
oceans will turn to steam, the ice caps will bubble and melt. Man has about 2 
million years to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 The big island of Hawaii is an active volcano. It rests atop the mightiest 
mountain on the planet. If you take measurements from the ocean floor it would 
make Everest seem like a ski slope. In the equatorial sun it has snow on top. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a place where colors grow so vivid it almost hurts to look at them, 
where sunsets melting into the blue sea are the most exquisite on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 It was here the Polynesians put ashore after their epic journey into the 
unknown armed only with canoe oars and bravery hundreds of years before 
Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an island of tranquillity where even the music is sweet, such a high 
glucose content that it is an adult lullaby far from the harsh discordant 
version of the ancient art in our own music. It still has melody as soft as the 
swaying winds, not just a beat like a locomotive piston. 
</P>
<P>
 It is always 200 years ago here. It is a young island, the youngest of the 
Hawaiian flotilla, barely 800,000 years old, an adolescent of landfalls, and it 
is lush with such beauty and soaring cliffs and lakes of lava it is ageless. 
The air is so pure that ecstatic astronomers place their telescopes atop it the 
better to study the vastness we are a part of. They may find God from the peaks 
of Mauna Loa some night. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only 30 people per square mile here, not counting the tourists who 
flock through in their colored shorts and hanging cameras and golf bags and 
shirts with palm trees on them. 
</P>
<P>
 They share their island. They like people, and hospitality is a way of life 
for them. They are island people but not clannish, and they are as happy as 
their music. 
</P>
<P>
 The great resorts like Mauna Lani and Waikaloa match anything the captains and 
kings used to flock to on the French Riviera or the spas of Europe. Captain 
Cook was killed here, but a monument is raised to him because he brought the 
news of Hawaii -- which he called the Sandwich Islands -- to a world that had 
never seen a bougainvillea or tasted a coconut or pineapple and he died a 
benefactor to mankind. 
</P>
<P>
 The tourists play golf, and why not on holes surrounded by the bluest sea you 
ever will see, and the fairways are lined with anthurium and lava and the air 
is so soft you can touch it when the trades whistle through the palms. The 
mongooses play in the lava and the birds, as gaily plumed as any in 
ornithology, flutter through the hibiscus. Out to sea you can see the white 
sails spanking in the breeze. The sun always shines, the rain falls mainly in 
the mountains, not the plains. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a place where you get orchids not only in the moonlight but on your 
eggs, and its 4,000 square miles host only 120,000 permanent citizens. England 
by comparison fits 50 million in 40,000 square miles and New York City you 
don't want to know about. 
</P>
<P>
 The big island has murders, assaults and robberies, but not one-an-hour or 
less. It is an oasis of beauty ringed by the mightiest moat in the world, the 
Pacific Ocean. As Joe Louis said, you can run but you can't hide. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder they have such a deep belief in God. They can hear Him in the 
basement, see Him in the night sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Their language is as sweet as their fruit. It has only 13 letters in it, so 
they use all of them in every word and some of their words are so long they 
should be serialized and every word has at least 5 "o's" and "i's' plus a few 
"k's." It is a language so pretty it almost has to be sung, the words so long 
they seem to be stuttered. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a corner of the world everyone should spend some part of his or her life 
in, a reminder of what the earth was before man began his marauding. To hear 
the dulcet tones of Sweet Leilani or The Wedding Song or sway to the hula is 
restorative and gets you ready for another year of the Santa Monica Freeway or 
the Sig Alerts of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 On the greens of Waikaloa, you don't really miss the World Series or worry the 
Rams will go or hockey will be iced. You are sure if it is not heaven, it is at 
least a corner of it. Even the weeds are gorgeous. You can go back in time even 
for a place that has telephones and television, faxes and par threes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is therapeutic. On the golf course, I hit 29 "Oh, no, not over theres!" 14 
"Anybody see where that wents?" 20 "I could have sworn that broke lefts" and 23 
"Anybody see what I'm doing wrongs?" 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter. You can't get mad in Hawaii.

MIKE DOWNEY: OWNER DELIVERS TIMELY MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I recently obtained a copy of a formal statement made by August A. Busch Jr., 
chairman of the board of Anheuser-Busch, Inc., and president of the St. Louis 
Cardinals, face-to-face to his baseball players, each of whom later received a 
copy. 
</P>
<P>
 I am going to quote lengthily from this pamphlet, partly because of its 
pertinence, but mostly because I believe Mr. Busch sums up better than I ever 
could what the American public is feeling. Much has been abridged, but I 
believe its intent is intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the things that concern me deal with our team specifically and with 
baseball generally. 
</P>
<P>
 "After talking to my staff, I decided to discuss my views with you all and get 
them off my chest. That's what I'm doing now. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Since I regard the situation in baseball as unusual -- and critical -- 
I don't know any better way to communicate with you than to talk to you face to 
face as I'm doing now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gentlemen, I don't think there is any secret about the fact that I am not a 
very good loser. One thing is for sure: I don't like to lose. I don't like to 
lose in baseball and I don't like to lose in the beer business. 
</P>
<P>
 "For that reason, you can well understand that there have been a number of 
times in the past 17 years when I felt like giving the club away. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I believe you should know something about the decisions we must make . 
. . the risks we must take . . . the problems we face, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ballparks and all the things it takes to put a major league team on the field 
just don't happen. . . . You don't put over 2 million people into a stadium by 
wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes hundreds of people, working every day, to make it possible for 18 
men to play a game of baseball that lasts for about two hours. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe it is out of place either to remind you of the large number 
of civic-minded businessmen and unions in our community who put up over $20 
million of their money, and then put their credit and reputations on the line 
to guarantee an additional $31-million loan from Equitable Life Assurance 
Society, a loan that will take 30 years to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Incidentally, not one of the men, or the organizations, who put up the 
$20 million will ever live to see a single penny of that money returned to 
them. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Times have changed in just a very few years, and people won't go and pay 
their money where they don't have all the modern conveniences. . . . And, there 
is another factor. Many professional sports now overlap the baseball season and 
compete very seriously for the entertainment dollar. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "People are now turning out in droves to watch professional hockey. And 
millions are packing the football stadiums all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wonder if we are putting them all in focus these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't already know it, I can tell you now -- from the letters, phone 
calls and conversations we've had recently -- that fans are no longer as sure 
as they were before about their high regard for the game and the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's take a good look at the past winter ourselves. What do we see? 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost didn't have any season at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of our players who ought to be in top condition reported late for spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball's union representatives made all kinds of derogatory statements 
about the owners. We suddenly seemed to be your greatest enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your representatives threw down all kinds of challenges, threats and 
ultimatums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some players made statements over radio and television, and to newspapermen, 
in which they, too, reflected upon the owners. Some of them said that the real 
problem was that the owners wanted to keep all the radio and television money 
to themselves, even when they must have known that was far removed from the 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, let me make myself very clear. I am not arguing with your right or the 
right of your representatives to say and do whatever they believe serves yours 
or their best interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I am saying -- loud and clear -- is that I think we ought to give 
consideration -- all of us -- to what we have to gain and what we have to lose 
by these tactics. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "As players, you are entitled to get the best deal you can, and I believe you 
have. We have the biggest payroll for players in the entire history of 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I am saying, though, that we are beginning to lose sight of who really 
has to pay the ultimate bill for your salary and your pension -- namely, the 
fan. And when we do that, I think we do have a problem. It's a problem which 
should be of mutual concern to all of us. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "True, you deserve to be well paid in accordance with your playing ability. 
But I must call your attention to the fact of life that you take few, if any, 
of the great risks involved. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Most fans have had a steady diet of strike talk and dollar signs. . . 
. Too many fans are saying our players are getting fat . . . that they now only 
think of money. . . . Fans are telling us now that if we intend to raise prices 
to pay for the high salaries and so on and on, they will stop coming to the 
games, they will not watch and will not listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urge you to watch your attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plead with you not to kill the enthusiasm of the fans and the kids for whom 
you have become such idols. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the ones who make you popular. They are the ones who make your 
salary and pension possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are told that many players have begun to ignore the fans. We are told that 
too many players are refusing to sign autographs. We are told that some of the 
players fail to show up for scheduled appointments. We are told that some 
players push kids aside when they try to take their pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remember, a few years ago, when player representatives told us they would 
refuse to be interviewed unless they were paid extra for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We better concern ourselves about the future of the game that has meant so 
much to so many of us. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is at a serious point in its history. I don't know what the future 
will bring." 
</P>
<P>

WITH ROBINSON HEALTHY AGAIN, CHAPMAN ROLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Curtis Robinson's little victory was overshadowed by the bigger one he 
engineered for Chapman -- 59-18 over Azusa Pacific in front of 2,633 Saturday 
afternoon here -- but it was just as important to the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson rushed for 169 yards and three first-half touchdowns, and passed for 
183 yards and two second-half scores, but for Chapman Coach Ken Visser, it was 
another statistic that stood out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having Curtis Robinson for a whole game," Visser said. "It was good to see 
Curtis play the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Robinson didn't play the entire game, but at least this time Visser 
got to choose when to pull his quarterback, namely after the Panthers had taken 
a 42-11 lead with 12 minutes 55 seconds left to play.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Robinson didn't make it out of the first quarter against Redlands. 
He was poked in the eye while being pulled down by his facemask and couldn't 
return because of seriously blurred vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The week before against Claremont-Mudd, he was sidelined with a separated 
shoulder, which was injured on the Panthers' second play from scrimmage in the 
season opener against Whittier. Despite the injury, he managed 272 yards total 
offense, two touchdowns rushing and two passing in the 30-13 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 So Saturday marked the first time Robinson has been able to make it out of the 
opening quarter without being injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Visser admitted to being worried about Robinson's health early in the 
game -- especially because backup Todd Gragnano's injured finger had limited 
him to being available only in an emergency -- but Robinson said he wasn't 
bothered by such thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he wasn't dwelling on the homecoming aspect of the game -- the 
Azusa Pacific stadium is within view of the Citrus stadium where he played the 
past two years -- or the fact that about 20 friends and family were watching 
from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, playing with a shield on his facemask, said he was concentrating on 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to come back so close to the junior college where I played, but I 
just expect to dominate every game," Robinson said. "It looked a lot easier 
than it was. They played hard but we just were able to get the big plays when 
we needed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman (3-0-1) also took advantage of extremely favorable field position and 
took leads of 21-0 and 28-3 before going ahead, 28-11, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers first took possession at the Azusa Pacific 34 after a 14-yard 
punt. A Robinson screen pass to Darnell Morgan that went for a touchdown was 
called back for holding, but Robinson went around end on the option for 21 
yards on the next play, setting up a two-yard dive by Morgan for a 7-0 lead 
with 12:27 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight minutes later, after getting the ball at the Azusa 42, Robinson 
ran around his right end for a 39-yard touchdown. Then after Jim Perez blocked 
an Azusa punt, Robinson led a 24-yard drive that he finished with a one-yard 
dive for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's final rushing touchdown was spectacular. On second and nine from 
the 19, he called a quarterback draw, broke outside and ran 81 yards for the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific (1-4), shut down from the start on the ground, had to go to the 
air to move the ball. Freshman quarterback Ben Focke, who passed for 202 yards 
with one interception, cut the lead to 28-11 with a nine-yard scoring pass to 
D.J. Williams with seven seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who completed nine of 18 passes with one interception, opened the 
second half by hitting Darnell Rubin with a 50-yard scoring pass. Then he 
completed a pass to Oscar Ford at the line of scrimmage and Ford took care of 
most of the 67-yard touchdown himself for the 42-11 lead with 12:55 remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 After Azusa Pacific cut it to 45-18 on a 57-yard pass play from Jim Lujan to 
Williams, reserve quarterback Jacob Galasso scored from one yard with 5:43 
left. On the next play from scrimmage, defensive lineman Jim Ahern finished the 
Panthers' scoring by intercepting a Lujan pass and returning it 12 yards.

RAMS SORELY WILL SEEK A VICTORY AT GREEN BAY; PRO FOOTBALL: QUARTERBACKS MILLER 
AND CHANDLER ARE RECOVERING FROM INJURIES, AND BETTIS HAS A PAINFUL BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 While an improving defense gives the Rams hope for better days ahead, any 
chance they have against the Green Bay Packers today depends on how well their 
quarterbacks fare in the trainer's room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (2-3) enter the game with Chris Miller suffering from a sore throwing 
shoulder and Chris Chandler trying to recover from a sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is expected to start today, but Coach Chuck Knox hasn't ruled out 
starting Chandler or using him as a backup if his ankle continues to show 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to wait and see," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries best describe the state of the Rams' offense lately. Wide receiver 
Flipper Anderson will wear a flak jacket to protect a small broken bone in his 
back. Tailback Jerome Bettis, who didn't practice this week because of a 
bruised low back, will start and is expected to carry the offense once again. 
</P>
<P>
 So with plenty of ice packs in tow, the Rams will try to win at Lambeau Field 
for the first time since 1988 with a beat-up offense that has produced only one 
touchdown -- on a tipped pass from Chandler to Anderson -- and four field goals 
the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a critical game for us," Ram assistant head coach Joe Vitt said. "We 
need to get a win in the worst way, get back to .500 and move on from there. 
</P>
<P>
 "And in light of the injuries on offense, we need to turn to our defense right 
now."  
</P>
<P>
 Based on the way the Ram and Green Bay defenses have played the last few 
weeks, today's game could become a field-goal contest between Tony Zendejas and 
Chris Jacke. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' defensive line -- Fred Stokes, Sean Gilbert, Jimmie Jones and Robert 
Young -- has kept Joe Montana and Jeff George on their heels the last two 
weeks. The defense shut out the Chiefs and held Atlanta scoreless for 56 
minutes before losing, 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best defensive front in football right now," Vitt said. "I can't 
think of a better one. They get to the passer, they work unbelievably hard in 
practice and they're young too." 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay's defense, under the direction of former Ram assistant Fritz 
Shurmur, is fourth in the league (273 yards per game). The Packers have given 
up more than two touchdowns only once this season, a 24-14 loss to Miami in 
Week 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Their rush defense, sixth in the league with a 77.4-yard average, will have 
its hands full with Bettis, who averages 101 yards. Miller faces one of the 
best pass rushes in the league in Green Bay's Reggie White (three sacks), Sean 
Jones (four sacks) and Bryce Paup (four sacks). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to get the ball out there quick and take as few shots as I 
can," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who suffered a sprained ankle against Atlanta last week, made what 
Knox called a "miraculous" recovery this week. The snaps with the top units 
went to backup Tommy Maddox and Miller, who has sat out the last two games 
because of a pinched nerve and slight separation in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 With Miller coming off an injury and Anderson wearing a flak jacket as he runs 
pass routes, where does that leave the Rams' offense? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably in the hands of an overworked Bettis, whose 130 carries this season 
are 12 more than any other back in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis has averaged 32 carries in the past two games and he raised concern 
early in the week about his durability in an offense that uses him so much. He 
sat out practice all week to rest his back but promises to be in the lineup 
today.  
</P>
<P>
 Third-down back Johnny Bailey, the team's leading receiver with 16 catches for 
166 yards, also should figure prominently today, possibly lining up for the 
first time with Bettis, instead of replacing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-year player Howard Griffith got some work at tailback this week because 
David Lang sat out practice because of a deep thigh bruise. Griffith also might 
play today at fullback for Tim Lester, who suffered a sprained ankle in 
practice Wednesday but returned the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay's offense also has problems with injuries to key players. Starting 
left guard Guy McIntyre is sidelined because of a blood clot in his calf, but 
quarterback Brett Favre (deep bruise on right hip) and wide receiver Sterling 
Sharpe (hamstring) will play. 
</P>
<P>
 Favre, whom the Rams sought as a restricted free agent in the off-season, 
leads the NFC in passing yards with 1,427. He has been erratic at times, 
throwing eight touchdown passes with five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has had trouble getting Green Bay in the end zone. The Packers have 
scored more than 16 points only once this season, a 30-3 victory over Tampa Bay 
in Week 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe set a league record for receptions last season with 112, but is the 
team's second-leading receiver with 32 for 384 yards, one catch shy of running 
back Edgar Bennett. Although slowed by the hamstring injury, Sharpe still 
caught nine passes for 132 yards and a touchdown last week in a 17-16 loss to 
New England. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sterling came out for a few plays against New England," Green Bay Coach Mike 
Holmgren said. "It's not a serious injury, just a twinge in his leg, and he has 
a little work on it now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll play and give you everything he's got. Ninety percent of Sterling is 
usually better than 100% of a lot of guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay's biggest weakness is its running game. Bettis has out-rushed the 
entire Green Bay offense, 507 yards to 364 this season. Tailback Reggie Cobb, 
who's sharing time with rookie LeShon Johnson, leads the Packers with 185 yards 
in 45 carries and has the team's only rushing touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 With both teams struggling offensively and playing well on defense, does 
Holmgren predict a low-scoring game? 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time I've ever said that it would be, it has usually been just the other 
kind of game," he said. "If you go on what both teams have done so far, it's 
going to be low-scoring."

TRACY, ANDRETTI, MANSELL MOVING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS; LAGUNA SECA: CANADIAN 
ON POLE, VETERAN RETIRING AND ENGLISHMAN GETTING OUT OF INDY CARS IN A HURRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Indy car racing bids farewell to Mario Andretti and Nigel Mansell today, but 
there is no need to shed a tear for Paul Newman and Carl Haas, whose cars 
Andretti and Mansell drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Andretti, the 1991 Indy car champion and Mario's son, will step into 
the seat left by his father. Paul Tracy, one of Roger Penske's dominating trio 
of drivers, has a handshake option for Mansell's ride -- if Penske will release 
him from his contract, which runs through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, the Andrettis will start side by side today in the sixth row for 
their final race together -- the Bank of America 300 at Laguna Seca Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newman-Haas team had a news conference scheduled Saturday to announce 
Tracy as one of its drivers, but it was abruptly canceled when Penske did not 
give Tracy his release. Penske has until Nov. 15 to re-sign Tracy for next 
season or let him go. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Tracy's late-season success has Penske giving second thoughts to 
his previously announced plan to run a two-car team next year. The young 
Canadian driver was a runaway winner of the last race at Nazareth, Pa., and was 
the fastest qualifier for today's race, final event of the 16-race Indy car 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy's Friday lap of 113.768 m.p.h., a track record, was good enough to claim 
the pole, as unseasonably hot weather held speeds down. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell qualified third at 112.146 for his final Indy car race. Jacques 
Villeneuve, another young Canadian, will start on the front row with Tracy 
after posting a speed of 112.244. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy recently tested with the Benetton-Ford Formula One team in Portugal and 
was offered a multimillion-dollar three-year contract to drive for them next 
year, but he said that he wanted to remain in Indy cars -- with or without 
Penske -- for a few more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity is there, but right now I want to concentrate on Indy cars," 
Tracy said. "I need to wait until my family is older." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tracys have two children, Alysha Rachelle, 18 months, and Conrad, who was 
born Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy is in a no-lose situation. If Penske keeps him, he will remain part of 
the most powerful team in racing. If he is released, he signs with Newman-Haas 
and joins a team that has won two of the last four Indy car championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say enough about my association with Roger Penske," Tracy said. "He 
took me on when I was a nobody and gave me a great opportunity. He helped put 
me on the map where I am now. It was great being able to work with Rick (Mears) 
and Emerson (Fittipaldi). If I move on, that's OK. I'll just try to take each 
step as it comes along." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell is wasting no time in returning to his Formula One roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after today's 84-lap race, he will hop a helicopter from the 
infield to the nearby Monterey airport, where he will head for England in his 
private jet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will refuel twice before landing in Exeter sometime Monday afternoon," 
Mansell said. "On Tuesday and Wednesday, I will be at the Estoril course in 
Portugal, testing the Williams for next Sunday's race in Spain. We will 
practice for two days in Spain before the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shall try to stay out of trouble, get into the time zone, get a good finish 
and get on to Japan and Australia for the last two races. I will enjoy that 
because I will get in some deep-sea fishing down there." 
</P>
<P>
 British writers insist that Mansell will drive for Williams in 1995, rejoining 
the team with which he won the world championship, but Mansell remains coy 
about his future beyond this year's final three Formula One events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not the one to answer questions about the future," he said. "That will 
be decided by others. All I can be is patient and see what is in store for me." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing he did admit, though, was that his estate in Clearwater, Fla., was 
on the market. Asking price: $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The main house on the nearly five acres along the Gulf of Mexico has 66 rooms, 
12 full baths and five half-baths. Also on the property are two guest houses, a 
caretaker's house and a three-level garage with hydraulic lifts to stack the 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am leaving with nothing but wonderful memories of my two years here," the 
41-year-old Englishman said. "Last year was magical. This year was certainly 
disappointing, but we had our moments. What happened this year only made me 
savor '93 more. I didn't appreciate until this year what we accomplished last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 After winning five races and the PPG Cup championship as a rookie in 1993, 
Mansell has only three poles and two second-place finishes this year. He is in 
sixth place in points  
</P>
<P>
 Mario Andretti, who will close out a 31-year career in Indy cars today, was 
not so precise in his departure plans. In fact, the man who has put together 
one of the greatest records in racing history sounded as if, even at age 54, he 
had made a premature decision to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this stage (of a usual season), I was planning for the next test," he 
said. "Nine days after this race last year I was testing at Indianapolis. 
Michael is planning all his tests. I'm not doing that, and I miss it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have changed for me. I'm forcing myself to retire, but I'll miss 
everything. I'll miss waiting for the next car. It's like having your first 
baby. It's going to be a change and I'm going to have to deal with it. I feel a 
little like a baby myself right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes spiced the final weekend of racing, which was left without much 
suspense when Al Unser Jr. clinched the PPG Cup title and its $1-million bonus 
two races ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Herta, the young driver from Valencia who suffered near career-ending 
injuries last July in Toronto, was named as the replacement for Michael 
Andretti on Chip Ganassi's Reynard-Ford team. A.J. Foyt, who had an option on 
Herta's services, released him and in turn signed veteran Eddie Cheever for the 
1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Boesel, still looking for his first victory after 119 Indy car races, 
will make his final start today for car owner Dick Simon. The veteran Brazilian 
has signed to drive with Bobby Rahal next season, but not with Honda-powered 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahal and Mike Groff end their less-than-successful two-year association with 
the Japanese manufacturer here today. Honda officials have announced their 
intention of continuing their Indy car program, but no driver or team has been 
revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone, which has been out of racing for 20 years since its tire wars with 
Goodyear in the 1960s and '70s, will return next season with a team owned by 
Pat Patrick. Scott Pruett will be the driver and Jim McGee, who masterminded 
the Newman-Haas team the past two years, will be manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Horne, owner of the Tasman Motorsports Group, is moving up from Indy 
Lights to Indy cars with Indy Lights champion Andre Ribeiro, 28, of Brazil as 
his driver.

MORNING BRIEFING: 'BIG BAD JOHN' AND THE ORANGE CRUSH HAVE BEEN DULY SQUEEZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Better watch yourselves, you Broncos. You are 0-4 and the faithful are getting 
restless in Denver, where nothing is sacred anymore. Not even John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 Woody Paige of the Denver Post certainly was in no mood to forgive Elway's 
passing in Denver's loss to the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Paige: "The Miracle Worker threw more like Anne Bancroft and may get a 
new nickname -- the Patty Duke." Paige went on to call Elway "Big Bad John" and 
painted a bleak picture for the guys in the orange jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Broncos always have lived and died with Elway, and they are dying," Paige 
said. "Superman can't fly anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the only player in NFL history to have had two runs of 90 
yards or longer? 
</P>
<P>
 Duck coup: The Mighty Ducks have won the Dick Dillman Award, presented by the 
Professional Hockey Writers Assn. to the top public relations staff in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Duck PR chief Bill Robertson: "It just goes to show our staff is 
everything it was quacked up to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Mack was unavailable: For those keeping score at home, here are the men 
who have interviewed for the vacant job of manager of the Baltimore Orioles, 
listed chronologically: Rick Dempsey, Davey Lopes, Bill Virdon, Phil Regan, 
Elrod Hendricks, Buck Rodgers, Chris Chambliss, Davey Johnson and Jeff Torborg. 
</P>
<P>
 Real nice award: Gino Torretta? The 1992 Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback 
from Miami, cut by the Minnesota Vikings after the last exhibition game, is 
still looking for work. The Pittsburgh Steelers might be interested. 
</P>
<P>
 It's clear Heisman-winning quarterbacks and the NFL don't mix very well. None 
of the last seven have become NFL stars. The last to do it was 1970 winner Jim 
Plunkett, who led the Raiders to two Super Bowl titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Say what?John Crumpacker of the San Francisco Examiner, commenting on the 
49ers' one-sided loss to the Eagles:  
</P>
<P>
 "Their astonishing 40-8 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles was to peel back the 
curtain on the parallel universe, where things are upside backward and turvy in 
their topsiness." 
</P>
<P>
 "I said celery cap": The Western League, an eight-team, double A-level minor 
league baseball circuit that will start playing next spring, has franchises in 
Long Beach and Palm Springs. Yes, there is a salary cap: $92,000 -- per team. 
</P>
<P>
 He needs great luck: It doesn't look as if agent Alan Meersand of Manhattan 
Beach will be hanging out on the pier with baseball's acting commissioner, Bud 
Selig, anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Meersand: "You'd be whining and bitching too, if you blew $27 million on 
Teddy Higuera and Greg Vaughn. . . . The way to rectify this, of course, is to 
ram a salary cap down the players' throats and make them pay for his horrible 
management. Good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Bo Jackson, with a 91-yard run against Seattle in 1987 and a 
92-yarder against Cincinnati in 1989. 
</P>

RAIDERS TRY TO HALT INCONSISTENCY TODAY; PRO FOOTBALL: LOS ANGELES TRAVELS TO 
NEW ENGLAND TO MEET A PATRIOT TEAM THAT HAS WON ITS LAST THREE GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to a bye week, the Raiders have had two weeks to reflect on their 1-3 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough time to think about how they went from a Super Bowl contender to a 
last-place team in only a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having the week off, I think helped us in that we were able to take a look at 
what we're doing," Coach Art Shell said. "To see what we have to do in order to 
get this thing turned in the right direction, where it has to go in order for 
us to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Today at Foxboro, Mass., the Raiders will try to stop their fall when they 
play the upstart New England Patriots, who have a three-game winning streak and 
are tied for second in the AFC East with Buffalo at 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Another defeat would keep the Raiders at least three games out of first in the 
AFC West, and they would have lost to three AFC opponents, which would 
definitely hurt them in a playoff tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little surprised," New England Coach Bill Parcells said of the Raiders. 
"They look to me to be a formidable opponent. The game that probably surprised 
me the most was (the Raiders' 38-9 loss to Seattle). I don't know what happened 
in that game." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Raiders' inconsistency is a surprise to Parcells, you can imagine how 
the Raiders feel. 
</P>
<P>
 To start, the Raiders made two changes in their defense, elevating cornerback 
Albert Lewis and rookie linebacker Rob Fredrickson to starting roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who signed with the Raiders as a free agent after making four Pro Bowls 
with Kansas City, will start at right cornerback in place of Lionel Washington. 
Washington, an eight-year starter with the Raiders, will switch to nickel back. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson, the Raiders' first-round draft choice from Michigan State, will 
move into the lineup at left outside linebacker. He will replace Aaron Wallace, 
who will be used as a pass-rush specialist at defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lewis just needs to be on the field more than he has been," said Shell, who 
added that Washington will still play a key role in the secondary. "And 
Fredrickson has made great strides this season to get in the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from these lineup changes, the Raiders also stressed an attitude change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel that the only way to play this game is to play it hard, to be 
as mean and nasty as you can," linebacker Winston Moss said. "If anything, I 
think that's something that's missing. There hasn't been a real urgency to line 
up and try to beat the (heck) out of everybody who we were playing in the first 
four games." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell noticed the change when the team returned to practice last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitude was real good Monday and has been there all week," Shell said. 
"They seem ready to go to work, and that's what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lineup and attitude adjustments will have to work for the Raiders to have a 
chance against the NFL's top-rated offense, led by quarterback Drew Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
 In only his second season, Bledsoe has emerged as one of the league's top 
passers with 1,751 yards and 11 touchdowns in completing 60.3% of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot of poise," Shell said. "The more film you watch of this guy, the 
more impressed you become. There are people hanging on him and he's still 
making throws, big-time throws. Not just for five yards. I'm talking 30 yards 
down the field. Making them and scoring touchdowns."

 Bledsoe's top target is tight end Ben Coates, a 6-foot-5, 240-pound, 
fourth-year veteran from Livingstone (N.C.) College. Coates has 35 catches for 
529 yards and five touchdowns. Wide receiver Michael Timpson has 27 catches for 
350 yards and three scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Marion Butts, whom New England acquired from San Diego during the 
summer, leads the team with 243 yards rushing, with fullback Kevin Turner being 
used mainly as a blocker and a receiver out of the backfield. Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Jarrod Bunch, who signed as a free agent last month, is expected to 
be activated for the first time this season. He will back up starter Tom 
Rathman. . . . The Raiders have played the Patriots 27 times and have a 13-13-1 
record, with the Raiders winning their last meeting, 24-21, on a field goal by 
Jeff Jaeger in 1989.

ANALYSIS; OLYMPIC TRACK NOT RIGHT ON SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the 1996 Summer Olympics still nearly two years away, it is curious that 
the schedules for competition in all sports but the flagship event, track and 
field, have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody had to be last, I guess," said Amadeo Francis of Puerto Rico, a 
member of track's international federation committee in charge of scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 If only it were that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Although International Amateur Athletic Federation and Olympic organizers say 
the process takes time, it might also turn out that it takes money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the behind-the-scenes deal-making that often dictates Olympic movements, it 
appears that IAAF President Primo Nebiolo of Italy is using the Atlanta Games' 
track schedule as a pawn to bring in more money for his group and to boost the 
lagging popularity of his sport in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the IAAF Council must approve the track schedule, Nebiolo has the 
final say. 
</P>
<P>
 By delaying approval of the schedule until he gets a satisfactory deal, 
Nebiolo hopes to get more money for IAAF coffers, more television coverage and 
promotion from NBC and, presumably, rejuvenation of U.S. track interest. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sports Intern, a German publication, Nebiolo wants the Atlanta 
Committee of the Olympic Games (ACOG) to pay more for a proposed expanded 
schedule. ACOG is considering holding track and field events over nine or 10 
days, an increase from the eight-day program used in previous Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The publication reported that an extra day of track competition would yield at 
least $2.5 million extra in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebiolo is arguing that NBC, which has the U.S. television rights to the 
Games, will benefit from the increased track program and, thus, should pay more 
for coverage of the 1995 World Championships in Sweden and guarantee coverage 
of the 1997 championships in Mexico City. He also wants the network to better 
promote its track telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just cannot be that the 1995 World Championships are only worth very 
little, when one year later the Olympic track and field events are a big hit 
with the same program and same athletes," one IAAF Council member told Sport 
Intern. 
</P>
<P>
 That Nebiolo would work to renew track interest in the United States indicates 
the IAAF's lack of confidence in USA Track & Field, the sport's national 
governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 The IAAF has long been concerned about USA track's ineffectiveness against the 
decline of the sport in a nation that produces some of the world's best 
athletes, but barely acknowledges it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebiolo sees the Atlanta Games as an opportunity to market the sport here. The 
fallout could be the downfall of longtime USA track leader Ollan Cassell, who 
has a cool relationship with Nebiolo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad that the state of track and field as a sport has fallen so low in 
the United States that the IAAF has to target us as a developing nation in 
terms of trying to build popularity and interest," said Craig Masback, a former 
Olympic runner and television commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not formally positioned to challenge Cassell, USA track's executive 
director, Masback is being mentioned as a possible replacement if Nebiolo is 
successful in upsetting the balance of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Such rumblings occur periodically in track, upon which Cassell has held a firm 
grip for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Nebiolo is behind the campaign, a coup might have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to work with the U.S. federation," Nebiolo said last August in 
Paris. "We have offered our assistance many times, but they have never 
responded." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassell said USA track has long welcomed outside assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it has to be in coordination here with what we're doing," he said from 
his Indianapolis office. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassell said USA track has planned some programs for the next two years that 
will coincide with the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 He is well aware of IAAF efforts to undermine his leadership. But he said he 
is not concerned about the recent developments. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, IAAF involvement in the United States is not unprecedented. When 
the New York Games were about to fold, IAAF money helped keep them afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if Nebiolo's manipulations are successful, it would not be the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 He used the track schedule for the Seoul Olympics to get $20 million from 
Korean organizers, who were afraid that their $500-million American television 
contract would be sabotaged if they did not meet the IAAF president's demands, 
according to the book, "Dishonored Games," by Vyv Simson and Andrew Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
 An Atlanta organizer characterized the Seoul situation as tantamount to 
blackmail, but declined to comment on whether it was happening again with the 
'96 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always things going on (with) the people at the top of the Olympic 
family," an IAAF official told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 If Nebiolo does not get his way with NBC, he might threaten to hold the finals 
during Europe's prime time. That would put them in the heat of the Georgia 
afternoon, prime time for neither the athletes nor the TV-viewing public in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 IAAF officials have denied they would request afternoon finals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Francis said his three-member delegation hopes to have a 
proposal before the IAAF Council when it meets Nov. 29 in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 ACOG has made 19 revisions of the track schedule since January, and David 
Maggard, director of competitions, is satisfied with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary and a few final events are scheduled for morning sessions, from 9 
a.m. to noon. Most of the finals will be held in the evening, from 7:30 to 10 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 If Nebiolo approves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're not just fighting here in the United States for track and 
field, but worldwide," Cassell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in our best interest to do what is best for us. If we can use (the 
schedule) some way to get NBC to give (us) more coverage and it fits within the 
regulations of the IOC and ACOG, then I see nothing wrong with it."

 WELCOME TO NEBRASKA, HOME OF QUARTERBACKS 
</P>
<P>
 And who ever said Nebraska was only good for shifty running backs? Or beefy 
linemen whose idea of a good restaurant is a silo and who comb their hair with 
pitchforks? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, ol' Quarterback U. has come through again. Forced to go to their third 
quarterback, the Cornhuskers rolled over Oklahoma State, 32-3, in their Big 
Eight opener at Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Turman, a sophomore walk-on who started the fall as a third-teamer, 
opened the second half and drove Nebraska to two touchdowns in its first three 
possessions.  
</P>
<P>
 Turman's time arrived when Coach Tom Osborne was forced to pull Brook 
Berringer, who was starting for Tommie Frazier. Berringer took over last week 
against Wyoming when Frazier (Quarterback No. 1), was hospitalized with a blood 
clot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berringer suffered a partially collapsed lung against Wyoming. An X-ray at 
halftime Saturday showed some damage to his lung, so out went Berringer 
(Quarterback No. 2) and in came Turman (Quarterback No. 3). FOOTBALL TELLS 
PUNTER: 'BEAM ME UP , SCOTTI!' 
</P>
<P>
 The award for Worst Kicked Ball of the Day goes to SMU punter Anthony Scotti. 
Standing in his end zone, Scotti knuckled a punt that hit at the 10-yard line 
and bounced back through the Mustangs' end zone for a safety. Baylor went on to 
win, 44-10, at Waco. THAT'S A LOT OF CANDLES 
</P>
<P>
 Let's all wish a Happy 500th to the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Conn. The 500th 
college football game at the stadium was played Saturday. Alas, Yale fell to 
Lehigh, 36-32, as Lehigh's Bob Aylsworth set a Yale Bowl record with 454 yards 
passing. ONE TOTALLY BUFF SCHEDULE 
</P>
<P>
 Oil up that remote control. Channel surfers, wax your converter boxes. Dudes 
and Dudettes, check out next weekend's schedule: No. 1 Florida vs. No. 9 
Auburn; No. 2 Nebraska vs. No. 19 Kansas State; No. 4 Penn State vs. No. 7 
Michigan; No. 5 Colorado vs. No. 16 Oklahoma and No. 6 Arizona vs. No. 22 
Washington St. CALL THEM HEAVYWEIGHTS, NO MATTER WHAT DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 Doubtless here's something you think about: Can the best Division I-AA team 
beat the best Division II team? 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday it could. Youngstown State (I-AA champ) beat North Alabama (Division 
II champ), 17-14. It was only the second meeting between defending Division 
I-AA and Division II champions. The only previous one was in 1982 when Boise 
State, the I-AA champ, beat Division II winner Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 17-6. 
IT'S TOO, TOO, TOO, TOO, TOO BAD 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College 30, Notre Dame 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very, very, very, very, very disappointed," Irish Coach Lou Holtz said. 
NUMBERS, NUMBERS: (SOME OF THEM REALLY UGLY) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Navy, which lost by 22 points to Air Force, came in averaging only 60.5 
yards per game rushing, but the Middies finished with minus-6 net yards on the 
ground. Maybe they should stay away from land and try . . . . the water. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Colorado's 38-23 victory over Missouri was the 10th consecutive time 
Missouri has lost to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA (2-4, 0-3 in the Pac-10) has been outscored 133-38 in consecutive 
losses to Nebraska, Washington State, Washington and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pace University, a Division II school in Pleasantville, N.Y., broke a 
15-game losing streak with a victory over I-AA Iona. Mike Maceranka from Laguna 
Hills High made his first start at quarterback. Obviously, he set the pace for 
Pace. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Columbia's unbeaten streak reached three games, its longest in more than 20 
years, after a victory over Fordham that came on the sixth anniversary of the 
end of Columbia's 44-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Auburn extended its Division I-A winning streak to 17 with a 42-18 rout of 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 -- West Texas A&M's Grady Benton passed for 451 yards and seven touchdowns in 
a 70-44 victory over Western New Mexico. But the Arizona State transfer was 
outdone by Alfred Montez, who passed for 614 yards and four touchdowns for 
Western New Mexico. Benton completed 33 of 48 passes and Montez 39 of 63 as the 
teams combined for 1,494 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Army's 1-4 start is its worst since opening the 1974 season 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Valdosta State quarterback Chris Hatcher became the career touchdown pass 
leader in Division II as he threw five in a 38-7 victory over New Haven. 
Hatcher's 94 scoring passes broke the mark of 93 set by Doug Williams, who 
played at Grambling from 1974-77. AND THEY DIDN'T ENJOY IT 
</P>
<P>
 After watching his team lose to Virginia Tech, 41-13, Temple Coach Ron 
Dickerson said: "We got manhandled today." 
</P>
<P>
 Hokiehandled? AIR McNAIR UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McNair of Division I-AA Alcorn State threw four touchdown passes in a 
28-21 victory over Texas Southern at Lorman, Miss. McNair's current statistics 
-- passing: 175 of 235 for 2,317 yards, 23 touchdowns, 10 interceptions; 
rushing: 64 carries for 565 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair owns the NCAA Division I-AA career total offense record. He is closing 
in on the NCAA overall record, held by 1990 Heisman Trophy winner Ty Detmer, of 
14,665 yards. Detmer's record was set at Brigham Young from 1988-91. FYI: 
ALCORN 
</P>
<P>
 McNair and his Alcorn State teammates play at Jack Spinks Stadium in Lorman. 
It is named after the former Alcorn player and coach who was the first black 
Mississippian drafted by the NFL. He died Sept. 29. GATORS WORK ON DEFENSE, 
TUNE UP THEIR BLANDNESS 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked Florida Gators talked about how tough their defense was after 
smacking LSU, 42-18. OK, it was fine, especially Anthone Lott's 88-yard return 
of an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 With Auburn next, it's just that Florida needs to brush up a little on its 
quotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Terry Dean threw his 18th touchdown pass, then hid behind the 
cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be the biggest game for us to this point," Dean said. "We will have 
to play our very best to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ugh. A SINGLE BLOCK OF GRANITE MAKES A NICE STONE WALL 
</P>
<P>
 Texas' 17-10 victory over Oklahoma was preserved by a Longhorn nose guard who 
stopped Oklahoma's James Allen short of the goal line on fourth and goal from 
the three-yard line with less than a minute to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The nose tackle is named Stonie. Stonie Clark. He weighs 343 pounds. HE SURE 
KNEW THE WAY TO GET PAST SAN JOSE 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon Kaufman's 254 yards rushing against San Jose State were the most by a 
Washington running back since Hugh McElhenny ran for 296 yards against 
Washington State in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Washington Coach Jim Lambright: "That's about the most impressive speed 
show that he could end up putting on out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Said San Jose State Coach John Ralston: "When you talk about speed, that is 
the ultimate on speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman was philosophical after scoring on runs of 91, 3 and 76 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never worry about getting caught from behind," he said. "I just take off 
running. They either catch me or I end in the (end) zone." GRAMBLING STILL 
RAMBLING 
</P>
<P>
 After knocking off Mississippi Valley State, 24-7, Grambling (5-0) continued 
to build on Coach Eddie Robinson's record. He is college football's all-time 
winningest coach with 339 victories. IT'S A GEOGRAPHY PROBLEM: ILLINOIS AT HOME 
IN OHIO 
</P>
<P>
 Did Ohio State Coach John Cooper's grip on his job get a little shakier after 
Illinois romped over his team at Columbus? 
</P>
<P>
 As the Illinois players left Ohio Stadium with a 24-10 victory over the 
17th-ranked Buckeyes, they yelled, "This is our home." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure looks that way. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Illinois' fourth consecutive victory at Ohio Stadium. Not since 
Illinois won its sixth in a row at Columbus in 1929 has a team won more than 
three consecutive games on Ohio State's home field. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State came in averaging 219 yards a game on the ground but was limited to 
134. MIGHTIER THAN THE PENN? NOBODY ON THIS BIG DAY 
</P>
<P>
 Penn's 51-point victory over Holy Cross (59-8) was its biggest margin of 
victory in 30 years. Not only that, the Quakers won their 15th consecutive 
game, the longest winning streak in Division I-AA football. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, but Penn (3-0) rolled up a school-record 34 first downs. Not 
only that, but Penn pulled all its offensive starters in the second half. HAIL 
TO THE CHIEF . . . . . . . . I MEAN OLD NO. 48 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Gerald Ford watched Michigan defeat Michigan State at Ann 
Arbor. The Wolverines retired Ford's No. 48 jersey in ceremonies at halftime. 
Ford played center at Michigan in 1934. ON WISCONSIN 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin's Terrell Fletcher had never rushed for, oh, 186 yards in a game 
before. That is until he got to play against Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher rushed 26 times for a career-high 186 yards and scored three 
touchdowns in a 46-14 victory over Northwestern. Fletcher's partner in the 
Wisconsin backfield, Brent Moss, gained 145 yards, his 16th consecutive game of 
more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time this season that Moss and Fletcher had rushed for 100 
yards in the same game.

BRUINS KNOW ABOUT WILLARD ALL TOO WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For three years, Jerrott Willard had tormented UCLA, so why should Saturday 
have been any different? 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and time again, the inside linebacker was involved in stifling the Bruin 
offense, helping Cal to a 26-7 Pacific 10 Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Bears' fifth consecutive victory over the Bruins, their longest 
winning streak in the 61-year series. The last time Cal won four consecutive 
games against UCLA was from 1947-50. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a testimony to the guys who have been here five years," Cal 
Coach Keith Gilbertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 That group does not include Gilbertson, who took over from Bruce Snyder before 
the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does include Willard. 
</P>
<P>
 And Willard, a 6-foot-2, 230-pounder, knows the sweat and pain that has gone 
into bringing Cal out of the conference cellar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears finished last in the Pac-10 in 1988. They were last again in 1989, 
the year Willard made a school-record 134 tackles and was selected the CIF 
Division VI player of the year as a senior at Corona del Mar High. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard suffered a personal tragedy in high school when his mother, Carleen, 
died during surgery at age 45. Willard has since dedicated his football success 
to her memory. 
</P>
<P>
 And while he has achieved success -- he is a strong candidate for All-American 
honors this season -- the road has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a program on the rise and I wanted to be a part of . . . turning 
something around," Willard said of his decision to attend Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard was expected to play as a freshman in 1990 but suffered a knee injury 
and redshirted the season. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned with a vengeance, leading the Pac-10 in tackles in 1992 and 1993. 
He was a first-team all-conference selection last season. Willard needs 86 more 
tackles this season to become one of three players in school history to have 
500 tackles in a career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerrott is a very fine player," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. "He is one of 
the best linebackers in the conference. He's very competitive. He's the heart 
and soul of the team. You need a player like that to pull your team together. 
He's a hell of a player." 
</P>
<P>
 But Willard had struggled earlier this season. A knee injury kept him on the 
sideline during a 21-7 loss at Hawaii on Sept. 17, and he played despite 
suffering from flu in a 55-0 victory over San Jose State last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The local media criticized Willard's play against San Jose, but he left no 
doubt in anyone's mind about his ability with his 14 tackles and two sacks for 
losses totaling 15 yards Saturday against the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard quickly squelched UCLA hopes when the Bruins came out of the locker 
room, trailing 19-7, to start the second half. The Bruins were on their 42-yard 
line in their first drive of the half when Willard stopped Sharmon Shah on a 
run for no gain. On the next play, Willard sacked quarterback Wayne Cook for a 
loss of nine yards, forcing UCLA to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard struck again with 4:33 remaining in the third quarter, getting the 
ball loose from Cook, who scrambled to recover for a loss of six yards, forcing 
UCLA to punt from its 27-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Willard) is a great player," Gilbertson said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach then moved closer to the bright lights of the television cameras, 
adding very slowly, "Let me say this, He is playing great football. I don't 
want to hear one more time what's wrong with Willard. Nothing's wrong with 
Willard." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, no doubt, would vouch for that.

USC FINDS ITS QUARTERBACK OF FUTURE; TROJANS: SOPHOMORE BRAD OTTON SHOWS BOTH 
POISE AND ABILITY IN BEATING OREGON STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally pressed, Brad Otton looked puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
 The USC quarterback, cornered by a throng of reporters, wasn't sure what to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to make a statement, do I?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 No, he already had done that on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton, the back-up to Rob Johnson, got his first start Saturday because 
Johnson sprained his ankle against Oregon last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton might not replace Johnson anytime soon, but he looked as if he will be 
playing a lot of minutes for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-6 sophomore completed 13 of 21 passes for 208 yards and two 
touchdowns against Oregon State. He had no interceptions and was sacked only 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 That last fact is perhaps the most satisfying statistic for USC fans -- 
including Coach John Robinson -- who have been displeased with the sacks 
Johnson has taken this season. 
</P>
<P>
 They also delighted in Otton's ability to make big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton connected with Keyshawn Johnson for one bomb of 50 yards and another 
pass play of 27 yards. In all, Otton found him six times for 139 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was Otton's convincing play-action passes that keyed both his touchdown 
tosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Riley, USC's offensive coordinator and quarterback coach, was more than 
pleased with his back-up player's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otton did an outstanding job -- he was poised and made big plays," Riley 
said. "He would have made another big play if someone hadn't missed a block." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley was referring to Otton's one sack, on which the quarterback faked a 
handoff and turned around to find his facemask full of Oregon State jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 But Otton was not shaken, stirred, or even nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, he said, he didn't have one butterfly. Of course, that soon 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those opening drives were like a nightmare," Otton said. "All of a sudden, we 
were down, 13-2, and Rob (Johnson) comes over to me on the sideline and says, 
'Well, it looks like you're going to throw a lot.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I room with Rob on the road, and when things are going wrong, I know who to 
go to -- he's been running this offense for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Otton didn't throw a lot -- only enough to beat Oregon State in his first 
Division I-A start. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton came to USC as a transfer from Weber State under some odd circumstances. 
For one thing, he didn't know much about the university. For another, he 
thought USC was a quarterback school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't know anything about USC -- I watched part of the game against 
Utah last year," Otton said. 
</P>
<P>
 What he saw was Johnson complete 30 of 44 passes for 345 yards and three 
touchdowns. That was a good selling point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming to SC was tougher than people might think. I mean, sure, everyone 
thinks 'Yeah, play for SC,' but my mom, my dad and my brother went to Weber 
State and I have a lot of good friends there. 
</P>
<P>
 "But (the administration) kind of left us hanging. There was talk of the 
program being cut, scholarships being cut and coaching positions being cut." 
</P>
<P>
 He set records at Weber State, a Division I-AA school, when he passed for 540 
yards and accounted for 565 yards of total offense against Northern Arizona 
last season. For the season, he passed for 2,307 yards and 15 touchdowns as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 That made him instantly attractive to USC, as did the fact that Otton's dad 
had been coached at Weber State by Riley's dad and the two had remained 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell the truth, with Rob here, I wasn't sure I wanted to sit a year," 
Otton said. "But everyone here talks of building to win a national championship 
in three years. I have three years left. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do the math."

MOORPARK STUNS NO. 1 BAKERSFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMNGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his 16 seasons coaching the Moorpark College football team, Jim Bittner has 
seen plenty of spectacular plays and games. 
</P>
<P>
 But few probably compare to what he saw Saturday night as the Raiders upset 
the state's top-ranked team, Bakersfield, 23-20, in a Western State Conference 
interdivisional game before 8,000 at Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the biggest (victories) ever (for Moorpark)," Bittner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended a 17-game conference winning streak for the Renegades and 
most likely will drop them from the top spot in the state and the No. 2 ranking 
in the country by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sixth home defeat for Bakersfield since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorpark (3-1, 3-0 in conference play) had to hang on for the victory 
after taking a 23-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield (4-1, 3-1) was driving for what appeared to be a touchdown with 34 
seconds left when linebacker Robert Webb sacked Danny Henry near the Moorpark 
20-yard line and forced a fumble. Linebacker Jeffery Maxey recovered to kill 
the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Renegades closed the halftime deficit quickly in the third quarter, 
scoring on their first two possessions on runs of seven and 85 yards by George 
Jones. They added a 37-yard field goal by Robert Nycz midway through the 
quarter to pull to within 23-20, but the Moorpark defense held off other late 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark wasted little time taking a 6-0 lead when quarterback Damian Delfino 
connected with receiver Gregg Whitley on a three-yard pass play to cap a 
74-yard drive on the first possession. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders increased the lead to 9-0 on a 42-yard field goal by Steve Sabbe 
later in the first quarter. Defensive back Doyle Holmon set up the score with 
an interception of a pass by quarterback Deon Price. 
</P>
<P>
 On Moorpark's third possession, midway through the first quarter, Delfino 
found wide receiver Joaquin Evans at the Bakersfield five-yard line for a 
36-yard touchdown pass play that gave the Raiders a 16-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had planned to play-action pass, which we did early but they started 
bringing everybody (on defense) so we couldn't option-pass (in the second 
half)," Bittner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Raider defense, which forced five turnovers, went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 With 8 minutes 47 seconds remaining before halftime, nose guard Jason Sandel 
caused Price to fumble with a hard tackle. Maxey returned the fumble 12 yards 
to extend the Moorpark lead to 23-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield cut the lead on a 28-yard field goal by Nycz with 2:01 left in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark running back Gary Clemons had 120 yards in 24 carries, including a 
57-yard run that set up the first Raider touchdown. Delfino completed six of 12 
passes for 89 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, the state's leading rusher, had 181 yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry and starter Deon Price, who left the game because of an unspecified 
injury in the first half, combined for 11 completions in 19 attempts for 200 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shut down our offense," Bittner said. "We couldn't do anything against 
their defense . . . I was just happy when they were running and not passing."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / MIKE HISERMAN: IDLE TIME BECOMES MOUNTIES' PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bye-bye Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that, bye-bye-bye-bye. See ya next month. 
</P>
<P>
 At a point when most local high schools have hit the halfway point in their 
regular-season schedules, the Mounties are almost finished. 
</P>
<P>
 One game left, against Ganesha, on Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep played its one and only game of October on Thursday, defeating 
Gladstone, 20-7, at Citrus College. They need not rush breaking down the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween is closer to Thanksgiving than the Mounties are to their next 
football game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mar Vista canceled a game that was to be played next Friday and Cerritos was 
forced to pull out from an agreement to play the week after that. 
</P>
<P>
 The following Fridays, Oct. 28 and Nov. 4, already were open. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Reece, Montclair Prep's beleaguered athletic director, has been working 
the phones. Right now, the class dweeb has a better chance of getting a date. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep is a free-lance team, competing without league affiliation. And 
for that, the school has only itself to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Before its football program was rocked by recruiting and grade-fixing 
scandals, Montclair Prep was a member of the Alpha League. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been expelled, the Mounties are outcasts. Most other schools won't even 
meet them in a nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
 To fill in the blanks, Reece has been in touch with San Dimas, Sherman Indian 
and California School for the Deaf, among other possibilities. Coach George 
Giannini says the team's schedule might include another game or two by the end 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, current Mountie players are feeling pinched by their 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being punished for things that happened before a lot of us even came to 
Montclair," linebacker Anwan Jones said. "We're paying the consequences of 
their actions, and it's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a roll: The last time Moorpark won its first five games in a season, the 
team played only five games in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 With Santa Clara next up on its schedule, Moorpark is a cinch to win its sixth 
consecutive game, matching the longest winning streak of its 70-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 In their last 14 games dating back to last season, the Musketeers are 12-1-1 
-- the only loss coming against Atascadero in the secondround of the Southern 
Section Division IX playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's recent success has caught the fancy of fans, who are showing up in 
record numbers. An estimated 5,000 watched the Musketeers down Oak Park, 35-34, 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There at the end, they were really loud," Moorpark Coach Rob Dearborn said. 
"They were going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those watching was former Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia, recently hired 
by his former club as an instructor. Scioscia is a friend and business partner 
of Luja Bodesta, an orthopedic specialist who is Moorpark's team doctor. 
</P>

 Murphy's Law: Getting knocked out by three neighborhood bullies is one thing. 
Being out-jabbed is another. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy has lost three football games -- by a total of four points. 
</P>
<P>
 Close scores, big losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you lose rivalries, those are big losses," Coach Bob Francola said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first loss came against second-ranked Sylmar, 16-14. Then the Golden 
Cougars dropped a 7-6 decision to Granada Hills by missing a chip-shot field 
goal and having an extra-point attempt blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Their latest setback was to San Fernando, 21-20. The linescore of the game 
showed Kennedy failed on three two-point conversion tries. 
</P>
<P>
 The assumption is that Francola scrapped the kicking game altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so. Kennedy, which blew a 20-7 lead, tried a PAT after its first 
touchdown, but the holder couldn't get the ball on the tee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kicking problems haven't always been the kicker," Francola said. 
"Everybody else always make those plays look so easy. We keep making it an 
adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They're believers: Us, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Markham, first-year football coach at Bloomington High, must have the 
greatest tactical mind this side of that maniacal basketball coach from 
Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington's play-action attack faked Chaminade defenders out of their hip 
pads Friday night in a 72-14 rout. This against a team that opened the season 
with back-to-back shutouts and had held opponents to negative rushing yards 
after three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington had outscored the opposition, 280-31, in its first four games. 
But, heck, who had they played? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that's what we thought," said Jason Giovannettone, a Chaminade 
defensive back. "We didn't think they'd played anyone decent." 
</P>
<P>
 Giovannettone & Co. were a confident 3-1 coming in and a philosophical 3-2 
going out. "They're for real," Giovannettone said. "I hope this strikes a 
little fire in our heart to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two-liners: Ventura is the best 1-4 team in the region, and the Cougars proved 
it by defeating Hueneme, 51-0, and holding Viking tailback Ronney Jenkins to 61 
yards. Ventura opened the season with consecutive losses to Simi Valley, 
Westlake, Royal and Buena -- teams all ranked in The Times' regional Top 10. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 The most surprisingly strong team in the region would have to be Simi Valley, 
a squad picked to finish near the bottom of the Marmonte League standings by 
most alleged experts. The Pioneers are 4-0-1, 2-0 in league play. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular belief, having a great running game doesn't guarantee 
victory. Friday night's top rushers -- Monroe's Nick Nuccitelli (286 yards 
against Poly), and Grant's Di-Onte Smith (256 against Van Nuys) -- each ended 
up on the losing side. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Optional advice: Burbank opponents might want to try onside kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale tried kicking away from Carlos Baker Friday night, and with good 
reason. Baker, who had two returns for touchdowns last season, had scorched 
Arroyo on a 66-yard return the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
 So Glendale went to the other side, at Vaughn Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 Oops. Lucas took one back 81 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, Baker ended up burning the Dynamiters anyway, scoring on a 91-yard 
pass play. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 He's all wet: In an age when coaches routinely are drenched by icy buckets of 
fluid even after the most ordinary of victories, how in the world did Agoura 
water polo Coach Jason Rosenthal walk away from the pool Friday bone dry? 
</P>
<P>
 Easy. He lied. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura players threatened to submerge Rosenthal after the Chargers defeated 
Royal, 12-11, snapping Royal's 66-game Marmonte League winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 He persuaded them to defer by saying such a celebration was against CIF rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know if it is," Rosenthal said. "But that's what I told them." 
</P>
<P>
 Soak that man. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thought for the day: Steve Snyder, Royal's water polo coach, after his team's 
first loss in 67 league games: 
</P>
<P>
 "A jillion people in China still don't give a (darn)."

NORTHRIDGE BACKS INTO ROUT; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TRIO OF BALLCARRIERS HIT THEIR 
STRIDE IN ROTATION AS MATADORS DEFEAT SONOMA STATE, 40-14.

 Shaun Coleman is the living, breathing -- and for a moment, stumbling -- 
embodiment of what the Cal State Northridge backfield will look like the rest 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the clock winding down in the fourth quarter Saturday, Coleman took a 
handoff, almost fell before he took his second step, then bounced outside. 
</P>
<P>
 A moment later, Coleman surprised everybody by bolting down the left sideline 
for a 49-yard touchdown, one of three scores he managed in the game. All thanks 
to fresh legs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This from a burly fullback, one of three players in the Matadors' reborn 
backfield rotation that hit its stride in a 40-14 nonconference rout of Sonoma 
State before 936 at Cossack Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The prevailing theory about the backfield, after three games of treading 
water, is that Mark Harper, Darren Walton and Coleman are better collectively 
than individually. It's hard to argue. Northridge (3-2) rushed for 280 yards 
after rolling up 302 a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost fell down, but I had the strength to pull away," Coleman said of his 
final scoring run. "We have three good running backs that can run effectively 
out of both (backfield) positions." 
</P>
<P>
 The trio effectively ran Sonoma State out of its shoes. Each carried between 
seven and 17 times, ensuring that nobody was too beat up in the fourth quarter, 
as evidenced by Coleman's speedy jaunt around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll rotate all three the rest of the year as long as all three are 
healthy," Northridge Coach Bob Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time this season, senior quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin wasn't much 
of a factor. He completed seven of 16 passes for 114 yards and one touchdown. 
He had one pass intercepted.  
</P>
<P>
 "We needed that," said Coleman, who finished with a career-high 94 yards in 10 
carries and also scored on runs of 21 and two yards. "J.J. had a little bit of 
an off-day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice for us, because J.J. picked up the slack when we struggled the 
first three games." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper finished with a career-high 129 yards in 17 carries, marking his second 
consecutive 100-yard game. For the sake of perspective, Harper had a team-high 
99 yards on the ground after the first three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, a 5-foot-10, 225-pound senior, set the tone when he ran over a pair 
of would-be tacklers for a 21-yard score in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge held a 34-0 lead before Sonoma State (1-5) opened up on the Matador 
reserves. Another gauge of the lopsidedness: All 48 players on the road trip 
played for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as the running game was responsible for the victory -- the backfield 
averaged 7.0 yards a carry -- the secondary was a close second. 
</P>
<P>
 In what's become the Matadors' weekly ho-hum development, senior safety Joseph 
Vaughn intercepted another pass and returned it for a touchdown, his fourth in 
five games. Vaughn has six interceptions. Danny Garrett holds the school 
single-season record with nine interceptions in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn picked off a first-quarter pass by besieged junior Grant Parr and 
cruised down the sideline for a 38-yard score and a 14-0 lead. He ran within a 
few feet of the Northridge bench, which was either shocked or desensitized by 
the sight of Vaughn scoring yet again. Hardly anybody moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior cornerback Vinnie Johnson, however, came off the field shaking his head 
in disbelief and said to Burt: "I can't believe that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a four-year starter, has one interception, and for that, cornerback 
Jim Rose can be thankful. Few quarterbacks throw in Johnson's area, which meant 
plenty of business for Rose, who took over as a starter in the second week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, a junior from Pierce College and Monroe High, tied a school single-game 
record with three interceptions -- one for each earring he wears. Rose showed 
up for post-game interviews with a bandanna over his closely-cropped hair and a 
can of snuff tucked in his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just picked that up," he said of the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 After Vaughn's score, the Matadors chewed on the Cossacks some more, then spit 
'em out. 
</P>
<P>
 Walton, who carried seven times for 59 yards, gave Northridge a 21-0 lead on a 
27-yard run with 10 minutes 23 seconds left in the first half.  
</P>
<P>
 Coleman followed with a two-yard blast for a 28-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime Parr, playing because of an injury to starter Ryan Merrill, 
completed five of 14 passes and had three intercepted. He finished six of 20 
for 45 yards and had four picked off. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge outgained Sonoma State, 399-278. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt had to search long and hard to come up with something negative to say 
about the blowout. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's one thing I'm a little concerned about, it's the play of the 
back-up guys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, if there's only one thing to be concerned about, he's in darn good 
shape.

NORTHRIDGE BACKS INTO ROUT; OFFENSE: SUBSTITUTING FOR A TEAMMATE IN TROUBLE 
WITH THE LAW, MATADOR GUARD ERIC THOMAS HOLDS UP WELL IN LINE OF FIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an invisible umbrella over the 88th Street Church of God In Christ in 
South Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Thomas believes it is something more ethereal. Call it Providence, divine 
intervention. He calls it a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 No member of the congregation under the age of 25 has ever been killed, odds 
he considers astronomically long in light of the problems that plague the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many young African American youths in trouble and we've never 
had a funeral for anybody under 25," Thomas said. "In South Central L.A., 
people get shot every day." 
</P>
<P>
 He has the scars to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas tested the church's good fortune five years ago when, as a bystander, 
he was shot in the back during the holdup of a fast-food outlet in the same 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 As fate would have it, violence played a peripheral role as Thomas started for 
the first time in a year in Saturday's 40-14 rout of Sonoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas started at right guard in place of senior Jonathan Beauregard, who has 
been charged with two counts of attempted murder in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, who was cleared to play by Northridge officials while awaiting a 
disposition of his case in court, suffered a broken finger during practice this 
week, opening the door for Thomas. Accused gunman and shooting victim. One 
picking up for the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony has not been lost on many who know the story of the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone keeps bringing it up," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' story borders on the surreal. He was buying a hamburger on July 14, 
1989, when robbers started shooting up the place. Thomas was hit by a 
.25-caliber slug and fell in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the gunmen ran over to Thomas, who was bleeding profusely. Thomas was 
sure the gunman planned to finish him off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd seen their faces," Thomas said. "I was praying. I thought I was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Dead wrong. The gunman apologized, then fled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd always gone to church because my family wanted me to," Thomas said. "At 
that point, God told me He was real." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas begged gawkers for assistance. Nobody helped. Finally, he made his way 
back into the restaurant and told the manager he'd been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager didn't believe Thomas, until the lineman turned around and flashed 
the back of his shirt, now saturated in blood. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Thomas three years to get well. He fought off a debilitating bout of 
jaundice. Two years ago, the bullet finally passed through his digestive tract. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of the most-popular players on the team. Coach Bob Burt thinks so 
much of Thomas that he has been known to apologize for using profanity in his 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great guy, a super kid," Burt said. "To overcome the things he's had 
to deal with says lots about his character. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's respected by everybody on the team because he's not a selfish player. 
He's a team player." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Thomas made his only start in Northridge's 24-18 upset of Nevada 
Las Vegas, one of the biggest victories in school history. It was his swan 
song, it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, two weeks before the 1994 summer practice sessions opened, Thomas 
learned the NCAA had given him another season of eligibility, largely because 
of the nature of his physical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life's been incredible," Thomas said. "Two weeks before we start and I get 
another chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas will give Beauregard another chance too. "I feel for him," Thomas said. 
"I'm praying for him . . . I'm praying for everybody."

LAST PLAY DOES IN WHITTIER CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE LACQUES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mario Qualls scored on a two-yard run as time expired, giving Malibu Camp 
Kilpatrick a 13-12 nonleague victory over Whittier Christian on Saturday night 
at Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls' run capped a 14-play, 63-yard drive during which the Eagles converted 
two fourth downs, including a fourth and 24. Camp Kilpatrick quarterback Cesar 
Cuevas hit Henry Flowers for 27 yards on fourth and 24 from the Whittier 
Christian 44, giving the Eagles a first down at the Heralds' 17 with 1 minute 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, the Eagles had a fourth and four from the Whittier 
Christian 11, but Cuevas hit Flowers for a nine-yard completion to Whittier 
Christian's two-yard line with 6 seconds left. Qualls scored on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp Kilpatrick (4-1) trailed, 12-0, entering the fourth quarter, but Qualls 
scored on an 11-yard run with 11:21 left to cut the lead to 12-7. Qualls, who 
finished with 124 yards in 19 carries, gained 16 yards on fourth and three from 
the Heralds' 27 to set up his score. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier Christian (4-1) managed only one first down and 27 yards offense in 
the second half. Nick Valdez led the Heralds with 98 yards rushing in 22 
carries and two touchdowns. He was held to 17 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heralds drove 89 yards in 11 plays to score on their first possession. 
Valdez carried nine times for 72 yards on the drive and capped it with a 
three-yard touchdown run with 6:42 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heralds also scored on their last drive of the half. They had the ball on 
Camp Kilpatrick's 30 after Jason McCleary intercepted a Cuevas pass and 
returned it 39 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Six plays moved the Heralds to Camp Kilpatrick's three-yard line from where 
Valdez took it in with 27 seconds left.

VILLAGE CHRISTIAN'S FIVE FIELD GOALS TOO MUCH FOR SCC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Village Christian's Ignacio Brache, who kicked field goals of 35, 42, 48, 55 
and 56 yards in the Crusaders' 29-14 victory over Southern California Christian 
on Friday, is still striving for his ultimate goal -- a Southern Section record 
for the longest field goal. Oak Park's Eric Affholter set the record with a 
64-yarder in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we crossed the (50-yard line), I didn't want to go any further because 
he was so hot," Village Christian Coach Mike Plaisance said. "I thought about 
taking two delay-of-game penalties -- all of those things go through your mind 
-- but, I didn't want (SCC Coach Bert Esposito) to think we were running up the 
score. We definitely wanted to give him a chance to break the record." Village 
Christian is 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Brache broke his Division X record with the 56-yard kick, which is two yards 
longer than last year's record. His five field goals also tie a Southern 
Section record held by four kickers for most field goals in a single game and 
break a school record held by Jason Jones, who kicked four in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Buhler rushed for 156 yards in 18 carries, including a 78-yard touchdown 
run, for Southern California Christian (1-4).

ANTELOPE VALLEY'S WOES CONTINUE IN 32-14 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brent Carder is in his 25th year coaching at Antelope Valley College, but if 
there is a silver lining to be found this season, his football team is having a 
difficult time finding it. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley dropped a 32-14 Foothill Conference game to Grossmont on 
Saturday, dropping the Marauders to 1-4, 1-1 in conference play, one of their 
worst starts under Carder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stunk," said Carder. "I wish I could be more articulate, but I can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossmont held a 17-0 lead in the third quarter before Antelope Valley rallied 
with two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley drove 84 yards in 10 plays and scored on Domino Gibson's 
three-yard run. That drive was the longest for Antelope Valley this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the fourth quarter, Christopher Brown scored on a 53-yard pass play 
from Michael Gleich. With Zoltan Matrai's conversion kick, the Marauders 
trailed by three, 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley's defense then fell apart, however, and the Griffins (3-1, 
1-1) scored 15 consecutive points to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were flat coming into the game," Antelope Valley defensive back Jarod 
Dodson said. "They have a high-powered offense, but that's no excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted it more than us." 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley had its usual allotment of turnovers, with two interceptions 
and two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Antelope Valley did gain 330 yards, almost double its average output 
this season.

BALANCED OREGON STATE DEFEATS NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oregon State women's volleyball team used a balanced attack to defeat Cal 
State Northridge, 15-12, 15-9, 11-15, 15-10, Saturday night in a nonconference 
match at Corvallis, Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (10-7) were led by Missy Clements, who had a match-high 20 kills, 
but were undone by 31 team hitting errors to finish with a hitting percentage 
of only .103. 
</P>
<P>
 Matador Aimee Stone notched 12 kills but had 14 errors. Teammate Heather 
Anderson added 11 kills, and setter Kathleen Shannon had 39 set assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State is 11-6.

LIGHTS GO OUT FOR CAL LUTHERAN AGAIN; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: HALFTIME LEAD 
DISAPPEARS QUICKLY AND KINGSMEN FALL TO LA VERNE, 23-6. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Joe Harper's got the right idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we could play at night," the Cal Lutheran football coach said, 
"somewhere where we could just pull the lights at halftime." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen might as well, because they have been falling asleep in the 
second half so far this season. It happened again Saturday, when they fell to 
La Verne, 23-6, in a Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
game at Mt. Clef Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran led, 6-3, at halftime, then played a second half that was so bad 
offensively, the numbers are hardly believable. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Kingsmen had a net loss of 26 yards in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 * They did not make a first down. In fact, they didn't get closer than seven 
yards from the first-down marker. 
</P>
<P>
 * Their first possession of the half began at their 31. They could not advance 
farther the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened," Cal Lutheran tailback Terrence Thomas said, "but 
it's happened two weeks in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Kingsmen (1-3, 1-2 in the SCIAC) led Occidental, 17-13, in the 
fourth quarter, but lost, 19-17. They have been outscored, 78-33, in the second 
half this season. They have been ahead or tied at halftime of every game, yet 
have won only once. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem this week, as last week, was on the line of scrimmage. Cal 
Lutheran linemen simply couldn't keep the Leopards (4-0, 3-0) out of their 
backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lack of consistency blocking is where our problem is and unless we 
can get that cured, we won't be a good offensive team," Harper said. "Yet we 
recognize we have to play within the limitations of the personnel we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper would not go so far as to say his linemen were physically overmatched, 
just that they were making too many physical and mental errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Ryan Huisenga, who was sacked three times, said the team's problem 
was it failed to spread out the defense with passes, allowing La Verne to stack 
up on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put about a million guys in the middle," Huisenga said. "I have 
confidence in our line, but they are being asked to do something that . . . is 
pretty hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense also was asked to do something difficult: stop La Verne's offense, 
which averaged 496 yards and 47 points a game and was ranked fifth in Division 
III. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense held the Leopards to a field goal in the first half. And the 
Kingsmen went into the locker room with a 6-3 lead because of a 15-yard 
touchdown pass from Huisenga to Billy Parra in the second quarter. The 
extra-point kick sailed wide. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the 61 yards Cal Lutheran gained on that drive would be 
nearly half its game total of 128. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just stopped ourselves," Thomas said. "We do well in the first half then 
we just shoot ourselves in the foot." 
</P>
<P>
 While the offense struggled, it put the defense in precarious situations. 
Because the Kingsmen were usually punting out of their end zone, La Verne 
started five of seven second-half possessions in Cal Lutheran territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough," said linebacker Chris Peltonen, who had 16 tackles. "But 
that's our job, to hold them." 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne took a 10-6 lead on a one-yard dive by quarterback Ryan Campuzano 
with three minutes to play in the third quarter. Campuzano added another 
touchdown on a six-yard run with 10:46 to play in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Darren MacClellan, the leading rusher in the conference, scored 
on a five-yard run with 7:05 to play, putting the game well out of reach for 
Cal Lutheran's sputtering offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The matchup between MacClellan and Thomas, the top two rushers in the SCIAC, 
never materialized. Although Thomas had outgained MacClellan, 67-54, at 
halftime, MacClellan finished with a 205-68 advantage.

FRESNO CITY HANDS VENTURA ITS FIRST LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seemed like old times Saturday night: 
</P>
<P>
 Times the Ventura College football team would just as soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno City's potent offense was too much for Ventura to handle and the 
Pirates suffered a 42-16 nonconference loss at Ventura High before 3,500 fans 
-- their largest crowd of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (3-1) entered the game ranked No. 21 in the nation by USA Today. But 
the Pirates had not met a team as talented as Fresno (4-1), ranked No. 20 in 
the same poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Daimon Shelton and Frankie Sinclair combined for 358 yards rushing and Josh 
Bravo passed for 170 yards as Fresno rolled up 548 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Coach George Rosales was disappointed with the result, but not with 
his team's effort. "That's the best team we'll see all year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, which finished with 235 total yards, scored first, capping a 72-yard 
drive with a two-yard run by Gordy Abellera. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fresno scored the next 35 points. Sinclair did much of the damage, scoring 
touchdowns on runs of 15 and 85 yards and a 30-yard screen-pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinclair finished with 155 yards rushing and Shelton had 203.

GLENDALE SHUTS OUT SANTA MONICA 
</P>

 He might not be blessed with great moves or outstanding speed, but Glendale 
College tailback Ilan Zilberman displayed plenty of endurance in the Vaqueros' 
18-0 victory over host Santa Monica in a Western State Conference football game 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Zilberman, a 5-foot-10, 180-pound sophomore from Grant High, rushed for a 
game-high 126 yards in 25 carries and scored a touchdown as Glendale (2-2, 1-2 
in conference play) snapped a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaquero fullback Hector Valencia complemented Zilberman nicely with 98 yards 
in 11 carries and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to run the ball well if we wanted to win this game," Zilberman 
said. "We knew coming in that we needed to establish the run so we could 
control the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Operating behind a typically mammoth Glendale offensive line, Zilberman rushed 
for 103 yards in 15 carries in the first half to help the Vaqueros take a 12-0 
lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale, which amassed 229 of its 344 yards in offense in the first half, 
took a 6-0 lead with 7 minutes 39 seconds left in the second quarter on a 
seven-yard run by Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia's run capped an 11-play, 58-yard drive following a Santa Monica 
fumble. Zilberman gained 40 yards in six carries during the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia scored Glendale's final touchdown on a 49-yard run up the middle on 
the Vaqueros' first possession of the second half.

PREP CROSS-COUNTRY ROUNDUP; KATELLA BOYS EDGE SANTA ANA AT INVITATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a showdown of Orange County's top two rated boys' cross-country teams, 
Katella beat Santa Ana, 69-75, to win the Division I team title Saturday at the 
Fountain Valley-Huntington Beach Invitational at Central Park in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella, which has been No. 1 in the county polls since the preseason, was 
paced by junior Edgar Benitez, who ran the three-mile course in 15 minutes 53 
seconds, good enough for third place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints, the defending county champions and No. 2 in the county poll, 
placed three runners among the top seven, but could not beat the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Santa Ana's in the race, our guys get excited," Katella Coach Mike 
Cochrane said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really trying to hold them back to prepare for next week (the county 
championships)." 
</P>
<P>
 Wenceslado Morales (16:01), Luis Zaragoza (16:09) and Danny Rivero (16:12) 
were fifth, sixth and seventh for the Saints, the defending Sunset League 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Katella boys' team was not the only Knight squad to find Central Park to 
its liking. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Vaicaro led the girls' team to the Division I team title by finishing 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaicaro pulled away from University's Meisha Wilson just after the two-mile 
mark, cruising to a five-second victory with a winning time of 19:01. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed that I left her (Wilson) on top of the hill," said Vaicaro, a 
senior who posted the day's second-fastest time overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaicaro's winning effort helped the Knights (51 points) handle Fountain Valley 
(107) and Alta Loma (125). 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons fell victim to much the same problem as the Saints' boys' team, 
placing three runners among the race's top five, but they didn't have the depth 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons' Angie Winkler (19:26), Becca Armour (19:31) and Andrea Craddock 
(20:03) were third, fourth and fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks dominated the competition in Division II, scoring only 26 points 
to win the boys' race and 29 for victory on the girls' side. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancer standouts Kevin O'Doherty (15:20) and Kim Mortensen (18:33) easily 
posted the day's fastest times while winning individual titles in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cross-country meets: 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena boys win in New York -- Shawn Syphers finished 11th (13:37), Ryan 
Emenaker finished 13th (13:44), Zach Amos finished 15th (13:48) and Jason Shook 
finished 18th (13:51) to lead El Modena to a first-place finish in its race at 
the 2.5-mile Manhattan Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Kennedy finished 21st (13:54) and Tim Allen finished 25th (13:57) for El 
Modena, which finished in the top five among all 294 schools divided among 
seven races. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' race, Jessica Dahlberg finished 32nd (15:53), Tara Whitfield 
finished 36th (16:08) and Leslie Burton finished 38th (16:11), helping El 
Modena to an eighth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Also finishing for El Modena was Kim Lacher, Katie Kennedy and Kaylee 
Whitfield. The girls' race included 30 teams from 11 states. MATT FARMER

PONN HELPS MAYFAIR BEAT CALVARY CHAPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Travis Ponn rushed for 94 yards in 11 carries and two touchdowns as Lakewood 
Mayfair defeated Calvary Chapel, 25-13, Saturday night at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponn and quarterback Sean Augustine were the main offensive weapons for the 
Monsoons (3-2).Augustine threw for 79 yards and one touchdown and ran for 52 
yards in 16 carries, including the team's first score. That came on a 14-yard 
touchdown run on the first play of the second quarter, giving Mayfair a 7-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine made it 13-0 with a 15-yard pass to Dan August with about eight 
minutes remaining in the first half. August caught four passes for 49 yards to 
lead the Monsoons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calvary Chapel offense was lead by senior quarterback Waylan Kruse. Kruse 
completed eight of 13 passes for 117 yards before injuring his ankle late in 
the first half. The Eagles (3-2) went to their fourth-string quarterback, Mark 
Echan, and relied primarily on their running game during the second half. Ken 
Nash had 117 yards rushing, 73 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Lineman Steve Eby recovered a bad snap on a punt attempt in the end zone to 
cut the Monsoon lead to 13-7, but that was the closest the Eagles came all 
night. Mayfair scored the next 12 points on two Ponn runs (one and eight yards) 
to put the game out of reach. TONY ALTOBELLI

CANYON SPRINGS HANDS IRVINE THIRD LOSS IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moreno Valley Canyon Springs avenged last year's loss to Irvine in the 
Division IV championship game with a 31-0 nonleague victory Saturday night at 
Valley View High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars (4-1), top-ranked in Division IV, lost to Irvine, 41-14, last year 
in the title game at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday night they dominated Irvine, limiting the Vaqueros to 155 yards 
total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (2-3) lost its third consecutive game. Irvine quarterback Scott Larsen 
completed only six of 17 passes for 82 yards and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Springs took a 3-0 lead on a 26-yard field goal by Brandon Reitan with 
five minutes left in the first quarter. The Cougars then moved to a 10-0 lead 
on a 52-yard touchdown run by Ryan Pizinger with 11:50 left in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Springs added another score late in the first half. The Cougars got the 
ball on the Irvine 31-yard line after an 11-yard punt by Larsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight plays later, quarterback Ryan Roques connected with Matt Driscoll on a 
14-yard pass with 25 seconds left in the second quarter to give the Cougars a 
17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Roques then scored from four yards with 7:24 left to play for a 24-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Springs capped the scoring when Terrelle Smith scored on a 68-yard 
touchdown run with 2:44 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith led Canyon Springs, rushing for 122 yards in 13 carries; Pizinger rushed 
for 95 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Diehl led Irvine rushing with 75 yards in 21 carries. Danny Noisy caught 
three passes for 27 yards for the Vaqueros.

BLOCKBUSTER TALENT; WESTLAKE HIGH'S DAVID BLOCK IS A GOAL-ORIENTED WATER POLO 
PLAYER WHO HAS HIS SIGHTS SET ON A COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP AND A SHOT AT THE 2000 
OLYMPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Basia Fisher wasn't sure just how good her son, David Block, was at this water 
polo thing until an expert cleared it up for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "A coach that first saw him came to me and said, 'This boy has tremendous 
talent, more than the norm. You really need to take him and expose him to the 
college coaches,' " Fisher remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Block was barely 14 at the time. And he'd been playing water polo for a grand 
total of two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach was Craig Rond, founder of the Southcoast Water Polo Club in 
Thousand Oaks, and he was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still remember my first practice," said Block, now a senior at Westlake 
High. "Shooting in the pool, I made all my shots and I said to myself, 'I might 
be pretty good at this sport.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three months, Block has traveled twice to Europe and once to 
Hawaii for all-star water polo events. He won a gold medal with a 17-and-under 
all-star team that played for two weeks in Greece in August. Block's play in 
Greece left an impression on Don Stoll, who coached that team and five Southern 
Section championship teams in the past six years at El Toro High. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to me," Stoll said. "With no formal background in swimming or 
water polo, for him to be as talented as he is in just four years is just 
remarkable. . . . I'd love to have him on my team." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most significant praise, however, comes from U.S. Olympic water 
polo Coach Rich Corso, who also coaches at Harvard-Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's good. He is a one-man team (at Westlake). He's improved a lot 
over the last 10 months," Corso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corso, who has coached Block in clubs and clinics at Harvard-Westlake, said 
it's too early to gauge the chances of Block reaching his goal: the 2000 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to take him out of this area and he's got to play against guys who 
are his caliber or better before you can determine that," Corso said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for Block will be college water polo, probably at Pepperdine, 
Stanford, USC or UCLA. Coaches from those schools have been in regular contact 
with Block and his coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (college coaches) get ahold of him," Stoll said, "there's so much raw 
material I'm sure they can refine him to be much better than he is now." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to other area high school players, Block doesn't have much room for 
improvement. In 11 games, the 6-foot-2, 175-pound hole-man has scored 55 goals 
and had 14 assists. He has two 10-goal games and has carried the Warriors to a 
7-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a kid who began playing water polo simply because his mother 
wouldn't allow him to play high school football. Too violent, she said. So he 
figured he would try a sport he had watched on television -- once, during the 
1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 When Block first jumped into a pool for water polo, his best asset was a 
strong, accurate arm. He had been a quarterback, after all. Throwing the ball 
into the goal? No problem. Swimming? Well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started, the swimming part was really tough," he said. "I was 
really slow." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Block managed to win the most valuable player award for the Westlake 
junior varsity his freshman year. That spring, he joined the Westlake swimming 
team, and improved dramatically. Last spring, he qualified for the Southern 
Section Division I championships in the 200-meter individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore, Block was the named second-team All-Marmonte League. He made 
the first team last season and was the team MVP after scoring 65 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's anyone in the Marmonte League who can stop him one on 
one," Westlake teammate Scott Weigel said. "There are games when he gets the 
ball in the hole and he just turns and scores every time." 
</P>
<P>
 As the hole-man, Block's job is to camp in front of the opponent's goal, like 
a floating post-up player. Because he's so good, teams often double- or 
triple-team him, Westlake Coach Mike Power said. But they don't stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can have three guys on him and shake them off and still keep control of 
the ball in one hand," Power said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Block's proficiency is the result of 10 months of grueling work 
following his junior season at Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 He played last winter for the National Youth Development Team, which worked 
out for about six hours each Saturday in El Toro -- about a four-hour round 
trip from Block's home in Westlake Village. On Sundays, he played two hours 
with a club team based at Harvard-Westlake in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Block played with the club team at Pepperdine. He was also chosen 
as captain of a 16-and-under team from Southern California that traveled to 
Hungary for a series of games, including one against the Hungarian national 
19-and-under team. Block's team lost, 11-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month after returning from Hungary, Block traveled to Greece with 
a 17-and-under all-star team. He stopped briefly in Los Angeles on his way from 
Greece to Hawaii, where he played in another invitational all-star tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything you tell him, he would do it and get better right away. . . ," said 
Stoll, the 17-and-under all-star coach. "Some things take four or five years 
for a kid to learn, and he seems to pick them up right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Power said Block has been using what he's learned over the summer to help his 
Warrior teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He showed us a lot of defensive plays and a lot of offensive plays," Power 
said. "He kind of took it into his own hands to say, 'Hey guys, if you want to 
be good, this is the way to do it.' "

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: HARVARD KNOCKS OFF NOTRE DAME; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: 
VOTED OUT OF LEAGUE, WOLVERINES STUN KNIGHTS IN NONLEAGUE GAME, 14-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mission League doesn't have Harvard-Westlake High to kick around anymore. 
So, defending league-champion Notre Dame figured to get in a few final kicks in 
a nonleague game at Harvard on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was Notre Dame that got the boot, as Harvard rallied for a 14-10 
victory to stun the previously unbeaten Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard (3-1-1), voted out of the Mission League this season to make room for 
Serra, was out-gained, 313 yards to 197, and spent much of the game with its 
defense on the field trying to ebb Notre Dame's offensive surges. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, the outcome was determined by Kevin Goldfein's leaping end-zone 
interception with 1 minute 18 seconds to play. Ryan Bowne, who completed 15 of 
26 passes for 111 yards, drove Notre Dame (4-1) from its 49-yard line to the 
Harvard 12 in the final three minutes. The turnover was the third of the game 
for Notre Dame, ranked No. 3 in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to tell our guys all week that Harvard is a very good 
football team," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said. "We don't have any 
excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the first for Harvard against Notre Dame since the teams first 
met in 1992. But Coach Dave Bennett downplayed its significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We erased that Mission League stuff from the start of the season," Bennett 
said. "That meant nothing to us." 
</P>
<P>
 That's hard to believe, considering how ecstatic the Wolverines were at the 
final gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the greatest victory we've ever had here," wide receiver Kadar Lewis 
said. "No one is ever gonna forget this." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' performance was most memorable. In the second quarter, he broke loose 
after catching a swing pass from quarterback Derek Lemkin and dashed 80 yards 
for a touchdown to give Harvard a 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 With eight minutes to play in the game, Lewis made what might rank as the 
Wolverines' play of the season by running 40 yards on a brilliantly executed 
double reverse. The call came on third and 21 from Harvard's 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Lemkin hit Charu Turner with a 22-yard touchdown pass that 
proved decisive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, we know Notre Dame is the best team we're going to play," said 
Lemkin, who survived five sacks to complete four of 12 passes for 114 yards. 
"If we beat Notre Dame, we can beat anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame, coming off a 34-24 victory over Crespi, took a 3-0 lead on Chris 
Sailer's 55-yard field goal in the first quarter. Sailer missed on attempts 
from 54 and 55. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights marched 83 yards in 14 plays to begin the third quarter and take a 
10-7 lead. Fullback Don Ebenhoch dove one yard for the touchdown.

BRACHE'S 56-YARD FIELD GOAL ONLY 8 YARDS SHY OF RECORD 
</P>

<P>
 Five field goals in a single game is quite an achievement for a high school 
kicker, but it isn't exactly what Village Christian's Ignacio Brache had in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Brache, who kicked field goals of 35, 42, 48, 55 and 56 yards in the 
Crusaders' 29-14 win over Southern California Christian on Friday, is still 
striving for his ultimate goal -- a Southern Section record for the longest 
field goal.Oak Park's Eric Affholter set the record with a 64-yard kick in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we crossed (the 50-yard line), I didn't want to go any farther because 
he was so hot," Village Christian Coach Mike Plaisance said. "I thought about 
taking two delay-of-game penalties -- all of those things go through your mind 
-- but, I didn't want (Bert Esposito, the Southern California Christian coach) 
to think we were running up the score." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Brache can take solace in the fact that he broke his own Division X 
record by two yards. Also, his five field goals tied a Southern Section record 
held by four other kickers for most field goals in a single game. PAIGE A.

COMPANY AT CROSSROADS WITH NEW CHIEF IN CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the past 13 years, Peter M. Ochs has constructed Southern California's 
largest privately owned home building firm -- the Fieldstone Group of Cos. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its formation, the Newport Beach home builder has sold more than 12,500 
homes throughout California, generating a total of nearly $2.5 billion in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Southern California real estate watchers say the building concern is at a 
turning point. Although Fieldstone will surely do well after Ochs leaves the 
helm in a few months for an extended sabbatical in Spain, it is unclear how 
much success the company will have in the increasingly competitive regional 
home building market.  
</P>
<P>
 A well-respected company that Ochs said he operates on Christian principles, 
Fieldstone must continue to find steady sources of building capital and 
continue to innovate if it wants to recapture the influential industry position 
it held in the mid-1980s, real estate watchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fieldstone needs to go back and look at what it did at the beginning, when it 
was innovative and creative," said Kenneth W. Agid, a real estate consultant in 
Irvine, who said the company used to be more of a leader in home design and 
promotion.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like they've gone from being I. Magnin to being a Ross Dress for Less. 
They shouldn't just look at the bottom line, the company should reassume its 
leadership position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Keith Johnson, who owns a minority stake in Fieldstone Co. and a 23% 
stake in the two affiliated companies -- Fieldstone Communities Inc. and 
Cypress Homes -- will be the leader to decide the company's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great challenge and opportunity for Keith -- it's like following a 
baseball coach who won 20 World Series," said Randall Lewis, executive vice 
president with Lewis Homes of Upland, which builds homes priced around $200,000 
in Orange and Riverside counties. "But Keith is extremely capable and will 
leave his imprint on the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a wiry, 6-foot-4 executive with a passion for duck-hunting and 
fly-fishing, said that he plans to steer the company in the same direction as 
its chief executive officer, fine-tuning as he goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only the future will tell whether our decisions are right or not, and that is 
part of what's fun about this industry," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And these days, the industry is pondering Fieldstone's future. Several experts 
suggest that Fieldstone is either a prime acquisition target for a larger, 
perhaps out-of-state builder, or a good candidate to become a publicly traded 
company, though Ochs and Johnson say there are no plans for a public offering 
of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 When the market for real estate fell in the late 1980s, Fieldstone was saddled 
with large amounts of land it couldn't sell. The company is still trying to 
restructure loans on two troubled projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1993, Fieldstone made headlines when it defaulted on a $150-million 
loan for a 2,300-acre community in northern San Diego County called La Costa, 
which is not connected to the famed spa of same name. Fieldstone purchased the 
property in a joint venture with a Canadian builder at the height of the market 
in 1988, and planned to build 3,600 homes on the site. Only a handful have been 
built. 
</P>
<P>
 Company documents show the La Costa project is now worth about $75 million. 
Ochs said Fieldstone is currently working with lenders to restructure the debt 
and begin building again. 
</P>
<P>
 Another formerly troubled project was called the Vistas, a 584-acre 
residential development in Rancho Santa Margarita.  
</P>
<P>
 Fieldstone went into default on several construction loans for the Vistas 
project, but has restructured that debt with $140 million in construction loans 
obtained in August from Bank of America and First Interstate, according to 
Ochs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has built and sold only about half of the 1,800 homes planned for 
the project. But it plans to build more with the recent construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 And at least one banker said that Fieldstone is a good long-term bet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a real estate developer that hasn't suffered in this 
market," said Kurt Kraushaar, manager of the real estate department for Union 
Bank in Irvine, which has about $50 million in loans outstanding to Fieldstone. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they are very well-regarded. Fieldstone is a company that Union Bank is 
going to continue to work with. They will be a force in this market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Fieldstone built 1,084 homes and condos for an average price of 
$309,000, making it the largest private home builder in Southern California -- 
second only to Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., the publicly traded Los Angeles firm 
that built 2,642 homes. But Fieldstone said it expects its revenues to decline 
this year to $235 million from $254 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochs is a former president and Johnson used to head the San Diego division of 
the William Lyon Co. in Newport Beach, once Southern California's largest home 
builder. Ochs left Lyon in 1981, in the middle of an earlier housing slump, to 
form Fieldstone Co. with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Their company built 89 homes that first year on its San Diego holdings, which 
had room for 2,000 homes, posting sales of $11 million. By 1985, the company 
had sold 994 homes and had expanded into Orange, Los Angeles and Riverside 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Though known for its management strengths, sound business principles and 
support of employees, in recent years few in the industry have considered 
Fieldstone a leader in home design. Ochs has said he leaves experimentation to 
others and concentrates on delivering a well-built home at a competitive price. 
But Fieldstone is not considered an entry-level builder like Kaufman & Broad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the flashiest or the boxiest product, it's somewhere in the middle," 
said Lewis, of Lewis homes. "Fieldstone's product is like Kellogg's cereal, 
it's not focaccia and it's not sushi." 
</P>
<P>
 The average Fieldstone house is priced about $50,000 higher than the average 
of $250,000 paid for a typical home in Orange County, although many buyers and 
real estate watchers say that Fieldstone homes still provide a good housing 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 But homeowners are not always happy with Fieldstone. In 1991, the San Diego 
district attorney's office launched a preliminary investigation into a local 
housing project where buyers complained of unfair pricing practices by 
Fieldstone. No action was ever taken, according to Cliff Dobrin, assistant 
chief of the fraud division in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers complained that Fieldstone agents told them to buy soon because home 
prices were going up, when in fact, Fieldstone lowered prices on later homes in 
projects, reducing the values of their homes. Fieldstone argued that its prices 
were reduced because of the real estate downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry homeowners picketed Fieldstone developments and a group of San Diego 
homeowners filed a lawsuit against Fieldstone that year. The suit was later 
settled through arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldstone has also tangled with environmental groups, especially after Ochs' 
very public efforts in 1988 to defeat Measure A, a countywide, slow-growth 
initiative. The building industry put up most of the $1.8 million raised to 
defeat the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly don't think too highly of Fieldstone," said Craig Beneville, an 
activist with Earth First! in Orange County. "They are just making profits off 
the plunder of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the foes Fieldstone has made through the years, real estate 
experts single out the company as a competitor to be reckoned with -- an 
ethical builder in an industry not always known for its ethics, with a 
reputation for quality leaders and good timing. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shumway, president of Market Profiles, a Costa Mesa real estate 
consulting firm that works with many builders, suggested that Fieldstone will 
prosper into the next century because of its good reputation and savvy 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't, it would shake my faith in the whole industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Roland F. Osgood, a president with Kaufman & Broad's home building 
division in Newport Beach, said Johnson and Fieldstone may be in for some rough 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 "They started that company in 1981 and they couldn't have hit the market any 
better. They had a good run," he said. "They're good people, but I think 
they're going to have a tough time. They are not real aggressive in the land 
market right now, and their competitors are very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Webb, president of the south coast division of Greystone Homes in 
Newport Beach, said that Fieldstone may be wise to sit back and wait, 
especially as land prices are dramatically increasing and the company has 
sufficient land holdings to build on for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know what they are doing," he said. Fieldstone Group

DEVELOPER'S NEW GOAL: BUILD FAITH; PETER OCHS TO TRADE HELM OF FIELDSTONE FOR 
MISSIONARY WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the time he was 9, Peter M. Ochs could be found on hisfather's construction 
sites collecting stray nails in a tin can -- the sixth generation of his family 
to show a passion for building. 
</P>
<P>
 The nails eventually formed a kingdom of houses, as Ochs grew up to create the 
largest privately owned home builder in Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 But now Ochs, a self-made multimillionaire real estate developer and deeply 
religious man, plans to make good on his longtime claim to start another career 
at the age of 50. He and his wife, Gail, plan to leave for Spain in about four 
months, where they will learn Spanish in preparation for Christian missionary 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County home building community is about to lose one of its most 
respected and envied leaders, as Ochs is planning to devote almost all of his 
time to missionary work in Latin America, just when the building industry is 
limping out of the recession and struggling to define its new role in the 
changing Southern California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He commanded the respect of all his peers in the industry," said Sanford 
Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego. "Ochs was a businessman who 
happened to be a home builder -- but he could have headed any Fortune 500 
company. He was elegant, disciplined and an excellent leader," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ochs will remain as chairman of Fieldstone and will keep his undisclosed 
ownership stake in the company and two affiliates: Fieldstone Communities Inc. 
and Cypress Homes. But leading the Fieldstone Group of Cos. into the next 
century will be Keith Johnson, 51, the other co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I took Fieldstone to a stage, and I'm pleased with it," Ochs said 
during an interview at his Newport Beach office, where he displays part of his 
large collection of California Impressionist paintings. "Now it needs to be 
taken to the next stage. And another hand on the wheel will be better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see myself as an active chairman, though I won't be very active from 
Spain," he said. "I won't be setting strategies -- that's the CEO's job." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochs' move to leave at such a relatively young age recalls a decision made by 
another top executive: pizza baron Tom Monaghan, who retired as president of 
Domino's Pizza Inc., based in Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1989 to spend more time 
serving the church. But two years later, after unsuccessfully trying to sell 
the company, Monaghan was back as president.  
</P>
<P>
 Ochs doesn't expect that to happen. He is committed to expanding "First 
Fruit," a foundation he funds to raise the standard of living in other 
countries and recruit converts to Christianity. His ministry work will take him 
frequently to Latin America, but Ochs will also spend time in the United States 
raising money for his projects. 
</P>
<P>
 While working in remote locales, Ochs plans to travel light. Though he remains 
Fieldstone's non-executive chairman, he will be virtually out of reach during 
his missionary ventures.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we are hit with a crisis -- we'll handle it," said Johnson, the new CEO. 
"When he's in Spain," he said of Ochs, "I expect we'll meet with him before he 
goes, then we won't hear from him for three months."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ochs plans to leave both his collection of Fieldstone homes and his extensive 
collection of California art. The headquarters for his Fieldstone Group of Cos. 
now houses one of the finest gatherings of California Impressionist paintings 
anywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 "Collections, like a business, come to an end when you can no longer add 
substance to them. You can still enjoy it, but it is no longer as dynamic," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochs comes from a long line of home builders starting with his 
great-great-grandfather, who was a bricklayer. His great-grandfather was home 
builder, as was his father. Ochs values his heritage. One of the paintings in 
his office depicts a snowy street scene in Bethlehem, Pa. -- the city where 
Ochs grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing undergraduate studies at Princeton University, Ochs went to 
Stanford University, where he received a master's degree in business 
administration in 1967. Upon graduation, he took a job in the mergers and 
acquisitions department of American Standard Corp. in New York, where he led 
the company's entry into real estate development. 
</P>
<P>
 He left within a few years, though, because he wanted to create something not 
only valuable but also tangible. He came west to help form William Lyon Co., 
which by the late 1980s had become Southern California's top home builder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I drive through Orange County neighborhoods I built 20 years ago 
and just look at people living their lives in those homes," Ochs said. "It's 
very satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 He became president of the company in 1975 when founder William Lyon accepted 
an offer from the Pentagon to head the Air Force Reserve. Lyon returned in 1979 
to reassume his previous position, but Ochs was not ready to step down. 
Instead, the two men negotiated a compromise in which Ochs exchanged his stake 
in the Lyon Co. for ownership of the company's holdings in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned a tremendous amount from him," Ochs said of Lyon, who could not be 
reached for comment. "We're friendly competitors now." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Ochs and Johnson, who was head of the San Diego division, 
pooled their resources and spun off from William Lyon Co. to form Fieldstone 
Co. Since 1981, the company has built 12,500 homes in Southern California, 
generating sales of $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In an industry known for its shoot-from-the-hip mavericks, the soft-spoken 
Ochs earned the reputation of being just the opposite: thoughtful and 
deliberate. Associates describe him as someone they can trust to close a deal 
with just a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ochs is someone who really walks his talk," said Jeff Rocke, vice president 
for development at the United Way, an organization that Ochs has actively 
supported. 
</P>
<P>
 Even business competitors and political foes say that, even when they disagree 
with his actions, they respect the man.  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rogers, a San Juan Capistrano rancher, was involved in drafting Measure A, 
an Orange County slow-growth initiative that Ochs helped defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that he's out for his interests, like any home builder," 
Rogers said. "Ochs is an adversary, but a person I would feel comfortable 
inviting to my home -- unlike some other builders." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Ochs has also received a number of professional commendations. 
He was selected as National Builder of the Year in 1989 by Professional Builder 
magazine and in 1991, along with fellow Orange County developer Kathryn 
Thompson, was inducted into the California Building Industry Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he has done extensive charity work and is a highly visible 
patron of the arts, having served on the boards of the United Way, the South 
Coast Repertory Theater and the Orange County Business Committee for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 He also gives financial seminars at Mariners Church in Newport Beach, where he 
is an elder, to teach people how to be better stewards of their money. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's created an army of givers," said Kenton Beshore, senior pastor at the 
nondenominational church. "He has a powerful belief in God, and his company is 
value-driven. Integrity and truth-telling are all part of his corporate 
culture."  
</P>
<P>
 Randy Bramel, a real estate specialist with Bridgeport Investment Co. in 
Newport Beach, has been a close friend of Ochs for 18 years and is a fellow 
member of a Bible study group that meets once a week at 6:30 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 "I meet a lot of competent people in this business, but no one like him," said 
Bramel, who goes cycling with Ochs and has accompanied him on ski trips to 
Vermont. "He is equally comfortable with someone who is the president of a 
Fortune 500 company and a blue-collar worker." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ochs is a member of some of Orange County's most prestigious social 
organizations, such as Big Canyon Country Club in Newport Beach, he isn't found 
regularly on the golf course or dining out with other developers. Instead, he 
and wife, Gail, typically spend weekends within their close circle of friends 
from church or Fieldstone. 
</P>
<P>
 "His life is his company, his family and the church," said Roland F. Osgood, 
president of the Newport Beach division of home builder Kaufman & Broad. "He 
doesn't go out for beers with the guys or go play golf on Thursday afternoons. 
When you see him, you see him with his wife. But in business he is tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Ochs well say they are not surprised, though, that he has 
chosen a new career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter has targeted his whole life to do this," Beshore said. "That's why he 
didn't call it the Ochs Co. He named it Fieldstone because he knew that one day 
he would step down and become more involved in his Christian activities." 
</P>
<P>
 He will also be stepping away from Fieldstone Foundation, the corporation's 
nonprofit arm. Established in 1983, the Foundation had assets of $8.6 million 
and gave away $1.6 million in 1993, according to its latest state filing. 
</P>
<P>
 One beneficiary of that generosity as been St. Joseph's Ballet in Santa Ana. 
Beth Burns, who founded the ballet 11 years ago, said Fieldstone Foundation has 
given it more than $10,000 over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter's generosity is an inspiration," Burns said. "I wish I could find the 
words to express to you how Fieldstone is one of the model foundations. They 
don't just write checks." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochs drops by often, Burns said, to chat with the young dancers and even help 
them with tasks, such as stringing popcorn for decorations.  
</P>
<P>
 Gail Ochs, 50, said she and her husband "just consider philanthropy a focus of 
our lives, which means we often miss social events we're invited to." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who have four daughters and recently became grandparents, 
certainly don't intend to sever their Orange County ties when they leave for 
Spain and plan to keep their custom-built house in Newport Beach and their 
vacation home in Deer Valley, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochs confesses that leaving won't be easy. The departure, he said, will be 
bittersweet. "It's such a drastic change," he said. "I've been doing this for 
so long. It's a huge adjustment process." 
</P>
<P>
 He describes the move as re-potting -- uprooting himself from one career and 
transplanting himself in another. He believes such changes are important, as is 
taking time out occasionally for reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contemplative life in the 20th Century is a lost art," he said. "Do I 
know how to do that? No. Is it scary? Yes. But we're going to try." Profile:

FIELDSTONE FOUNDER SETS OUT ON ANOTHER MISSION; HOME BUILDER OCHS PLANS FOR 
FOREIGN MINISTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a child, Peter M. Ochs used to spend his after-school hours at his father's 
construction sites, where he recalls collecting nails in a tin can. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Ochs was the fifth generation of his family to show a passion for 
building things, and he grew up to found Fieldstone Co., Southern California's 
largest privately owned home-building company. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldstone, along with the rest of the construction business, was hit hard by 
the recession of the early 1990s, and now the industry is about to get another 
blow: the loss of one of its most respected leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochs (pronounced Ox ) is retiring from real estate development at age 50 to 
start a new career as a Christian missionary. He and his wife, Gail, will leave 
in a few months for a year in Spain, where they plan to learn Spanish in 
preparation for a ministry in Central or South America. 
</P>
<P>
 He describes the move as repotting -- uprooting himself from one career and 
transplanting to another. Such changes are important, Ochs believes, as is 
taking time out occasionally for reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contemplative life in the 20th Century is a lost art," he said. "Do I 
know how to do that? No. Is it scary? Yes. But we're going to try." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochs, a fixture in Southern California business circles for more than 20 
years, will remain in a limited role as chairman of Fieldstone and will keep 
his majority stake in the company and two affiliates: Fieldstone Communities 
Inc. and Cypress Homes. But leading the Fieldstone Group of Cos. into the next 
century will be co-founder Keith Johnson, 51. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I took Fieldstone to a stage, and I'm pleased with it," Ochs said 
during an interview at his Newport Beach office, where he displays part of his 
large collection of California Impressionist paintings. "Now it needs to be 
taken to the next stage. And another hand on the wheel will be better." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 13 years, Ochs and his partner have built a firm that has sold 
more than 12,500 homes throughout California, including nearly 1,100 last year, 
and generated revenue of $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He commanded the respect of all his peers in the industry," said Sanford 
Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego. "Ochs was a businessman who 
happened to be a home builder -- but he could have headed any Fortune 500 
company. He was elegant, disciplined and an excellent leader." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ochs' great-great-grandfather was a bricklayer. His great-grandfather was a 
home builder, as was his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochs grew up in Bethlehem, Pa., and attended Princeton University. He received 
a master's degree in business administration from Stanford University in 1967. 
He then took a job in the mergers and acquisitions department of American 
Standard in New York, where he led the company's entry into real estate 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few years, he came west and helped form William Lyon Co., a firm that 
eventually became one of the leading home builders in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I drive through Orange County neighborhoods I built 20 years ago 
and just look at people living their lives in those homes," Ochs said. "It's 
very satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 He became president of the company in 1975 when founder William Lyon accepted 
a Pentagon offer to head the Air Force Reserve. Lyon returned in 1979 to 
reassume his previous position, but Ochs was not ready to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the two men negotiated a compromise in which Ochs exchanged his stake 
in Lyon Co. for ownership of the company's San Diego properties in 1981. Ochs 
and Johnson, who headed the San Diego division of Lyon, then used those 
properties as the foundation to form the Fieldstone companies. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In an industry known for people who shoot from the hip, the soft-spoken Ochs 
earned a reputation of being thoughtful, deliberate and trustworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ochs is someone who really walks his talk," said Jeff Rocke, vice president 
for development at United Way, an organization that Ochs has actively 
supported. 
</P>
<P>
 Even business competitors and political foes take pains to say they respect 
Ochs. "There's no question that he's out for his interests, like any home 
builder," said Tom Rogers, a San Juan Capistrano rancher and backer of Measure 
A, a 1988 slow-growth initiative in Orange County that Ochs helped defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ochs is an adversary but a person I would feel comfortable inviting to my 
home -- unlike some other builders." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Ochs has received a number of professional commendations, 
including his induction in 1991 into the California Industry Hall of Fame and 
his selection in 1989 as national builder of the year by Professional Builder 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he has done extensive charity work and is an active patron 
of the arts, having served on the boards of United Way, the South Coast 
Repertory Theater and the Orange County Business Committee for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a member of Big Canyon Country Club in Newport Beach, Ochs is not 
much of a golfer or socializer. Instead, he and wife Gail typically spend 
weekends within their close circle of friends from church or work. 
</P>
<P>
 "His life is his company, his family and the church," said Roland F. Osgood, 
president of the Newport Beach division of home builder Kaufman & Broad. "He 
doesn't go out for beers with the guys or go play golf on Thursday afternoons. 
When you see him, you see him with his wife. But in business he is tough." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What is unclear now is what will happen to Fieldstone after Ochs leaves the 
helm. Several experts suggest that Fieldstone is either a prime acquisition 
target for a large out-of-state builder or a good candidate to go public, 
though Ochs said no stock offering is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Ochs' reputation, he and his company have had their share of problems 
and controversy in recent years. The company has had run-ins with homeowners 
unhappy about the falling value of their new homes and environmentalists who 
disliked Ochs' efforts to defeat Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
 When the real estate market began to decline in the late 1980s, Fieldstone 
found itself saddled with a lot of land it could not sell. The company is still 
trying to restructure loans on two troubled projects in San Diego and Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldstone defaulted on a $150-million loan for a 2,300-acre community in La 
Costa in northern San Diego County. According to Ochs, Fieldstone is now 
working with lenders to restructure the debt and begin building again. 
</P>
<P>
 Another formerly troubled project is a 584-acre residential development in 
Rancho Santa Margarita, where Fieldstone has been in default on several 
construction loans. The company has built and sold only about half of the 1,800 
homes planned for the project, but it plans to build more after landing 
additional construction financing from Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 But these kinds of problems have been common for all developers in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a real estate developer that hasn't suffered in this 
market," said Kurt Kraushaar, manager of the real estate department for Union 
Bank in Irvine, which has about $50 million in loans outstanding to Fieldstone. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they are very well regarded," he said. "Fieldstone is a company that 
Union Bank is going to continue to work with. They will be a force in this 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the problems Ochs is leaving behind, he says his departure is going 
to be difficult. "It's such a drastic change," he said. "I've been doing this 
for so long. It's a huge adjustment process." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochs' missionary work will be carried out through a private foundation he set 
up called First Fruit, whose aim will be to recruit followers of Christianity 
and raise living standards in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While doing missionary work, Ochs plans to travel light, but by no means will 
he be spending all his time in remote areas or getting rid of his material 
possessions. He says he'll spend a lot of time in the United States on fund 
raising, and he plans to keep his home in Newport Beach. Profile: Peter M. Ochs

WHEN THE FUTURE FADES...; ...PROFESSIONALS' EXPECTATIONS DIM IN RECESSION'S 
WAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Libby Pachares felt trapped. It was the middle of 1992, and she had been back 
to work only a few months. Still torn about having ended her maternity leave, 
she became infected by the anguish and self-doubt that spread over Los Angeles 
with the flames of the riots. Assumptions she held before the baby was born -- 
that she would readily go back to work -- wrestled with her need to nurture and 
protect her two children. 
</P>
<P>
 But she had to work. Pachares and husband Alec Nedelman had moved into a new 
home in Santa Monica the previous autumn. With the house came much more room 
for their family -- and a mortgage payment nearly five times bigger than 
before. What didn't come were once-expected increases in their earnings. For 
the first time, Pachares felt the oppression of financial obligation that daily 
weighs down waitresses and factory workers, shoe sellers and bank tellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the hardest part . . . when you feel trapped: that you have no choice, 
that things had better work out at the job, that you have to tolerate things -- 
because you really need the job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California recession was the leveling factor that put Pachares and 
Nedelman, both attorneys making six-figure salaries, on the emotional plane of 
insecurity and anxiety long populated by the working class. Through sleepless 
nights and long budget calculations, they and thousands of other Southern 
California professionals have ratcheted down their dreams to try, for the 
moment, to stay even. 
</P>
<P>
 The days of unchallenged high fees, unfettered growth and job security for 
doctors, lawyers, architects, accountants and other professionals vanished with 
the heady days and soaring incomes of the mid- and late 1980s. And even though 
the state is beginning to climb out of its economic hole, few expect to see 
those days again. 
</P>
<P>
 The sure route to the American dream -- the path that made professionals the 
foundation of California's upper middle class -- has become littered with 
obstacles unforeseen only a few years ago. Clients today are hard to come by 
and harder to keep, and advancement is uncertain. Earnings no longer climb 
automatically to the skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some professionals, faced with such sweeping changes in their careers and 
prospects, have become dispirited and angry. Some have packed up and left 
California for parts of the country more quickly rebounding from the recession 
-- or where the changes are occurring more slowly. Others have had little 
choice but to follow job opportunities out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Many more California professionals, however, have adjusted by making personal 
and professional sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena, architect Michael E. Shea and his business partner put in an 
extra 10 hours a week, but they don't earn more money. Darrel Moss took back 
the headaches of managing the Van Nuys accounting firm where he's a principal. 
Sherman Oaks lawyer Janice Kamenir-Reznik and her husband took out loans when 
their firm couldn't pay their salaries. And 57-year-old Artine Kokshanian, an 
ear, nose and throat doctor practicing in Glendale, shortchanged his retirement 
account to meet everyday expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the dinner table and at seminars, professionals share stories of 
colleagues who five years ago cranked the pace and price of their lives up to 
levels that matched their phenomenal incomes -- and now are straining to pay 
the bills on a Palos Verdes lifestyle. Of those who could no longer afford 
private schools for their children and moved out of Los Angeles to higher-rated 
public school districts. Of friends whose self-esteem has plummeted, who have 
lost their businesses or are on what Shea calls the "bleeding edge." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years ago, Charles Agapiou was seeing a lot of desperate sellers 
at his Rolls-Royce and Bentley dealership in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people bought these cars as investments, then when the economy and 
the price of luxury cars went down, they were all bailing out," Agapiou said. 
"People faced cash shortages, and the only way to meet their obligations was to 
liquidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some professionals who weren't strapped for cash, he said, were reluctant 
to display their prosperity while so many others were losing their livelihoods. 
Some of them traded down to less ostentatious vehicles, "to show a lower 
profile to the public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The adjustments began in professionals' offices before seeping into their 
private lives. 
</P>
<P>
 At Choy Associates in Los Angeles, architect Barton Choy has been facing the 
stresses of the recession alone since his father died in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a diverse practice, but "each facet of the marketplace just dropped 
off," Choy said. "Residential was one of the first to go, then commercial 
slowed down and stopped, and (then came) institutional and government-funded 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Choy has filled the gaps in work by taking on jobs the firm had not done or 
considered before, such as exhibit design, architectural graphics, landscape 
design and planning. And though he said he has managed to keep his income about 
even, "the stress level has increased (because of) the uncertainty of the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 "This has caused great stress between my wife and myself," Choy said. They 
work longer hours and see each other less. Daily life, he said, is "more 
stressful and more precious. Architecture has always been a day-to-day 
business, but it's particularly scary in this environment." 
</P>
<P>
 At La Canada Design Group in Pasadena, Shea and his partner Lance Bird used to 
think of themselves as artists, not businessmen. "A financial statement -- we 
had no idea what that meant," Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that began to change about four years ago, when the architects were seeing 
the first signs of a downturn and knew they had to prepare. Today, they preside 
over a staff of nine -- half what it was three years ago -- doing the same 
volume of work. They decided to take on as much of the burden themselves as 
they could, rather than piling it on their staff members, and they haven't had 
pay raises in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But their confidence has increased since they began running the firm more like 
a business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're pretty smart about that (financial) stuff," Shea said. "We pay 
attention to business. We're tenacious about our (account) receivables. . . . 
We're constantly looking out for cash flow." 
</P>
<P>
 Professional firms have had no choice but to get smart. 
</P>
<P>
 When customers got squeezed in the recession and learned to be better 
consumers, they put the squeeze on lawyers, brokers, accountants and other 
service providers. Clients began doing more work in-house; when they sought 
outside professionals' services, they tossed aside notions of firm loyalty and 
knocked down the amount they were willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cooper, Moss, Resnick, Spiegel & Co., a small accounting firm in Van Nuys, 
business was slow when Darrel Moss resumed the role of managing partner two 
years ago. He has racked up many long hours since, grappling with the headaches 
of bringing in more work and cutting the firm's own costs.  
</P>
<P>
 After examining its own operations, the accounting firm cut some salaries last 
year by as much as 15% and this year laid off some employees. For clients 
struggling to stay afloat, it developed operational audits to identify areas 
for savings and efficiency.  
</P>
<P>
 Like Shea and Bird working extra hours for essentially less pay and Moss 
taking on a role he had filled before, many professionals say they just aren't 
at a place in their careers -- or their personal lives -- that they expected to 
be by now. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia O. Chang was one of the Cooper Moss managers who got hit first by the 
paycut -- and then was laid off. She bounced back, landing a job at the Long 
Beach office of the Ernst & Young accounting firm. Compared to friends and 
colleagues displaced by accountancy's downturn, though, she says she has been 
"lucky" -- especially because her husband's income rose as hers was falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Mark Schwartz's income fell too -- and with it his dream of solo practice, 
cherished through all the years of medical school at Johns Hopkins University 
and residency at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, at age 36 and after only eight years in private practice as a 
primary-care physician, Schwartz came to the wrenching conclusion that reality 
was overtaking his dream. He was losing patients to managed-care networks and 
his income was dropping: It fell 10% in one year. He tried working longer hours 
to be more accessible to patients, but still he wasn't busy enough. 
</P>
<P>
 So he sold his Culver City practice and joined Bay Shores Medical Group, a 
health maintenance organization in Torrance. Now he's as busy as he wants to be 
and doesn't have to "worry from paycheck to paycheck like I did before." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it the right decision? "I made the inevitable decision," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Managed care is the big gorilla in Southern California's health care industry, 
one that grew out of economic and recessionary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 As the state's employers look to trim their costs of benefits, they have 
increasingly turned to managed care, HMOs and preferred-provider systems that 
reduce costs by controlling patients' access to health care providers and 
restricting providers' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Today nearly 75% of Californians covered by health insurance belong to some 
kind of managed-care group. The big gorilla has embraced primary-care 
physicians and pediatricians working in groups and given the cold shoulder to 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 With fewer patients covered by traditional fee-for-service benefits, doctors 
feel compelled to go to where the patients are: the groups and the networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't fight, join. If you don't join, quit," advised Kokshanian, the 
Glendale specialist. He tried to resist managed care, but he saw his practice 
shrinking. Now he has joined several health care groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he has felt the pinch. He said he had been asking his wife to cut back 
a bit on expenses at home, but it wasn't until she repeatedly heard it from 
their doctor friends that she believed "things are tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Kokshanian is 57 -- still young for doctors in the Middle East culture from 
which he came. But he wonders whether as a single practitioner he'll be able to 
hold on even until U.S. retirement age -- or, conversely, whether he can afford 
retirement if he doesn't stick it out. Last year, he said, he "didn't put a 
penny" into his pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At 61, Donald Motzkin, a urologist, says retirement is still a long way off, 
although he thinks about it every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how low insurance companies are pricing their structures and 
demanding that physicians comply if they want work," Motzkin said. "Between the 
lower fees paid and removal of patients (who opt for or are forced into 
managed-care systems), it has a profound effect on income." 
</P>
<P>
 Motzkin frets that when the time comes, he may not be able to sell his Van 
Nuys practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The single practitioner is a dinosaur. Extinct," Motzkin said. "I don't know 
if a private, solo practice in a medical specialty has any value at all in 
1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of thriving, as they were a handful of years ago, the area's solo 
practitioners throughout the professions are feeling endangered at the least. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawyers practicing solo and in small firms are facing financial 
hardships, according to a recent informal survey by the Los Angeles County Bar 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys have had to close their offices and work at home, share law 
libraries, rent conference rooms by the hour and find other ways to scrimp. 
Some have sought counseling to deal with the emotional stress of having their 
careers upended. 
</P>
<P>
 The anxiety has infiltrated larger firms as well. In accounting, a wave of 
mergers and consolidations has thinned the ranks of partners at large and 
mid-sized firms. When Southern California's real estate market bottomed out a 
few years ago, real estate lawyers from Santa Barbara to San Diego were left 
holding empty briefcases. 
</P>
<P>
 Large-firm partnerships used to provide a safety net for professionals. But 
now, instead of being carried along over the rough spots, partners are as 
likely to be eased out with early-retirement incentives or nudged into working 
elsewhere. Many have had to broaden their skills or change areas of practice.  
</P>
<P>
 David Vena had built a strong real estate practice at Latham & Watkins, one of 
Los Angeles' top law firms, and was chairman of its real estate department. 
When real estate activity slowed, there was too little work to support the 
department's many attorneys. Some were moved into different practice areas and 
some left the firm. Vena now is chair of Latham's bustling health care 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession, and particularly the real estate downturn, cut a wide swath 
through the professional and personal lives of Janice Kamenir-Reznik and her 
law partner-husband, Benjamin M. Reznik. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Reznik & Reznik, a small law firm in Sherman Oaks, was a real 
estate practice top to bottom. But when "all the matters our firm had looked to 
for its bread-and-butter practice dried up," Kamenir-Reznik said, the firm 
quickly moved into the field of environmental law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recession . . . demanded we change the focus of our practice in a way 
that in the long run will benefit it," she said. In the past four years, the 
firm has doubled in size. But there were times when clients didn't or couldn't 
pay their bills -- some went bankrupt -- and Reznik & Reznik had to stretch to 
meet its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone to the bank and drawn a lot of credit when we needed to borrow 
money to pay the staff," she said. There were times last year when she and her 
husband "didn't take salaries for several months in a row. We took out bank 
loans instead." 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, though, was what the recession did to the couple's expectations of 
being able to slow the pace of their work lives and spend more time with their 
three children. Instead, Kamenir-Reznik said, they are working harder than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not where we were going to be in our early 40s," she said. "I 
expected that I would have more free time, that I could work 30 or 40 hours a 
week instead of 60, that I could be a team mom at Little League instead of just 
bringing snacks, and that I could devote more time to . . . my charities." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are attorneys Pachares and Nedelman where they expected to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Nedelman said he considered the group of partners just ahead of him in his law 
firm to be models.  
</P>
<P>
 "You look around, see what the partners are doing, and that's what you're 
supposed to do. . . . A lot of people ahead of me belonged to country clubs or 
luncheon clubs, like the City Club. But a lot of (attorneys) my age are joining 
the Y, not the Hillcrest or other country clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 There were other adjustments. The couple put off a vacation cruise and 
remodeling. Nedelman cut back on expensive lunches with fellow attorneys and 
even considered selling his Mercedes. By the time baby Ariana was sleeping 
through the night, Pachares was not. Instead she was trying through the dark to 
stare down anxieties and budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Pachares stayed on the job and now is comfortable with her position as vice 
president and in-house counsel for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. in Santa Monica. 
But Nedelman, still reaching for a better economic future, switched law firms 
this summer, leaving his partnership at Loeb & Loeb for a new partnership in 
the Los Angeles office of Mayer, Brown & Platt. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason I'm making this move is I think it will give me more business 
development opportunities. That's what builds your income as a lawyer," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Nedelman had questioned his future working in a large law firm. 
"The recession created psychological pressures," he said, "and I thought, 'Do I 
want to change jobs, get out of this?' But then I realized we've got a huge 
mortgage, I can't. Where else would I get this kind of money doing this kind of 
work? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of us who are making six figures are incredibly fortunate, and we 
need to remember that," Nedelman said. Despite the pressures, he said, "we have 
not been in the situation where we have to worry about not having a roof over 
our kids' heads or being able to buy holiday gifts. All the problems we have, 
we have to keep in perspective."

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: ADDRESS OTHER ISSUES AND TRADE DEFICIT WILL TAKE CARE 
OF ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EISNER, ROBERT EISNER is William R. Kenan professor of economics at 
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He is the author of The Misunderstood 
Economy: What Counts and How to Count It. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street shuddered as the Dow plunged, and we heard new cries of disaster 
and calls for action. Why? The U.S. trade balance was reported in deficit by 
almost $11 billion in July, the second-"worst" month in history. There was 
renewed talk of action against Japan, the nation that accounted for half of 
that deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 But what sense did it all make? 
</P>
<P>
 The figures themselves are at best of doubtful accuracy and at worst 
misleading. By definition, because the deficit is the excess of imports over 
exports -- and because one country's imports are another country's exports -- 
total deficits for the world must come to zero. Yet, taking the statistics of 
each country, we would conclude that total world imports very considerably 
exceed total exports! 
</P>
<P>
 What clearly is happening is that most countries keep better track of imports, 
which are subject to tariffs, quotas and inspections of various kinds, while 
exports flow out freely and often unnoted -- in trucks across the Canadian 
border, through purchases by foreign tourists at bargain U.S. prices, or 
however. Correct figures would still show a substantial U.S. trade deficit, but 
it would almost surely be less than the numbers so alarming to some. 
</P>
<P>
 What we should be looking at is the total "balance on current account," which 
is not reported monthly. In addition to payments we receive for exports and 
make for imports, it includes net investment income and unilateral transfers. 
The net investment income is now reported at about zero; foreigners seem to be 
earning something over $100 billion a year on their investments in the United 
States, while Americans are earning almost exactly the same amount on their 
investments in the rest of the world. Adding in our negative net "transfers," 
though -- gifts to relatives in the old country, Social Security benefits paid 
to Americans who have retired abroad and military grants -- brings our 1993 
balance on current account to minus $104 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But so what? 
</P>
<P>
 Doomsayers tell us that means, if the numbers are right, that we are giving 
more than $100 billion a year to foreigners -- money they invest in U.S. banks, 
bonds, stocks, motels, hotels and factories. The investment may be helping us, 
but each year it continues, foreigners are adding $100 billion to their net 
"claims" on the United States -- a sum currently put, again with uncertain 
accuracy, at about $500 billion. If claims kept on accumulating at that rate 
for 10 years, which would be most unlikely, the additional $1 trillion would 
bring the total to $1.5 trillion dollars! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. tangible assets or wealth come to about $40 trillion. What's more, 
those foreign claims are almost all in dollars (which we can print), not 
foreign currency. Foreigners hoping to cash in would find that unless they want 
more paper, they would have to accept U.S. goods -- thus reversing the very 
current-account deficits that gave them their claims to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way of seeing the limits of the "problem" is to note that at a real 
rate of interest of 4%, for example, that additional $1 trillion of net claims 
in 10 years would earn foreigners $40 billion more per year at our expense. But 
that would be less than 0.5% of our national income or gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, our trade deficit -- far from indicating anything bad -- is largely a 
measure of our prosperity relative to that of our major trading partners. In 
1991, with the United States in recession, the total trade deficit was only 
$28.5 billion -- a third of what we may be headed for in 1994. But since then 
our economy has had a recovery -- substantial if still incomplete, in my view 
-- while Europe and Japan have remained mired. When we are prosperous, we can 
buy more and hence import more. When foreigners are not prosperous, they do not 
buy as much from us. We export less; hence the increased deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 So the trade deficit is not telling us that we have fewer jobs, but rather 
more jobs, giving us the income to buy Toyotas (those made in Japan as well as 
in California and Kentucky) and travel to Gay Paree. 
</P>
<P>
 For those concerned, as am I, that we still do not have enough jobs -- and 
enough good jobs -- the remedy is not in restricting trade. Rather, the 
solution lies in seeing to it that the government, in its fiscal and monetary 
policy, offers enough purchasing power for us to buy all we can produce. It 
also lies in supporting education and training our work force, and in 
investment in research and new technology, to make sure we can produce more and 
that all of our people can be productively employed. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade deficit then will take care of itself, as long as we allow foreign 
exchange rates to seek free-market levels. That means discouraging the Japanese 
and others from keeping their currencies too cheap -- and ours too expensive -- 
thereby making their goods artificially cheap for us to import and our exports 
artificially expensive. And it means seeing to it that our own Federal Reserve 
Board abandons its misguided efforts to fight an invisible inflation demon by 
keeping the economy from "overheating." It is these efforts -- which raise 
interest rates and keep the dollar expensive -- that really are spooking Wall 
Street and endangering our economy.

GUEST VIEW / JOHN O. WILSON; PESSMISTIC VIEW OF STATE'S RECOVERY BELIES WHAT'S 
HAPPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O. WILSON, JOHN O. WILSON is executive vice president and chief 
economist of San Francisco-based Bank of America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New evidence suggests that California's economy is adding jobs at a rate 
likely to topple the conventional wisdom of observers who had written us off. 
One conspicuous casualty of this evidence is Business Week magazine, which 
recently predicted that our gathering economic strength would "fizzle out." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, California's economy is firing up. Revised employment data indicate 
that job growth since the depth of the recent recession is more than five times 
higher than previously thought. Moreover, Bank of America now forecasts that 
California will add 500,000 net new jobs between now and the end of 1996. 
That's three times greater than what we had earlier projected. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 According to the conventional view, California's economy is still mired in a 
deep recession, with the only signs of employment growth occurring in the 
Central Valley. The rest of the state -- particularly Southern California -- 
will have to wait two years or more before growth returns. 
</P>
<P>
 This pessimistic view is based primarily on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
data showing that California lost 603,000 jobs during the recession that began 
in July, 1990, and bottomed out last December. Since then, according to the 
bureau data, California has added only 27,000 net new jobs -- a small increase 
for an economy in which nearly 1.4 million people are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bureau of Labor Statistics' so-called "establishment survey" clearly 
underestimates the job growth that has taken place recently in California. The 
survey is based on information obtained from 37,000 of the state's larger, more 
established firms. Job growth produced by self-employment and new business 
ventures is not fully counted. 
</P>
<P>
 For the national totals covering all 50 states, the BLS attempts to correct 
for this undercounting by adding an adjustment factor each month. However, it 
does not make this adjustment each month for the data that cover individual 
states. Instead, it waits until the first quarter of each year and then revises 
the data for California and other states by using payroll tax receipts. That 
presents a far more accurate picture of job growth than does the establishment 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Finance has recently estimated what the BLS 
revision for the first quarter of next year will look like. The results are 
striking. They suggest that the state's economy is strengthening far more 
rapidly than most people suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The department estimates that employment bottomed out in March, 1993 -- not 
December, 1993, and that since November of last year, employment has grown by 
139,000 -- substantially more than the federal government's estimate of 27,000. 
For the full year, job growth is likely to be more than 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of California's new jobs are coming from services, particularly business 
services, as well as from recreation, motion pictures, health care, engineering 
and management consulting. Many of these new employment opportunities offer not 
only good wages but also economic security. 
</P>
<P>
 This data "will change dramatically the perception of the recovery in 
California," according to David Hensley of Salomon Bros., a former director of 
the economic forecasting center at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California has been battered by defense cutbacks, corporate downsizings and a 
depressed commercial real estate market. We also have suffered the consequences 
of flagging tax revenues, regulatory excess and a series of natural calamities. 
Compounding all of these difficulties has been a bruising national recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the history of this state is a lesson in resilience. New industries 
continue to take the place of old ones. Entrepreneurs are re-seeding the 
economy with new products and services. And the state's diversity, its port 
facilities and its position on the Pacific Rim are enabling our producers to 
take full advantage of the tremendous growth and market liberalization taking 
place beyond America's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to give the California economy a fresh look.

Q & A; WHEN THE BOTTOM LINE IS PERSONAL HONOR; AUTHOR BACKS COEXISTENCE OF 
BUSINESS, ETHICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rabbi Wayne Dosick must have struck a chord with his book "The Business Bible: 
Ten New Commandments for Creating an Ethical Workplace" (William Morrow & Co.). 
It sold out its 15,000-copy hardcover run last year and has just been released 
in paperback by HarperBusiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Using contemporary examples and ancient parables, Dosick, 47, structured his 
book around 10 chapters on 10 ethical commandments. Among them: Honesty is the 
best management policy, whether dealing with employees or customers. And: 
Managers have a responsibility to treat employees and customers as they would 
prefer to be treated. 
</P>
<P>
 Dosick, who lives in La Costa, Calif., is an adjunct professor of Jewish 
studies at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is a book linking business and ethics timely? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's an upheaval going on. The "Me Decade" of the '70s and the "Greed Is 
Good" decade of the '80s led to all these excesses -- the Wall Street scandals, 
the S&L failures. Suddenly, business leaders are beginning to talk about 
business in an entirely new way as "a trust" and "a calling" and "a covenant" 
and as "love." 
</P>
<P>
 I said to myself, I have a unique perspective to offer this discussion. These 
guys come from, if you will, the failure of the business world to live up to 
good ethical standards, and they are calling the business world to task for 
that. I come from the perspective of bringing the ethical standards to the 
business world. Not just Judaism, but all the spiritual traditions have 
something to say about how we live decently in our everyday lives.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bible and Talmud are not just holy books out there for sacred moments, but 
nitty-gritty books teaching how we are to behave with each other in everyday 
relationships and which over and over again talk about issues of commerce and 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So your book is a compendium of business lessons to be drawn from holy 
texts? 
</P>
<P>
 A: After I started writing, I looked around and knew I needed real-life 
examples, that I couldn't talk on an esoteric plane as if I'd gotten the word 
off the mountain and you guys better listen. I knew I'd need to find companies 
that do this kind of stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 So I went looking for businesses that do it right -- that do well by doing 
good -- and I found some. Tom's of Maine, the toothpaste maker, and Ben and 
Jerry's ice cream people are well known for sharing their profits and for 
social consciousness.  
</P>
<P>
 Then I ran into this company called Fel-Pro, an automotive gasket manufacturer 
in Skokie, Ill., whose managers were invited to the White House for Clinton's 
signing of the family leave bill. Fel-Pro has been giving family leave for the 
past 12 years. They have on-site legal and psychological counseling, summer 
camps and scholarships for employees' kids. I asked around and it turned out, 
by sheer coincidence and luck, that Fel-Pro's co-chairman, Lewis Weinberg, has 
a retirement house in Ramona (a San Diego suburb). 
</P>
<P>
 So I got introduced to and had dinner with him and I asked Mr. Weinberg: "How 
can you do all this?" He looked at me and said, "How can we not do it? For 54 
straight years, we have had increasing profit, and there is only one reason: We 
take care of our employees and our employees take care of us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One of your main themes is the value of treating employees and customers 
humanely. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Ethics go across the board -- internally with employees, externally with 
consumers. When I did book signings and people would pass me by, I'd call them 
over, and they'd say, "I'm retired, I don't need a book on business ethics." 
But every one of us is involved in business if we do nothing more than buy a 
29-cent stamp or a tube of toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been collecting business stories -- the good, the bad and the ugly of how 
people behave out there. You probably have your own litany. If you just 
recorded how you were treated in various business settings in the course of one 
week, you'd be blown away at how poorly you're treated, and we don't really 
give it much thought. 
</P>
<P>
 But then you jump hoops and get happy when you're treated well. That's why 
there will always be a place for Nordstrom, no matter what Wal-Mart does to a 
downtown shopping district. When you think of Nordstrom, you think of quality 
and service, not that the prices are high. The bottom line is that we'll go 
back again and again to a place where we're treated well, and we'll stay away 
from places where we are not treated well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You quote the prophet Micah to define a true business leader as someone who 
"does justly, loves mercy and walks humbly." What did you mean? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Those are the exact three qualities that a good leader has to have. In the 
Israeli army, the generals are at the head of the line and they say, "Follow 
me." They're not sitting in some bunker saying, "Charge!" 
</P>
<P>
 People don't become leaders in some office coup, but from engendering the 
loyalty of the people they are to lead, the same way when you're a 15-year-old 
kid playing football or in your college fraternity. You treat people decently, 
give them good examples, you show them the way, and you do the job with them. 
You have to be fair, have to have compassion and walk humbly. Anyone who walks 
too high on a pedestal gets knocked off one of these days. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is truth important in a business setting? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because everything depends on it -- your honor, your word, your reputation 
and eventually your business. If you lie to me, you may get away with it this 
time and the next time and the time after. But if I catch you in that lie, 
that's it, we're done, because I can never trust you again. And I have to be 
able to do my business based on trust. 
</P>
<P>
 From my point of view, everything depends on honesty. The worst that happens 
is the shuttle blows up, or the airplane mechanic doesn't tighten a bolt tight 
enough and a plane crashes, or people get hurt or people's lives are ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 You value truth with a wife or husband, because you know what lack of trust 
can do to a marriage. You value it with children, because you know what a 
broken promise can do to a six- year old. And you value it when you walk into a 
church or mosque or synagogue, because you aren't going to lie to the pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing going on in the business world that's not going on in our other 
worlds is that we are trying to make money, trying to make a profit, trying to 
acquire more and more. And so something happens that profit and acquisition 
become so important to us (that) we are willing to give up our personal honor 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Any sign that a more ethical, humane approach to work is coming to 
realization? 
</P>
<P>
 A: IBM used to stand for "I've Been Moved." People are saying, finally: "I 
have a job that I like. I will sacrifice the promotion, prestige and money that 
goes with it for being where I am -- to keep the kids in the good schools, 
where the family is tied to the community." That's happening a lot these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta came out and said that for every $1 
that a company spends in preventive health care and exercise programs for 
employees, the company saves $7 in future health costs. So now we're getting 
firm data, statistical research, that doing good benefits the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees are finding out that success is not measured in dollars but in 
creativity, personal satisfaction, how one touches the life of another person. 
Maybe touching the lives of youngsters whom he can help mold and shape is in 
the end far more satisfying for an MBA or an engineer. It may turn out that an 
MBA's real calling is to be a high school coach. 
</P>
<P>
 As hard as it is to say, the American dream we thought we were going to have 
isn't going to be. Instead of lamenting that, we've got to begin to deal with 
that reality, and we have to dig deep into our souls -- our creatvity and 
beings -- to know that there are other things to do than the jobs we've been 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If greed was good enough 10 years ago, why not now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Reality set in. Once you have it all -- the house in the suburbs, the condo 
at the beach, the fancy cars in the driveway, kids in private school -- you 
turn around and say: "So what? What now?" It's not material things that count, 
and people are finding that out. It's the heart's satisfaction, the soul's 
satisfaction of making your contribution to the ongoing process of the 
universe, toward touching the hearts and souls of other people, to being a 
decent, kind and humane human being, by making your life on earth make a 
difference in the lives of others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But how does that relate to managers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: By understanding that the bottom line is not necessarily measured in dollar 
signs, that you can do good stuff with your business as well. When you share 
what you have earned with the people who helped you earn it -- the employees 
and the customers who paid the bills -- you get what you give. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Doesn't a company have to ration its humanity in tough times like these 
when survival is at issue? Isn't a company justified in giving less slack to 
problem employees, for example? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, the first thing I want to know is: Why is the problem employee a 
problem? Why is the problem child in kindergarten a problem child? Fel-Pro, for 
example, has on-site psychological counseling to help find out what's going on 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the worker is having trouble at home -- his father is sick, his child is 
having problems. Maybe he's a creative person who feels punched down by the 
system or the boss or whatever. Let's find out. People are not problems 
inherently; people have problems because of something that's going on in their 
lives. If we are going to help that person as a human being, let's help him the 
best we can to solve it. 
</P>
<P>
 To say everyone is going to fit and will be fabulous and wonderful for the 
company -- obviously there are mismatches. But before I dismiss someone as a 
problem employee, I'm going to try to find out the best I can what is going on 
in their lives.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: ADJUSTING TAX WITHHOLDING IS EASY -- AND 
SMART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you got married, divorced, had a child, sold something at a big profit, 
lost a job or bought a home during 1994, you need to think about federal taxes. 
That's because you may have told friends and relatives about the "big event," 
but you probably didn't inform your payroll department. 
</P>
<P>
 It's likely that your employer is withholding too much or too little federal 
tax from your paycheck as a result. And that's not smart. 
</P>
<P>
 If too much tax is withheld from your check, you effectively give a 
no-interest loan to the federal government. The government won't return the 
favor. If your employer doesn't withhold enough, you're likely to face a nasty 
surprise -- in the form of taxes and possible penalties -- in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the withholding correct is your responsibility. And now is a good time 
to do it because, with three months remaining in the year, you still have 
enough time to make up a shortfall -- or collect an overpayment. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that adjusting your withholding is fairly easy. You simply 
need to request a W-4 form from your employer and fill it out. (Your employer 
should have a ready supply. If not, you can get forms directly from the 
Internal Revenue Service by calling (800) TAX-FORM.) 
</P>
<P>
 The one-page form provides instructions. However, if you had a major event 
like the ones described above, the instructions may not be enough. That's 
because these events trigger tax issues that are not clearly explained in the 
form. What are these issues and how do you handle them on the W-4? 
</P>
<P>
 * Marriage: Adjusting your withholding will be a little tricky because the 
form doesn't account for the fact that you get the marital rate for the entire 
year -- even if you got married in September. If just one of you is working, or 
if one of you makes a lot more money than the other, the marital rate will work 
to your advantage. But if not, you are likely to end up paying more tax than 
you would have paid alone. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to get your withholding just right, you should estimate your 1994 
liability by taking a look at both of your 1993 tax returns. Add together your 
combined wages and deductions and then look up the liability based on the tax 
tables' marital rate. Everything is adjusted for inflation so the calculation 
will not be exact, but it should get you close. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare the 1993 tax to the amount of tax already withheld from your 
respective paychecks -- and a rough estimate of what will be withheld during 
the coming three months. If you haven't withheld enough, you can divide the 
underpaid amount by the number of pay periods remaining in 1994 and put the 
result on Line 6 of the W-4. If you withheld too much, you may want to add a 
few extra personal allowances on Line 5. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in either case, be sure to adjust your withholding again in January so 
the proper amount is automatically withheld in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * Divorce. You may assume you can still claim your children as dependents 
because you're providing child support payments, but that may not be true. 
Check your settlement. If your withholding level is based on having several 
dependents you can no longer claim, you may have seriously underpaid your tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * Births: If you have a new family member, you add a personal allowance on the 
W-4 work sheet. But, as with marriage, the amount withheld now cannot fully 
compensate for the fact that you get the deduction for the full year. Chances 
are, you've had too much tax withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 * Job loss: If you got unemployment insurance payments for more than a few 
months during 1994, it's likely that you have underpaid your tax. That's 
because unemployment payments are taxable, but tax generally isn't withheld 
from the checks. On the other hand, you might have overpaid if you were working 
most of the year and a lot of taxes were withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 * Capital gains. If you made a big profit on real estate or stocks, you may 
also have underpaid your tax. There are often ways to mitigate -- or delay 
recognition -- of these gains. For help, you'd be wise to consult a 
professional tax adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 * New home. First-time home buyers are likely to reap a tax bonanza. That's 
because mortgage interest expenses, "points" and property taxes all are tax 
deductible. If you bought a home worth $100,000 or more, those expenses could 
land you a tidy tax refund. But if you don't want to wait until next year to 
get it, fill out the work sheet on the flip-side of the W-4. The result should 
cause your employer to withhold less tax, boosting your take-home pay.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO GET STARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carole Glenn's short foray into mutual funds appears to be over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fountain Hills, Ariz., resident had the tough luck to purchase two bond 
funds last September, right about the time when interest rates were bottoming. 
When rates started pushing higher, the funds' value dropped. She figures she 
lost about 6% on the two investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wound up selling the funds and putting the money back into CDs," says 
Glenn, swearing off any further investment adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 While she blames her broker for not keeping her informed about the funds' 
slide, she also admits to not doing enough research on her own, and for not 
knowing where to turn for such assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 She isn't alone. Despite the much-ballyhooed growth in the mutual fund 
business, only about one in four households owns any fund investments, and it's 
likely that a much smaller percentage could describe what they own in any 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
 This column is dedicated to people who don't know where to turn for simple, 
understandable investment help -- or how to proceed. It provides several 
suggestions for learning the basics. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you later turn to a broker or financial planner for help, it still 
pays to have some investment knowledge and experience in your corner -- if only 
to better evaluate a professional's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 You should start your learning effort by picking up a beginner's booklet on 
mutual funds and investing. 
</P>
<P>
 A good example is "Directing Your Own Mutual Fund Investments," from the 
Mutual Fund Education Alliance ((816) 471-1454; 1900 Erie St., Suite 120, 
Kansas City, MO 64116). 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet costs $15 alone or $17.50 when purchased with the "Investor's 
Guide to Low-Cost Mutual Funds." Pay extra for the combination, as the guide is 
full of phone numbers and performance results on 750 no-commission funds. 
</P>
<P>
 At 41 pages, the booklet can be easily read within two hours. It provides the 
basics on fund benefits, types of funds available, reading a prospectus, 
understanding price tables in the newspaper and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fund companies also offer capable guides -- usually free -- for 
beginners. For example, Fidelity Investments' "Getting Started With Mutual 
Funds," is a 21-page booklet ((800) 544-8888) that explains what mutual funds 
are. The T. Rowe Price "Personal Strategy Planner" ((800) 638-5660) provides a 
good discussion of risk, diversification and the importance of time -- key 
underpinnings for any investment program. 
</P>
<P>
 The time needed to read the Fidelity and T. Rowe Price booklets: 30 to 60 
minutes each. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, you should order a few prospectuses from different mutual fund 
companies, or pick up some at a local brokerage office. The idea is to become 
familiar with these documents, which include many key facts that investors need 
to know, along with reams of dry prose that beginners will find confusing and 
even advanced investors consider tedious. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't try to read prospectuses from cover to cover. All you need to learn is 
how to scan for the most critical facts. At a minimum, you should be able to 
identify the fund's objective (income, appreciation, price stability or some 
combination), the type of investments it normally owns, any sales charge, 
annual operating expenses, minimum investment amount, and procedures for 
selling or redeeming shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk section is worth a look, but don't get hung up on all the 
disclaimers, as fund companies disclose all sorts of likely and imagined 
threats to protect themselves from legal liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Time required to glean the key points from a prospectus: 15 minutes to an hour 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you understand the investment basics and know how to locate essential 
fund information, track the progress of several funds in newspaper tables. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily changes in a portfolio's price or net asset value (abbreviated as 
"NAV") are expressed in cents per share. After a few weeks, you should notice 
that mutual funds don't fluctuate all that fast. The Mutual Fund Education 
Alliance's booklet, among other publications, explains the handful of notations 
and terms listed in newspaper tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Time commitment to track a few funds: five minutes a day, a couple of times a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, you will want to practice with some real funds and real cash, 
perhaps spreading a few thousand dollars among a stock, bond and money-market 
fund, in roughly equal proportions. Or, you can put it all in a single 
conservative fund owning both stocks and bonds (see the accompanying chart for 
examples). 
</P>
<P>
 Although you will face the real danger of dropping some cash in this exercise, 
the learning experience hopefully will prove valuable. Besides, there's little 
chance of losing much money in a hybrid stock-bond fund, assuming you give it 
at least a couple of years to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a portfolio of 40% stocks, 40% bonds and 20% cash would have suffered 
just seven down years since 1950. The average loss would have been 3%, and the 
worst annual setback, 7.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Because stocks, bonds and money-market investments march to their own 
drummers, a hybrid portfolio provides more return potential without much 
additional risk compared to leaving it all in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The time commitment here might range from two to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 What beginners need to remember is that mutual funds are not all-or-nothing 
speculations. Because they are diversified by nature, funds may fall in price 
but they won't lose their entire values. If anything, funds are much more 
likely to rise over time than to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 And once you have taken a start with an investment plan, you will want to keep 
adding to your knowledge by scanning fund-related books, newspaper articles and 
magazine pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Time needed to read future installments of this column: 10 minutes or so a 
week. Good Funds for Beginners Novice investors may want to consider some of 
the following mutual funds, all of which have delivered smooth rides for 
shareholders while maintaining some stock market holdings. None of these funds 
has suffered a full-year loss during the 1990s, though several are down 
modestly so far in 1994.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: SHARING A HOME DEED WITH AN EX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: My ex-husband pays the mortgage on my home. In return, I have added his 
name to the deed. If I sell the house and take advantage of the $125,000 profit 
exemption, is he precluded from using his exemption on his home? How does our 
arrangement affect my ability to leave my home to my two children? Finally, 
does our arrangement mean that my home is at risk in the event he is sued? -- 
B.V . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: We'll take the questions in order. Because you and your ex-husband are 
divorced, each of you is eligible for a separate $125,000 profit exclusion upon 
the sale of your principal residence. Even if you use yours, your ex-husband 
may still use his when he sells his home. (Remember, however, that because you 
do not own the home by yourself, only your share of the gain is subject to your 
exclusion.) 
</P>
<P>
 Your ability to leave your home to your children depends entirely on how you 
and your ex-husband hold title to the home. If you are joint tenants with right 
of survivorship, your ex-husband will automatically inherit the home upon your 
death (and so would you if he were the first to die). If you are 
tenants-in-common, you are entitled to leave your half of the home to whomever 
you wish. 
</P>
<P>
 If your ex-husband is sued, your home could very easily be involved in a 
settlement because it is one of his assets, although only his share would be 
directly affected. Nevertheless, you could be forced to sell the home or buy 
out your ex-husband's share if he required its cash value to settle a debt or 
judgment. Liability for Insurance Proceeds on a Home 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In a recent column you said that homeowners have about four years to 
reinvest their insurance proceeds from a casualty loss before those funds are 
considered taxable by the government. I do not want to reinvest my proceeds, 
and my attorney says I won't have to pay taxes on them. Is that right? -- G.K . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The advice is only partially correct. Whether you actually face a tax 
liability on the unspent insurance proceeds depends on several factors. And you 
may not know the final answer until you actually sell your home and determine 
the extent of your gain, if any. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the rule governing unreinvested casualty insurance proceeds: Your 
settlement is not taxable unless it results in a gain for you. How would that 
work? Let's say your home has a tax basis of $100,000 and a fair market value 
of $500,000. You received a $250,000 insurance settlement from the earthquake 
that you have decided to spend on your children's education and an 
around-the-world cruise. As a result, you would face an immediate tax liability 
on $150,000 -- the amount the insurance settlement exceeds your home's basis. 
That is the most direct and obvious example. Here's another. 
</P>
<P>
 Your home has a $100,000 basis and a $300,000 market value, and you receive a 
$25,000 insurance settlement that you will not use to repair your home. Because 
the settlement is less than your home's basis, there is no direct or immediate 
tax liability. However, your house's tax basis will be increased by the $25,000 
amount of the settlement. If you were to sell it for $300,000, and not purchase 
a replacement home of equal or greater value, you would be liable for taxes on 
$225,000, not the $200,000 that was your tax basis prior to receipt of the 
insurance money. What to Do With Bonds Left After a Death 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I recently discovered three U.S. Savings Bonds that my adult son purchased 
shortly before his death nine years ago. My son had no will at the time of his 
death, and the bonds had no beneficiary. No taxes have ever been paid on the 
bonds' accrued interest. Is there any way I can cash these bonds? Who is 
responsible for the taxes on the accrued interest? -- B.G . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Assuming that the bonds were held in your son's name only and that your son 
had neither a wife nor children, you are entitled as his mother to cash the 
bonds. To do this you must complete a document entitled "application for 
disposition as heir entitled," Form PDF 5336 from the Federal Reserve Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The form is available by calling the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City at 
(800) 333-2919. After completing the form, your signature must be certified, 
and the document must be mailed with the bonds and a certificate of your son's 
death back to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City at P.O. Box 419440, 
Kansas City, MO 64141. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you cash the bonds, you are liable for the income taxes owed on the 
interest the bonds generated since their purchase. When Tax Is Deferred on 
Investment Switch 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am selling a rental property and purchasing another through a 1031 
exchange. I expect to receive some money through this transaction. Are these 
funds taxable, or is any tax deferred until I sell the new property? -- E.V . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The answer depends on the reason you receive cash out of the deal. 
Remember, to be eligible for a tax-deferred exchange of investment property, 
you must purchase a piece of real estate of equal or greater value than the one 
you are disposing of. If you do not reinvest your total proceeds, you are 
liable for taxes on the invested remainder, what accountants and others 
commonly refer to as "the boot." However, if there is another reason you are to 
receive this cash -- a lower interest rate on your new loan would be one -- you 
would not be liable for taxes on the money. 
</P>
<P>
 One caution: Such exchanges are sophisticated transactions subject to some 
fairly strict income tax statutes. You would be wise to consult an attorney or 
accountant who specializes in these deals before you proceed. The tax 
consequences if you are ruled ineligible for the tax deferral could be 
staggering.

EX-COWBOY TIPS HIS HAT TO TEAMWORK; APPAREL: DREW PEARSON'S VENTURE GREW TO A 
$77.5-MILLION BUSINESS IN 1993. HE CREDITS HARD WORK AND SURROUNDING HIMSELF 
WITH SAVVY PARTNERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Along with the success Drew Pearson has enjoyed in life, he's had to put up 
with plenty of ribbing. That was true 20 years ago on the football field, and 
it's true today in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the 1975 National Football Conference title game, when the Dallas Cowboys 
trailed Minnesota by four points with less than a minute left. Cowboys 
quarterback Roger Staubach launched a 50-yard desperation pass to Pearson, who 
outleaped the Vikings' Nate Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson's catch gave the Cowboys a 17-14 victory and sent them to the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 That play, known as the Hail Mary, is perhaps the shining moment of Pearson's 
National Football League career. But the ex-wide receiver has had to defend it 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "He claims I pushed him," he said of Wright. "And I claim I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson also finds himself defending Drew Pearson Cos., a 9-year-old venture 
that last year sold 24 million hats, most with officially licensed pro sports 
logos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get a lot of snide remarks: 'Hats? Hats? Why are you getting into 
that? What, you can't find a job?' " Pearson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he did after the Hail Mary play, Pearson is getting the last laugh. DPC 
had 1993 sales of $77.5 million, and was selected as Black Enterprise 
magazine's 1994 company of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to know this is what hats can do for you," said the 43-year-old 
Pearson, whose company is the 15th-largest black-owned industrial-service 
business in the country. (One of his Cowboys teammates, Jean S. Fugett Jr., led 
the nation's biggest black-owned firm, TLC Beatrice International Holdings 
Inc., until early this year.) 
</P>
<P>
 DPC has 37 licensing agreements, which include the NFL, the National 
Basketball Assn., Major League Baseball, the Walt Disney Co. and Warner Bros. 
Its hats are sold in stores worldwide including Foot Locker, JC Penney, Sears 
and Target. 
</P>
<P>
 Nye Lavalle of Sports Marketing Group-Dallas said the business is among the 
top 10 in pro baseball and basketball hat sales, and the top five in NFL sales. 
</P>
<P>
 DPC is tiny compared to sporting goods giants like Starter and Russell 
Athletics, but it still manages to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly think they're viewed as a fine organization," Russell spokesman 
Wesley Haynes said from the company's Alexander City, Ala., headquarters. "They 
definitely deserve the award." 
</P>
<P>
 Although hats are just one part of the sportswear industry, DPC sells only 
hats. 
</P>
<P>
 DPC's three-person design team constantly churns out unique designs, about 60 
for each season. The hats may feature lightning bolts with the Pittsburgh 
Steelers' colors, swirling Houston Rockets hues or even Looney Tunes characters 
like the Tasmanian Devil decked out in New York Yankee pin stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to come up with more innovative designs, more fashionable designs so 
that the buyer and the consumer can have an alternative," Pearson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson has also graced his hats with distinctive labels: his initials 
surrounding a Dallas Cowboys-like star. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not only getting a Minnesota Vikings hat or a Dallas Cowboys hat, but 
they're getting a Drew Pearson hat as well," Lavalle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a market niche has been central to DPC's success, but Pearson's name 
has also been a factor, Lavalle said: "He has an identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Pearson hats are marketable because he remains popular 11 years after his 
playing days ended. He is the Cowboys' all-time leader in receptions, with 489. 
And in 11 seasons with the Cowboys, Pearson had 7,822 receiving yards, caught 
48 touchdown passes and was an NFL All-Pro three times. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pearson had some trouble settling into life after football. Brief stays in 
the broadcast booth and on the sidelines as a Cowboys assistant helped Pearson 
decide he wasn't an analyst or a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the 1985-86 season, tired of 16-hour days as the Cowboys' 
receivers coach, Pearson contacted entrepreneurs Ken Shead and Mike Russell, 
who had pitched a hat-manufacturing venture to him several times in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the season, DPC was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first office was Ken Shead's house," said Pearson, one of the three 
employees when the company started. It now has 150. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson said football taught him the importance of trusting the business sense 
of Shead and Russell, who had been in marketing and sales for Sperry Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody can't be a quarterback in football, and in business, everybody 
can't be the financial guy, and everybody can't be marketing guy, everybody 
can't be administrator," said Pearson, who is also part owner of a Dallas 
sports bar. "So you have to go out and get those people and bring that 
expertise around you." 
</P>
<P>
 In DPC, Pearson handles league relations and public relations; Russell 
specializes in marketing; Shead deals with sales and new business; and a fourth 
partner, Dave Briskie, specializes in finance. 
</P>
<P>
 DPC initially struggled to get financing or major licenses, and had to start 
out catering to local high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our initial approaches to the NBA, the NFL, baseball and Disney met with 
quite a bit of resistance," said Shead, adding that they were rejected for 
every major contract at least four times. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's big break came when it was awarded a merchandising license for 
the 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. After that, the big leagues 
eventually came around. The NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball granted licenses 
to DPC in 1987.

HONDA READIES ACCORD-BASED MINIVAN FOR U.S. MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Honda is hoping its Ohio-built Accord, which vies with the Ford Taurus for 
bragging rights as the country's best-selling car, will be a strong springboard 
for a leap into the global minivan market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Honda Odyssey, a seven-passenger van based on the Accord chassis but built 
in Japan, will go on sale in the United States in January. Its competitors will 
be vehicles that have become more and more sophisticated as the number of 
minivan buyers has grown to more than a million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Odyssey will be somewhat smaller than the market's major players, 
Chrysler's Town & Country, Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, and Ford's new 
Windstar. That might initially be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think when people get in the vehicle and see the flexibility of the 
vehicle . . . that will go away," Honda spokesman Art Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our research told us people wanted three things," he said. "Car-like 
handling, car-like maneuverability and safety." 
</P>
<P>
 The Odyssey is aimed at buyers who want standard dual air bags, antilock disc 
brakes, a body that meets crash-test standards for cars and an independent rear 
suspension for handling, Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has two hinged doors on each side and a lift-gate rear door. Its third seat 
folds flat into the floor, as in some conventional station wagons, with the 
spare tire stowed to one side. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda hopes to sell about 25,000 Odysseys in North America the first year and 
up to 70,000 worldwide. If sales here are strong, the company might eventually 
build Odysseys in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The international plans are part of the reason for Odyssey's size. Japanese 
buyers prefer narrower minivans. Toyota, for example, builds a separate, 
narrower version of the Previa for sales at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner said a base of potential U.S. Odyssey buyers already exists: "Honda 
owners that had to go elsewhere in the past when they wanted a minivan." 
</P>
<P>
 Odyssey prices will start at about $23,000 compared to low-end Chryslers and 
Fords that can be bought for about $6,000 less. It will be powered by a 
four-cylinder, 140-horsepower engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda acknowledges that lack of a six-cylinder engine might be a disadvantage. 
The company is adding a six-cylinder to Accord's options for 1995, and it is 
assumed that the new engine eventually will be available for Odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda's reputation for high-quality, user-friendly vehicles is expected to be 
a major Odyssey asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Honda will be interesting to watch because it is smaller, four-cylinder 
only. It doesn't fit what we think the minivan market has evolved to," said 
Richard A. Winter, minivan general product manager for Chrysler, the industry 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is a Honda."

DANCING IS ON THE MENU AT CHINESE EATERY; UP TO 80 OLDER CHINESE AMERICANS 
GATHER AT NEW WON KOK RESTAURANT THREE TIMES A WEEK TO EAT, DRINK, SING AND DO 
THE CHA-CHA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE SEO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crowd gathered on the second floor of the New Won Kok Restaurant in 
Lincoln Heights can't help but go a little wild when they hear the lively 
rhythm of cha-cha music. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately after the music starts, women wearing floral dresses and 
men with slicked-back hair strut toward the dance floor and start grooving to 
the one-two, cha-cha-cha beat. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood is distinctively upbeat as this crowd of older Chinese Americans 
swivel their hips to popular Chinese songs blaring through the restaurant's 
karaoke sound system. That's the scene every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday 
night, when up to 80 Chinese American senior citizens come to party. 
</P>
<P>
 After dining on Cantonese specialties, some of the senior citizens sing 
Chinese songs with a karaoke machine accompaniment, while the rest of the group 
dances the tango, the twist, fox trot, and, of course, the cha-cha. 
</P>
<P>
 "My favorite dance is the cha-cha, but I like disco music too," said Hsu Mong, 
59, a retiree who is a regular dancer at the restaurant at 2411 N. Broadway. "I 
come because it's good for my health and I can make some new friends. I look 
forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities began more than a year ago when owner Sylvia Hom invited her 
friends to make use of the restaurant's spacious dance floor and karaoke 
machine. Before long, her friends invited their friends. Then their friends 
brought their friends. Now, dozens of regulars and newcomers attend -- all of 
whom are charged only for the food they eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chinese people now know how to enjoy life," said Hom. "In the old days, even 
if we hit 60, we still worried about saving money. All we did was stay at home 
and buy property. Now, we're taking care of ourselves. We realize life is too 
valuable not to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason Hom is so adamant about people enjoying themselves is she 
knows what it's like to lose the will to live. In 1984, her husband, Vincent, 
died -- leaving her with three children to care for on her own. The family's 
restaurant was also destroyed by arson two months after it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was depressed for two years, but then I decided that my life had to go on," 
she said. "I don't make much money doing this, but I don't care because I'm 
happy on these three nights because I'm dancing and singing." 
</P>
<P>
 On most weeknights, the festivities begin at 6:30, when the older people, 
along with some in their 30s and 40s, sit at large round tables sharing plates 
of Chinese broccoli, chow mein and the restaurant's seafood specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While dinner is served, a few karaoke singers stand in front of a video 
monitor and belt out lyrics of their favorite Chinese opera songs. Although 
people politely applaud after the singers wrap up their high-pitched, 
slow-paced and lengthy opera selections, it's clear that some in the audience 
are eager to dance. 
</P>
<P>
 When an older gentleman -- whom many in the room consider to be the group's 
best singer -- takes the stage, people begin to stir. The man's smooth and 
strong voice instantly draws people to the dance floor, seducing them to shake 
their hips and shuffle their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those waltzing across the room are Norman and Lily Yee of Pasadena, who 
have been dancing together since they were married 48 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dance to keep young," said Norman Yee, 70, a youthful-looking regular. 
"Before, Chinese people just stayed home. Now, we know that health is the most 
important thing. We want to eat well, exercise and spend our money." 
</P>
<P>
 Lily Yee, in a sleeveless blouse and flowing skirt, said she and her husband 
go dancing twice a week. Lily Yee, who is 65 and has six grandchildren, said 
she favors the New Won Kok dance floor because there's a lot of room to move 
around. "It's not crammed like the other places," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hom started the dance nights, she hired two dance instructors to teach 
the group the basics of ballroom dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, a lot of people "were not so good," said Anna Kwong, one of the 
instructors. But now, most people have no trouble with the complicated steps of 
the tango or fox trot, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although women usually outnumber men at the restaurant, it rarely poses a 
problem because women have no qualms about dancing with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so happy when we dance," Hom said. "We don't worry about anything 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Wong, a 58-year-old businessman from Silver Lake, comes to dance twice 
a week with his wife. Sometimes, he also brings his 90-year-old brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves to swing dance," Wong said. "He's pretty good too."

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; HOUSING FOR DISABLED HOMELESS TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A newly renovated house with bright colors and helpful features, including a 
long hallway that will be turned into an art gallery, will become home to eight 
disabled homeless people later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 When it opens Oct. 27, the house at 3551 E. 4th St. will be the only shelter 
for the homeless disabled on the Eastside, according to members of Community 
Rehabilitation Services Inc., a 16-year-old nonprofit organization at Centro 
Maravilla that helps the disabled become more independent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken us about three years to get here," Al Rivera, board president for 
CRS, said as he stood in the back room that will be used for classes. "It 
started with an idea, and then someone told us there was money out there for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to provide accessible, low-cost housing and classes in job 
skills, financial management and self-defense to help residents become more 
independent, said Patricia Torres, CRS support services program director.  
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Marquez, 45, will move into the house in about a month, which she said 
will relieve the pressure of having to live with friends. Marquez is epileptic 
and has diabetes and hopes to find a job after moving into her new home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really pretty and quiet. It's beautiful," she said. "I live with a 
friend now and there's a lot of problems associated with that and tension. It's 
very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez volunteers at Unification of Disabled Latin Americans, a group in the 
Wilshire area that finds services and homes for the disabled. One of the most 
important things for the disabled is a fully accessible home, said the group's 
founder, Ruben Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Housing for disabled individuals is one of the most important tools of 
rehabilitation," Hernandez said. "With accessible housing, they can attain 
their goals, such as school, finding activities and work. This housing is a 
gift." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-bedroom, two-bath home is a "transitional living facility" designed 
to help residents learn to live on their own after a stay of no more than two 
years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two back doors are at ground level, and a curving ramp will be built in front 
to accommodate wheelchairs. Both bathrooms have showers at floor level and are 
wide enough for people in wheelchairs to roll right in. Kitchen cabinets 
feature wide handles to make it easier for people with hand mobility problems 
to open them. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization looked in several neighborhoods for a shelter location, but 
some residents were opposed, fearing drug and alcohol addicts would be brought 
in for treatment. The owner of the house they settled on was willing to sell 
the property to house the homeless disabled, and neighbors soon came around to 
the idea, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastside has an estimated 150,000 disabled adults, and the group expected 
to be flooded with applications after homeless shelters and agencies that help 
the disabled were told of the new home. But, so far, few people have applied, 
and only three have been accepted to live there.  
</P>
<P>
 It appears the targeted population is more difficult to contact than had been 
anticipated. "But we'll find them," Torres said. "We know they're out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The property was purchased for $215,000 and renovated for an additional 
$230,000, Rivera said. Grants and loans were provided by the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
and the California Community Foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 Community Rehabilitation Services, which serves 6,000 people a year, is hoping 
to expand with offices in the Pasadena/Altadena area and near the City of 
Commerce. It also hopes to build another transitional home for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's been real supportive because there is such a need," Rivera said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; HOLLENBECK POLICE NEED VOLUNTEER HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police at the Hollenbeck Division substation are seeking volunteers to work 
desk jobs and perform other duties to free up police officers for street 
patrols.  
</P>
<P>
 Officer Bob Garcia, who is in charge of recruiting, wants to sign up 40 to 50 
residents for the volunteer positions, which will involve taking reports from 
people who walk into the station, helping investigators follow up on reports, 
performing clerical duties and, as part of a special unit, responding to 
domestic violence cases to help with relocation, referrals and moral support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part about it is they're a community person," Garcia said. "There's 
always a gap between the officer and the victim, even though we try to help. If 
there's a community person there to say, 'I live just four blocks away and I'm 
just here to help,' that would be great." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer program is expanding to allow more officers to be on the streets 
as part of the Los Angeles Police Department's community policing program. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers must be 18 or older and have a clean record. Applicants will be 
screened because they will be involved in sensitive work that requires 
responsibility and maturity, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants will also be asked to go through four Saturdays of classes from 8 
a.m. to noon on the organization of the Police Department, introduction to 
criminal law and other aspects of police work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll get a crash course of what the police officers get in their six-month 
academy training," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the volunteers will be asked to serve a minimum of eight hours 
each month. Garcia hopes the volunteers will eventually run the volunteer 
program themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a high-energy person who is willing to volunteer their time to their 
community," Garcia said. "It's not like they're giving (their time) to anyone 
but themselves and the people they live with, their community. It's an 
outstanding program." 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call Garcia at (213) 485-2949 or pick up an application from 
the Hollenbeck Division substation, 2111 E. 1st St.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; COUNTY COMPLETES PROPERTY APPRAISALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county completed appraisals of most of the properties in the Marengo 
Terrace neighborhood as part of Phase One of the project to build a new 
County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The appraisals, conducted by the county's Internal Services Department, 
included 30 properties on Cummings and Charlotte streets and the west side of 
Chicago Street.The project will eventually displace more than 200 families and 
businesses from the neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Manzanares, project administrator for the commission's Housing 
Development and Preservation unit, will review the appraisals and meet with 
individual homeowners this week. If property owners dispute the appraisers' 
findings, they may hire their own county-approved appraisers at county cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some residents say they hope the negotiations go well, they still 
hold a distrust of government officials and say they may want to hire an 
appraiser who may not be on the list of county-approved appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to sound so suspicious, but we don't know if people (appraisers) want 
to stay on the good side of the county," said Amparo Juarez, who has lived in 
her Cummings Street house for more than 40 years. "We'll see if the amount of 
money we're going to get, if it's reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the looming questions for homeowners who have rental units on their 
properties is if they will be compensated for the loss of that income, Juarez 
said. They were told at a meeting Tuesday that they will receive market value 
for the rental property. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood will be demolished to make way for a $1.1-billion project 
that will include a hospital replacing all four existing hospitals and two 
outpatient clinics at County-USC Medical Center. The 2.1-million-square-foot 
hospital is expected to be completed by 2002.

<P>
 Irene Hirano, 47, the president and executive director of the Japanese 
American National Museum, has been appointed to a presidential committee that 
studies and promotes public arts and humanities programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee on the Arts and Humanities comprises a diverse group of artists, 
scholars, writers, business leaders and community activists -- including music 
producer Quincy Jones and "M. Butterfly" playwright David Henry Hwang. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President wanted to assure that there was good ethnic diversity on the 
committee, and so hopefully I can bring my experience as a Japanese American 
and as an Asian American to the deliberations that the committee will 
undertake," Hirano said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the group's first meeting Sept. 21, Clinton asked that members report 
in a year on the status of America's cultural life, whether programs nationwide 
have made any strides in bridging cultural and ethnic differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, created by executive order in 1982, will also be responsible 
for seeking new ways to increase private and public funding of the arts and 
humanities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirano, of West Los Angeles, has served as president and executive director of 
the nonprofit Japanese American National Museum since 1988. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; $500,000 MORE OKD FOR CABLE CAR PROJECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a proposal to increase from $1 million to $1.5 
million the design costs for restoration of Angels Flight, the twin cable-car 
system that once serviced Bunker Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had originally agreed to pay Harris & Associates $1 million to 
manage reconstruction of Angels Flight, built in 1901 and dismantled in 1969 to 
make way for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 The $537,000 increase mainly arose out of the city's decision to provide 
wheelchair access on one of the cable cars -- even though the city's historic 
railway is exempt from federal Americans with Disabilities Act guidelines, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members on Wednesday unanimously approved the added expense to Harris' 
contract, on the condition that an audit be done and that the Community 
Redevelopment Agency seek additional funding from the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action also allows the Community Redevelopment Agency board to 
vote on a construction contract later this month, said Jeffrey Skorneck, Bunker 
Hill project manager for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction could then begin by December, and Angels Flight could be back on 
track by the end of 1995, Skorneck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "the world's shortest railway," the restored orange-and-black rail cars 
will run on tracks half a block south of 3rd Street, between Hill and Olive 
streets. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; THE MONSTER THAT ATE THE RECESSION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Godzilla vs. King Kong. Godzilla vs. Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 Godzilla vs. the recession ?  
</P>
<P>
 That's right. Japan's famed monster with the bad breath could help wipe away 
the economic woes that have marred Little Tokyo and surrounding Downtown 
businesses since the 1992 riots, according to some local merchants and artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is proposing that a statue of the fictional, dinosaur-like character 
be erected alongside or as part of a family entertainment, monster and science 
fiction movie museum in Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Godzilla is an icon," said Sheila Rollins, 49, a visual artist who owns an 
apartment building on Traction Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's Japanese. He's American. Everybody knows him. Kids would like to come 
and see (the museum)." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have yet to review the group's suggestion, but Howard Gantman, 
press deputy for Councilwoman Rita Walters, said: "It might be an interesting 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The Godzilla museum idea was among the "most popular and unique suggestions" 
among submissions from about 80 people to the Community Redevelopment Agency, 
according to a consultants' report. 
</P>
<P>
 CRA staff spent $10,000 to hire consultants Kats Kunitsugu and Sumiko Takase, 
who organized brainstorming sessions over the past year with Little Tokyo and 
surrounding Downtown residents, merchants, artists and property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the Little Tokyo Opportunities Inventory was to collect 
community ideas for making Little Tokyo more appealing to tourists and 
visitors, and to find ways to turn those ideas into reality, said Gloria 
Uchida, CRA project manager for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recommendations for future projects included a bridge to connect the 
artists' colony on Traction Avenue to 2nd Street, a multipurpose gymnasium that 
could be called the Little Tokyo Megaplex, a toy museum that could be 
incorporated with the Godzilla monster museum, a public aquarium to display 
Downtown's seafood industry and a Japanese products complex to house consumer 
representatives from Japanese electronics firms and auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although CRA officials said they don't have funds to pay for all of the 
proposed projects, they plan by December to produce pamphlets featuring most of 
the ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2,000 will then be distributed to developers or businesses in an 
effort to seek outside funding, said Mickey Gustin, arts planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, CRA staff can provide money for some of the less expensive ideas 
from the community, such as tree plantings around Little Tokyo, Uchida said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Uyemura, a 47-year-old artist who heads the Godzilla museum group, said 
CRA staff should consider asking American or Japanese filmmakers for financial 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone Downtown, and I think Little Tokyo especially, is just suffering 
from the economy and the bad P.R. we got from the riots," said Uyemura, a 
visual communications designer at Mrs. Gooch's decor studio. The community 
"needs some kind of a major attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 A Godzilla museum is highly possible in Little Tokyo and would also be unique 
to America, said Qathryn Brehm, also an artist. Currently, the only known 
Godzilla memorial is in Kobe, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultant Kunitsugu said a business improvement district, similar to the 
city's first on Broadway, is an alternative to obtaining funds needed for arts 
and visual projects in Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only way we are going to be able to do anything," she said. TOMMY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-WILSHIRE; BOOK SALE WILL AID WILTON PLACE SCHOOL

 Bathroom repairs and lawn maintenance are part of the wish list a local 
elementary school hopes to fulfill with the help of a book sale Thursday and 
Friday at Central Plaza, 3460 Wilshire Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two weeks, businesses in 22 buildings in the 3000 block of 
Wilshire have been gathering books from their employees in bins decorated by 
kindergarten through fifth-grade students at Wilton Place School. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third year the book sale will help the school pay for expenses not 
covered by public school funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Public funds "don't cover all the things we really want," said Linda 
Dinerstein, assistant principal. "So this has been a wonderful project." 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from each annual sale have averaged between $1,500 and $2,000, said 
Christine King, a spokeswoman for Central Plaza, which helped develop the book 
drives along with the Wilshire Chamber of Commerce. The collection bins were 
donated by Bekins Business Relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the school used book-sale funds to purchase instructional materials, 
including videocassette recorders and tape recorders. Last year, the school 
purchased computer software and microscopes for science classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some instructional materials for teachers and students will be purchased this 
year, but the school's greatest need right now is for preventive maintenance, 
Dinerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Plaza book sale will run from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day. Book 
browsers will be able to snack on baked goods sold by Wilton Place parents and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 For information or to donate books, call Alexandra Dia at Central Plaza, (213) 
487-3770. LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; SSIREUM WRESTLERS THROW WEIGHT AROUND FOR 
NEW FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It may not have done what the recent World Cup games did for soccer, but last 
weekend's 21st annual Los Angeles Koreatown Multicultural Festival helped 
solidify the growing local popularity of an ancient Korean sport and national 
pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport is ssireum , a style of wrestling similar to Japanese sumo that has 
been popular in Korea since the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted from 57 BC 
to AD 668. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the Korean American community of modern-day Los Angeles, ssireum is 
enjoying an increase in prominence, largely due to the efforts of the Korean 
Folk Wrestling Assn. in U.S.A., an informal network of retired professional 
wrestlers and younger enthusiasts formed three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have over 200 members now," said association member and longtime amateur 
wrestler Sam Chong, 38, as he wound down after a match during the festival at 
Ardmore Park, next to the sand-filled ring in which ssireum is traditionally 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Korean people enjoy ssireum, so it is becoming very popular here," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 This was the second year the association sponsored an amateur ssireum 
competition at the Koreatown Festival. Out of the almost 20 men who lined up 
around the sand ring to compete, several were beginners, many of them young, 
second-generation Korean Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here and saw them play last year," said Thomas Hyung, a 20-year-old 
Cal State Northridge student, as he awaited his turn. "I wrestled in high 
school, so I wanted to try this out." 
</P>
<P>
 According to tradition, ssireum originated in China -- where ancient tomb 
paintings show wrestlers in positions similar to those used today -- and was 
carried into the Korean peninsula by migrating tribes. Originally a method of 
self-defense, ssireum grew into a popular spectator sport played at village 
festivals and remains one of the most popular spectator sports in Korea, with 
competitions drawing several thousand onlookers, as well as a large television 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The sand-filled ring used is about 22 feet in diameter. Each player wears 
shorts and a long cotton belt called a sapha , which he wraps around his waist 
and right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 A match consists of three rounds, each three minutes long. At the beginning of 
each round, the players squat close together on the sand, holding onto one 
another's sapha. When the referee gives the signal, they begin to wrestle. The 
first player to fall loses the round. If a player wins two out of three rounds, 
he wins the match. 
</P>
<P>
 In ancient times, the winner of a ssireum competition would usually receive a 
bull as a prize. Now that live bulls are no longer practical, a small bull 
trophy is sometimes handed to the winner instead. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two weight classes on Korean professional teams: hanla-jangsa (220 
pounds or less), and baekdo-jangsa (over 220 pounds). Weight is flexible, 
however, for local amateurs, said Gene Kim, chairman of the Koreatown Assn. and 
a ssireum fan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean Folk Wrestling Assn. in U.S.A. is headed by Kwang Il Kim, a retired 
wrestler who competed professionally in Korea in his youth. Although the 
association does not have a set gathering place, members often meet at various 
Tae Kwon Do studios throughout the Korean community to play and practice, 
usually learning of the gatherings through word of mouth, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Older wrestlers teach ssireum techniques to new recruits, many of whom had 
their first exposure to the sport through television or attending one of the 
association's occasional public competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of this year's Koreatown Festival activities, Kim arranged for several 
professional teams to visit from South Korea and compete at the Grand Olympic 
Auditorium a few days before the amateur competition.  
</P>
<P>
 Kim hopes that the professional event, which drew more than 2,000 spectators, 
helped kindle greater interest in ssireum not only among Korean Americans, but 
among the general population as well. LESLIE BERESTEIN

 To give aspiring art students a taste of college-level art classes, the Otis 
College of Art and Design has added two free drawing workshops to the schedule 
for its traditional fall open house, which will be held at 11:30 a.m. on Oct. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty members will discuss the school's programs, financial aid, how to put 
together a portfolio to apply to the school, and how to transfer class credits 
from community colleges.Afterward, prospective students may attend workshops 
offering professional instruction from the Otis staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will give them a sense of what a college drawing class will be like," said 
Francy Balcomb, a spokeswoman for the college. 
</P>
<P>
 The Otis College of Art and Design offers bachelor of fine arts degrees in 
communication arts, environmental arts, fashion and fine arts. A majority of 
its students come from the Los Angeles area, and almost 50% are minorities,

 Patsy Harris, a vigorous woman who works nearly nonstop, remembers when life 
seemed too tenuous to think past expiration dates on credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't even bear to look at my driver's license. I figured I probably 
wouldn't make it four years," recalled Harris, 46, a Crenshaw district 
resident. "I was out of the hospital and seemed OK. But other, emotional, 
problems were just beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Two-and-a-half years later, Harris is president of Sisters Breast Cancer 
Survivors Network, a support service group that tends to the day-to-day needs 
of women living with -- and dying from -- breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most of its members are African American, the group is open to all 
women who are struggling to regain some normalcy after having their lives 
capsized by the disease. Harris and a core group of nine volunteers work almost 
daily to ease the psychological burdens of patients -- many of whom are single, 
unemployed and underinsured. Many are residents of the Central City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try and demystify a lot of things for them," explained Harris, whose group 
meets for monthly support sessions at a Hawthorne church. "The difference 
between a lumpectomy and a mastectomy, what drugs are involved in chemotherapy, 
where to order prostheses. Surgery is actually the easiest part. People pat you 
on the back after you get out of the hospital and say, 'You're going to be 
fine.' That's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Network member Kay Powell, a five-year cancer survivor who works closely with 
Harris, said working with women "in the trenches" has created a life-sustaining 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a need for dealing with patients after surgery and after 
treatment. That's the emotional part," said Powell, a South-Central resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We help each other deal with husbands, children, grocery shopping. We're 
there with them in a way doctors and hospitals can't be." 
</P>
<P>
 During a typical week, Harris and others shuttle patients to and from 
hospitals, cook and deliver meals to women, find cleaning help and ease newly 
discharged patients into new routines of living with tubes, drug therapy and 
physical and emotional scars. 
</P>
<P>
 Such changes, said Harris, are very difficult for women accustomed to 
independence.  
</P>
<P>
 "Women -- particularly black women -- are so used to being the strong one, the 
provider, the caretaker," said Harris, who frequently gets late-night calls 
from distraught patients. "We're there to tell them, 'It's OK not to wash 
clothes today. It's OK not to cook or clean.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Sisters network is a spinoff of Women of Color, a similar 
support group run out of Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood. Harris 
and her core group, who comprised the outreach component of that organization, 
broke away and formed their own independent group in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women of Color strictly served black women. We wanted to include all women, 
although our focus is black women," Harris explained.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sisters network is looking to set up community locales at such sites as 
the Crenshaw YWCA and Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center. Through 
King-Drew, the group is working to establish a database that can keep members 
informed about breaking news, issues and research about breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the issues the network addresses are weighty. Recently, 27 of its 
members proudly displayed plaster versions of their torsos during a weekend 
exhibit at the Federal Building in Westwood. The event was the Los Angeles 
Breast Cancer Alliance's annual kickoff of national Breast Cancer Awareness 
Month in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our casts really stood out because they were brown, not white," said Harris, 
smiling. "That hadn't been done before. It's just one way we get back a sense 
of empowerment."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: HYDE PARK; SCHOOL CENTER PUTS FOCUS ON BELONGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a cluster of bungalows alongside the parking lot at Hyde Park School, 
parents and professionals are quietly pioneering a community project that they 
hope will bring together parents and children to improve education. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyde Park Family Service Center's name may sound generic, but its 
structure and ambitions are extensive. Launched in July, the center offers 
services ranging from day care to youth intervention in an effort to address 
the needs of families in the Hyde Park and Crenshaw areas. Perhaps most unique 
about the center is its staff: three of the four full-timers are parents of 
children in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to bring in families and empower them," said center coordinator 
Muriel Bragg, who has two children at Hyde Park School. "We don't want to hear 
them use any more excuses about not getting involved, like, 'I don't have 
transportation.' We're right here in the neighborhood, and we can provide 
transportation for people who need it." 
</P>
<P>
 The center works with 25 city, county and community agencies to provide 
services from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Mondays through Fridays. Program components 
include mental health services, social work case management, public safety 
information, day care and daily classes in English for Spanish-speaking adults. 
Cooperating agencies and organizations include the county departments of Public 
Social Services and Childrens Services, Hope in Youth, the Los Angeles Police 
Department, Families in New Directions, and Westside Counseling and Training. 
Parents can walk in any time for free services or to schedule appointments.  
</P>
<P>
 Parent Monica Craig said that in addition to feeling more of a stake in the 
school, she is benefiting culturally.  
</P>
<P>
 "I run the day-care center for parents taking ESL classes from 8 to 1," she 
said. "I'm actually starting to learn some Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Hyde Park School is one of the Los Angeles Unified School District's 34 
pioneer LEARN schools, the Family Service Center is the first of its kind in 
the district. It received about $100,000 from its year-round host school and 
another $50,000 in a state planning grant to start up this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very different from other parent centers in that it brings several 
components under one roof," said Hyde Park Principal Mattye Fegan. "A lot of 
parents in our community need to travel distances to see probation officers, 
social service people, family counselors. We streamline things for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Service Center operates at Hyde Park School, Bragg said, she 
intends to open it up to the entire Crenshaw-Dorsey cluster of schools -- 32 in 
all -- next month. She and other parents, called community reps, have been 
spreading the word about the center with flyers and along a parent network. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise its visibility, the center is hosting a rap and musical concert from 
3 to 6 p.m. Saturday at the school auditorium, 3140 Hyde Park Blvd. There will 
also be food vendors, games and other activities beginning at noon.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL/WATTS; SAYING YES TO JOBS FOR AT-RISK 
YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Saying "yes" to alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the fledgling Youth Employment Systems (YES) is all about -- 
providing jobs for high-risk, unemployable youths from the inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
 A brainchild of Watts community leader James Smith, 47, the nonprofit youth 
employment organization prepares youths 16 to 24 who have dropped out of school 
for careers in construction, the film industry and environmental fields. In the 
last 15 months, YES has trained and placed 15 youths in a variety of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need someone to help us with these fields," said Darrell Straight, 22, a 
high school dropout at 16 who recently graduated from Los Angeles Achievement 
School, a South-Central adult school, with Smith's encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Smith's contacts in the movie industry, Straight has been able to work 
on several film projects, most recently as a production assistant on an 
upcoming Miramax film, "Glass Shields." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa-based ENSR, an environmental consulting and engineering firm, is 
working with YES to help train youths in hazardous waste disposal as well as 
graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith hopes to expand the program to 30 youths a year. YES started with 
$150,000 in funding from individual and corporate supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 YES belongs to the Los Angeles Urban Youth and Family Coalition, 40 youth 
service groups sponsored by Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. The coalition 
competes with other youth service programs for city funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is also searching for a sponsor who could provide office space in 
South-Central or Watts to hold classes in job skills. He is now working out of 
borrowed office space in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, YES will hold its second Youth in Action Awards fund-raiser, which will 
take place at the House of Blues, 8430 Sunset Blvd., from 2 to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Before establishing YES, Smith directed the city Community Development 
Department's Gang and Drug Diversion and Job Training Program at Nickerson 
Gardens in Watts for four years. It was shortly after the spring riots of 1992 
that Smith founded YES, based on a Los Angeles Housing Authority project that 
trained youths in the construction field.  
</P>
<P>
 YouthBuild USA, a national training and job placement program, was seeking to 
build a model agency in the inner city and gave YES $7,000 in seed money.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith's experience with drop-out students dates back to when he founded 
dropout prevention programs in Inglewood and Los Angeles schools in 1988 and 
1991, respectively. From that experience and his work in Nickerson Gardens, 
Smith came to believe that hands-on job training was an important way to boost 
self-esteem and steer youths away from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what (youths) need. That's what they want. That's what they deserve, 
so they can have a piece of that American Dream," Smith said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; 800 ATTEND COLLEGE INFORMATION FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 800 area 10th-, 11th and 12th-grade students attended a college 
information fair recently at Huntington Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
 College recruiters from throughout California and the country helped students 
with queries about applications and admissions requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to the people from Stanford, Harvard and Berkeley," said Jessica 
Rochat, 15, a 10th-grader at Huntington Park High who is planning to be a 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recruiters basically answered questions about what they could offer and 
encouraged us to apply despite high costs," said Rochat, who attended the Oct. 
1 conference with her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the conference was to promote higher education among Latino 
students, said Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia (D-Huntington Park), sponsor of 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of the students attending public schools in California are of Latino 
origin, said Escutia, yet no more than 6% of the University of California 
graduating class is Latino, and only 11% of students receiving bachelor's 
degrees in the state are Latinos. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: COMMERCE; PROGRAM GIVES GANG MEMBERS A WAY OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three weeks ago when she decided to end her association with the King Cobra 
gang, 17-year-old Christine Figueroa said she received a welcome slap in the 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard slap delivered by a fellow gang member signified that Christine -- 
mother of an 8-month-old boy and pregnant with another child -- was officially 
free to leave the feared King Cobras gang, her surrogate family for nearly five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicknamed "Monstra" because of her size -- Christine stands nearly 6 feet -- 
the ex-gangbanger plans to finish high school and attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize now that I'm a mom, I have to provide a better future for my 
children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She credits the Probation Department's Gang Alternative Prevention Program for 
her decision to depart the world of violence and legal brushes she had known 
since age 13, when she was "jumped" into the gang through a ritual beating 
delivered by four fellow gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was good about GAPP is that it never stopped helping me when I needed 
help," said Christine of the program that targets at-risk youth and directs 
them toward positive activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I just needed to get away from all the gang pressures, they sent me to 
another school in Monrovia where I didn't know anyone that I would get into 
trouble with. The counselors also gave advice to my grandparents, who basically 
raised me." 
</P>
<P>
 Since it arrived in the city of Commerce in 1990, officials say the GAPP 
program is responsible for an impressive decline in the city's recorded gang 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the problem is far from completely solved, Commerce is almost like 
an island of tranquillity wedged in between other violent areas," said Arminda 
Vengco, who handles gang prevention programs for the Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department statistics show seven gang-related 
assaults and no homicides in Commerce in 1993, compared to 140 gang-related 
assaults and 11 homicides in neighboring unincorporated areas of East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks to some good counseling and prevention programs, the gang problem here 
is not one of suppression, but of prevention. . . . Now we have to worry about 
gangs in surrounding areas like Bell Gardens and East L.A. from coming into the 
city," said Ron Padilla, 45, the city's GAPP probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Padilla, Commerce is divided and controlled by two gangs -- the 
King Cobras and Choppers 12. Both gangs originated in the early 1960s in East 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "An integral part of the GAPP program is to get parents, as well as kids, 
involved in expanding awareness about gangs," said Padilla. "If the parents 
don't care or express interest, then it's really hard to reach the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the program, Christine's grandparents attended a 10-week parenting 
class and helped her straighten out. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Padilla, children who are at risk for joining gangs are 
identified early on by school officials based on their attendance records. Even 
among elementary school students, a pattern of tardiness often indicates a 
student is spending time with the wrong crowd or losing interest in structured 
activities that make joining a gang more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the student is referred to GAPP, a series of meetings takes place between 
a probation officer, school officials, law-enforcement officials and parents or 
guardians. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperation and smooth communication between all parties involved, says 
Padilla, is the key to GAPP's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is successful because we target kids early on and don't lose them 
in the bureaucratic shuffle," said Padilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Also helpful is the large amount of funds the city dedicates to crime 
prevention each year. For 1994, nearly 40% of the year's $30.6 million budget 
paid for sheriff's services and crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 For Christine, who sometimes laments the loss of security provided by gang 
life, these efforts have added up to an opportunity to find her own solutions 
to life's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a long time to break away," she said. "But I handled the beatings I 
got when I joined, so now I know I can handle a lot more." SIMON ROMERO

THE FOLLOWERS OF BAHA'I; FOUNDED 150 YEARS AGO, THE FAITH PREACHES UNITY 
THROUGH DIVERSITY AND PROMOTES A PROGRESSIVE AGENDA OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
JUSTICE. ITS CENTRAL MESSAGE OF A PEACEFUL WORLD WITHOUT BORDERS, FOLLOWERS 
SAY, HAS SPECIAL RESONANCE IN RACIALLY DIVIDED L.A.

<P>
 On a cool, breezy evening in Chinatown, beneath a soulful black-and-white 
portrait of a man wearing a turban and white beard, weekly visitors trickle 
into the comfortable living room of Lourdes and Vahid Sanaei. An unemployed 
secretary, a computer programmer, a full-time mother, a flower shop owner, a 
building supervisor. White, black, Latino and Iranian. Some murmur an Arabic 
greeting: Allah' u Abha: God is most glorious. 
</P>
<P>
 Most have embarked on spiritual quests to arrive here, at a Baha'i "fireside," 
an informal educational gathering that mingles believers in the Baha'i faith 
with prospective followers and the merely curious. Under the photographic gaze 
of one of the faith's leaders, Baha'is talked about their independent religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles needs the Baha'i faith," said Bob Hopper, 58, a Baha'i and a city 
tour guide who regularly attends firesides. "Other religions have brought 
similar principles, but they need to be renewed and looked at again, and that's 
what the Baha'i faith does." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded 150 years ago by a Tehran-born nobleman now called Baha'u'llah, the 
Baha'i faith preaches unity through diversity and promotes a progressive agenda 
of social and economic justice and racial and gender equality. For believers, 
it is the means to accomplish what no war or political movement has -- a 
peaceful world without borders uniting all people, all religions and gods. 
</P>
<P>
 Baha'u'llah's central message, "The earth is one country and mankind its 
citizens," followers say, has special resonance in Los Angeles, a city so 
recently shattered by racial divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pioneers in living in unity and diversity," said Amin Banani, a Baha'i 
and UCLA historian. "Los Angeles is becoming a multiracial, multicultural place 
and we are a people who have practiced living as a unified people and have a 
(systematic) plan for doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, that plan has included launching an institute on healing 
racism, a multiethnic youth theater group and an after-school enrichment 
program and a multicultural gospel choir, all based out of the Baha'i 
headquarters in Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those groups, the Baha'i Youth Workshop, founded in 1974 by Oscar and 
Freddie DeGruy in their living room, has worked toward encouraging youths to 
find common interests. The traveling theater troupe, which has toured 
nationally, has included black, white, Latino, Asian, Iranian and about 10% 
non-Baha'i performers. 
</P>
<P>
 As workshop members, "they can be together from different religions and 
different cultures and different races and they can find a point of unity," 
Oscar DeGruy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group visits schools, community centers and other sites and uses hip-hop, 
rap, jazz and other styles to address topics such as peace, equality, education 
and social ills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're brought up to believe that if you don't fit, we don't want you," Oscar 
DeGruy said. "We're all different for a reason and now it's time to share those 
differences with each other. . . . The Baha'i faith gives (the youths) the 
opportunity to come together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Baha'i community's aim is to triple its active members from 
its base of 1,500 in the next two years. There are 5,000 active Baha'i members 
in Southern California and about 110,000 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the Baha'i community in Southern California is one of the largest in 
the country. Its hub is the Baha'i Center, located at the edge of Baldwin Hills 
at Rodeo Road and La Cienega Boulevard. Thornton Chase, an insurance company 
executive who became the first American Baha'i, is buried in Inglewood Park 
Cemetery and his grave site is considered a holy place of pilgrimage. Los 
Angeles is also home to a Baha'i radio show and Kalimat Press, one of three 
Baha'i publishers in the country.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Baha'i community formally organized in 1909, making it one of 
the country's earliest multiracial religious communities, said Muhtadia Rice, 
public information officer for the Baha'is of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The religion forbids missionaries and Baha'is are not allowed to proselytize, 
so the informal firesides held every week across the city are the foremost way 
believers spread the faith. Perhaps because of this low-key approach, the faith 
is relatively unknown, despite an 85-year presence in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're confused with B'nai B'rith, we're confused with Buddhists, or people 
have never heard of us at all," Rice said. "It's critical for us that we are 
accepted as credible and very mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic fundamentalists have called the Baha'i heretics. Other critics dismiss 
the religion as a cult. Scholars still view the faith as somewhat new, small 
and exotic, and there are few non-Baha'i specialists in academia. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, said Diana Eck, a professor in comparative religions at Harvard 
University, the Baha'i faith is a world religion in the sense that, "though it 
is neither very ancient nor very large, you can find Baha'is all over the world 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 With 5 million members in 233 countries and territories worldwide, it is among 
the widest spread and fastest growing religions by percentage increase in the 
world, according to Baha'i researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 This modern faith has attracted followers ranging from entertainers Dizzy 
Gillespie and Jim Seals and Dash Crofts of the singing duo Seals & Crofts, to 
jurists Dorothy W. Nelson, a U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge and her 
husband, retired state Judge James F. Nelson. The Nelsons have hosted weekly 
firesides in their home for 36 years, some of which have drawn more than 200 
people.  
</P>
<P>
 "At first we went to firesides (in the early 1950s) to see if (the Baha'i 
religion) was just one of those 'California things,' " admitted Dorothy Nelson, 
an elected member of the Baha'i National Spiritual Assembly who was raised an 
Episcopalian. By 1954, the Nelsons had left their traditional Christian 
backgrounds for the Baha'i faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Baha'is believe racism is the greatest challenge facing Americans today. The 
faith demands that followers work toward the abolition of prejudice and 
encourages intermarriage to overcome racial barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, Gloria Haithman-Ali, now a USC administrator, realized that Baha'i 
principles of unity and racial equality gave a spiritual name to her personal 
beliefs. As a young black woman in Greensboro, N.C., she had protested and 
demonstrated against discrimination during the civil rights movement. Later, as 
a mother in New York, she recalls seeking a home for her family and being shut 
out of trailer parks and neighborhoods because of her color. One day, she was 
invited to a Baha'i retreat in Teaneck, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point I looked around (the multicultural group) and said 'These are 
the true Christians,' and at that point, in my heart, I knew I was Baha'i," 
recalled Haithman-Ali, who is vice chair of the Los Angeles Baha'i Spiritual 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots, a group of Baha'is formed the Institute for the Healing of 
Racism, and began offering nine-week courses in how to cure what the faith 
considers a moral and social disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has really been a demand for (the classes)," said Haithman-Ali one of 
the institute's founders. "At the end (of the session), hopefully people 
realize it's really the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 What may distinguish the Baha'i faith most from other religions is the belief 
that all religions are part of one religion and that each faith's prophet has 
provided humanity with updates from God. 
</P>
<P>
 Baha'u'llah (1817-1892) is considered the most recent in a line of holy 
messengers sent by God to guide men on earth. Another messenger is expected in 
1,000 years, according to Baha'i teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Baha'i have a real perspective on the unique contributions of all the 
different religions," Eck said. "Other religions don't do that, especially the 
Western, monotheistic religions." 
</P>
<P>
 In Islamic Iran, where orthodox Muslims believe Mohammed to be the last 
prophet, Baha'is have been tortured and killed for their beliefs. Since the 
1979 Islamic revolution, more than 200 Baha'is have been executed and Baha'i 
scholars report that slayings occurred as recently as last year. An increasing 
number of Los Angeles Baha'is are Iranian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Baha'i encourage openness and investigation of other 
religions appealed to Lourdes Sanaei, 37. Sanaei spent 14 years in Catholic 
school and always wondered why, as a young girl, her church taught that sinners 
-- everyone, including even children who were not baptized -- would be doomed 
to eternal hell.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had all these questions and the priests would say 'Oh, don't ask that. Have 
faith,' " recalled the mother of three. "Then I started to read the Baha'i 
writings and the answers I'd looked for were there. This is a religion that is 
very clear and there are no dogmas. It's like there were veils before my eyes 
and they fell away." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelica Huerta remembers how her Catholic family became alienated from the 
church after the changes of Vatican II. Now 44, she spent her early 20s 
investigating other religions and even traveled to Jerusalem in search of 
answers. Then she discovered the Baha'i community in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were wonderful, warm people who had embraced all the messengers of God 
and that made a lot of sense to me," Huerta said. 
</P>
<P>
 One evening, she gathered her family and friends to announce her decision to 
convert. Family members thought she had been sucked into a fraud and found it 
hard to accept such a foreign-sounding religion, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were very upset, let me tell you," she said. "It was a scary situation." 
But within a year, her parents and five brothers and sisters had also 
converted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people understand that it's not some irrational cult and it is the 
fulfillment of religious promise, it's not difficult to accept," said James 
Nelson, once a junior minister in the Presbyterian Church who now chairs the 
National Spiritual Assembly. "What's difficult for most people is to let go of 
the emotional attachment to traditional religion." 
</P>
<P>
 Other key teachings of Baha'u'llah envision the elimination of economic 
injustice, a universal language and a world government to unite nations. 
Equality between men and women is also paramount. If a family can only afford 
to educate one child, it should send a girl to school, said Baha'u'llah, 
because mothers are the first teachers of the human race.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite idealistic principles, the faith does have contradictions. Mehdi 
Bozorgmehr, a UCLA sociologist, co-authored a study of Los Angeles Iranians in 
the 1980s and discovered that Iranian Baha'is mingled more among their own kind 
than their faith mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be careful how you write that," Bozorgmehr warned, the Baha'i "won't like 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Baha'i scripture stresses the equality and importance of women in 
the faith, but also prohibits them from serving in the highest Baha'i office, 
as members of the Universal House of Justice. Baha'i writings explain this by 
saying only that the reason for it will someday be clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perplexing," admitted James Nelson. "But there are lots of things in 
life that are perplexing that we don't have answers to. It frustrates other 
activities that are in progress to stop and worry about that one thing. . . . I 
don't understand it now, but I think I will." 
</P>
<P>
 Baha'is are not allowed to participate in partisan politics, criticize their 
governments or marry without the consent of their parents, if living. Divorce 
is allowed but discouraged. They are obligated to pray each day, consider their 
work as worship and fast for 19 designated days each March. They have no 
regular services, such as Catholic Sunday Mass, although members can attend 
"devotionals," or informal prayer meetings in most communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important Baha'i gathering is known as the area feast, held 
every 19 days at the end of each Baha'i month. (The Baha'i calendar is based on 
19 months of 19 days each. The number 19 is significant among Baha'is because 
in 19th Century Persia, the numerical Abjad system gave each letter a standard 
value, and the Arabic word for unity, Vahid, has a value of 19.) The Nineteen 
Day feast is a community gathering that combines prayer, administration and 
socializing. It is the only Baha'i activity that is closed to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The faith has no clergy and little ritual and is governed by a nine-member 
Local Spiritual Assembly elected by residents of that city. Campaigning and 
nominations for positions on the assembly are forbidden. Local members elect 
the National Spiritual Assembly, which in turn helps elect representatives to 
the Universal House of Justice, the nine-member international body based in 
Haifa, Israel, whose decisions on spiritual matters are considered to be 
infallible and guided by God. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiona Missaghian, a 22-year-old German-born USC master's student, remembers 
being harassed for her beliefs by other children in her hometown near Cologne, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a child, sometimes it was difficult because you're different," said 
Missaghian, who, in jeans and a backpack looked very much like every other 
student on campus. "I remember in sixth grade a kid called me 'Miss World 
Peace,' but eventually they all began to realize (unity is) something we have 
to achieve."  
</P>
<P>
 some of which have drawn more than 200 people.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: COMMUTER CHICKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG and MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of gas stations in Los Angeles sell food, but there may be only one 
where you can get some grub that actually tastes good -- the Arco at 11th and 
Blaine streets just west of the Harbor Freeway, where inside you'll find Mr. 
Sippee. 
</P>
<P>
 A gas station that serves respectable food? That's exactly what I thought 
after exiting the Olympic off-ramp to get some gas.I saw the sign boasting of 
the broasted chicken and potatoes. Yeah, sure. But I was hungry, and it was 
only $1.99 for a breast and wing and a mound of potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the freeway, I knew I had something unique. The chicken was flavorful 
and the potatoes were quite good. Combined with the easy on/off access ramp, I 
had found my fast food/gas pit stop.  
</P>
<P>
 (After several visits, my personal best time, starting with exiting the 
freeway, getting the chicken, and re-entering the fray, is 2 minutes and 6 
seconds.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Sippee is owned by Noel Anenberg, a former English teacher who bought a 
gas station in the early '80s and to diversify its convenience store, added a 
kitchen and takeout counter. The fresh Arkansas chickens and white rose 
potatoes are dredged in flour and seasoned with paprika, salt, pepper and 
garlic before they are broasted. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular order is the aforementioned $1.99 breast and wing, or thigh 
and drumstick. Mr. Sippee, (named when Anenberg's young son, who after learning 
about the Mississippi River, inquired about Mississippi's husband), also sells 
family packs -- 10 pieces ($7.59) and 16 pieces ($11.99).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Sippee is at 1045 Blaine St., Los Angeles. Open every day 9 to 2 a.m. 
Information: (213) 748-2121.

JUDGE BACKS STATE, SCHOOLS IN BATTLE OVER AMBASSADOR SITE; COURTS: RULING 
EXONERATES STATE. FOUR OF SIX CLAUSES IN LAWSUIT AGAINST THE DISTRICT ARE 
THROWN OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost one year after withdrawing plans to build a high school on the site of 
the closed-down Ambassador Hotel, the Los Angeles Unified School District 
recently scored a minor victory in its legal battle against Trump-Wilshire 
Associates, the developers who own the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which is partially managed by mega-developer Donald Trump, filed 
a $100-million lawsuit against the school district and the state of California 
on April 5, claiming irreparable financial damages stemming from the district's 
move to abandon the site after years of haggling with Trump-Wilshire over a 
purchase price.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 28 Superior Court ruling by Judge Barnet M. Cooperman excused the 
state as a defendant on all counts and threw out four clauses of the 
developers' six-clause complaint against the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tremendous day for the state, and a good day for the school 
district," said Ed Szczepkowski, an attorney representing the school district.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Bert Fields, who represents Trump-Wilshire, said the company plans to 
concentrate on the two remaining clauses, which charge that the developers were 
not justly compensated for the property and that the school district violated 
their civil rights by condemning the site through the power of eminent domain 
granted to state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very pleased to keep the civil rights claim in," Fields said. "Now 
we're just looking forward to the trial." 
</P>
<P>
 The basis of Trump-Wilshire's claim is that in keeping the property tied up in 
eminent domain proceedings for more than three years, the school district 
prevented them from building a mixed-use skyscraper on the site they purchased 
in 1989, a project that the developers contend would have proven lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The school district filed a condemnation claim for about $47.9 million for the 
rear 17 acres of the 24-acre property in May, 1990, after unsuccessfully trying 
to negotiate a voluntary sale. When Trump-Wilshire insisted on greater 
compensation, the land sat fallow as both parties awaited a court date.  
</P>
<P>
 After several attempts to negotiate a satisfactory price out of court, the 
school district officially withdrew its bid last November, citing economic 
reasons. Although the property is once again theirs to develop, Trump-Wilshire 
maintains that such an undertaking would no longer be financially feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 "By filing their condemnation claim, they destroyed the value of this land and 
made it impossible to go forward," Fields said. "Other tenants moved away, and 
there is nothing we can do with that land now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The school district, however, contends that Trump-Wilshire was bound to lose 
money from the beginning. Building a skyscraper in an area with declining real 
estate values and rising office vacancies would have resulted in a financial 
fiasco regardless of the school district's intervention, Szczepkowski said, so 
there is no merit to the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was also brought against the state on the ground that the school 
district acted as a state agency. Trump-Wilshire has the option to appeal the 
court's decision to excuse the state from the lawsuit, but attorneys would not 
comment on their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump-Wilshire was given 30 days from the Sept. 28 court date to rewrite and 
file the two amendable clauses, after which the school district will have 30 
days to challenge them. The next hearing is not expected until sometime in 
December, Szczepkowski said.

VOICES: LIBRARY'S TRUE WORTH KEPT UNDER COVER; UNDERFUNDED FACILITY, A CENTER 
OF OPPORTUNITY FOR RESIDENTS, COULD DO MUCH MORE FOR THE COMMUNITY, SENIOR 
LIBRARIAN SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR POND, Arthur Pond, 39, is the senior librarian of the Hyde Park 
branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. His dream is to make his branch, 
which now suffers from lack of funds, poor visibility and little community 
awareness, a valuable and relevant part of the community. He was interviewed by 
Nancy Slate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two major things that make a difference in the lives of young 
people. One is reading, the other is involvement with an adult. Not necessarily 
a parent, just someone who cares and tries to be helpful. The public library is 
probably the only place in town where kids can get both. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when I became senior librarian at Hyde Park Branch, we had the lowest 
circulation of any branch in the Los Angeles library system. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of temporary staff people were passing through, which resulted in people 
not getting involved and finding out what was needed to turn things around. 
Even worse, we are at the end of a long, narrow lot, with apartment buildings 
on two sides and a parking lot in front. So we're not highly visible to people 
driving down Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a lot of ambitions for this branch, and since I came here, some very 
good things have happened. I've gotten a wonderful children's librarian and two 
other permanent librarians, so we are now fully staffed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots, one business donated money to buy a computer and printer. 
This computer is absolutely beloved by the community. Kids play the games, and 
a lot of people are coming in and making resumes, which is the kind of relevant 
service we are seeking to offer the community. 
</P>
<P>
 We've had wonderful people come in and do story hours. Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke read to the kids. And Thyme Lewis, one of the stars of "Days 
of Our Lives," read to them and told them how helpful the library had been to 
him as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 I want Hyde Park Branch to be a contributing part of the community, so I did 
some research into people's needs, how we could best meet them, and how to 
raise awareness of the library.  
</P>
<P>
 My first thought was to find my target group. It dawned on me, "Hey! None of 
our books on starting a business are ever in. So the group that needs our help 
most must be job-seekers and entrepreneurs." So we have taken to spending a 
chunk of our budget on books geared to starting a business. And those are being 
very heavily used. We hope we will facilitate new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Our next move probably will be sending out a letter introducing ourselves and 
explaining our goals to the Hyde Park business community, and seeing what kind 
of support we can build that way. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a need to publicize the branch. Going through newspapers, radio 
and television hasn't been as reliable as we thought. So we'd like to hire a 
company that will drop a flyer on every doorstep in the area. It's not the 
cheapest way. We could use teen-age volunteers. But you don't send teen-agers 
out walking in south Los Angeles without worrying. 
</P>
<P>
 We also hope to provide folks with a reason to come to the library on a 
regular basis, in the hopes of creating a habit. Our entertainment-related 
programs have brought a bunch of people in. If we can find the funds, we'd like 
to have a program every week. Then, while people are here, we say, "Hi there. 
Why don't you let us help you with your homework" or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 The other thing I'd like is to gear programs toward people's needs. Right now 
I'm trying to find people who will come in and talk about interview skills, 
resume development, things that are germane to job-seeking. The people of our 
community could help out with this. A business person, for example, could come 
in and talk about how he started his business and pitfalls to watch out for. 
</P>
<P>
 I have great ambitions for this branch. To fulfill them, we need a high level 
of community awareness, and a lot more funding. It would be nice if we could 
find a corporate sponsor, because I suspect they would have contacts that would 
help us. Working with smaller businesses would be great too. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to have our Friends of the Library group solicit financial 
support and raise awareness. They can do this by speaking to groups such as 
churches, just saying, "Hello. We're your neighbor. If you come to the library, 
this is what we can do for you." 
</P>
<P>
 I would also like to have a larger building with a community room. We could 
then provide classes, meeting space for book groups and historical societies, 
and so many more groups. We're also working on money for a new sign, so people 
will know we're here.  
</P>
<P>
 Libraries are important to all of us. They improve our lives, keep kids in 
school and raise their educational level. They offer a place to come and learn 
and stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it -- it's virtually impossible to get in trouble with a book in 
your hand. You'd have to hit somebody with it. Ultimately, we play a valuable 
role in making a more productive, less violent society. And in the end, that 
benefits us all.

VOICES: THE TALK OF THE COMMUNITY; AT THE ETHNICALLY DIVERSE 105-YEAR-OLD 
ANGELICA LUTHERAN CHURCH, UP TO 5 LANGUAGES ARE USED IN SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In the city's center stands Angelica Lutheran Church, witness to a changing 
Los Angeles over the last 105 years since the congregation's founding. The 
red-brick church with stained-glass windows and pipe organ serves as a 
spiritual and community center in the ethnically diverse Pico Union district, 
where many newly arrived residents from Latin America struggle to adjust to a 
foreign land. Affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, the 
church at 1345 S. Burlington Ave., near West Pico Boulevard and West 14th 
Street, is located in one of the poorest neighborhoods of Southern California. 
For four years Carlos Paiva, 43, has been minister. He grew up in Lima, Peru, 
where he worked as a chemist before coming to Pasadena to study at Fuller 
Theological Seminary and Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary in Berkeley. His 
wife, Maria, serves as the church's secretary. He was interviewed by Berkley 
Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angelica Church was planted here to serve the community socially, spiritually 
and however else we can. 
</P>
<P>
 I preach in Spanish and minister in Spanish because this is the language of 
the majority at Angelica. When I first preached to the Spanish-speaking 
congregation, there were only 10 people, including myself. Now we have 250 
members, and 85% to 95% speak only Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 We have two Lutheran services, one in Spanish and one in English. We have a 
Korean Presbyterian group and a Kanjobal one that is Guatemalan and more like 
the Baptist denomination. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sundays at 9 is the Spanish service, at 10:30 is English, at 11:30 is 
Korean and at 1:30 is Kanjobal. Our Finnish congregation moved to Van Nuys in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelica is one of the oldest churches in Los Angeles. The church was founded 
by the Swedish community. Most of the pastors were Swedish. We still have one 
service a year, at Christmas, where there is a very traditional Swedish 
service, the Julotta service.  
</P>
<P>
 My first year here the sermon was in Swedish that day. But now it is hard to 
find a pastor who can speak Swedish. So half of the service is in Swedish, half 
in English now. 
</P>
<P>
 We want to speak the languages spoken in the community, to address the issues 
and help the people who live around the church. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Angelica's members are new to the Lutheran church. They are of Roman 
Catholic background. Sometimes they call me father, and I say, "You are right. 
I have three kids." 
</P>
<P>
 We have good relations with the Catholic churches over here. We are not in 
competition. We just want to share the Gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 Our building hosts different agencies trying to heal this community. Angelica 
is becoming like an oasis so everybody can come here and be building up their 
families. We have El Rescate here. Their purpose is to help the refugees from 
El Salvador and Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 We are providing an English as a Second Language course for adults. We are 
linked with the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 During the afternoon we provide entertainment. We provided free karate classes 
and free aerobics all summer. 
</P>
<P>
 One Korean girl offered the aerobics class to 65 ladies who speak only 
Spanish. She is a second-generation Korean and is bilingual but she didn't 
speak Spanish. She handled it very well. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer we provided an Angelica Safe Summer program. It was to help 
the kids on vacation. We provided drama classes, computer classes, basketball, 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 We are hosting a program that provides lunch for senior citizens for $1. They 
come at 9 in the morning and play bingo and at noon they eat and then go back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 We provide low-income housing for senior citizens. We have more than 40 
apartments that were built for our church about 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a food distribution program. For one year after the riots we helped to 
give away baskets of food twice a week. Now we do it on Wednesdays. We are 
helping 135 families. 
</P>
<P>
 Education is one of my priorities -- education in everything, not only for 
school but for life. Most of the people in the neighborhood need basic 
education in what it means to live in the United States, to be better citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 My dream is to have a computer lab that is connected with USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the mothers, families . . . around here earn money by taking care of 
babies for other families. My dream was that somebody would teach these ladies 
so they could be licensed for child care. UCLA's extension program offered 
help. So we now have 45 ladies who are meeting in the church every Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my dreams is for Angelica to become a library for the whole community. 
I'm discovering the kids in elementary school, their that parents don't have 
the ability to read to them (their children) in English. 
</P>
<P>
 So if we can get some volunteers who can read to them, that would be very 
nice.

CASTELLANOS' INTERCEPTION LIFTS FREMONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fremont Coach Taja Rodisha has been preaching senior leadership to his players 
all season, and that's exactly what Gus Castellanos gave him in a Friday 
afternoon game against Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior defensive back's interception with 1:51 in the fourth quarter 
sealed the Pathfinders' 12-7 Southeastern Conference win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been telling the seniors that we need someone to step up and provide 
leadership," Rodisha said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, that's what we got." 
</P>
<P>
 Castellanos also scored Fremont's first touchdown on an 11-yard reception from 
quarterback Robert Loera in the third quarter. Delante Walker's 25-yard 
touchdown run put Fremont ahead 12-0 at the start of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After quarterback Larry Roberson's four-yard touchdown run brought Jefferson 
within 12-7 at the 5:53 mark, Fremont turned the ball over on downs and the 
Democrats marched down the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberson's pass to Isaac Hatley was batted in the air and caught by 
Castellanos, who returned it to the Fremont 25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson's offense couldn't produce consistent drives against Fremont's 
defense, amassing only 74 yards in total offense to Fremont's 282. Hatley was 
held to 27 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Fremont 4-1; Jefferson 1-4 
</P>
<P>
 Next week: Fremont BYE; Jefferson at Locke.

GAME OF THE WEEK; DONS CAN'T GET THE TIME OF DAY FROM CRENSHAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorsey High enjoys nighttime football games even when stadium lights flicker 
and it's difficult to see. But the Dons have trouble playing during the early 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday afternoon, Crenshaw knocked the daylights out of Dorsey, 34-10, in a 
Southern Pacific Conference game at Crenshaw, and it was not a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (3-2) recovered five Dorsey fumbles and returned two for touchdowns 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "All high schools who play regularly at night complain about playing afternoon 
games," Dorsey Coach Paul Knox said. "It throws off your whole schedule. You 
lose your routine." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons' two losses have come during the afternoon. Three of their four 
losses last season were afternoon games. 
</P>
<P>
 Day or night, the Cougars simply were bigger, stronger and faster than Dorsey 
(3-2). Crenshaw scored its first touchdown on Farrel Payton's four-yard run 
following a Crenshaw fumble recovery. Quarterback Ricky Lumford completed three 
passes to Rashard Magee, including a 41-yard pass, to set up the score.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rashard said he could beat his man on certain plays so we decided to go to 
him," Crenshaw Coach Robert Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw lost three fumbles but capitalized on three Dorsey fumbles to score 
20 of 27 second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
 Payton rushed for 106 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week: Carson at Dorsey; Washington at Crenshaw.

SALESIAN AND CATHEDRAL GIVE PEACE A CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILL ETHERIDGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Salesian High School won the game, 3-0, but the real victory last Saturday 
afternoon at Roosevelt High was that Salesian and Cathedral High restricted 
their battles to the football field. 
</P>
<P>
 Said a thankful Salesian coach Jerry Scott afterward: "The game was decided on 
the field, not on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the game was decided in secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Fights on the field and in the stands and violent incidents related to games 
between the two all-boys Catholic schools had escalated so badly in recent 
years that the schools took a drastic step: They agreed to a self-imposed ban 
on fans and media attending all athletic events between the two schools. The 
site and date of last year's game (won by Cathedral 13-3 at Pius X High School) 
was kept a secret from fans and played in an empty stadium, with the coaches 
and players finding out the site only when they arrived by bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Several steps were taken to open the game back up to fans this year and to 
ensure a peaceful outcome.  
</P>
<P>
 Salesian alumnus Hector Alatorre recruited the services of 20 other Salesian 
grads for added security, Athletic Director Bob Mendoza collected host 
Salesian's student I.D. cards before the game, then waited 15 minutes after the 
game to return them, while Cathedral fans made their exit.  
</P>
<P>
 The estimated crowd of 1,000 was led in a prayer before the game. After, the 
teams met at midfield to shake hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathedral Athletic Director Lou Palapiano was pleased. "The game was 
wonderful, everything went well and there were no major problems."  
</P>
<P>
 Players and fans were treated to an intense, spirited contest, which wasn't 
decided until the fourth quarter on sophomore Albert Vasquez's 28-yard field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The field goal was set up by junior quarterback Arturo Gonzalez's scrambling 
70-yard run to the Cathedral 15-yard line.  
</P>
<P>
 The Phantoms gave up 130 yards on 11 penalties, one of which negated an 
apparent first-quarter touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 There are no plans yet to renew fan participation in other Salesian-Cathedral 
contests.

NOTEBOOK; EAGLES' DEFENSE LAYS AN IMPRESSIVE STRING OF GOOSE EGGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to statistics, tackles and sacks are as important as passing and 
rushing for the Verbum Dei High football team. The Eagle defense has not 
allowed a touchdown in three of its first four games. 
</P>
<P>
 The only time Verbum Dei's defense has cracked was in the first game of the 
season, when the Eagles made the long trip north to play at Santa Maria.  
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles gave up two first-half touchdowns, but thereafter the defense began 
to mesh. Verbum Dei twice kept Santa Maria out of the end zone on first and 
goal in the fourth quarter of an 18-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinging to an 18-14 lead, safety Justin Sewell ran down Santa Maria's Jeffrey 
Campbell at the one-yard line after a 72-yard gain. But Santa Maria could get 
no farther, and the Eagles took over on downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after Santa Maria drove to the Verbum Dei three-yard line in the game's 
closing minutes, the Eagles held again, giving up only a field goal.  
</P>
<P>
 There has been little drama since. Verbum Dei's defense has not given up a 
touchdown in 14 quarters.  
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles shut out Salesian, 22-0, in the second week of the season, allowing 
only 48 yards offense and recording 12 sacks, including three by tackle Keane 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, Verbum Dei held Belmont to 80 yards offense in a 9-2 
intersectional victory, with 12 tackles by linebacker Frank Harris and 11 each 
from Jason Steen and Shamsu-Din Shaheed.  
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei's special teams allowed Compton to score on an 81-yard kickoff 
return on Sept. 30, but the Eagles won, 16-6. Steen had 14 tackles, including 
four for a loss of yardage. Harris and Shaheed had 12 and 11 tackles 
respectively, and the Eagles gave up 31 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret to Verbum Dei's success? Coach Lalo Mendoza says there is none. 
</P>
<P>
 "We set out to try to make everything simple as possible," Mendoza said about 
the Eagles' zone defense. "We don't do anything confusing or different. We just 
try to line up the same way every down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Footnotes -- Roosevelt's 23-22 victory over Locke on Sept. 30 marked the 
Roughriders' first victory over the Saints since the schools were placed in the 
Southeastern Conference in 1988. Locke won the first five games. The teams 
played to a 20-20 tie last year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Showdowns -- The Cal State Los Angeles women's volleyball team will play host 
to Cal State Bakersfield on Tuesday night at 7:30 in a match between the 
nation's top two NCAA Division II teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Ferchaw had 18 kills to lead second-ranked Cal State L.A. (17-0) to a 
15-6, 12-15, 15-13, 15-13 victory over Cal State Dominguez Hills last Tuesday. 
The Golden Eagles' 17-game season-opening winning streak is the longest by any 
Cal State L.A. team in any sport. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens High defeated Cantwell Sacred-Heart, 15-4, in the third-place 
match of the Whittier tournament Oct. 1. Lisa Valenzuela, Georgina Juarez and 
Diane Cordoso were selected to the all-tournament team for the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Runaround -- Grace Padilla won the 35th annual Biola cross-country 
invitational Oct. 1. The former South Gate High runner covered the 5,000-meter 
course at La Mirada Park in 18 minutes, 9 seconds, to lead Asics Track West to 
the team title. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the saddle -- Akili Roberson of L.A. Southwest made the switch from 
playing quarterback to safety for the first three games of his freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the former Locke High standout was back at quarterback Saturday in the 
Cougars' Western State Conference game against Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Southwest's fourth-string quarterback got the promotion after passing for 
271 yards off the bench in a 41-20 loss against Santa Barbara on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberson, who also rushed for two touchdowns, entered the game with the 
Cougars trailing, 33-0, in the third quarter. He quickly led the Cougars on a 
68-yard drive, capping it with a four-yard touchdown run.
